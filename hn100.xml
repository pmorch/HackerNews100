<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>TL;DR:</p><p><em>We've been on the Cloudflare Business plan ($250/month) for years. They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly "purged" all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</em></p><p>I'm a SysOps engineer at a fairly large online casino. We have around 4 million monthly active users. We had been happy Cloudflare customers since 2018 on the "Business" plan which has some neat features and costs $250/month for "unlimited" traffic.</p><p>Now admittedly, $250 is probably fairly low for the amount of traffic we were pushing through Cloudflare. We mainly use CF for the CDN (caching all our static content) and DDOS protection, for which it works pretty well. It’s easy to use and you don’t usually have to think about it much.</p><p>I had read a few articles on Hacker News about how at some point Cloudflare contacts you, asking you aggressively to move to "Enterprise" with custom pricing. But I wasn't expecting it to go this horribly.</p><p>In April, we received this email from Cloudflare:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" width="897" height="407" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:407,&quot;width&quot;:897,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This sounds like there's some issue with our website.

We do have multiple domains that </span><em>mostly</em><span> act as mirrors to our main domain. We have these for a few reasons. One is that since we are a casino, we have different regulatory requirements we need to comply with in many countries. For example, many games are only available in some countries. Some countries we block completely. Then we have a few different domains that remove certain game groups or site features - for example our social features (chat, user tipping / interaction) or our sportsbook. Another is that we use them to target different global user groups and affiliates and track conversions long-term. This also means that if a country DNS-blocks our main domain, a secondary domain may still be available. This could arguably be seen as a violation of the Cloudflare TOS, as they wrote above.</span></p><p><span>In any case, </span><strong>we receive &gt;95% of our traffic through the main domain</strong><span> that’s been unchanged since our founding, and were happy to resolve this issue in whatever way, including by removing any affected secondary domains from Cloudflare.</span></p><p>We sent them info about our domains and tried to get more information from them about the issue and who from our team we should get involved, but they refused to give us anything apart from a date for a call.</p><p><span>So we scheduled another call, now with their "Trust and Safety" team. But it turns out, </span><strong>we were actually talking to Sales again</strong><span>.</span></p><p>They said they could offer us an amazing contract for $10k per month with all kinds of great features. We tried figuring out how exactly this was related to the TOS problem and how to resolve the situation. We asked them which domains were affected by their “rotation” concerns. They didn't give us an answer. We asked which of the Enterprise features we actually had to get.</p><p><span>They would not offer us anything apart from a full deal </span><strong>for $10k per month</strong><span>, which would magically resolve the issue. They were not interested in any other resolution.</span></p><p><span>They said we had 24h to sign their contract because they had to “get back to Trust &amp; Safety". We asked to pay monthly. They said we </span><em>need</em><span> to sign a yearly commitment and pay the full year up front. It felt like extortion. Pay us $120k until tomorrow or we destroy your business.</span></p><p>After the call, they sent us this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" width="1280" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:153184,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note the email implies a monthly payment might be possible.

That way the rules will work for other caching proxies.</p></li><li><p>Don't use any proprietary Cloudflare products like Zero Access or Workers.

If you have some a bit more vulnerable attack surfaces (for example, an uncached unauthenticated API request that eats up 100ms of CPU time, and can thus use up your cores with just 10-100 requests per second), Cloudflare is not even going to detect it. Especially since all semi-professional “DDOS attack as a service” groups seem specifically specialized for Cloudflare-backed services, including “Under Attack Mode” workarounds etc.</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>In this article I show you how to turn your iPhone into a dumb phone, using a handful of simple apps and settings.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to purchase a new device just to simplify your screen time! You can use your existing iPhone to enjoy many of the same benefits.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>

<p>So, you want to reduce your screentime, maybe embrace some digital minimalism, but you don’t want to go full-on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dumbphones">dumbphone</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, like most people, you need a smartphone to fully engage with society (like with QR menus, the bane of the dumbphone life!).</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can tweak your current iPhone to dumb it down and transform it from a dopamine-driven-slot-machine, into something a bit more tepid. It’s a great way to temper your screen time without requiring a new (dumb)phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero2.png" alt="An iPhone turned into a dumb phone with a few apps and settings"> <em>Follow along with this article to dumb-down your iPhone.</em></p>

<p>This article will show you how to dumb down your iPhone, with tweaks like <a href="#minimal-homescreen-launcher">using a minimal homescreen launcher</a>, <a href="#plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">choosing a plain wallpaper that hides your dock</a>, <a href="#grayscale-only-display">enabling grayscale mode</a> and <a href="#disable-notifications">disabling notifications</a>. And of course, the final boss — <a href="#bonus-delete-your-apps">deleting your apps</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The tweaks here might make your phone less appealing, but you’ll still have access to social media, emails, the internet, etc. Dumbing down your iPhone is a great way to dip your toes into a more digitally minimal lifestyle, but it’s not a replacement for a more limited device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you’re excited to get started! Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-homescreen-launcher">minimal homescreen launcher</h2>

<p>The first thing I recommend is a minimal homescreen launcher — it’s a full-screen widget you place on your homescreen which displays a plain list of selected apps (which you can customize).</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dumbify/id6480082872">Dumbify</a> launcher and it works pretty well. There are a couple of similar launchers, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blank-spaces-app/id1570856853">Blank Spaces</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/on-point-minimal-home-screen/id6476465213">on point</a>, but both have freemium models with expensive ‘premium’ upgrades. Dumbify costs $4.99 USD upfront, but has no in-app purchases; it’s what I use and it’s great.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/homescreen.png" alt="A minimal homescreen for my dumbed-down iPhone"> <em>The homescreen on my dumbed-down iPhone, using Dumbify.</em></p>

<p>These homescreen launchers all behave the same — they show a plain list of app names, rather than colorful app icons, which are (hopefully!) less engaging and less likely to distract you.</p>

<p>The freemium apps can be a good way to play around and see if this is something you want to commit to, if you’re uncertain. Just be warned that they’re much more expensive to purchase vs. buying Dumbify once their trials run out.</p>

<h2 id="plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">plain wallpapers (that hide your dock)</h2>

<p>A simple, plain wallpaper is another way to simplify your phone. This was a tough one for me! I love displaying pretty photos on my lockscreen, but I decided to go all-in on dumbing down my iPhone.</p>

<p>Dumbify includes two wallpapers you can use which match the colors of the iOS dock, and I’ve included them below. By matching with the dock, you can remove all your apps from your dock for an extremely spartan homescreen (like in my screenshot above).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Dark</th>
      <th>Light</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/dark_bg.png" alt="dark background for iPhone dumb phone"></td>
      <td><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/light_bg.png" alt="light background for iPhone dumb phone"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Just tap and hold these photos to save them, crop them to fit your phone screen, and set one as your wallpaper.</p>

<p>You should also make sure to disable automatic light/dark mode, since that adjusts the color of the dock. You can do that via <code>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Appearance/Automatic</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip: for a completely bare homescreen, you can also turn off the little “Search” badge on your homescreen under <code>Settings &gt; Home Screen &amp; App Library &gt; Search/Show On Home Screen</code></p>

  <p>Note: I’ve also written about <a href="https://dumbph.com/iphone-different-wallpapers-light-dark-mode">using different iPhone wallpapers for light and dark mode</a>, which is the finishing-touch on a great minimal homescreen setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="grayscale-only-display">grayscale-only display</h2>

<p>The first two suggestions in this article were neat, but not <em>that</em> drastic. This one is!</p>

<p>Using an Accessibility setting, you can completely gray-out your iPhone’s screen, which I’ve found has made a noticeable difference to how engaging it is. Doomscrolling on Instagram or TikTok is much less appealing without all the flashy colors!</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero1.png" alt="my dumbed-down iPhone with a grayscale screen filter"> <em>My iPhone with the grayscale filter enabled.</em></p>

<p>Under <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessability Shortcuts</code>, you can enable the <code>Color Filters</code> option. By default, this will let you enable grayscale mode by triple-clicking your iPhone’s power button. It also has the handy benefit of letting you switch back to color mode with another triple-click.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to set this directly (maybe you use the shortcut already), you can do that in <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Color Filters &gt; Grayscale</code>.</p>

<h2 id="disable-notifications">disable notifications</h2>

<p>I left this one until (nearly) last since I think it’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Disabling (most) of my notifications was one of the best things I ever did — it’s astounding how many nuisance notifications come through on a given day. Social media pings, random promotions, spam emails — constant interruptions for irrelevant things. Disabling them was cathartic and a huge relief (not surprising, since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/history-of-notifications/#:~:text=More%20notably%2C%20Rosen%E2%80%99s%20research%20has%20consistently%20shown%20that%20notifications%20stress%20us%20out">notifications stress us out</a>).</p>

<p>I do allow a handful of notifications through — phone calls and text messages, as well as my banking apps. Everything else though? 🙅‍♂️</p>

<p>Apple fortunately makes it straightforward to manage your notifications via <code>Settings &gt; Notifications</code> — you can customize your notification preferences per-app, and if you’re on iOS 15 or later, you can also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/108781#:~:text=your%20notifications%20appear.-,Schedule%20a%20notification%20summary,-With%20iOS%2015">schedule a notification summary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-delete-your-apps">bonus: delete your apps</h2>

<p>The bonus tip, the elephant in the room - your apps. <strong>You can make all the tweaks to your iPhone that you like, adjust this-and-that, but if you keep your addictive apps around, what’s the point?</strong></p>

<p>Different people find different apps addictive — social media is, of course, a huge one, but the internet (ie: your browser app) can be just as addictive, as can YouTube, Slack and more. Sometimes even <a href="https://strava.com/">Strava</a> sucks me in!</p>

<p>Whatever apps you’re addicted to, just seeing their icons on your iPhone (or being able to search for them) can act as a <a href="https://www.weber.edu/academicpeercoaching/blog/forming-habits.html#:~:text=habits%20are%20created%20by%20putting%20together%20a%20cue%2C%20a%20routine%2C%20and%20a%20reward%2C%20and%20then%20cultivating%20a%20craving%20that%20drives%20the%20loop">cue, triggering a little dopamine-driven feedback loop</a> in your brain which sends you spiralling into another doomscrolling session. As effective as little tweaks can be, sometimes the best intervention to break a bad habit is going straight for the cue (the app, in this case).</p>

<p>There’s a handful of popular techniques you can try out — from going cold-turkey and just deleting all your addictive apps, to trying out social-media-free weekends, to using the native <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphb0c7313c9/ios">iOS screen-time feature</a> or more advanced apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opal-screen-time-for-focus/id1497465230">Opal</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jomo-screen-time-blocker/id1609960918">Jomo</a> to regulate your usage of them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’ve read this far, all the way to the end, then thank you.</p>

<p><strong>I have a challenge for you:</strong> Implement at least one of the things I’ve covered in this article. Even just doing a little “notification audit”, where you go through your notification settings and disable them for unnecessary apps, can help you reduce interruptions. Likewise, social-media-free weekends can be a great way to cut back on addictive apps without having to completely give them up.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to note though — dumbing down your iPhone is a <em>far cry</em> from a panacea for smartphone addiction. You can turn your iPhone into a ‘dumphone’ all you like, but unless you also delete some apps, you’ll still have access to all your vices — social media, games and more (even if they’re now grayscale). Even if you’re brutal and uninstall everything, you still have the app store and browser beckoning.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that these tweaks aren’t beneficial — I think they are; I think they’re a great set of tweaks to nudge you away from overuse and mindless scrolling — but don’t expect an overnight transformation. For that, you might need to take more drastic measures.</p>

I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'."</p><p>Facewatch later wrote to Sara and acknowledged it had made an error. </p><p>Facewatch is used in numerous stores in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters.</p><p>The company declined to comment on Sara's case to the BBC, but did say its technology helped to prevent crime and protect frontline workers. Home Bargains, too, declined to comment.</p><p>It's not just retailers who are turning to the technology. </p><p>On a humid day in Bethnal Green, in east London, we joined the police as they positioned a modified white van on the high street. </p><p>Cameras attached to its roof captured thousands of images of people's faces. </p><p>If they matched people on a police watchlist, officers would speak to them and potentially arrest them. </p><p>Unflattering references to the technology liken the process to a supermarket checkout - where your face becomes a bar code. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On the day we were filming, the Metropolitan Police said they made six arrests with the assistance of the tech. </p><p>That included two people who breached the terms of their sexual-harm prevention orders, a man wanted for grievous bodily harm and a person wanted for the assault of a police officer. </p><p>Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence for the Met, told the BBC the tech's speed was extremely helpful.</p><p>"It takes less than a second for the technology to create a biometric image of a person's face, assess it against the bespoke watchlist and automatically delete it when there is no match."</p><p>The BBC spoke to several people approached by the police who confirmed that they had been correctly identified by the system - 192 arrests have been made so far this year as a result of it.</p><p>But civil liberty groups are worried that its accuracy is yet to be fully established, and point to cases such as Shaun Thompson's.</p><p>Mr Thompson, who works for youth-advocacy group Streetfathers, didn't think much of it when he walked by a white van near London Bridge in February. </p><p>Within a few seconds, though, he was approached by police and told he was a wanted man. </p><p>"That's when I got a nudge on the shoulder, saying at that time I'm wanted".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He was asked to give fingerprints and held for 20 minutes. He says he was let go only after handing over a copy of his passport. </p><p>But it was a case of mistaken identity. </p><p>"It felt intrusive… I was treated guilty until proven innocent," he says. </p><p>The BBC understands the mistake might have been due to a family resemblance. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, has filmed the police on numerous facial-recognition deployments. She was there the night Shaun Thompson was picked up by police. </p><p>"My experience, observing live facial recognition for many years, [is that] most members of the public don't really know what live facial recognition is," she says.</p><p>She says that anyone's face who is scanned is effectively part of a digital police line-up. </p><p>"If they trigger a match alert, then the police will come in, possibly detain them and question them and ask them to prove their innocence."</p><p>The use of facial recognition by the police is ramping up.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022 the Metropolitan Police used live facial recognition nine times. The following year the figure was 23.</p><p>Already in 2024 it has been used 67 times, so the direction of travel is clear. </p><p>Champions say that misidentifications are rare. </p><p>The Metropolitan Police say that around one in every 33,000 people who walk by its cameras is misidentified. </p><p>But the error count is much higher once an someone is actually flagged. One in 40 alerts so far this year has been a false positive. </p><p>Michael Birtwhistle, head of research at the Ada Lovelace Institute research group, believes the technology is so new that the laws have not yet caught up. </p><p>"I think it absolutely is a Wild West at the moment. That's what creates this legal uncertainty as to whether current uses are unlawful or not," he says. </p><p>In Bethnal Green, although some people the BBC spoke to were worried about the use of the tech, a majority were supportive - if it helped to tackle crime. </p><p>That leads to another question about the technology: will it help in the long run? </p><p>As people get more used to seeing white vans parked on busy high streets, will people who know they are wanted by police simply get wise to the cameras and avoid them? Will shoplifters hide their faces? </p><p>Ms Carlo says society needs to guard against facial recognition becoming normalised.</p><p>"Once the police can say this is OK, this is something that we can do routinely, why not put it into the fixed-camera networks?"</p><p>This is the dystopian future that civil-liberty campaigners are most afraid of - a China-style mass-surveillance state. </p><p>Advocates dismiss such dire predictions as overblown.</p><p>And it is also clear there are plenty among the public who are willing to put up with having their faces scanned - if it means safer streets. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In 2022, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a>, waging a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except nuclear) daily. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies me about incoming threats.</p>
<p>We hear the siren a few times a day. Life would completely stop if we went to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So, people adapt.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When the siren goes off, practically everyone starts checking their phones: "What is going on?"</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://alerts.in.ua/">various applications</a> and <a href="https://t.me/s/war_monitor">Telegram channels</a> for monitoring the type of danger, missile paths, and understanding whether we are in direct danger or can continue with our lives for another minute.</p>
<p>This is what war in the 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from your phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in real life. 😅</p>
<p>There are different kinds of air alarms with varying levels of danger:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MiG-31K take off</strong> – This can happen multiple times during the day. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31">MiG-31K</a> can carry a very dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-47M2_Kinzhal">Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile</a>. Although it happens rarely, you can't predict when the missile is attached and when it is not, so most people tolerate this level of danger.</li>
<li><strong>Suicide drones attack</strong> – Usually carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136">Iranian Shahed 136 drones</a>. Most of them get shot down, but they are still dangerous and scary. We call them "mopeds" or "lawn-mowers" because of the sound of their engine.</li>
<li><strong>Ballistic missile attack</strong> – This can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander">9K720 Iskander</a>, are extremely fast (2 km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually, the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom).</li>
<li><strong>Cruise missile attack</strong> – Cruise missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)">Kalibr</a>, are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach any point in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the most dangerous type of attack is a combined one. This means all of the above are raining down on Ukrainian cities simultaneously. These usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning. The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-air-alerts">Monitoring Air Alerts<a href="#monitoring-air-alerts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Home Assistant has a built-in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ukraine_alarm/">Ukraine Alarm</a> integration. It monitors the nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA.</p>
<p>When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers.</p>
<p>Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets, roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-monitoring-channels">Scraping Monitoring Channels<a href="#scraping-monitoring-channels" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, and the type of attack.</p>
<p>So often I found myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. <em>I know it sounds crazy, and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example. If you are in Ukraine, GO TO THE SHELTER!</em></p>
<p>I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels myself, I delegate this task to HA.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape">HA Multiscrape</a> custom integration for that. You may ask, "why do you need a custom component when <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape/">HA has a built-in scraping component</a>?" Yes, it does, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape, and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-imminent-danger">Monitoring Imminent Danger<a href="#monitoring-imminent-danger" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95">Tu-95 bombers</a>.</p>
<p>They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it takes about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case, it's the bathroom), gather documents, and sleep for a few hours before the "show" begins.</p>

<img alt="Tu-95 takes off notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/eb24f547-8ef6-47b4-a60c-97995dfaf02c">
<figcaption>Notification about Tu-95 bombers taking off</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Usually, it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, and checks if the latest message contains a specific set of words, like <em>"take off" <strong>and</strong> "plane" <strong>and</strong> "tu-95"</em>. It also stores the latest message as an attribute.</p>

<h2 id="direct-danger-alert">Direct Danger Alert<a href="#direct-danger-alert" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies me right when there's a direct threat to my location.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Direct danger notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/05f1821c-89f5-474e-bf95-fffb3ea459d8">
<figcaption>Notification about direct danger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an attack happens at night, you need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway?</li>
<li>Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to get some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in these conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to get proper sleep to be able to work.</li>
<li>The air defenses are titans; they do their job excellently. Flying threats are getting shot down regularly.</li>
<li>In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (this estimate is completely unscientific!).</li>
<li>If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit – you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that.</li>
<li>If the missile/drone gets shot down nearby, the shockwave will blow your windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time, I decide to sleep in bed. When things get hot, I hide in a bathroom so that when something blows up nearby, <a href="https://visitukraine.today/blog/990/list-of-things-to-put-in-an-emergency-suitcase-and-basic-rules-that-will-save-lives-during-missile-strikes">I will be behind two walls</a> from glass shards and shockwaves.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like <em>"Kyiv"</em> or a neighborhood name, for <em>"warning" <strong>or</strong> "be in a safe place" <strong>or</strong> "fast target"</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maia-main" role="main">
      <h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity.</p>
<p>C.A.R. Hoare, Turing Award lecture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Software systems are inherently dynamic and unstable.<sup><a id="id-BWDujIehq-marker" href="#id-BWDujIehq">38</a></sup> A software system can only be perfectly stable if it exists in a vacuum. If we stop changing the codebase, we stop introducing bugs. If the underlying hardware or libraries never change, neither of these components will introduce bugs. If we freeze the current user base, we’ll never have to scale the system. In fact, a good summary of the SRE approach to managing systems is: "At the end of the day, our job is to keep agility and stability in balance in the system."<sup><a id="id-MJbuJtOhb-marker" href="#id-MJbuJtOhb">39</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="system-stability-versus-agility">System Stability Versus Agility</h2>

<p>It sometimes makes sense to sacrifice stability for the sake of agility. I’ve often approached an unfamiliar problem domain by conducting what I call exploratory coding—setting an explicit shelf life for whatever code I write with the understanding that I’ll need to try and fail once in order to really understand the task I need to accomplish. Code that comes with an expiration date can be much more liberal with test coverage and release management because it will never be shipped to production or be seen by users.</p>

<p>For the majority of production software systems, we want a balanced mix of stability and agility. SREs work to create procedures, practices, and tools that render software more reliable. At the same time, SREs ensure that this work has as little impact on developer agility as possible. In fact, SRE’s experience has found that reliable processes tend to actually increase developer agility: rapid, reliable production rollouts make changes in production easier to see. As a result, once a bug surfaces, it takes less time to find and fix that bug. Building reliability into development allows developers to focus their attention on what we really do care about—the functionality and performance of their software and systems.</p>

<h2 id="the-virtue-of-boring">The Virtue of Boring</h2>

<p>Unlike just about everything else in life, "boring" is actually a positive attribute when it comes to software! We don’t want our programs to be spontaneous and interesting; we want them to stick to the script and predictably accomplish their business goals. In the words of Google engineer Robert Muth, "Unlike a detective story, the lack of excitement, suspense, and puzzles is actually a desirable property of source code." Surprises in production are the nemeses of SRE.</p>

<p>As Fred Brooks suggests in his "No Silver Bullet" essay <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Bro95">[Bro95]</a>, it is very important to consider the difference between essential complexity and accidental complexity. Essential complexity is the complexity inherent in a given situation that cannot be removed from a problem definition, whereas accidental complexity is more fluid and can be resolved with engineering effort. For example, writing a web server entails dealing with the essential complexity of serving web pages quickly. However, if we write a web server in Java, we may introduce accidental complexity when trying to minimize the performance impact of garbage collection.</p>

<p>With an eye towards minimizing accidental complexity, SRE teams should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push back when accidental complexity is introduced into the systems for which they are responsible</li>
<li>Constantly strive to eliminate complexity in systems they onboard and for which they assume operational responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i-won-t-give-up-my-code">I Won’t Give Up My Code!</h2>

<p>Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations, confrontations over large-scale purges of the source tree are not uncommon. Some might protest, "What if we need that code later?" "Why don’t we just comment the code out so we can easily add it again later?" or "Why don’t we gate the code with a flag instead of deleting it?" These are all terrible suggestions. Source control systems make it easy to reverse changes, whereas hundreds of lines of commented code create distractions and confusion (especially as the source files continue to evolve), and code that is never executed, gated by a flag that is always disabled, is a metaphorical time bomb waiting to explode, as painfully experienced by Knight Capital, for example (see "Order In the Matter of Knight Capital Americas LLC" <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Sec13">[Sec13]</a>).</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding extreme, when you consider a web service that’s expected to be available 24/7, to some extent, every new line of code written is a liability. SRE promotes practices that make it more likely that all code has an essential purpose, such as scrutinizing code to make sure that it actually drives business goals, routinely removing dead code, and building bloat detection into all levels of testing.</p>

<h2 id="the-negative-lines-of-code-metric">The "Negative Lines of Code" Metric</h2>

<p>The term "software bloat" was coined to describe the tendency of software to become slower and bigger over time as a result of a constant stream of additional features. While bloated software seems intuitively undesirable, its negative aspects become even more clear when considered from the SRE perspective: every line of code changed or added to a project creates the potential for introducing new defects and bugs. A smaller project is easier to understand, easier to test, and frequently has fewer defects. Bearing this perspective in mind, we should perhaps entertain reservations when we have the urge to add new features to a project. Some of the most satisfying coding I’ve ever done was deleting thousands of lines of code at a time when it was no longer useful.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-apis">Minimal APIs</h2>

<p>French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery wrote, "perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away" <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Sai39">[Sai39]</a>. This principle is also applicable to the design and construction of software. APIs are a particularly clear expression of why this rule should be followed.</p>

<p>Writing clear, minimal APIs is an essential aspect of managing simplicity in a software system. The fewer methods and arguments we provide to consumers of the API, the easier that API will be to understand, and the more effort we can devote to making those methods as good as they can possibly be. Again, a recurring theme appears: the conscious decision to not take on certain problems allows us to focus on our core problem and make the solutions we explicitly set out to create substantially better. In software, less is more! A small, simple API is usually also a hallmark of a well-understood problem.</p>

<h2 id="modularity">Modularity</h2>

<p>Expanding outward from APIs and single binaries, many of the rules of thumb that apply to object-oriented programming also apply to the design of distributed systems. The ability to make changes to parts of the system in isolation is essential to creating a supportable system. Specifically, loose coupling between binaries, or between binaries and configuration, is a simplicity pattern that simultaneously promotes developer agility and system stability. If a bug is discovered in one program that is a component of a larger system, that bug can be fixed and pushed to production independent of the rest of the system.</p>

<p>While the modularity that APIs offer may seem straightforward, it is not so apparent that the notion of modularity also extends to how changes to APIs are introduced. Just a single change to an API can force developers to rebuild their entire system and run the risk of introducing new bugs. Versioning APIs allows developers to continue to use the version that their system depends upon while they upgrade to a newer version in a safe and considered way. The release cadence can vary throughout a system, instead of requiring a full production push of the entire system every time a feature is added or improved.</p>

<p>As a system grows more complex, the separation of responsibility between APIs and between binaries becomes increasingly important. This is a direct analogy to object-oriented class design: just as it is understood that it is poor practice to write a "grab bag" class that contains unrelated functions, it is also poor practice to create and put into production a "util" or "misc" binary. A well-designed distributed system consists of collaborators, each of which has a clear and well-scoped purpose.</p>

<p>The concept of modularity also applies to data formats. One of the central strengths and design goals of Google’s protocol buffers<sup><a id="id-0vYuXSLhXCk-marker" href="#id-0vYuXSLhXCk">40</a></sup> was to create a wire format that was backward and forward compatible.</p>

<h2 id="release-simplicity">Release Simplicity</h2>

<p>Simple releases are generally better than complicated releases. It is much easier to measure and understand the impact of a single change rather than a batch of changes released simultaneously. If we release 100 unrelated changes to a system at the same time and performance gets worse, understanding which changes impacted performance, and how they did so, will take considerable effort or additional instrumentation. If the release is performed in smaller batches, we can move faster with more confidence because each code change can be understood in isolation in the larger system. This approach to releases can be compared to gradient descent in machine learning, in which we find an optimum solution by taking small steps at a time, and considering if each change results in an improvement or degradation.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-conclusion">A Simple Conclusion</h2>

<p>This chapter has repeated one theme over and over: software simplicity is a prerequisite to reliability. We are not being lazy when we consider how we might simplify each step of a given task. Instead, we are clarifying what it is we actually want to accomplish and how we might most easily do so. Every time we say "no" to a feature, we are not restricting innovation; we are keeping the environment uncluttered of distractions so that focus remains squarely on innovation, and real engineering can proceed.</p>

<p>Aeromine, launched in 2022, makes compact 50 kW or larger “wind harvesting platforms” that it mounts on the edge of a building’s roof. The rooftop wind units, which have no external moving parts or blades, capture wind flowing up and over the building and convert it into onsite electricity. Its generator system is a rotor-stator system with a highly efficient 5 kW permanent magnet generator. (<a href="https://26011849.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26011849/Aeromine%20Website/downloads/Aeromine%20cut%20sheet%20231004.pdf">Specs are here</a>.) </p>



<p>The noiseless technology leverages aerodynamics like airfoils on a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow to generate energy. Aeromine says its systems typically consist of 20-40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction.</p>



<p>Each 1,000-pound unit can withstand winds of between 120 and 158 mph depending on specification.</p>



<p>Aeromine’s units can operate independently or be integrated with existing rooftop solar arrays. Onsite power generation eliminates grid supply disruptions.</p>



<p>Maynard Holt, founder &amp; CEO of Veriten, said: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe that distributed power innovation will play a vital role in helping companies fulfill their need for reliable, reasonably priced electricity and desire for low-impact power. We’re excited to partner with Aeromine, as its ability to quickly and affordably help a wide variety of companies meet their energy needs with wind resources is unique among distributed energy solutions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The bladeless wind turbines are designed to power apartment buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, offices, hospitals, retail centers – basically any big box building with a flat, unobstructed roof. </p>




	<p>The company says it has 400 qualified projects in its pipeline and expects to roll out commercially in Europe and North America in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a cavern almost a mile underground in the Black Hills, an experiment called the <small>MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR</small>, 40 kilograms of pure germanium crystals enclosed in deep-freeze cryostat modules, will soon set out to answer one of the most persistent and momentous questions in physics: are neutrinos their own antiparticles? If the answer is yes, it will require rewriting the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, our basic understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p>“The best way to learn whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles would be to observe a certain kind of radioactive decay, called neutrinoless double-beta decay. It has never been detected conclusively, and if it occurs at all, it’s exceedingly rare,” says Alan Poon of the Nuclear Science Division at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).</p>
<p>Poon is the current executive-committee chair of the <small>MAJORANA</small> Collaboration, which is comprised of more than 100 researchers from 19 institutions in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan, and whose efforts are focused on the experiment now under construction at the Davis Campus of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beta decay, single and double</em></strong></p>
<p>Ordinary beta decay is a common kind of radioactivity: an atomic nucleus changes into a different kind of element, a neighbor on the periodic table with lower mass, by emitting a beta particle – an electron or positron – plus a neutrino or an antineutrino. For example, carbon-14 transforms to nitrogen-14 when one of its neutrons turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. It was beta decay that led to the proposal that there must be a particle like the neutrino, since an electron alone could not account for all the energy lost in the decay.</p>
<div id="attachment_22270"><p><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/single-and-double-beta-decays.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22270" title="single-and-double-beta-decays" src="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/single-and-double-beta-decays.jpg" alt="Carbon 14 decays to nitrogen 14 by emitting an electron and an antineutrino, while changing one of its neutrons to a proton and transforming the nucleus one place higher in the periodic table – a common kind of single beta decay.

(Click on image for best resolution.) </p></div>
<p>“Double-beta decay is also possible and has been observed in a dozen different isotopes since 1986,” says Poon. “But it happens at a <em>really</em> low rate, and not too many nuclei can do it.”</p>
<p>The only conclusive double-beta decays seen so far involve two neutrons that change into two protons while emitting two electrons and two antineutrinos. It’s an uncommon situation, in which single beta decay is blocked because the decaying isotope’s immediate neighbor has a nucleus that’s too heavy, but the nucleus of the neighbor two places away on the periodic table does have lower mass – even though its atomic number is two places higher. Getting there requires double-beta decay.</p>
<p>One of the relatively few nuclei that can transform by double-beta decay is germanium-76 (<sup>76</sup>Ge), an isotope that accounts for less than eight percent of naturally occurring germanium. Germanium-76 can’t change to its neighbor, arsenic-76, but it can change to selenium-76, two places higher on the periodic table.</p>
<p>Many reference works refer to germanium-76 as stable, but double-beta decays of <sup>76</sup>Ge have been observed since the 1990s, and its half-life has recently been estimated at 1.3 x 10<sup>21 </sup>years, or roughly one and a third sextillion years. That’s 100 trillion times the age of the universe. Not <em>quite </em>stable.</p>
<p>How do you detect such a rare event? If you watch a single germanium-76 atom for one and a third sextillion<sup> </sup>years, the chances are 50-50 you’ll see it decay. On the other hand, if you watch one and a third sextillion germanium-76 atoms for just one year, the chances are 50-50 that you’ll catch at least <em>one</em> of them decaying.</p>
<p>In essence, that’s what <small>MAJORANA</small> proposes to do. The full <small>MAJORANA</small> concept calls for a metric ton or so of germanium diode detectors, enriched to 86 percent <sup>76</sup>Ge. Over the course of a year, a detector that size has a good chance of catching double-beta decays, although most will be accompanied by a pair of antineutrinos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Searching for an absence of neutrinos</em></strong></p>
<p>Identifying neutrinoless double-beta decays depends crucially on getting rid of background from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity in the surroundings. That’s the purpose of the <small>MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR</small>: to show that achieving a low enough background is indeed possible. A mile of rock overhead is an effective shield against most cosmic ray debris, but radioactivity from the environment, including from impurities in the experiment’s own components, is harder to avoid.</p>

<p>Jason Detwiler of the Nuclear Science Division, who has been involved with the <small>MAJORANA</small> project since 2005, says, “We’re spending a lot of time modeling every one of the <small>DEMONSTRATOR</small>’s thousands of individual parts, to make sure we can achieve the lowest backgrounds of any experiment of this kind ever – a hundred times lower.”</p>
<p>The <small>MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR</small> will be shielded with multiple layers of copper and lead against radioactive elements in the surrounding rock, and the detector will be built from ultrapure materials. Copper components are being formed underground in special facilities at SURF, to remove natural radioactivity and prevent contamination from cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Equally important is the detector’s ability to distinguish the background from double-beta decays inside the detector itself. Pure germanium is ideal for this purpose, both as a source of double-beta decays and, says Detwiler, as a detector that “can register the signal of nuclear decays cleanly, beautifully, and in high resolution.”</p>
<p>Nuclear decays and other events create charge carriers that drift toward the collecting electrode on the surface of the germanium diode. The way the carriers drift – their “pulse shape” – will clearly distinguish background events from a neutrinoless double-beta decay.</p>
<div><p><strong><em>Why Majorana</em></strong></p>
<p>So far the only known particles that are their own antiparticles are all bosons, particles that often carry force or mediate interactions, such as the photon, the pi-zero, or the Z. Ettore Majorana, a brilliant Italian theoretician who had a brief career in the 1920s and 30s but vanished mysteriously at the age of 32, was the first to propose that some fermions, particles of matter, might also be their own antiparticles.</p>
<p>That these hypothetical particles are today known as Majorana fermions is due to Enrico Fermi. Majorana considered his work “banal” and was famously blasé about promoting it. Earlier Fermi had urged him to write up his ideas about a neutral particle with the mass of the proton, but he didn’t bother, and the credit (and a Nobel Prize) went to James Chadwick for the discovery of the neutron. When it came to Majorana’s theory that fermions could be their own antiparticles, Enrico Fermi took no chances: he wrote the paper himself and signed Majorana’s name to it.</p>
<p>Majorana suffered increasing depression and in 1938 boarded a ferry from Palermo to Naples. He never arrived. Speculation has ranged from suicide, to escape to Argentina, to retreat to a monastery. Although matter and antimatter annihilate when they meet, no one has yet suggested that Ettore Majorana met his anti-Majorana on the fateful voyage.</p></div>
<p>“Berkeley Lab developed germanium detectors decades ago, so we have a history of strength and expertise in design and manufacture,” Detwiler says. “We’re working with a U.S.-based commercial vendor to turn germanium-76, enriched at an isotope separation facility in Russia, into working detectors. We’ll mount them with low-noise electronics developed here.”</p>
<p>The first pure germanium in the <small>DEMONSTRATOR</small> will be a natural mix of isotopes, setting a baseline for response to background events. Eventually 30 kilograms of the detector’s 40-kilogram total will be enriched to 86-percent germanium-76, narrowing the chance that background signals could compete with the discovery of an actual neutrinoless double-beta decay event.</p>
<p>Such an event would be easy to identify, because the energy of its two electrons would add to precisely 2.039 million electron volts (2.039 MeV), and none would be shared with antineutrinos. With a low enough background, <small>MAJORANA</small> will be able to easily separate the sharp spike of a 2.039 MeV two-electron event from a broad smear of energies shared among four different particles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rewriting the Standard Model</em></strong></p>
<p>Mass is essential to oscillation among the three neutrino flavors, but no one knows the precise mass of any of the flavors or why it’s so small. Neutrinoless double-beta decay offers a unique window on that question. If <small>MAJORANA</small> can go beyond showing that neutrinoless double-beta decay exists to showing how often it occurs, it may be able to establish the mass scale of neutrinos directly.</p>
<p>The key is their handedness, or helicity (which refers to how their linear momentum and quantum spin are aligned). If neutrinos and antineutrinos are two distinct particles, each could be either right-handed or left-handed, for a total of four quantum states. If neutrinos and antineutrinos are just one particle, however, it has only two states of handedness. In fact only two states, left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos, have ever been observed.</p>
<p>A diagram of neutrinoless double-beta decay shows a right-handed antineutrino emitted when a neutron decays (also emitting an electron). The antineutrino flips its handedness and is absorbed by a second neutron, which also decays (and emits a second electron). Only a single antiparticle/particle is involved. How fast it can flip its handedness depends on its mass: the more massive, the easier the flip, and the more often this kind of decay will occur.</p>

Two electrons account for the total difference in energy between the nuclei.  </p></div>
<p>But there’s a catch, says Poon. “The fascinating thing about neutrinoless double-beta decay is that it would violate one of the basic principles of the Standard Model, in which all interactions supposedly conserve lepton number. Electrons and neutrinos are both leptons, so if an interaction produces two electrons, that’s a plus two. In the usual kind of double–beta decay, two antineutrinos are also emitted – antiparticles with minus lepton numbers, which is a minus two. Lepton number is conserved at zero.” Not so with neutrinoless double-beta decay, however, which raises the lepton number from zero to two.</p>
<p>“The Standard Model leaves many outstanding questions, and we know it needs revision,” Poon says, “but we cannot write a new theory until we know if neutrinos are their own antiparticles, or how we’re going to accommodate the loss of lepton number conservation if they are, and a number of other questions, including neutrino mass.”</p>
<p>In the race to answer these questions, the <small>MAJORANA</small> Collaboration is competing with another important germanium experiment, the GERDA experiment at the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. But it’s a competition with a twist:</p>
<p>“GERDA has a different shielding concept, using liquid argon and water, and between us we’ll find out which has the lower background,” says Poon. “We may join forces to build the final one-ton detector.”</p>
<p>Germanium-76 is not the only element that can undergo double-beta decay. Other detectors use isotopes of tellurium, xenon, neodymium, or other elements. Poon says, “It’s important to establish that any instance of neutrinoless double-beta decay really reflects the property of the neutrino. If the process is seen in more than one element, that’s very strong evidence that the neutrino is indeed its own antiparticle.”</p>

		A <em>Harry Potter </em>T-shirt was maybe never going to sustain an empire. Or coasters shaped like national landmarks, or Christmas ornaments with your dog’s face on them.&nbsp;	</p>



	<p>
		Empires are built on unlikely foundations. Romulus built Rome on shards of Etruscan pottery and wolf milk. Cecrops built Athens on a hill and a lot of goat meat. And between 2005 and the fall of 2021, Etsy built a $37 billion empire on personalized coasters, dog-themed Christmas ornaments, and bootleg Taylor Swift merch. On November 23, 2021 –&nbsp;in the midst of a pandemic that saw the re-emergence of the kind of craft-driven “cottage industry” the company had aggregated onto its platform –&nbsp;share prices sat at an all-time high of $296.91 and the biggest concern for many investors was that the employee perks were too good.&nbsp;	

	</p>




	<div><p>
		Today, share prices sit below $80 having fallen 30 percent in November. Concerns run toward seller revolts due to changing Etsy rules and the financial hole left by the $217 million acquisition of Elo7 and the $1.625 billion acquisition of Depop in 2021, both of which were viewed by many as overpriced. But Etsy has a solid operating margin and generated north of $650 million in cash over the previous 12 months, so what’s the real problem? Why does it feel like the end of an empire?</p><p>The answer is simple: Etsy kind of sucks. Phrased with a touch more subtlety: Etsy no longer feels like a differentiated and buyer-friendly environment. There are roughly five reasons for this:</p></div>



<div>
<ol>
<li>Dropshippers, ubiquitous on the internet, are all over the platform. Rather than selling handcrafted products, these vendors act as middlemen, which is precisely the kind of person Etsy was designed to cut out of the market. (The kind of person that really messes up a flea market.)</li>



<li>Counterfeit goods constitute an increasing percentage of products offered. Earlier this year, the firm Citron Research claimed Etsy was one of the biggest counterfeit distributors. Etsy has only exacerbated the problem by allowing vendors to buy “ad words” of brands. This skews on-platform search toward those focused on arbitrage rather than value creation.</li>



<li>Small sellers are leaving. This may actually not be Etsy’s fault. The conditions of the pandemic were singular and many of the folks who decided they really wanted to spend their lives crocheting portraits of other people’s cats have subsequently changed their minds.</li>



<li>Large sellers are leaving. Mandatory opt-ins to advertisements led to an exodus of bigger sellers. In 2020, Etsy started automatically advertising on sellers’ behalf, with most shops obligated to pay Etsy a cut. Vendors making more than $10,000 annually were not allowed to opt out. People got pissed.</li>



<li>Etsy is no longer a unique platform. What makes Etsy unique –&nbsp;the “moat” in VC terms –&nbsp;is its scale and the network effects that scale provides, but the actual two-sided marketplace element of the business (all that code) is now easily replicable and can be basically bought off a shelf by new challengers and niche operators in the space.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</div>



	<p>
		The problems need to be understood in the context of the solution Etsy first provided. Back in the early aughts, there was really no easy way for a maker to reach an audience beyond the local farmer’s market. Yes, eBay existed, but it was impractical. High barrier to entry. Low return on investment. (Craigslist was low barrier, unreliable return.) Etsy changed that and, in so doing, created a bigger market for handmade and custom-made goods. And Etsy was –&nbsp;arguably still is –&nbsp;the real deal: the company only allows homemade, vintage, or craft items, rulebreakers notwithstanding. The overarching issue now seems to be perverse incentives. Etsy gets a percentage of the profits of the sellers undermining its mission. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/etsy-sellers-handmade-products-prices-which" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">One investigation from the consumer testing site <em>Which?</em></a> this year found that Etsy sellers were passing off items as homemade, but sourcing them from Amazon, Asda, and the discount chain B&amp;M.&nbsp;	</p>



	<p>
		“There are a lot of aspirational sellers who come to Etsy and realize that after a few months, they’re losing money selling a bunch of products for cheaper than they need to,” Matt Chancey, a private equity consultant, tells <em>SPY</em>. “When you start charging $30 for things, you start to go head-to-head with real retailers: You need quality, a return policy, warranties, reward systems, customer service departments – that’s not what the mom-and-pop seller was intended to do, and people make the swap to the quality vendor.”&nbsp;	</p>



	<p>
		Basically, it’s hard for small Etsy sellers to compete with large retail operations, especially at the price points that smaller sellers need to keep their businesses viable.&nbsp;	

	</p>




	<p>
		And Etsy hasn’t helped sellers by eroding trust through delayed payments, an unfortunate collateral of the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/silicon-valley-bank-collapse/card/etsy-pays-sellers-that-had-payments-delayed-after-svb-s-collapse-1GWMf9TBMnsJFVPYOvly" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Bank collapse</a> earlier this year. Etsy was using SVB to distribute payments to some sellers, who reported that they weren’t getting payments after the bank filed for bankruptcy in March.&nbsp;	</p>



	<p>
		In other words, Etsy is currently (things change!) driving away the sellers that actually make quality products. The dynamic is not dissimilar to the dynamic around Facebook content. The handmade stuff –&nbsp;hot takes on family reunions and commentary on PTA meetings –&nbsp;started to disappear as the internal ad sales business became a key profit driver<sup>1</sup>. A vicious cycle is created. Etsy consumers buy from lower quality vendors, get bad products, and become skeptical of the whole enterprise. Because Etsy products are, as Chancey puts it skeptically<sup>2</sup>, “cute” but not the sort of “durable goods” that belong in a household budget, consumers just leave. Vendors on Etsy forums say sales are tanking. Many seem baffled.	</p>



	<p>
		The venn diagram of people who sell on Etsy and people who understand the dynamics of public markets is not, one might conclude, a perfect circle.	</p>



	<p>
		“Etsy’s listing on the stock exchange transformed it into a company that needed to grow and grow fast so as to be able to satisfy its shareholders and their expected returns on investment,” Thomaï Serdari, a marketing professor at NYU specializing in luxury marketing and branding, tells SPY. “When there is a push for growth that is not commensurate with the initial values of the company, misalignment is bound to appear.”	

</p>



	<p>
		She adds that in order to scale, “Etsy allowed in sellers that had nothing to do with its original community and the values that bound them together.” That would be the small nation of print-to-order sellers. “Makers will look for alternatives,” she adds. “I imagine these must be smaller, still private, and functioning based on authenticity and trust as Etsy used to do.”	</p>



	<p>
		Correct. There has been a sharp increase in the number of e-commerce marketplaces over the last few years and those marketplaces have attracted a lot of sellers. The problem is that they haven’t all attracted a lot of buyers. The Artisans Co-Operative, which updates <a href="https://blog.artisans.coop/blog/etsy-alternatives-you-can-try-right-now-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an ongoing list of Etsy alternatives</a>, endorses marketplaces that hit a “critical mass” of consumers. Critical mass equals a viable consumer base. It’s an indicator that a site can attract serious businesses, but as Chancey emphasizes, a large number of <em>sellers</em> isn’t important.&nbsp;	</p>



	<p>
		If the number of buyers is what ultimately matters –&nbsp;and it is –&nbsp;Etsy will almost certainly have to change course. Chancey imagines a future in which Etsy intentionally downscales, rightsizing its seller network in order to bring back loyal buyers. The question is whether Etsy can do this before smaller marketplaces get their hooks into all those knitwear enthusiasts.	</p>



	<p>
		<sup>1</sup> This pattern of scale &gt; internal ad products &gt; clusterfuckery &gt; user exodus is generally referred to as “Enshittification,” a very fun term coined by Cory Doctorow in 2022 to explain why, broadly speaking, everything on the internet now seems way worse.<br><sup>2</sup> He’s never used Etsy, and shopped on Amazon for the first time six months ago. Equity consulting leaves little time for materialism, apparently.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>
(short for “terminal mux” (short for “multiplexer”))
is
<a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>
for your terminal.
Oh, it’s so much more than that, and I recently discovered with
some joy that it is installed by default on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
but its fundamental value add to any programmer who has to
SSH into servers more than once a week is it allows you to
split your screen up into multiple independent shells
<em>without needing a graphical environment at all</em>.
If you want to walk the path of true digital minimalism,
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vanilla Vim</a>
and tmux or its spiritual grandfather
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
are all you need.</p><p>So it’s always been interesting to me that a developer as
seasoned as
<a href="https://kovidgoyal.net/">Kovid Goyal</a>,
developer of the ePub powerhouse calibre and
my current teminal emulator of choice
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>,
has gone on record a number of times saying he is not a fan
of tmux. He has
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-am-using-tmux-and-have-a-problem">a whole section in his FAQ about it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[T]erminal multiplexers are <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745">a bad idea</a>, do not use them, if at all possible. kitty contains features that do all of what tmux does, but better, with the exception of remote persistence.</p></blockquote><p>(I don’t use remote persistence. I’m aware I’m a
caveman.)</p><p>And from the linked Git comment:</p><blockquote><p>[Terminal m]ultiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of windows/sessions. […] Energy/performance wise they are poison, every byte has to be parsed twice, once by the middleman and once by the terminal. And they act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get any new features. […] Terminals [themselves] are fine, certainly better than any other interface paradigm I have ever seen.</p></blockquote><p>I’m not here to incur Goyal’s wrath. He knows way more
about this space than I do, and I’m clearly a very
satisfied user of kitty at home, where I have the
ability to tweak my environment to be exactly what
I want it to be.</p><p>Therein lies the rub. At home, I run UNIX on my metal.
At work, I use Windows. And so, the multiple times a
day I find myself SSHing into one of our many, many
quasi-embedded Linux boxes, I find myself typing out
“tmux” as the first command I run. Because it’s always
going to be there, and it does the one thing I actually
need it to no matter what: Let me run multiple shells
at once, without SSHing in multiple times, regardless
of whatever funky terminal emulator I’m actually using
to get the job done. Alacritty, Windows Terminal,
whatever.</p><p>kitty has to run on what I’m remoting <em>from</em>.
tmux can work on what I’m remoting <em>into</em>.
And that makes
all the difference.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jerseay_style">Worse is better</a>
is more of a product managment philosophy than a
software philosophy, IMO, but it basically underlines
the idea that whatever your software’s killer app is,
you want to get that <em>really</em> right for the most common
use cases, even if it means living with a suboptimal
approach.
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-vms-in-hacker-pedagogy/">I love VMs for a lot of reasons</a>,
and I even maintain
<a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu">a set of 3 shell scripts</a>
which turns a vanilla Ubuntu VM into my personal software
development workhorse, complete with LazyVim, ripgrep,
tmux, and - yes - Kitty as the default terminal.
But even with that it’s
rare these days that I am doing such prolonged development
work that I feel it’s worth actually working in
such a VM. The perils of becoming a middle manager, alas.</p><p>So, for the most part, I remote in directly
from Windows. Which means I’m going to use tmux on
my servers. Which is why I have <code>C-b %</code> and <code>C-b "</code>
memorized and not … <em>checks kitty docs</em> … wait,
is it really <code>C-S-Enter</code>?</p><p>That’s so <em>nice</em>. Man. We are missing out.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
