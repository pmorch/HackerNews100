<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr text-lg">Announcing Magistral — the first reasoning model by Mistral AI — excelling in domain-specific, transparent, and multilingual reasoning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The best human thinking isn’t linear — it weaves through logic, insight, uncertainty, and discovery. Reasoning language models have enabled us to augment and delegate complex thinking and deep understanding to AI, improving our ability to work through problems requiring precise, step-by-step deliberation and analysis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But this space is still nascent. Lack of specialized depth needed for domain-specific problems, limited transparency, and inconsistent reasoning in the desired language — are just some of the known limitations of early thinking models.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, we’re excited to announce our latest contribution to AI research with Magistral — our first reasoning model. Released in both open and enterprise versions, Magistral is designed to think things through — in ways familiar to us — while bringing expertise across professional domains, transparent reasoning that you can follow and verify, along with deep multilingual flexibility.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Magistral is a dual-release model focused on real-world reasoning and feedback-driven improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">We’re releasing the model in two variants: Magistral Small — a 24B parameter open-source version and Magistral Medium — a more powerful, enterprise version.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Magistral Medium scored 73.6% on AIME2024, and 90% with majority voting @64. Magistral Small scored 70.7% and 83.3% respectively.</p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Suited for a wide range of enterprise use cases — from structured calculations and programmatic logic to decision trees and rule-based systems.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">With the new Think mode and Flash Answers in Le Chat, you can get responses at 10x the speed compared to most competitors.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The release is supported by our <a href="https://mistral.ai/static/research/magistral.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paper</a> covering comprehensive evaluations of Magistral, our training infrastructure, reinforcement learning algorithm, and novel observations for training reasoning models.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">As we’ve open-sourced Magistral Small, we welcome the community to examine, modify and build upon its architecture and reasoning processes to further accelerate the emergence of thinking language models. Our earlier open models have already been leveraged by the community for exciting projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.futurehouse.org/research-announcements/ether0-a-scientific-reasoning-model-for-chemistry">ether0</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B-Preview">DeepHermes 3</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Purpose-built for transparent reasoning.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Magistral is fine-tuned for multi-step logic, improving interpretability and providing a traceable thought process in the user’s language, unlike general-purpose models.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We aim to iterate the model quickly starting with this release. Expect the models to constantly improve.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Multilingual dexterity.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The model excels in maintaining high-fidelity reasoning across numerous languages. Magistral is especially well-suited to reason in languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Arabic, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Business strategy and operations.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Building on our flagship <a href="https://mistral.ai/models">models</a>, Magistral is designed for research, strategic planning, operational optimization, and data-driven decision making — whether executing risk assessment and modelling with multiple factors, or calculating optimal delivery windows under constraints.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Regulated industries and sectors.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Legal, finance, healthcare, and government professionals get traceable reasoning that meets compliance requirements. Every conclusion can be traced back through its logical steps, providing auditability for high-stakes environments with domain-specialized AI.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Systems, software, and data engineering.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Magistral enhances coding and development use cases: compared to non-reasoning models, it significantly improves project planning, backend architecture, frontend design, and data engineering through sequenced, multi-step actions involving external tools or API.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Content and communication.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Our early tests indicated that Magistral is an excellent creative companion. We highly recommend it for creative writing and storytelling, with the model capable of producing coherent or — if needed — delightfully eccentric copy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Availability</h2>

If you’ve got one of those, give us a little wave. Or contact us by email at jgh(at)jorgegarciaherrero.com.          </p><p><span>Below is a simplified explanation of a very technical process, </span><strong><a href="https://localmess.github.io/" rel="">rigorously detailed on the website set up by the researchers who uncovered Meta’s latest major blow</a></strong><span> to the GDPR specifically, and to other regulations more broadly, as we’ll see.</span></p><p>Credit where it’s due — it’s ingenious. Ingenious in the sense of breaking (yet again) the record for a privacy-related fine, but hey!... ingenious.</p><p>This is the process through which Meta (Facebook/Instagram) managed to link what you do in your browser (for example, visiting a news site or an online store) with your real identity (your Facebook or Instagram account), even if you never logged into your account through the browser or anything like that.</p><p>Meta accomplishes this through two invisible channels that exchange information:</p><p>(i) The Facebook or Instagram app running in the background on your phone, even when you’re not using it.</p><p>(ii) Meta’s tracking scripts (the now-pulled illegal brainchild uncovered last week), which operate inside your mobile web browser.</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong><span> to the outstanding human beings who revealed this scandal: </span><strong>Tim Vlummens, Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, Nipuna Weerasekara, Gunes Acar, and Aniketh Girish</strong><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>The entire flow of the _fbp cookie from web to native and the server is as follows:</p><ol><li><p>The user opens the native Facebook or Instagram app, which eventually is sent to the background and creates a background service to listen for incoming traffic on a TCP port (12387 or 12388) and a UDP port (the first unoccupied port in 12580-12585). Users must be logged-in with their credentials on the apps.</p></li><li><p>The user opens their browser and visits a website integrating the Meta Pixel.</p></li><li><p>At this stage, websites may ask for consent depending on the website's and visitor's locations.</p></li><li><p><span>The Meta Pixel script sends the </span><a href="https://localmess.github.io/#about_fbp" rel="">_fbp cookie</a><span> to the native Instagram or Facebook app via WebRTC (STUN) SDP Munging.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Meta Pixel script also sends the _fbp value in a request to https://www.facebook.com/tr along with other parameters such as page URL (dl), website and browser metadata, and the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250531104925/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/reference/" rel="">event type</a><span> (ev) (e.g., PageView, AddToCart, Donate, Purchase).</span></p></li><li><p>The Facebook or Instagram apps receive the _fbp cookie from the Meta Pixel JavaScript running on the browser.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/06/wwdc25-macos-tahoe-breaks-decades-of-finder-history/">https://512pixels.net/2025/06/wwdc25-macos-tahoe-breaks-decades-of-finder-history/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44235177">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-32553">

	<div>
		<p>Something jumped out at me in the macOS Tahoe segment of the WWDC keynote today: the Finder icon is reversed.</p>
<p>You can see that in the image below. On the left is macOS Sequoia, and on the right is macOS Tahoe:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/About-Finder.jpg" alt="About Finder"></p>
<p>I know I am going to sound old and fussy, but Apple needs to roll this back.</p>
<h2>Some History</h2>
<p>The Finder logo has changed over the years, but the dark side has been on the left <em>forever</em>. Here it is on the boot screen on System 7.5.3, which shipped in 1996, an early version of the logo in color:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Finder-7-5-3.png" alt="Finder in 7.5.3"></p>
<p>And in the About This Computer screen in Mac OS 8:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Finder-About-8-0.png" alt="Finder in 8.0"></p>
<p>This same basic design survived the move to Mac OS X, as can be seen here in the Public Beta from 2000. The only real change was the addition of a little sheen to make it fit in better with the Aqua user interface:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10-Public-Beta-Kodiak-About-This-Mac.png" alt="Finder in Public Beta"></p>
<p>Here you can see it in Mac OS X Panther which shipped three years later:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10-3-Panther-Finder-Go-Menu.png" alt="Finder in Panther"></p>
<p>The Finder then transitioned to the Retina era in 2012 with OS X Lion:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10-7-Lion-About-This-Mac.jpeg" alt="Finder in Lion"></p>
<p>The logo was updated with the redesign that was ushered in with OS X Yosemite in 2014, then tweaked again for macOS Big Sur in 2020:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10-10-Yosemite-Stacks.jpeg" alt="Finder in Yosemite"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Big-Sur-Apple-Menu.jpeg" alt="Big Sur Finder"></p>
<h2>A Solution</h2>
<p>The Big Sur Finder icon has been with us ever since,<sup id="fnref-32553-fn-car"><a href="#fn-32553-fn-car" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> and I hope Apple reverses course here. I understand that the new icon is meant to be in sync with <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/">the new Liquid Glass user interface</a>, but some things are just tradition.</p>
<p>For kicks, I ran the current Finder icon through Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/">new Icon Composer app,</a> and I think it looks pretty good with Liquid Glass, even in the clear and tinted modes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Liquid-Glass-Finder.jpg" alt="Liquid Glass Finder"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This has been filed with Apple as Feedback FB17840162. Yes, seriously.</strong></p>

            <p>Digitaliseringsminister Caroline Stage (M) vil fra næste måned begynde at udfase Microsoft i sit eget ministerium. Planen er, at omkring halvdelen af medarbejderne om en måneds tid og hen over sommeren skal arbejde med computere, hvor Office 365 er erstattet af Libre Office. Hvis det går som forventet, vil alle medarbejdere være på en open source-løsning i løbet af efteråret.</p>
            <p>Det fortæller ministeren op til lanceringen af en ny digitaliseringsstrategi for de kommende fire år, hvor digital suverænitet for første gang er en prioritet. Strategien er aftalt mellem staten, regionerne og kommunerne.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">   <section> <p>A quiet but deeply unsettling moment just shook the foundations of international justice, proving why Europe needs digital sovereignty - and most Europeans not too interested in tech likely missed it: The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a court based in The Hague and central to Europe’s upholding of human rights, suddenly found that his email account was shut down. The service provider? Microsoft. The reason? Mr. Trump.
</p> <hr> <div> <h3 id="what-happened">What happened</h3>
<p>In February, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-icc-sanctions-israel-order-01beee050ae84d0d9eae66d00bc8ead9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump sanctioned International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant. The court argued that the Israeli politicians have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid in Gaza amid the war against Hamas, thus, harming civilians.</p>
<p>Israeli officials denied all charges, and, consequently, US President Donald Trump issued sanctions against the ICC saying that the court had committed “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel”. Trump also called the warrants “baseless arrest warrants”.</p>
<p>Following these sanctions, the ICC has found itself faced with several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has lost access to his email; his bank accounts were frozen.</li>
<li>American employees of the court risk arrest when traveling to the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the blocking of Khan’s Microsoft email account, the court is facing severe hurdles in its day-to-day work.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-blocked-email-account-based-on-us-sanction">Microsoft blocked email account based on U.S. sanction</h3>
<p><image-zoom-wrapper> <span><picture> <source srcset="https://tuta.com/assets/microsoft-shut-down-email-account.BgAnMnC8_Z2orNlR.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://tuta.com/assets/microsoft-shut-down-email-account.BgAnMnC8_e8q5s.png" alt="Microsoft sperrte Khans E-Mail-Konto." width="1800" height="1013" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture></span> <picture> <source srcset="https://tuta.com/assets/microsoft-shut-down-email-account.BgAnMnC8_Z2orNlR.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://tuta.com/assets/microsoft-shut-down-email-account.BgAnMnC8_e8q5s.png" alt="Microsoft sperrte Khans E-Mail-Konto." width="1800" height="1013" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture> </image-zoom-wrapper> 
<em>Microsoft shut down Khan’s email account.</em></p>
<p>The blocking of Khan’s Microsoft email account took place because of an executive order signed by Trump which the U.S.-based company – Microsoft – fulfilled. This gets even more explosive when one considers that Microsoft - even if it wanted to - had to obey this order because of the legal and political situation.</p>
<p>The Open-Source Business Alliance (OSBA) told <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Criminal-Court-Microsoft-s-email-block-a-wake-up-call-for-digital-sovereignty-10387383.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heise</a> that it considers Microsoft’s actions to be “unprecedented in this context and with this impact”, and that this incident proves that <strong>Europe needs digital sovereignty</strong> by choosing European-based tech services over US-based Big Tech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This must be a wake-up call for all those responsible for the secure availability of state and private IT and communication infrastructures. … We cannot rely on companies that are not under our jurisdiction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="wake-up-call-for-digital-sovereignty">Wake-up call for digital sovereignty</h3>
<p><strong>This, indeed, must be a wake-up call.</strong></p>
<p>U.S. sanctions – unrelated to Europe and imposed by a foreign power – led to the shutdown of the digital communication of a leading public figure, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p><strong>This is a story of digital sovereignty.</strong></p>
<p>And it marks a clear turning point in Europe’s relationship with foreign technology providers. If key figures in international law can be digitally silenced by a company subject to U.S. law, what does that say about our control – or lack thereof – over the very digital foundations we rely on?</p>
<p>For years, European institutions have relied on a false promise of security and data protection by Silicon Valley tech giants. Cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have repeatedly assured us that they respect European law, have built data centers within EU borders, and have pledged to comply with the GDPR. While at the same time <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/outlook-business-security-issue" rel="" target="_self">Microsoft’s New Outlook uploads all data, including passwords, into the cloud</a>, <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/microsoft-office-365-email-alternative" rel="" target="_self">Microsoft’s Office 365 has been declared illegal for German schools because of data protection issues</a>, and <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/denmark-bans-google-email-and-cloud-services-due-to-privacy-concerns" rel="" target="_self">Denmark has banned Gmail from schools due to privacy concerns based on the GDPR</a>. <strong>And these are just a few examples.</strong></p>
<h3 id="jurisdiction-trumps-everything">Jurisdiction trumps everything</h3>
<p><image-zoom-wrapper> <span><picture> <source srcset="https://tuta.com/assets/boycott-us-choose-eu.VNyJdP4k_u3jTI.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://tuta.com/assets/boycott-us-choose-eu.VNyJdP4k_1vjqEt.png" alt="Die Zuständigkeit ist wichtiger, als wir bisher dachten: Europäische Behörden sollten sich an europäische technische Dienste halten." width="1800" height="1013" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture></span> <picture> <source srcset="https://tuta.com/assets/boycott-us-choose-eu.VNyJdP4k_u3jTI.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://tuta.com/assets/boycott-us-choose-eu.VNyJdP4k_1vjqEt.png" alt="Die Zuständigkeit ist wichtiger, als wir bisher dachten: Europäische Behörden sollten sich an europäische technische Dienste halten." width="1800" height="1013" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture> </image-zoom-wrapper> 
<em>Jurisdiction matters more than we used to think: European authorities should stick to European tech services.</em></p>
<p>In the light of all this, the ICC incident has just put the final nail in the coffin. It reveals a deeper truth, one that Europeans must start acting upon!</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction trumps geography.</strong> It doesn’t matter if your servers are in Frankfurt, Rome, or Paris – if your provider is subject to foreign law, so is your data.</p>
<p>And this must be included in every worst case scenarios of every business and every authority. The question is obvious: Is my data secure and protected – not just from external threats like malicious attackers, but also from internal threats stemming from the company hosting your data?</p>
<p>If political decisions made thousands of kilometers away can have immediate and severe consequences on European digital communications and European data, this poses a huge risk. One that you should not be taking. And with the recent Microsoft incident, it’s no longer a theoretical threat. That is exactly what just happened.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-is-a-threat">Dependency is a threat</h3>
<p>Let’s imagine this was not about email, but about the energy sector.</p>
<p>Would Europe ever hand over control of its national power grids to foreign companies bound by non-European law? Would we trust a foreign supplier’s guarantee for 99.999% uptime (which is the standard uptime SLA agreement of cloud providers) while at the same time a foreign power could force them anytime to cut Europe’s power?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>Yet this is how we’re managing our digital infrastructure in Europe.</strong></p>
<p>We are blind to the risks, and much too trusting of American tech providers. Cloud platforms, communication tools, and email providers are core services that run our governments, schools, hospitals, and courts. And in most cases, European institutions have chosen American providers - while great <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/small-business-email-address" rel="" target="_self">email alternatives for businesses</a> exist.</p>
<h3 id="europe-has-the-services--lets-start-using-them">Europe has the services – let’s start using them!</h3>
<p>What makes all this even more frustrating is that Europe doesn’t lack innovation; <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/boycott-us-choose-european-products" rel="" target="_self">Europe has great tech services that are better than their U.S. equivalents</a>. Particularly when it comes to tech services, Europe has much more on offer than some would expect – especially if you value privacy and security.</p>
<p>Across the continent, privacy-first, security-focused, and truly sovereign digital solutions are being developed. One of the best examples is Tuta, which offers secure, encrypted email and calendar tools, even with <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/post-quantum-cryptography" rel="" target="_self">quantum-safe encryption</a>. The email provider not only operates under German data protection laws with all servers based in German data centers, but it also uses the most advanced encryption technologies to protect businesses’ data.</p>
<p>So why don’t we see services like this one powering ministries, parliaments, and courts?</p>
<p>Because despite all the speeches about “strategic autonomy,” European tech is still often treated as a backup plan by the authorities – and most of them have not even started putting this plan into action. For decades, European authorities have relied on Microsoft’s products. Stemming from Microsoft’s integration into Windows, the most widely used OS since its launch in the 1980s, most businesses and authorities still use Microsoft Outlook for email, Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. While switching from Microsoft to European-based alternatives can’t be done in a day, authorities must start planning the switch.</p>
<p><strong>Now it’s time to break free from the dependency on American tech!</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-sovereign-cloud">The sovereign cloud</h3>
<p>There’s a saying in tech that goes as follows: There is no cloud, just other people’s computers.</p>
<p>When taking this concept into action, one has to ask themselves: On whose computer would I like to store my data? With an American tech provider – to which the US (government, NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.) can potentially have full access? Even if the data stays in Europe, the control – the ability to operate, deny, or transfer access – remains elsewhere. As long as American tech providers hold the key, Europe does not own its data.</p>
<p>We need true sovereignty – by choosing European services that are built and operated under European law and that store the data solely in Europe, best end-to-end encrypted.</p>

<em>The Tuta Team welcoming a brighter future!</em></p>
<p>If Europe wants to regain control of its digital infrastructure, we need a structural change; and an immense effort from all parties involved. But in the end, the effort will pay off. Not only by gaining sovereignty, but also by supporting and building a European tech industry – one that can easily compete with American and Chinese tech companies.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we don’t even need new laws, all we need is a commitment by the public sector. <strong>When Trump says “America first”, Europe must say “Europe first”</strong> – and in tech the gain is double: 1. A big share of what the public sector spends on European tech, they get back in the form of company taxes. 2. The public sector could help boost an already vibrating and innovative European tech industry to gain a competitive edge, not just in Europe but also abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Make “European” a requirement for public procurement of tech products</strong>: EU institutions, governments and local authorities should make being “European” a requirement for procuring tech products. This way they can make sure that the services they purchase follow European data protection laws and are not under the influence of foreign governments.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent vendor lock-in</strong>: Any platform used in the public sector should be interoperable and replaceable. No exceptions. Contracts should be written with exit strategies in mind so that a dependency like the one we are currently seeing with Microsoft never happens again.</p>
<p>Going forward, European and local authorities can make a real difference. All they have to do is get active!
The Microsoft email issue of the ICC must not be dismissed and forgotten. It’s a wake-up call for what happens when you build your digital house on someone else’s foundation.</p>
<p>Let’s not wait for the next company to switch off an essential tech service in Europe.</p>
<p>Let’s build systems that adhere to European laws and regulations, protect European citizens and their data, and strengthen European independence.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s stop borrowing digital power – and start generating our own. Together we can make the web a better place!</strong></p>

		<p>A few years ago, I sat across from a friend at a late dinner. He was telling me about his new promotion, the big title, the bonus, the corner office. I remember watching his face as he described it. He looked like someone describing a story he’d once believed but no longer knew how to finish.</p><p>Later that night, walking home alone, I realized I had spent the last year of my life pursuing a goal I barely remembered choosing. I had grown proficient at producing, scaling, optimizing. I had systems. I had habits. But I was working in the absence of inner alignment. I was winning at a game I no longer wanted to play.</p><p>The goal hadn’t been wrong. It had just been handed to me, implicitly, by a world that measures progress in forward motion and not in depth.</p><p>That was the moment I began to question the entire architecture of ambition. Not whether it worked, but whether it asked the right things of a person. Whether a life could be constructed from milestones rather than methods, from outcomes rather than orientation.</p><p>Lately, I’ve paid closer attention to the boundaries that shape my work. The negative space. The rules. The constraints. I stopped asking where I wanted to go and started asking what I was unwilling to violate in order to get there. I noticed a shift: The work got harder, yes. But also clearer.</p><p>I haven’t abandoned goals entirely. But I no longer treat them as sacred. They’re furniture. Constraints are the frame.</p><h3 id="the-overrated-religion-of-goals">The Overrated Religion of Goals</h3><p>In 1953, a popular myth claimed that Yale graduates who wrote down their goals were significantly more successful 20 years later than those who didn’t. The study was cited in self-help books, business seminars, and motivational speeches for decades. The only problem was that the study never happened. It was completely fabricated, a ghost statistic that wandered the halls of corporate training programs like a benevolent poltergeist. But it persisted. Like a bad penny, it kept showing up for decades. </p><p>Why?</p><p><strong><em>Because it said what people wanted to believe: that clarity of ambition would bring control, that intention would yield destiny.</em></strong></p><p>The cult of goal-setting thrives in this illusion. It converts uncertainty into an illusion of progress. It demands specificity in exchange for comfort. And it replaces self-trust with the performance of future-planning. That makes it wildly appealing to organizations, executives, and knowledge workers who want to feel like they’re doing something without doing anything unpredictable. But the more interesting question is: who is <em>not</em> setting goals? And why?</p><p>It turns out that many of the people doing genuinely innovative work avoid explicit goals entirely. They work within constraints instead.</p><h3 id="goals-are-for-games-constraints-are-for-worlds">Goals are for Games. Constraints are for Worlds.</h3><p>A goal is a win condition. Constraints are the rules of the game. But not all games are worth playing. And some of the most powerful forms of progress emerge from people who stopped trying to win and started building new game boards entirely.</p><p>When John Boyd, the brilliant / irascible military strategist, developed the OODA loop, he worked within the limits of jet fighter dogfights. In those constraints, he found a dynamic model of decision-making that would later influence military doctrine, business strategy and start-up culture.</p><p>Richard Feynman didn’t get his Nobel Prize by pursuing "win a Nobel Prize" as a goal. He played with problems, often placing arbitrary limits on himself: what if we assume this system has no dissipation? What if we ignore spin? He looked for elegance within boundaries, not outcomes. His freedom came from self-imposed structure.</p><p>Constraints do not block creativity. They aim it. The sonnet form is maddeningly restrictive. Yet Shakespeare produced infinite meaning inside 14 lines. Jazz musicians work within a key and tempo. Architects must respect the load-bearing capacity of concrete. The painter who begins with a blank canvas faces more paralysis than the one who starts with a frame and a palette.</p><h3 id="the-seduction-of-goals">The Seduction of Goals</h3><p>Setting goals feels like action. It gives you the warm sense of progress without the discomfort of change. You can spend hours calibrating, optimizing, refining your goals. You can build a Notion dashboard. You can make a spreadsheet. You can go on a dopamine-fueled productivity binge and still never do anything meaningful.</p><p>Because goals are often surrogates for clarity. We set goals when we’re uncertain about what we really want. The goal becomes a placeholder. It acts as a proxy for direction, not a result of it.</p><p>In WWII, when allied bombers returned to base riddled with bullet holes, engineers initially proposed reinforcing the areas with the most damage. But statistician Abraham Wald pointed out the flaw: they were only seeing the planes that made it back. The holes marked the <em>survivable</em> areas. The real vulnerabilities were the untouched parts on the returning planes, because the ones hit there never came home.</p><p>Goals often focus our attention on the visible holes. But it’s the invisible constraints that tell us what really matters.</p><h3 id="constraints-as-compass">Constraints as Compass</h3><p>NASA had a fixed budget, fixed timeline, and a goal that bordered on the absurd: land a man on the moon before the decade was out. But what made it possible wasn’t the moonshot goal. It was the sheer range of constraints: weight, heat, vacuum, radio delay, computation. Each constraint forced creative workarounds. Slide rules and paper simulations gave us one of the most improbable technological feats in history.</p><p>Constraints make solutions non-obvious. They force the kind of second-order thinking that goals actively discourage. Instead of aiming for a finish line, the constrained mind seeks viability. It doesn’t ask, “How do I get there?” It asks, “What’s possible from here?”</p><h3 id="why-constraints-scale-and-goals-break">Why Constraints Scale and Goals Break</h3><p>A goal set at time T is a bet on the future from a position of ignorance. The more volatile the domain, the more brittle that bet becomes.</p><p>This is where smart people get stuck. The brighter you are, the more coherent your plans tend to look on paper. But plans are scripts. And reality is improvisation.</p><p>Constraints scale better because they don’t assume knowledge. They are adaptive. They respond to feedback. A small team that decides, "We will not hire until we have product-market fit" has created a constraint that guides decisions without locking in a prediction. A founder who says, "I will only build products I can explain to a teenager in 60 seconds" is using a constraint as a filtering mechanism.</p><h3 id="the-psychology-of-anti-goals">The Psychology of Anti-Goals</h3><p>There’s a kind of internal rebellion that occurs when you set a goal you don’t believe in. You drag your heels. You sabotage yourself. You procrastinate, but not because you’re lazy. Because you’re not aligned.</p><p>Anti-goals are constraints disguised as aversions. The entrepreneur who says, "I never want to work with clients who drain me" is sketching a boundary around their time, energy, and identity. It’s not a goal. It’s a refusal. And refusals shape lives just as powerfully as ambitions.</p><p>Marcus Aurelius, writing in his private journal that we now call <em>Meditations</em>, returned constantly to the idea of limits. He didn't prescribe grand goals. He reminded himself what <em>not</em> to do: Don’t lie. Don’t whine. Don’t be ruled by impulse. The Stoic path is constraint-oriented. It avoids the seduction of outcomes.</p><h3 id="the-career-of-the-constraint-seeker">The Career of the Constraint-Seeker</h3><p>One person sets a goal: become a best-selling author. Another imposes a constraint: write every day, but never write what bores me. The first may spend years pitching, networking, contorting themselves into marketable shapes. The second may accidentally build a following simply because the work sustains itself.</p><p>The historian Fernand Braudel once wrote that time flows on multiple levels: the rapid time of events, the slow time of structures, the almost imperceptible time of geography. Constraints operate on the second level - they shape how you move through the world over years and decades.

									<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">After 2+ years and a tremendous waste of energy and money, my firm Calm Company Fund resolved a lawsuit against us on very favorable terms.</p>
<p>What started as one of the most challenging periods of my life became an unexpected masterclass in using AI to level the playing field against well-funded opponents. If you’re an entrepreneur, especially one without a massive legal budget, this story contains lessons that could save your company.</p>
<h2>The Broken System: Why Defendants Always Lose</h2>
<p>The Delaware legal system is fundamentally broken for defendants. Due to the ironically labeled “American Rule,” even if you win, it’s extremely rare for the other side to have to cover your attorneys’ fees, much less compensate you for lost time and energy. The best case scenario is spending a small fortune to maintain the status quo of: not guilty of anything. By and large, the U.S. legal system seems to imbue people and companies with a strong right to file dumb lawsuits, even if they are mostly fabricated or based on incredibly weak claims.</p>
<p>And the legal costs to defend against a lawsuit all the way through trial can be enormous. $1 million is a reasonable expectation.</p>
<p><em>“But wait, if the lawsuit is truly dumb, won’t a judge just ‘throw it out’?“</em></p>
<p>This is the first question you get from anybody who has not actually had to interact with the U.S. legal system. And, yes, while there are two primary opportunities for a judge to throw out a case without it going to a jury trial, once you look at the basic details of each phase, you realize that they are pretty poor protection to defendants from the cost of a defense. Let’s look at the two of them.</p>
<p><strong>Motion to Dismiss: </strong>This is usually what folks who don’t have legal experience are thinking of when they think of a judge throwing out a dumb lawsuit. That somebody will file a lawsuit with basically no actual supporting facts or evidence or founded legal claims, and a studious judge will look it over and say this is BS and throw the case out. It happens relatively early on in the process. And it’s true that if you win a motion to dismiss, you will be able to wrap the case up quickly without too much cost. But here is the standard in Delaware for winning a motion to dismiss, and the standards are pretty similar in other U.S. jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>The court must <strong>accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true</strong>, draw <strong>all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor</strong>, and <strong>dismiss the complaint only if the plaintiff could not recover under any reasonably conceivable set of circumstances</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way, you basically have to accept almost all of the entire initial lawsuit as true, in particular, the facts being alleged as true. And then determine that even if all of this stuff was totally true, the case should still not proceed. This really only works if there are technical flaws in the lawsuit that render the entire thing invalid regardless of the truth of the matter. A classic example would be that this is a federal issue being filed in a state court, or vice versa, or that the statute of limitations has passed, or that the plaintiff does not actually have standing to bring this lawsuit even if what they say happened, happened. It cannot in any way look at the truth or falseness of the claims being made or at the real meaningful validity of the legal arguments being weighed. All of those have to simply be accepted as true, and otherwise you basically can’t win a motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you can’t win a motion to dismiss, you will essentially be forced to move to discovery and several other shorter phases of the trial. But discovery ends up being an incredibly time-consuming and expensive process where you’re forced to hand over all sorts of internal documents and communications and all sorts of things that could potentially be relevant to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>There can be plenty of fights over what does or does not get included there, and you also typically have to involve third-party vendors to ensure that it is happening appropriately. And all this stuff is incredibly expensive, potentially to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars that you are forced to do before you can make any further arguments that this case should be over.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Judgement: </strong>Once discovery is over, both sides would have an opportunity to file a motion for summary judgment. The motion for summary judgment is the first opportunity. Again, you have probably at this point already spent months or maybe up to a year of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars, and now this is your first opportunity to make a strong argument that the legal claims against you are so weak that they should be thrown out. Here is the standard for it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that <u>there is no genuine issue as to any material fact</u> and that <u>the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law</u>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Summary judgment is a two-part standard, and you have to win both parts in order to win summary judgment.</p>
<p>The first argument you need to make is that there are no genuine issues of material fact. So you essentially need to persuade the judge that the facts that they need to understand in order to rule on the case are known and not disputed between the two parties. You, in this case, can’t really make any fact-based arguments. If one party is alleging that somebody said something and the other party says, “Well, we didn’t say that,” that is a disputed fact. That’s the kind of thing that a jury trial will need to hear evidence and look at testimony and do all that to determine facts. So you need to argue that all the facts that you need are here and are undisputed. For example, if all the information is in contracts which we have the text of and emails that we have the text of, and certain things are not disputed between the two parties, then you have to establish that there is not any fact-based questions that need to be sorted out by a jury trial. And you then also need to win the idea that, based on these non-disputed facts, you should win as a matter of law. So you really can only be making arguments about the legal invalidity of the case against you, not about the truthiness of the case against you. This can be an incredibly high bar to clear because most cases are probably going to have some disputed facts. So even if you have an incredibly compelling case here, you probably will have a tough time winning summary judgment if there are any material facts that you know the parties are disputing. This is your second and potentially last time to have a judge throw the case out before it goes to a jury trial, and in both cases, the standard for the judge to throw it out is just incredibly high. The odds are very high that you’re going to continue having to go through the case process and continue spending a lot of money unless you come to a settlement.</p>
<p><strong>So here’s the asymmetric trap every defendant faces</strong>: Defending yourself all the way through trial will definitely be incredibly expensive, no matter how strong your case is. The chance of losing in a jury trial is always more than 0%, and even if you win, you will almost certainly not be able to recover your legal costs. So the Prisoner’s Dilemma most defendants face is: Do you want to pay us some amount for a 100% chance of making this go away now, or spend much more money with at least some chance of losing at trial? This is why ~98% of civil cases settle before trial.</p>
<p><strong>Founder Takeaway #1:</strong> Understanding this reality has profound implications for how you structure deals and contracts. The actual language of a contract almost doesn’t matter unless the underlying issue is worth $2-3 million or more. No matter how iron-clad your contract language, the other side can always raise enough doubt to force the matter to trial, and <em>it can cost $1 million+ to litigate through completion</em>.</p>
<p>This means contract disputes over smaller amounts mostly depend on leverage or a willingness to outspend the other side. Consider this in your future contract negotiations—you’re better off identifying risks and potential areas for dispute upfront than spending money having a lawyer “button up” language you can’t afford to enforce anyway.</p>
<p>I also now deeply understand why experienced business people have a strict “no assholes” policy. I always thought this was throwaway advice, but it only takes one lawsuit to make it clear how incredibly valuable it is to work with people you trust.</p>
<h2>Into the Litigation Black Hole</h2>
<p>Two years ago, I was sued for the first time. I’m going to leave out many of the specific facts and focus on what I learned about the process of dealing with litigation—the decisions I made and how I was feeling along the way.</p>
<p>This was uncharted territory for me. The first curveball: our primary counsel wasn’t based in Delaware, and when someone files a lawsuit in Delaware, you immediately need Delaware-barred lawyers to defend you. You’re suddenly scrambling for referrals to lawyers you’ve never worked with to help you with what is now the most important legal issue of your life. And you don’t have much time—litigation comes with tight response deadlines.</p>
<h3>Are They An Oncologist or General Contractor?</h3>
<p>When working with paid professionals, I think people tend to put them into one of two categories: doctors or general contractors.</p>
<p>With doctors, if your oncologist says you have a lump that needs to come out, you pretty much do whatever they say. You’re the patient; they’re the expert leading the charge.</p>
<p>With general contractors doing home renovations, most people intuitively know that’s not the right approach. You stay on top of them, give clear instructions, try to understand the issues yourself, and assume you need to provide lots of direction and monitoring to get what you want done.</p>
<p>Most people—entrepreneurs included, certainly myself—put lawyers in the doctor category when they should really treat them more like general contractors.</p>
<h3>The Delegation Trap</h3>
<p>When the lawsuit hit, I asked various people I trusted for their take. Almost across the board, the perspective was: “This is ridiculous. It doesn’t make any sense. I can’t even understand how there would be damages.”</p>
<p>So I made what seemed like a rational, delegating-CEO decision: don’t let this take up too much brain space. Give it to lawyers and let them handle it.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>This approach might be right if your business can comfortably spend $500K-$1M to defend a lawsuit. But if, like many entrepreneurs, you don’t have that kind of money, and the mounting costs will become a source of leverage against you, then you need to take it seriously and go “Founder Mode” on the legal process.</p>
<h3>The Expensive Treadmill of “Best Representation”</h3>
<p>When you tell lawyers “what do you think we should do,” they’re going to give you the “best representation” they can—because that’s what they’re incentivized to do. This means ticking every box, being as thorough as humanly possible, and taking everything the other side throws at them as seriously as possible.</p>
<p>This approach can cost you a fortune.</p>
<p>What lawyers typically won’t do is come up with creative ways for you to accumulate leverage against the other side to get them to back down. If you understand the dynamics I laid out earlier—that you’re essentially angling toward a settlement—this standard approach is exactly the opposite of what you should be doing.</p>
<p>You want to spend as little money as possible so costs don’t become leverage against you. And you want to find ways to make it clear that pursuing litigation against you isn’t in the other side’s best interest.</p>
<p>How exactly to create that leverage is more of a conversation over beers than a blog post topic. But this should be your primary focus—not perfectly playing the tit-for-tat game of legal proceedings that will mostly end up being irrelevant when two sides sit at a negotiating table.</p>
<h3>The Breaking Point</h3>
<p>I learned this the hard way. We spent a large portion of the initial proceedings allowing lawyers to follow the standard process, charging us $1,000/hour to check all the boxes and respond to every silly and pointless motion. The mounting legal bills became an accumulating source of leverage against us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these new lawyers weren’t presenting me with any viable options other than continuing to fire-hose money into an absurd litigation process. The current bills piled up and the prospective costs froze our ability to make nearly all strategic decisions—like hiring or raising new funds.</p>
<p>As I expressed my enormous frustration with this black hole of time, energy, and money, my partner gave me the pep talk I needed: she told me I needed to take control of the situation myself.</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<h2>How AI Became My Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>It was at this breaking point that I started using AI to review all contracts and filings, understand case law, and consider courses of action. I showed up to meetings with our lawyers with a strong point of view on where we should minimize costs and maximize our leverage. My general sense is that most lawyers are used to being totally deferred to by clients, and in this case, the new counsel we had started working with really did not like my new approach.</p>
<p>So, I fired them and got new lawyers.</p>
<p>It worked—but there’s no way I could have done it without LLMs getting good enough at exactly the moment I needed them.</p>
<h3>My AI Legal Research Workflow</h3>
<p>Here’s the specific process that saved my company:</p>
<p><strong>1: Upload Everything to AI Projects.</strong> Use the projects feature in Claude or ChatGPT to upload all relevant documents—contracts, motions, emails, anything relevant to your case. You might need to be selective if you hit context window limitations with thousands of pages, but include as much source material as possible.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth I didn’t necessarily find one platform (Claude or ChatGPT) or even specific models to be materially better than others at this work.</p>
<p><strong>2: Treat AI Like a Coach, Not an Oracle.</strong> Instead of asking “what do we do next,” I would ask the AI to explain the principles involved, the mechanics of what was happening in each motion, where we were in the process. I wanted to understand the controlling variables myself, not just get answers.</p>
<p>The AI is infinitely patient—you can drill down into anything you don’t understand and ask “explain that to me” or “how does that work?” This coaching approach was incredibly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Health Tip:</strong> Do this research using voice mode while walking. Legal research isn’t fun, but being outside in fresh air using your voice rather than staring at a screen makes it much more bearable.</p>
<p><strong>3: Leverage AI for Contract Analysis.</strong> AI excels at reviewing lengthy contracts. When you have a 400-page agreement where page 6 references “customary exceptions” that are finally listed on page 421, AI can instantly find and connect these references without you having to jump around through table of contents.</p>
<p>Always have the AI excerpt the actual contract language with page numbers, then verify by searching the document yourself. Don’t take the AI’s word for it—confirm everything.</p>
<p><strong>4: Have AI draft arguments and briefs. </strong>Writing from a blank page is always much more work than editing. I started showing up with outlines or drafts for our filings and briefs and asking my lawyers to discuss it with me and then edit them, rather than crafting everything completely from scratch. This is a huge time and money saver.</p>
<h3>Working with Lawyers in the AI Era</h3>
<p>I wasn’t totally upfront with even my new lawyers about using AI—I was worried about the “quoting WebMD at the doctor’s office” dynamic. Instead, I made it clear that I wanted to take an active role in strategic decisions.</p>
<p>This is tricky. Most lawyers are used to being delegated to completely. People treat the legal system like a complete mystery, with lawyers as spirit guides. If you’re going to take a more active role because you’re empowered by AI, you need to set that tone early.</p>
<p>Some lawyers bristle at clients setting strategic direction. They believe there’s a “correct way” to do things, they know it, and they’ll fight you if you disagree. In that case, get different lawyers. Ultimately I was able to find good counsel who were willing to work with me taking an active role.</p>
<h3>The Cost Arbitrage Advantage</h3>
<p>The US legal system is optimized for wealthy people and businesses to extract leverage against those with less money. As litigation proceeds, expensive steps just automatically trigger—filings, motions, discovery, disclosures. If you just show up and ask “we got sued, what do we do?” lawyers will walk you through the most expensive approach possible.</p>
<p>This creates a vicious cycle: if you’re ultimately going to settle (which 98% of cases do), it’s almost entirely about leverage and negotiation. The most effective leverage wealthier opponents have is simply bleeding you dry through expensive procedural steps.</p>
<p><strong>Founder Takeaway #2:</strong> You must proactively set budget constraints with your legal counsel. Be completely upfront: “Here’s where we think this is heading. We need to spend very little money so we don’t get bled dry and forced to accept a terrible settlement.”</p>
<p>When I radically reduced our legal costs using AI, it became a form of serious leverage. If the other party is spending 10x more than you, that creates negotiating power.</p>
<h3>Where AI Falls Short</h3>
<p>AI works best as a coach for your own primary research—don’t try to fully delegate legal strategy to it. The main limitations I encountered:</p>
<p><strong>Case Law Hallucinations:</strong> Earlier models definitely hallucinated case law that didn’t exist. Always double-check any case citations using open-source legal databases. This is getting better with newer models, but verify everything.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Decision-Making:</strong> Neither AI nor your lawyer can make the truly strategic decisions for you that you’ll need to get to a settlement. AI can help craft strong legal arguments, but you need to develop the overarching strategy yourself, balancing risks and negotiating position.</p>
<h2>The Psychological Toll and Unexpected Growth</h2>
<p>Going through protracted litigation is one of the most psychologically challenging experiences I’ve ever faced. As an entrepreneur, I’m used to hard things, but my saving grace has always been knowing I’m <em>choosing</em> the challenge. With litigation, you have <em>zero</em> choice—it soaks up enormous amounts of time, brain space, energy, and money for something you have less than zero interest in doing.</p>
<p>This forced me to develop practices of radical acceptance and get comfortable with circumstances I couldn’t change. The Untethered Soul was particularly helpful during this period. Ironically, I later learned it was written by a tech entrepreneur during his own multi-year litigation ordeal.</p>
<h2>Communicating Through Crisis</h2>
<p>Balancing transparency with stakeholders while managing legal constraints is incredibly difficult. Your counsel will advise against sharing anything that could end up in discovery, but litigation might be the most important thing affecting your business.</p>
<p><strong>For entrepreneurs in litigation:</strong> Be transparent, don’t sugarcoat, and ask for help. Your stakeholders want you to succeed and will offer advice or introductions if you ask.</p>
<p><strong>For investors/stakeholders:</strong> Give entrepreneurs in litigation enormous grace and patience. It’s incredibly difficult to strike the right balance between keeping you informed and following legal counsel’s advice.</p>
<h2>Your AI Legal Playbook: Three Actions to Take Today</h2>
<p>Before you’re in crisis mode, take these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set up your AI legal research system:</strong> Create projects in Claude or ChatGPT specifically for legal documents. Practice uploading contracts and asking the AI to explain key terms, potential risks, and ambiguous language.</li>
<li><strong>Audit your legal insurance using AI:</strong> Upload your business insurance policy and have AI analyze your coverage gaps for the most likely litigation scenarios in your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Establish your “no assholes” policy:</strong> Start assuming that you won’t necessarily be able to hide behind ironclad contracts if you’re working with people that you don’t trust, and really start to factor that in to who you decide to do business with. The cost of one bad actor can destroy years of progress.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>I’m convinced every entrepreneur should start using AI to take charge of legal issues now. Contracts are language, and Large Language Models are exceptionally good at reviewing and even creating them. Use actual lawyers more like strategic consultants rather than paying them to do all the laborious work of contract review or drafting.</p>
<p>This experience taught me that while the legal system is broken for defendants, AI can level the playing field for entrepreneurs who can’t afford to be outspent. The key is using it as a force multiplier for your own understanding and strategic thinking, not as a replacement for human judgment.</p>
<p>The most important lesson? Don’t let anyone—even expensive lawyers—convince you that legal strategy is too complex for you to understand and influence. With AI as your coach, you can take charge of your legal destiny and turn cost efficiency into competitive advantage.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                    <div><p><strong>As you probably know after all this time,</strong> Tedium is obsessed with the closing frame, the end of the story. And today, we learned that Apple is finally ending its 20-year run of Intel-based Macs.</p><p>That’s the bad news. The good news is that they gave the public one more year of new versions, along with the promise of potential security fixes, avoiding an uncomfortable rug-pull like <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/06/16/apple-powerpc-intel-transition-history/">the one that many PowerPC users experienced</a> with Snow Leopard in 2009. That OS came out a mere three years after the discontinuation of the last PowerPC Mac, and users had to figure out the cutoff was happening by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2008/06/11/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-drops-powerpc-support/">reading Apple rumor sites</a>.</p><p>While some Mac models did get short shrift (owners of the 2020 Intel MacBook Air have some angry skeets to write), for the most part, the company did not try to force this transition to happen faster than it needed to.</p>


<p><em>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwIUNbrjS9I">commercial</a> for the first Intel Mac, dating to 2006. If you’ve ever seen the video for The Postal Service’s “Such Great Heights” and think it looks very familiar, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/01/apple-vs-postal/">there’s a reason for that</a>.</em></p><p>It was as if the company wanted to bury the blow as much as possible, so it didn’t even mention it during the main WWDC keynote, which is the one that the average person cares about. It was instead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/51iONeETSng?t=3259s">buried nearly 55 minutes</a> into the 57-minute Platforms State of the Union, where Apple Senior Director of Developer Relations Matthew Firlik dropped the news like this:</p><blockquote><p>Metal 4 is a great example of the tight integration of our software with Apple silicon, creating a whole new class of experiences. In fact, since we began the transition to Apple silicon over five years ago, we’ve been able to add incredible features like Apple Intelligence, Game Mode, Presenter Overlay, and more.</p><p>We completed the transition to Apple silicon across our entire product lineup two years ago. So your apps can now depend on and build upon these features too. Apple silicon enables us all to achieve things that were previously unimaginable. And it’s time to put all of our focus and innovation there.</p><p>And so, macOS Tahoe will be the final release for Intel Macs. So if you’ve not done so already, now is a great time to help your users migrate to the Apple silicon versions of your apps.</p></blockquote><p>This sort of finality—a one-year pre-announcement from an official Apple source—is useful for any old users who have been holding off for whatever reason. But it’s also great for developers, who now have the OK to transition towards an upgrade if they haven’t already. And certainly, Apple’s ARM-based chips are some of the best processors ever made, based on their balance of speed and energy efficiency, which has made the M1 MacBook Air (nearly a 5-year-old machine!) perhaps the greatest goldilocks machine ever created.</p><p>But still, even with all that lead-up, this decision still stings, because it feels unnecessary to put all that good hardware to pasture. As I wrote back in April, <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/04/14/windows-10-forgotten-tech-users/">a similar decision to put an end of life on Windows 10</a> is ultimately unnecessary—and it would lead to a lot of good hardware ending up in landfills. That’s the downside, and one we should not ignore.</p></div><div><p>The upside of the Intel Mac going away is that users aren’t totally screwed. They still will likely see security updates for quite a while. And it is possible to install Linux on Intel Macs, though it’s more complicated on the newest Intel Macs because of the existence of the T2 security chip. (There’s actually a project, <a href="https://t2linux.org/">T2Linux</a>, that has largely solved this issue.) And plus, an old version of MacOS still has a lot of charm to it. With the right security posture it can still remain a very useful machine years down the line.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/WeQGG97jdHEGDnC5idGvbk0jSE8=/1000x751/filters:quality(80)/uploads/MacBook-Air-Stickers.jpg" width="1000" height="751" loading="lazy" alt="MacBook-Air-Stickers.jpg"><figcaption>Where are we going to put our hundreds of stickers now? (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/text-hfiym43qBpk">Mehmet Ali Peker/Unsplash</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the barrier of entry into the Mac market is perhaps at its most cost-effective point in quite some time. Currently, the Mac Mini M4, sporting 16 gigs of RAM and a 256-gigabyte SSD, sells on Apple’s website for $599 and is frequently discounted elsewhere. The original Mac Mini sold for $499 at launch with a mere 256 megabytes of RAM and a 40-gigabyte hard drive. With inflation, that PowerPC Mac Mini would cost the equivalent of $839 today. Put another way, the cheapest way into the Mac ecosystem is 30% cheaper than the cheapest option 20 years ago. Based on a quick analysis of pricing on Low End Mac, this is technically the cheapest that a new Mac Mini (and by extension, entry into the Mac ecosystem) has ever been, accounting for inflation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I’m still sad that we have some finality on the fate of the Intel Mac. As someone who spent a long time Hackintoshing back in the days before Apple Silicon reshaped the Mac landscape, I appreciated the freedom the Mac’s Intel compatibility allowed me. For a few great years, you could buy some random piece of junk and turn it into a Mac with a few hours of research and a few hours of work.</p><p>No, that was not the way Apple intended you to use it. But like lots of other things Apple didn’t intend you to do, it created a culture of sorts that I and others were happy to oblige in. To me, that culture was immensely valuable, even if it often felt at odds with what this company wanted me to do with their computers and operating systems.</p><p>These days, I’m mostly a Linux user. Sure, I still have an M1 MacBook Air, but I use it as a secondary machine on which I run Asahi Linux. But I think what Apple taught me, in my years of working around their limitations as a Hackintosh user, was that I wanted more flexibility in my computing experience, even if it means not having the most power-efficient processors. Over the years, Apple has only given it begrudgingly. The marquee feature of this year’s WWDC as an actual multitasking interface for iPadOS. But it was a decision Apple dragged its feet on for years, first slow-rolling mouse support, then split-screening, then the ability to manage files.</p><p>Apple gives flexibility begrudgingly. As <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/05/02/apple-app-store-decision-reaction/">its recent App Store saga</a> proved, it is a company that does not like bending.

<h2><a name="2025-06-09" href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/06/09">Monday, June 09, 2025</a></h2>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2025-06-09.1" href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/06/09.1">Implementing DOES&gt; in Forth, the entire reason I started this mess</a></h3>

<!-- Forth, ANS Forth, implementing Forth, DOES>, assembly, 6809 -->

<p><a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/06/02.1">The issue</a> I had with <code>DOES&gt;</code> isn't that it's hard to use—it's just that I had no idea how one would go about implementing it,
much like Javascript programmers use closures without having to think about how they're implemented
(even if they're aware of closures in the first place).
So,
before going into how it works,
a sample from <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/11-forth-compiler-defining-words/">Starting Forth</a> is in order.</p>

<pre title="Forth">: STAR 42 EMIT ;

: .ROW CR 8 0 DO
    DUP 128 AND IF STAR ELSE SPACE THEN 2*
  LOOP DROP ;

: SHAPE CREATE 8 0 DO C, LOOP
  DOES&gt; DUP 7 + DO I C@ .ROW -1 +LOOP CR ;

HEX 18 18 3C 5A 99 24 24 24 SHAPE MAN
</pre>


<p>These two words support the example.
The first word, <code>STAR</code> just prints a asterisk
(42 is the ASCII code for the word).
The second word,
<code>.ROW</code>,
takes an 8-bit value and for each bit,
if it's a 1,
prints an asterisk,
otherwise,
it prints a space.
<code>DO</code> <code>LOOP</code> is Forth's <code>for</code> loop by the way.
The next word,
<code>SHAPE</code> is the interesting one.
But first,
we need to discuss <code>CREATE</code>.</p>

<p>This word creates a new entry in the Forth dictionary by reading the next word
(defined as a collection of non-space letters)
in the input as the name.
It then gives the newly created word a default action of pushing the address of the body of the word into the stack.
Going ahead a bit,
the word <code>MAN</code> just after <code>CREATE</code> is run will look like this
(in assembly):</p>

<pre title="Assembly">man		fdb	shape	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'man'
.xt		fdb	forth_core_create.runtime
.body
</pre>


<p>When <code>MAN</code> is run,
the address of <code>.body</code> will be pushed onto the stack.
<code>CREATE</code> is typically used to create “smart data structures”—data structures that know how to do some action.</p>

<p>Now,
getting back to the example,
when <code>SHAPE</code> is run,
the first thing it does is call <code>CREATE</code> to create a new word,
then it compiles 8 values off the top of the stack into the body of the newly created word.
Just prior to <code>DOES&gt;</code>, 
<code>MAN</code> will look like:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">man		fdb	shape	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'man'
.xt		fdb	forth_core_create.runtime
.body		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$99
		fcb	$5A
		fcb	$3C
		fcb	$18
		fcb	$18
</pre>


<p>Now we get to <code>DOES&gt;</code>.
Due to the nature of what it does,
<code>DOES&gt;</code> is an immediate word—that is,
its executing during compilation to do the voodoo that it do.
Um, does.
Somehow,
it needs to modify the newly created word to not only push the address of its body onto the stack,
but execute the code that appears after itself.
So the code to be executed needs to be compiled and stored somewhere,
and somehow <code>MAN</code>
(in this example) needs to run this code.</p>

<p>And this was the problem I had with the word—<em>how does this all work?</em>
Even the well known <a href="http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=summary">JonesForth</a>,
implemented as an <abbr title="Indirect Threaded Code">ITC</abbr>,
<a href="http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob;f=jonesforth.f;h=5c1309574ae1165195a43250c19c822ab8681671;hb=HEAD#l1769">didn't bother with implementing <code>DOES&gt;</code></a>
(and now that I have implemented <code>DOES&gt;</code>,
I suspect I know why JonesForth didn't implement it).</p>

<p>The runtime portion of <code>CREATE</code> just pushes the address of the body of the word into the stack.
The data bytes following the <var>xt</var> have no meaning in and of themselves
(even as code it's nonsensical).
I did a search and found only <a href="https://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving3.htm">one page</a> that describes how to implement <code>DOES&gt;</code>,
but:</p>

<ol>
<li>it was part three of a series of articles describing how Forth's are implemented;</li>
<li>using terminology no longer used by the ANS Forth standard;</li>
<li>attempting to describe how to implement Forth on several different <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> architectures;</li>
<li>using a few different methods (like <abbr title="Indirect Threaded Code">ITC</abbr>, <abbr title="Direct Threaded Code">DTC</abbr> and <abbr title="Subroutine Threaded Code">STC</abbr>);</li>
<li>and on this page, a wierd side trip through another Forth word <code>;CODE</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It wasn't an exactly easy source to read,
but between part three and <a href="https://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving1.htm">part one</a>,
I was able to puzzle it out
(and it makes much more sense now that I've done it).
Now I can discribe the result using a single architecture
(6809) and a single implementation (<abbr title="Indirect Threaded Code">ITC</abbr>).
The trick here is to realize that <code>DOES&gt;</code> has a temporal aspect unlike any other Forth word.</p>

<p>Most immediate words in Forth have two temporal aspects—at the time of compilation,
and later at runtime.
For instance,
<code>IF</code>'s compile time aspect is to compile a conditional jump into the word,
and the runtime aspect is to do said conditional jump
(at least,
it does so in my implementation).
But <code>DOES&gt;</code> has <em>three</em> temporal aspects:</p>

<pre title="Forth">: SHAPE CREATE ...a DOES&gt; ( time 1 ) ...b ;
...c SHAPE MAN (time 2 )
MAN (time 3 )
</pre>


<p>At time 1,
we are compiling a word that creates other words
(so at this point, <code>CREATE</code> is compiled, not run).
The compiler looks up <code>DOES&gt;</code>, 
notices that it's an immediate word and executes it.
<code>DOES&gt;</code> at this point needs to include code to cause <code>SHAPE</code> to stop executing,
then somehow leave … something … behind for time 2,
and somehow compile the rest of the code <code>...b</code> for later execution.</p>

<p>At time 2,
we're defining a new word.
<code>CREATE</code> has been called and the initialization code for this new word <code>…a</code> has been executed.
At this point,
<code>DOES&gt;</code> needs to modify the new word … somehow … to execute the code that followed it at time 1.</p>

<p>And at time 3,
the word created is run and somehow,
it needs to know where the code to run is located.
But going back to what <code>CREATE</code> and the inialization code left us:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">man		fdb	shape	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'man'
.xt		fdb	forth_core_create.runtime
.body		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$99
		fcb	$5A
		fcb	$3C
		fcb	$18
		fcb	$18
</pre>


<p>What can be done?</p>

<p>The easy answer—<code>DOES&gt;</code> updates the <var>xt</var> of the newly created word at time 2.
Where is this <var>xt</var> created?
At time 1.
And when is it uses?
At time 3.</p>

<p>Here's what happens.</p>

<p><code>DOES&gt;</code> is an immediate word.
When it runs at time 1,
it compiles into the current word
(in this example, <code>SHAPE</code>)
the <var>xt</var> of its runtime.
So <code>SHAPE</code> will look like this:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">shape		fdb	dot_row	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'shape'
.xt		fdb	forth_core_colon.runtime
		fdb	forth_core_create.xt
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	8
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	0
		fdb	forth_core_do.runtime_xt
.L1		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	128
		fdb	forth_core_and.xt
		fdb	forth_core_if.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L2
		fdb	dot_row.xt
		fdb	forth_core_ext_again.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L3
.L2		fdb	forth_core_space.xt
.L3		fdb	forth_core_two_star.xt
		fdb	forth_core_loop.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L1
		fdb	forth_core_drop.xt
		fdb	forth_core_does.runtime_xt
</pre>


<p>(Note:  here you can see that literal numbers have the <code>LITERAL</code> runtime action,
that <code>IF</code> compiles to its runtime action.
There are two Forth words that pretty much do the same thing—<code>AHEAD</code> does an unconditional branch forward,
and <code>AGAIN</code> does an unconditional branch backwards;
they basically both do an unconditional branch,
so I picked one to handle both internally and I picked <code>AGAIN</code> for this.
More on this in a later post.)</p>

<p>To create the new <var>xt</var> that words created by <code>SHAPE</code> will use
(or any word that includes <code>DOES&gt;</code>)
it then lays out a single instruction,
<code>JSR forth_core_create.does_hook</code>
(more on this in a bit).
It then exits,
keeping the compiler “on” so the rest of the code that follows <code>DOES&gt;</code> gets compiled into the word
(<code>SHAPE</code> in this case).
This is all <code>DOES&gt;</code> does (man, that sounds weird) at time 1.
At the end,
<code>SHAPE</code> looks like:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">shape		fdb	dot_row	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'shape'
.xt		fdb	forth_core_colon.runtime
		fdb	forth_core_create.xt
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	8
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	0
		fdb	forth_core_do.runtime_xt
.L1		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	128
		fdb	forth_core_and.xt
		fdb	forth_core_if.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L2
		fdb	dot_row.xt
		fdb	forth_core_ext_again.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L3
.L2		fdb	forth_core_space.xt
.L3		fdb	forth_core_two_star.xt
		fdb	forth_core_loop.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L1
		fdb	forth_core_drop.xt
		fdb	forth_core_does.runtime_xt

.does		jsr	forth_core_create.does_hook	; !!!

		fdb	forth_core_dupe.xt
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	7
		fdb	forth_core_plus.xt
		fdb	forth_core_do.runtime_xt
.L4		fdb	forth_core_i.xt
		fdb	forth_core_c_fetch.xt
		fdb	dot_row.xt
		fdb	forth_core_literal.runtime_xt
		fdb	-1
		fdb	forth_core_ext_plus_loop.runtime_xt
		fdb	.L4
		fdb	forth_core_c_r.xt
		fdb	forth_core_exit.xt
</pre>


<p>Now we execute <code>SHAPE</code>.
Things go along until we get to <code>forth_core_does.runtime_xt</code>.
At this point,
the <code>Y</code> register is pointing to the <code>JSR forth_core_create.does_hook</code>
(see <a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/06/04.1">the previous installment for why this is</a>—but to recap:
the <code>Y</code> register is the Forth <abbr title="Instruction Pointer">IP</abbr>).
We get the <var>xt</var> of the newly created word
(and yes,
I had to modify <code>CREATE</code> to stash this for later use)
to replace the default <var>xt</var>.
At this point, <code>MAN</code> now looks like:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">man		fdb	shape	; link to next word
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	'man'
.xt		fdb	shape.does
.body		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$24
		fcb	$99
		fcb	$5A
		fcb	$3C
		fcb	$18
		fcb	$18
</pre>


<p>Then the <code>DOES&gt;</code> runtime basically does a Forth return,
ending the execution of <code>SHAPE</code>.
Thus ends the steps that happen at time 2.</p>

<p>When <code>MAN</code> executes,
it executes <code>JSR forth_core_create.does_hook</code>.
This is a small extension to forth_core_create that does the double duty of pushing the address of the body onto the stack,
and setting things up to run the Forth code compiled just after that instruction:</p>

<pre title="Assembly">forth_core_create
		fdb	forth_core_c_r
		fdb	.xt - .name
.name		fcc	"CREATE"
.xt		fdb	.body
.body		...		; not important right now

.does_hook	puls	d	; pull return address of the stack
		pshs	y	; push Forth IP onto return stack
		tfr	d,y	; point to DOES&gt; code
.runtime	leax	2,x	; get body from xt
		pshu	x	; push into the stack
		ldx	,y++	; NEXT
		jmp	[,x]
</pre>


<p>The <code>forth_core_create.does_hook</code> pulls the return address
(from the <code>JSR</code> instruction) from the stack—this contains the Forth code after <code>DOES&gt;</code> that needs to run.
We then push the existing <code>Y</code> register onto the stack,
then set <code>Y</code> to the Forth code to execute.
This leads right into <code>forth_core_create.runtime</code>,
which pushes the body of the word
(in this case, <code>MAN</code>)
onto the stack,
and then jumps into the code following the <code>DOES&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>And at the end of all this,
you get:</p>

<pre title="Forth">MAN
   **   
   **   
  ****  
 * ** * 
*  **  *
  *  *  
  *  *  
  *  *
 OK
</pre>


<p>I suspect the reason why JonesForth didn't implement <code>DOES&gt;</code> has to do with the direct subroutine call in the middle of a Forth word.
This only works if memory is both writable and exectuable,
and modern systems tend to disallow that.
There might be a way around this,
but I haven't yet bothered to figure it out.
I'm just happy to have figured it out as it is.</p>

                Last year, the city of Las Vegas reached a record 120 degrees during the peak of summer. The Clark County Coroner's Office found that heat was a factor in more than 500 deaths. Now, city, county and local advocates are planting thousands of trees to help bring down temperatures in the hottest neighborhoods. Trees can have a significant impact on mitigating heat.

                The lack of tree canopy in many of Las Vegas' neighborhoods is an important issue. Research has shown trees can lower the temperature in the area around them by at least 10 degrees. Temperatures can range significantly more depending on the surroundings, but even 10 degrees can make a big difference.

                Studies show heat disproportionately affects lower-income neighborhoods. This has a ripple effect, according to Ariel Choinard of the Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab. People in these neighborhoods end up paying more to cool their homes. And they may have to choose between keeping their home at a livable temperature and other necessities like food or medication.

   <p>In April, Choinard visited several urban heat island neighborhoods to demonstrate how the built environment can dramatically increase surface temperatures, and the significant difference trees can make. </p>   
   <p>A <a href="https://www.rtcsnv.com/projects-initiatives/projects/current-projects/southern-nevada-urban-heat-mapping-project-v2/" target="_blank">2022 heat mapping project</a> found that several areas, including East Las Vegas and North Las Vegas, can experience temperatures up to 11 degrees hotter than other parts of the region. Each of these neighborhoods is relatively poorer than other parts of Las Vegas.</p>

   <p>"Folks here have to work harder and longer to afford to cool their homes," Choinard said. "And we know that people make really tough trade-offs when it's superhot."</p>   <p>That can mean choosing between keeping their homes at a safe and comfortable temperature and paying for groceries, or limiting medication. </p>   <p>Choinard pointed out a mature tree providing plenty of shade in a neighborhood without many others.</p>   <p>"It's this tree that's doing really great work here," she said.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-71099">

                Many older neighborhoods and mobile home communities still have palm trees and cactuses, which provide a particular visual aesthetic but little shade.&nbsp;Local leaders are moving toward nonnative, drought-tolerant trees that can provide shade. Here, at the Desert Inn Estates, two palm trees stand high above a road with little other foliage.

   <h3>Planting 2,000 trees a year</h3>   <p>That's why the county, the city and nonprofits are all increasing efforts to plant more trees in the desert.</p>   <p>"Our 2050 goal is to plant 60,000 trees within the city of Las Vegas, and that breaks down to a little over 2,000 trees a year," said Brad Daseler, the city's urban forester.</p>   
   <p>Daseler is bringing in mostly nonnative plants that provide shade and are drought tolerant, like oak trees from northern Mexico and eucalyptus trees from Australia. </p>   <p>"Las Vegas is a pretty challenging environment for plant material in general because we do get so warm, but we also have the ability to freeze," Daseler said. "So finding trees that can survive in both of those climate extremes absolutely is a challenge."</p>   <p>And you can't just plant any tree in any place, Daseler says. There's nuance and strategy to what kind of trees are chosen for what areas.</p>   <p>Walking through the city tree nursery, he pointed out a young bur oak.</p>   <p>"Those would be trees that we would use more in our park spaces," he said. Other trees, like the Indian rosewood, can better withstand the harshness of being planted in a median, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, with a "high heat load."</p>   <p>The region is currently <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/" target="_blank">in a drought</a> that the U.S. Drought Monitor has classified as "exceptional" — its severest category.</p>   <p>So there's a delicate balancing act, Daseler said, in maximizing both trees and water. </p>   <p>That's a constant challenge in the desert, says Choinard.</p>   <p>"There's always that question of, what is the highest use of a gallon of water?" she said. "But when we're talking about the long-term viability of our communities, I think a tree is a great thing to put water on."</p>   <div id="resg-s1-71135">

                Planting trees for their specific environment is an important piece of the puzzle, according to Brad Daseler. For example, he might choose to plant a tree with a smaller profile to fit a narrower patch of sidewalk or a backyard garden, versus a city park. Here, Daseler points out tree pots with a textured felt lining that helps keep roots from binding up. "There's a lot of nuance to planting trees," Daseler says.

    <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/why-agents-are-bad-pair-programmers/">
      
    </a>

    <p>LLM agents make bad pairs because <strong>they code faster than humans think</strong>.</p>
<p>I'll admit, I've had a lot of fun <a href="https://justin.searls.co/tubes/2025-04-19-17h46m37s/">using GitHub Copilot's agent mode in VS Code</a> this month. It's invigorating to watch it effortlessly write a working method on the first try. It's a relief when the agent unblocks me by reaching for a framework API I didn't even know existed. It's motivating to pair with someone even more tirelessly committed to my goal than I am.</p>
<p>In fact, pairing with top LLMs evokes many memories of pairing with top human programmers.</p>
<p><em>The worst memories.</em></p>
<p>Memories of my pair grabbing the keyboard and—in total and unhelpful silence—hammering out code faster than I could ever hope to read it. Memories of slowly, inevitably becoming disengaged after expending all my mental energy in a futile attempt to keep up. Memories of my pair hitting a roadblock and finally looking to me for help, only to catch me off guard and without a clue as to what had been going on in the preceding minutes, hours, or days. Memories of gradually realizing my pair had been building the <em>wrong thing all along</em> and then suddenly realizing the task now fell to me to remediate a boatload of incidental complexity in order to hit a deadline.</p>
<p>So yes, pairing with an AI agent can be uncannily similar to pairing with an expert programmer.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward">
    <a href="#the-path-forward">The path forward</a>
</h2>
<p>What should we do instead? Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same thing I did with human pair programmers who wanted to take the ball and run with it: I let them have it. In a perfect world, pairing might lead to a better solution, but there's no point in forcing it when both parties aren't bought in. Instead, I'd break the work down into discrete sub-components for my colleague to build independently. I would then review those pieces as pull requests. Translating that advice to LLM-based tools: <strong>give up on editor-based agentic pairing in favor of asynchronous workflows like GitHub's new <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/">Coding Agent</a></strong>, whose work you can <em>also</em> review via pull request</li>
<li>Continue to practice pair-programming with your editor, but <strong>throttle down from the semi-autonomous "Agent" mode to the turn-based "Edit" or "Ask" modes</strong>. You'll go slower, and <em>that's the point</em>. Also, just like pairing with humans, try to establish a rigorously consistent workflow as opposed to only reaching for AI to troubleshoot. I've found that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#PingPong">ping-pong pairing</a> with an AI in Edit mode (where the LLM can propose individual edits but you must manually accept them) strikes the best balance between accelerated productivity and continuous quality control</li>
</ol>
<p>Give people a few more months with agents and I think (hope) others will arrive at similar conclusions about their suitability as pair programmers. My advice to the AI tool-makers would be to introduce features to make pairing with an AI agent more qualitatively similar to pairing with a human. Agentic pair programmers are not inherently bad, but their lightning-fast speed has the unintended consequence of undercutting any opportunity for collaborating with us mere mortals. If an agent were designed to type at a slower pace, pause and discuss periodically, and frankly expect more of us as equal partners, that could make for a hell of a product offering.</p>
<p>Just imagining it now, any of these features would make agent-based pairing much more effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let users set how many lines-per-minute of code—or words-per-minute of prose—the agent outputs</li>
<li>Allow users to pause the agent to ask a clarifying question or push back on its direction without derailing the entire activity or train of thought</li>
<li>Expand beyond the chat metaphor by adding UI primitives that mirror the work to be done. Enable users to pin the current working session to a particular GitHub issue. Integrate a built-in to-do list to tick off before the feature is complete. That sort of thing</li>
<li>Design agents to act with less self-confidence and more self-doubt. They should frequently stop to converse: validate <em>why</em> we're building this, solicit advice on the best approach, and express concern when we're going in the wrong direction</li>
<li>Introduce advanced voice chat to better emulate human-to-human pairing, which would allow the user both to keep their eyes on the code (instead of darting back and forth between an editor and a chat sidebar) and to light up the parts of the brain that find mouth-words more engaging than text</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that's how I see it from where I'm sitting the morning of Friday, May 30th, 2025. Who knows where these tools will be in a week or month or year, but I'm fairly confident you could find worse advice on meeting this moment.</p>

            More than 700 Marines based out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in California have been mobilized to respond to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/politics/trump-national-guard-los-angeles-hegseth">the protests in Los Angeles</a>, and the troops will join the thousands of National Guard members who were activated by President Donald Trump over the weekend without the consent of California’s governor or LA’s mayor.

            The deployment of the full Marine battalion marks a significant escalation in Trump’s use of the military as a show of force against protesters, but it is still unclear what their specific task will be once in LA, sources told CNN. Like the National Guard troops, they are prohibited from conducting law enforcement activity such as making arrests unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which permits the president to use the military to end an insurrection or rebellion of federal power.

            The Marines being activated are with 2nd battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine division, according to US Northern Command.

            Approximately 1,700 National Guard members are now operating in the greater Los Angeles area, two days after Trump’s Saturday memorandum deploying 2,000 service members, according to a statement from NORTHCOM. On Monday evening, the Pentagon announced that Trump ordered the deployment of an additional batch of 2,000 more National Guard members. It is unclear when the rest of the initial group, or the new troops announced Monday, would arrive in Los Angeles.

            The Marines are expected to bolster some of the guard members who have been deployed to LA in the last two days, this person said.

            And while the person familiar stressed that the Marines were being deployed only to augment the forces already there, the image of US Marines mobilizing inside the United States will stand in contrast to National Guardsmen who more routinely respond to domestic issues. While some Marines have been assisting in border security at the southern border, one US official said Marines have not been mobilized within the US like they are in California now since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

            While the Marines’ tasks have not been specified publicly, they could include assignments like crowd control or establishing perimeter security. Lawyers within the Defense Department are also still finalizing language around the use-of-force guidelines for the troops being mobilized, but the person familiar said it will likely mirror the military’s standing rules of the use of force.

The band played gospel music, seemingly a far cry from the funk and psychedelia he would later become known for, but Sly and the Family Stone would become known for its blending of music styles.</p><p>Sly Stone would answer simply when writing in his 2023 memoir, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," about how he wanted to be remembered: "Music, just music."</p><p>"I don't want to get in people's way and I don't want them to get in my way. I just want to play my songs," he said. "I would do it for nothing."</p><p>He was born in Texas in 1943, the second oldest of five children, but his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when he was young. He got a job as a disc jockey in the early '60s and played everything from British rock to soul music.</p><p>Sly and the Family Stone formed in 1966 as a combination of Sly and his brother Freddie's individual bands. Sister Rose also joined the group. Loretta chose not to pursue music while younger sister Vaetta performed in her own band, Little Sister, and would join Sly and the Family Stone for occasional gigs.</p><p>While Sly was predominantly a guitarist when the band formed, he allowed Freddie to take that role in the new group and mostly played keyboard. However, he was, by many accounts, a musical prodigy. He learned to play guitar, keyboard, bass and the drums as a child.</p><p>The Family Stone was the first major American rock band to be racially integrated.</p><p>Sly and the Family Stone released its first album in October 1967, "A Whole New Thing," but it received only limited attention. Just a month later, the band would be launched into the stratosphere when it released the single "Dance to the Music."</p><p>"Dance to the Music" peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.</p><p>"I knew the music worked, but I didn’t know if people would get it," Stone <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/06/i-never-lived-a-life-i-didnt-want-to-live-sly-stone-on-addiction-ageing-and-changing-music-for-ever" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a> in 2023 in a rare interview during the later years of his life. “That’s what happened after the first album -- I poured everything into those songs.

Everything that was modern music, Sly pretty much built the blueprint.</p><p>At the height of the band's fame, the members took the stage at the original Woodstock in August 1969. The band went on stage at 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, just after Janis Joplin and just before The Who. The group ripped through an electric medley of hits including "Everyday People," "Dance To The Music," "Music Lover" and "I Want To Take You Higher."</p><p>However, it was not long after that the band devolved into drugs, finger-pointing and missed shows. Sly himself admitted in his memoir that he became dependent on cocaine and PCP. The band released several unheralded albums in the '70s but never reached the height of 1969 again. It was the same for Sly's solo career, which included several albums in the late '70s and early '80s, usually still under the Family Stone name.</p><p>"When you get success, why do you feel guilty about it? And why do we sabotage it?" Questlove told "GMA." "Even though he invented the alphabet for which we write many of the books, the culture doesn't know. They know him for not showing up for shows, being late, being an addict."</p><p>"Instead of saying, 'He became an addict,' we wanted to focus more on what events in life make you go there," Questlove added, about the documentary.</p><div data-testid="prism-inline-image"><figure data-testid="prism-figure"><div data-testid="prism-ratio-frame"><picture data-testid="prism-picture"><source media="(max-width: 414px)" srcset="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=375, https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=750 2x"><source media="(min-width: 415px)" srcset="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=750, https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=1500 2x"><img alt="" data-testid="prism-image" draggable="false" loading="lazy" src="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg"></picture></div><figcaption><div data-testid="prism-caption"><p><span data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span>Sylvester "Sly" Stewart and his bride Kathy Silva, right, are congratulated during their wedding ceremony at a rock concert by Sly and the Family Stone at New York's Madison Square Garden on June 6, 1974.</span></span></span></p><p><span>Richard Drew/AP, FILE</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>Sly took the stage for a live performance at the 2006 Grammys, his first in decades, and made occasional appearances in the ensuing years.

                                        <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks.</p><p>Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p><p>Kennedy, who was one of the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation’s top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta.</p><p>Although it’s typically not viewed as a partisan board, the Biden administration had installed the entire committee.</p><p>“Without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028,” Kennedy wrote in <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Wall Street Journal opinion piece</a></span>. “A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science. ”</p>
    
<p>Kennedy said the committee members had too many conflicts of interest. Currently, committee members are required to declare any potential such conflicts, as well as business interests, that arise during their tenure. They also must disclose any possible conflicts at the start of each public meeting.</p>



<p>Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Kennedy’s actions were based on false conflict-of-interest claims and set “a dangerous and unprecedented action that makes our families less safe” by potentially reducing vaccine access for millions of people.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“Make no mistake: Politicizing the ACIP as Secretary Kennedy is doing will undermine public trust under the guise of improving it,” he said in a statement. “We’ll look back at this as a grave mistake that sacrificed decades of scientific rigor, undermined public trust, and opened the door for fringe theories rather than facts.”</p>
    
<p>Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, called Kennedy’s mass ouster “a coup.” </p><p>“It’s not how democracies work. It’s not good for the health of the nation,” Benjamin told The Associated Press. </p><p>Benjamin said the move raises real concerns about whether future committee members will be viewed as impartial. He added that Kennedy is going against what he told lawmakers and the public, and the public health association plans to watch Kennedy “like a hawk.”</p><p>“He is breaking a promise,” Benjamin said. “He said he wasn’t going to do this.”</p><p>Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, called the committee a trusted source of science- and data-driven advice and said Kennedy’s move, coupled with declining vaccination rates across the country, will help drive an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><p>“Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” Scott said in a statement.</p><p>Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor who had expressed reservations about Kennedy’s nomination but voted to install him as the nation’s health secretary nonetheless, said he had spoken with Kennedy moments after the announcement.</p>
    
<p>“Of course, now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion,” Cassidy said in a social media post. “I’ve just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I’ll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case.”</p><p>The committee had been in a state of flux since Kennedy took over.

<p>
Be sure to read the comment from Alan Kay at the bottom of the article!
</p>

<p>We succeeded in running the Smalltalk-76 language on our vintage Xerox Alto;
this blog post gives a quick overview of the Smalltalk environment.
One unusual feature of Smalltalk is you can view and modify the system's code while the system is running. I demonstrate this by modifying the scrollbar code on a running system.</p>
<p>Smalltalk is a highly-influential programming language and environment that introduced the term "object-oriented programming" and was the ancestor of modern object-oriented languages.<span id="fnref:developers"><a href="#fn:developers" rel="footnote">1</a></span>
The Alto's Smalltalk environment is also notable for its creation of the graphical user interface with the desktop metaphor, icons, scrollbars, overlapping windows, popup menus and so forth. When Steve Jobs famously visited Xerox PARC, the Smalltalk GUI inspired him on how the Lisa and Macintosh should work.<span id="fnref:jobs"><a href="#fn:jobs" rel="footnote">2</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjiaiieOZ5hcbD6b5hFxFalQq7wzUlt3L2mUFVacMH7-rW38iX1QMyH5Y0pPyX7g6Etjpe6kPTdGqP2rL30OzSZiq3IHrlDA6gXxTJTlugso0Tz0vjhVhFKZ7KezPEvYuup-8PjCraXVv2E/w9999/alto-running-smalltalk.jpg"><img alt="Our Xerox Alto running Smalltalk-76." height="396" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjiaiieOZ5hcbD6b5hFxFalQq7wzUlt3L2mUFVacMH7-rW38iX1QMyH5Y0pPyX7g6Etjpe6kPTdGqP2rL30OzSZiq3IHrlDA6gXxTJTlugso0Tz0vjhVhFKZ7KezPEvYuup-8PjCraXVv2E/w300/alto-running-smalltalk.jpg" title="Our Xerox Alto running Smalltalk-76." width="300"></a></p><p>Our Xerox Alto running Smalltalk-76.</p>
<p>The Alto was a revolutionary computer designed at Xerox PARC in 1973
to investigate personal computing. It introduced the GUI, high-resolution bitmapped displays, WYSIWYG editors, Ethernet, the optical mouse and laser printers to the world, among other things.
I've been restoring an Alto from YCombinator, along with 
Marc Verdiell,
<a href="https://rescue1130.blogspot.com/">Carl Claunch</a>
My full set of Alto posts is <a href="https://www.righto.com/search/label/alto">here</a> and Marc's extensive videos of the restoration are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mverdiell/videos">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The desktop</h2>
<p>Smalltalk introduced the desktop metaphor used in modern computing.<span id="fnref:moad"><a href="#fn:moad" rel="footnote">3</a></span>
It included overlapping windows<span id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="footnote">4</a></span>, multiple desktops and pop-up menus.
These windows could be moved and resized with the mouse.
(The biggest missing desktop feature was desktop icons, which Xerox later introduced in the Star computer.)
To understand how revolutionary this was, consider that
the Apple 1 microcomputer came out in 1976,
displaying 24 lines of 40 uppercase characters. 
The mainframe and minicomputer worlds were focused around punched cards, line printers, Teletypes, and dumb CRT terminals.
Alan Kay changed all this with his vision of a computer desktop with windows that could be directly manipulated, windows containing fancy typography or images.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRl2yzWbUSCV9oBXcSczsqhHOAOg2EHludOFMaJK-PJ6LnbjtmjEMQJCaR7tclymMSQ4JaPqLuxXcYtsGYJ7HDgQX-x34QqwnHUzORJ4yKn5t1t4c3jOvphsphEkc_DgBNY8yViZx4xqK1/w9999/smalltalk-desktop.jpg"><img alt="Smalltalk introduced the desktop environment, with overlapping windows for multiple applications." height="664" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRl2yzWbUSCV9oBXcSczsqhHOAOg2EHludOFMaJK-PJ6LnbjtmjEMQJCaR7tclymMSQ4JaPqLuxXcYtsGYJ7HDgQX-x34QqwnHUzORJ4yKn5t1t4c3jOvphsphEkc_DgBNY8yViZx4xqK1/w606/smalltalk-desktop.jpg" title="Smalltalk introduced the desktop environment, with overlapping windows for multiple applications." width="606"></a></p><p>Smalltalk introduced the desktop environment, with overlapping windows for multiple applications.</p>
<p>The screenshot above shows the Smalltalk-76 desktop. At the bottom, a drawing program displays the Smalltalk elf image.<span id="fnref:elf"><a href="#fn:elf" rel="footnote">5</a></span>
Icons allow selection of drawing mode, line style, brush color (grayscale), and so forth.
The Smalltalk class browser is in the middle.
In the upper right is a file viewer. Finally, in the upper left is a window for entering Smalltalk statements, essentially a shell or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>.</p>
<h2>Dynamically changing the running system</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things about the Smalltalk environment is that all the Smalltalk code can be examined and modified, even while the system is running.
The class browser below lets you select (using the mouse) a functional area such as "Basic Data Structures" or "Files". You can then select a class in that area,
functionality within the class, and then a particular method. The browser then displays the code running on the system.
All the Smalltalk code can be examined in this way, making the system's implementation very transparent.</p>

<p>In the screenshot above, I use the class browser to access "Panes and Menus", then "ScrollBar", then "Image" and finally "show". This displays the code for the scrollbar's "show" method, which draws the scrollbar.
This code draws a black rectangle, and then insets a white rectangle, resulting in a black-bordered rectangle for the scrollbar.
(Note the unusual dotted-circle character ☉ that Smalltalk-76 uses to create a <code>Point</code> from two <code>Number</code>s.)</p>
<p>The unusual feature of the class browser is that you can use it to change the system's code, while the system is running, and everything will pick up the new code.
For example, I can change how scrollbars are drawn.
In the screenshot below, I changed <code>clear: white</code> to <code>clear: black</code>.
Pressing the middle mouse button pops up a menu, and I can select "compile".
This causes the scrollbar code to be recompiled—while the system is still running.
(Note the modern appearance of the contextual pop-up menu.)</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzPMVBl4uZvz2nBSUfaH96ddsPOyZBLEo_AcAIY_NhsQrKAXXDIE1JEQxytC0xU4-EZzFongjdP7nDh4-vrZ3eRb74Neshn_uXLn07QyLcH0reZUC1npzBldS3M9t6uvM-p0qBVvQJjD2p/w9999/scrollbar2.jpg"><img alt="After changing the code, I selected &quot;compile&quot; from the pop-up menu." height="179" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzPMVBl4uZvz2nBSUfaH96ddsPOyZBLEo_AcAIY_NhsQrKAXXDIE1JEQxytC0xU4-EZzFongjdP7nDh4-vrZ3eRb74Neshn_uXLn07QyLcH0reZUC1npzBldS3M9t6uvM-p0qBVvQJjD2p/w600/scrollbar2.jpg" title="After changing the code, I selected &quot;compile&quot; from the pop-up menu." width="600"></a></p><p>After changing the code, I selected "compile" from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>The result of this change is that all scrollbars (for existing or new windows) will now have a black background, as you can see below.
The key point is this change was made while the system was running; there is no need to restart anything.
Even existing windows get the new scrollbars. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaAiKZjCG2swjZQWzPTA5N-9jkwwV56UlMyq3f54CzGogHXcMDs9d9xU3dDGfW5mmo8obCTm4rXV3f8O0esUirOisf3nQDVPS7PMEGBtB2EIrE4J-ZzCHfBdsxZ7m_qJLneAtTb_hZUQKT/w9999/scrollbar3.jpg"><img alt="Scrollbars now appear with a black background, even for existing windows." height="322" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaAiKZjCG2swjZQWzPTA5N-9jkwwV56UlMyq3f54CzGogHXcMDs9d9xU3dDGfW5mmo8obCTm4rXV3f8O0esUirOisf3nQDVPS7PMEGBtB2EIrE4J-ZzCHfBdsxZ7m_qJLneAtTb_hZUQKT/w600/scrollbar3.jpg" title="Scrollbars now appear with a black background, even for existing windows." width="600"></a></p><p>Scrollbars now appear with a black background, even for existing windows.</p>
<p>Although this scrollbar change was rather trivial, major changes can be made to the running Smalltalk system.
One well-known story of changing Smalltalk's behavior on the fly is from Steve Jobs' visit to Xerox PARC. Steve Jobs didn't like the way the window scrolled line-by-line, so Smalltalk implementer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ingalls">Dan Ingalls</a> rewrote the scrolling code in a minute and implemented smooth scrolling while the system was running, much to Jobs' surprise.<span id="fnref:scrolling"><a href="#fn:scrolling" rel="footnote">6</a></span></p>
<h2>A closer look at some Smalltalk code</h2>
<p>In Smalltalk, even most of the math functions are written in Smalltalk.
For instance, suppose we wonder how square roots are computed.
We can look at the square root function in the class browser by going to "Numbers", "Float", "Math functions", "sqrt".
This brings up the seven lines of code below for the square root function.
We can see that the code uses five iterations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#Square_root_of_a_number">Newton's method</a> to approximate the square root.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbl8qMpL8AYmoAaNQN5OUfbj3XvMxqSDrDIy0oUAoZDMqeUo3YjSI_Aihs0P9hwLPoGTwa9UdS868OPepsWNF4VYsHAFJKtVTYgKJ8wKk5aU2BhLOpLm-0jYJL6lqdcb5Ao1IC_n-Uj75Q/w9999/sqrt.jpg"><img alt="Looking at the square root code in the Smalltalk-76 class browser." height="91" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbl8qMpL8AYmoAaNQN5OUfbj3XvMxqSDrDIy0oUAoZDMqeUo3YjSI_Aihs0P9hwLPoGTwa9UdS868OPepsWNF4VYsHAFJKtVTYgKJ8wKk5aU2BhLOpLm-0jYJL6lqdcb5Ao1IC_n-Uj75Q/w508/sqrt.jpg" title="Looking at the square root code in the Smalltalk-76 class browser." width="508"></a></p><p>Looking at the square root code in the Smalltalk-76 class browser.</p>
<p>If you're used to Java or C++, this object-oriented code may look strange, especially since Smalltalk uses some strange characters.
The first line of code above defines local variables <code>guess</code> and <code>i</code>.
In the next line, the right arrow ⇒ implements an "if" statement.
If the number receiving the square root message (<code>self</code>) is 0, then 0 is returned (via the up arrow ⇑ return symbol) and if it is negative an exception is raised.
The square brackets define blocks, similar to curly braces in C.
The <code>instfield</code> line is a bit tricky; it pulls the exponent out of the floating point number and divides it by 2, yielding a reasonable starting point for the square root.
Finally, the <code>for</code> loop applies Newton's method 5 times and returns the result. Note the unusual double colon symbol ⦂; this delays evaluation of the argument, so it can be evaluated multiple times in the loop.<span id="fnref:moreinfo"><a href="#fn:moreinfo" rel="footnote">7</a></span></p>
<p>You might think that executing Smalltalk code for math operations would be very slow, and that is the case.
The good news is that basic operations such as addition are implemented with short cuts, rather than full message passing. But other operations are slow; the team described performance as between "majestic" and "glacial".
Xerox PARC ended up creating the Dorado, a much faster minicomputer than the Alto, to improve performance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although Smalltalk wasn't the first object-oriented programming language, Smalltalk introduced the term <i>object-oriented programming</i> and was very influential in later object-oriented programming languages.
Most modern object-oriented languages, from Objective-C and Go to Java and Python, show the influence of Smalltalk.
Smalltalk was also responsible for design patterns. The famous "Gang of Four" <a href="http://amzn.to/2xHGTzL">Design Patterns book</a> 
describes design patterns in Smalltalk and C++.<span id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java" rel="footnote">8</a></span></p>
<p>Smalltalk systems are still in use.
Smalltalk-76 (and the earlier 71 and 72 versions) were intended for research, but
Xerox released the Smalltalk-80 version; it was licensed by Xerox to HP, Apple, Tektronix and DEC for royalty-free distribution.
Smalltalk-80 in turn led to modern Smalltalk systems such as
<a href="http://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, <a href="http://smalltalk.gnu.org/">GNU Smalltalk</a> and <a href="http://squeak.org/">Squeak</a> (which led to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> language for children).</p>
<p>If you want to try Alto Smalltalk out for yourself, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/livingcomputermuseum/ContrAlto">Contralto emulator</a>, built by the Living Computers Museum. I explain how to run it <a href="https://www.righto.com/2016/10/simulating-xerox-alto-with-contralto.html">here</a>.
(Most of the screenshots above are from Contralto rather than the live Alto, for clearer images.)
Be warned, however, that Smalltalk on the Alto (live or emulated) is painfully slow.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-94dad4">The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.</p><p id="anchor-0b6167">Kennedy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?mod=opinion_lead_pos5" target="_blank">announced the change</a> in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the “committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.”</p><p id="anchor-52d895">Such a claim is "deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process," said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. "We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world." </p><p id="anchor-45e6b9">"This is manufactured chaos," O'Leary said. </p><p id="anchor-c9666c">The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts — including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians — who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed. </p><p id="anchor-81ca1b">The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so, but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations.  </p><p id="anchor-6dff9b">Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before being appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which a conflict exists. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html" target="_blank">released a database</a> in March of some members’ previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry is relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.</p><p id="anchor-fe8663">“To claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,” said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution.</p><p id="anchor-0f0ca7">Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy’s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy.<strong> </strong>Kennedy rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, and has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since aligning himself with President Donald Trump and becoming head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" target="_blank">vaccine distribution to children of lower income families</a>.</p><p id="anchor-414673">Kennedy’s decision to fire ACIP members “should erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,” Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday’s action will “make it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,” since they rely on ACIP’s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.</p><p id="anchor-6e1216">In his editorial, Kennedy called for a “clean sweep” of the ACIP, but did not say who he planned to appoint to the now-vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" target="_blank">in a press release</a> that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.</p><p id="anchor-af5b9b">“What I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration’s agenda,” said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University’s School of Public Health.</p><p id="anchor-d84794">Motta said firing ACIP members is “an unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise” that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank">said in February</a> that Kennedy had promised to maintain the ACIP “without changes.”</p><p id="anchor-092c25">Kennedy's shake up of the vaccine committee comes as the U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932" target="_blank">including measles</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/whooping-cough-pertussis-tdap-vaccination-outbreak-eb8f4776fdd0796ad789aac1ccdc9b67" target="_blank">whooping cough</a>. Since last fall, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-22.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_6-mortality-surveillance" target="_blank">241 mostly unvaccinated children have died of flu-related illnesses</a>, the highest number for a non-pandemic season since 2004.</p><p id="anchor-10c7a5">Members of the ACIP are appointed to four-year terms, and many were slated to serve on the committee for another three years. Kennedy wrote Monday that “without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.”</p><p id="anchor-68b2e5">The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.</p><p id="anchor-898c4d">“The clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,” said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. “Insurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.” </p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089">Aria Bendix</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/ariabendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:aria.bendix@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391">Brandy Zadrozny</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/brandyzadrozny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:brandy.zadrozny@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

<p dir="auto">The Containerization package allows applications to use Linux containers.
Containerization is written in <a href="https://www.swift.org/" rel="nofollow">Swift</a> and uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization" rel="nofollow">Virtualization.framework</a> on Apple silicon.</p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization provides APIs to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Manage OCI images.</li>
<li>Interact with remote registries.</li>
<li>Create and populate ext4 file systems.</li>
<li>Interact with the Netlink socket family.</li>
<li>Create an optimized Linux kernel for fast boot times.</li>
<li>Spawn lightweight virtual machines.</li>
<li>Manage the runtime environment of virtual machines.</li>
<li>Spawn and interact with containerized processes.</li>
<li>Use Rosetta 2 for executing x86_64 processes on Apple silicon.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please view the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main">API documentation</a> for information on the Swift packages that Containerization provides.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization executes each Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">Linux kernel configuration</a> and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/vminitd">vminitd</a> is a small init system, which is a subproject within Containerization.
<code>vminitd</code> is spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and provides a GRPC API over vsock.
The API allows the runtime environment to be configured and containerized processes to be launched.
<code>vminitd</code> provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process is ran.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You need an Apple silicon Mac to build and run Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build the Containerization package, your system needs either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>macOS 15 or newer and Xcode 26 Beta</li>
<li>macOS 26 Beta 1 or newer</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Applications built using the package will run on macOS 15 or later, but the following features are not available on macOS 15:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Non-isolated container networking - with macOS 15, containers on the same vmnet network cannot communicate with each other</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">A Linux kernel is required for spawning lightweight virtual machines on macOS.
Containerization provides an optimized kernel configuration located in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">kernel</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">This directory includes a containerized build environment to easily compile a kernel for use with Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">The kernel configuration is a minimal set of features to support fast start times and a light weight environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this configuration will work for the majority of workloads we understand that some will need extra features.
To solve this Containerization provides first class APIs to use different kernel configurations and versions on a per container basis.
This enables containers to be developed and validated across different kernel versions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8540">
	
	<div>
		
<p>Matthew Garrett has a <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">nice post</a> about Twitter (uh, X)’s new end-to-end encryption messaging protocol, which is now called XChat. The TL;DR of Matthew’s post is that from a cryptographic perspective, XChat isn’t great. The details are all contained within Matthew’s post, but here’s a quick TL;DR:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>There’s no forward secrecy.</strong> Unlike Signal protocol, which uses a <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">double-ratchet</a> to continuously update the user’s secret keys, the XChat cryptography just encrypts each message under a recipient’s long-term public key. The actual encryption mechanism is based on an encryption scheme from <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">libsodium</a>.</li>



<li><strong>User private keys are stored at X. </strong>XChat stores user <em>private key</em>s at its own servers. To obtain your private keys, you first log into X’s key-storage system using a password such as PIN. This is needed to support stateless clients like web browsers, and in fairness it’s not dissimilar to what Meta has done with its encryption for <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">Facebook Messenger and Instagram</a>. Of course, those services use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), and critically, <span>X does not appear to.</span></li>



<li><strong>X’s key storage is based on “Juicebox.” </strong>To implement their secret-storage system, XChat uses a protocol called <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/">Juicebox</a>. Juicebox “shards” your key material across three servers, so that in principle the loss or compromise of one server won’t hurt you. </li>
</ul>



<p>Matthew’s post correctly identifies that the major vulnerability in X’s system is this key storage approach. If decryption keys live in three servers that are all under X’s control, then <span>X can probably obtain anyone’s key and decrypt their messages.</span><em> </em>X could do this for their own internal purposes: for example because their famously chill owner got angry at some user. Or they could do it because a warrant or subpoena compels them to. If we judge XChat as an end-to-end encryption scheme, this seems like a pretty game-over type of vulnerability.</p>



<p>So in a sense, everything comes down to the security of Juicebox <span>and the specific deployment choices that X made.</span> Since Matthew wrote his post, I’ve learned a bit more about both of these things. In this post I’d like to go on a slightly deeper dive into the Juicebox portion of X’s system. This will hopefully shed some light on what X is up to, and why you shouldn’t use XChat.</p>



<h3>What’s Juicebox even for?</h3>



<p>Many end-to-end encryption (E2E) apps have run into a specific problem: these systems require users to store their own secret keys. Unfortunately, users are just plain bad at this. </p>



<p>Sometimes we forget keys because we lose our devices. Often we have more than one device, which means our keys end up in the wrong place. A much worse situation occurs when apps want to work in ordinary web browsers: this means that secret keys have to be airlifted into that context as well. </p>



<p>The obvious remedy for this problem is just to store secret keys with the service provider itself. This is convenient, but completely misses the <em>whole point of end-to-end encryption</em>, which is that service providers should not have access to your secrets! Storing decryption keys — in an accessible form — on the provider’s servers is absolutely a no-go.</p>



<p>One way out of this conundrum is for the user to <span>encrypt</span> their secret key, then upload the encrypted value to the service provider. In theory, they can download their secret keys anytime they want and they should know that their secrets are safe. But of course there’s a problem: <em>what secret key are you going to use to encrypt your secret key!?</em> Answering this question quickly leads you into an infinite pile of turtles.</p>

<p>Rather than descend into paradox, systems like Juicebox, Signal SVR, and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/08/13/is-apples-cloud-key-vault-crypto/">iCloud Key Vault</a> offer an alternative. Their observation is that while <em>cryptographic keys are hard to hang on to</em>, users generally <span>do</span> remember simple passwords like PINs, particularly if they’re asked to re-enter them periodically. <em>What if we use the user’s PIN/password to encrypt the stronger cryptographic key that we upload to the server?</em></p>



<p>While this is better than nothing, it isn’t good. Most human-selected passwords and PINs make for terrible cryptographic keys. In particular, short PINs (like the 6-digit decimal pins many people use for their phone passcode) are vulnerable to efficient brute-force guessing attacks. A six-digit PIN provides at most 2<sup>20</sup> security, which is what cryptographers call “a pretty small number.” Even if you use a “hard” key derivation function like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> with insane difficulty settings, you’re still probably still going to lose your data.</p>



<p>Fortunately there is another way.</p>



<p>For many years, cryptographers have considered the problem of turning “weak secrets” into strong ones. The problem is sometimes known as <em><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-lai.pdf">password</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372297.3417266">hardening</a></em>, and doing it well usually requires additional components. First, you need to have some strong cryptographic secret that can be “mixed” into the user’s password to make a produce a truly strong encryption key. Second, you need some mechanism to <em>limit</em> the number of guessing attempts that the user makes, so an attacker can’t simply run an online attack to work through the PIN-space. <span>This cannot be enforced using cryptography alone</span>: you must add a server (or servers) to enforce these checks. Critically, the  server will place limits on how many <em>incorrect passwords</em> the user can enter: <em>e.g., </em>after ten incorrect attempts, the user’s account gets locked or erased.</p>



<p>In one sense, we’re right back where we started: someone needs to operate a a server. If that server is under the control of the service provider, then they can disable the guessing limits and/or extract the server’s secret key material, at which point you’re back to square one. </p>



<p>Many services have engineered some reasonable solutions to this problem, however. They boil down to the following alternatives, which can be implemented separately or together:</p>



<ol>
<li>The server can be implemented inside of a specialized Hardware Security Module, which is set up so that the provider cannot reprogram it or access its key material (at least, after it’s been configured.) This approach was pioneered by Apple, and is now in use by <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/08/13/is-apples-cloud-key-vault-crypto/">iCloud Key Vault</a>, <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/">Signal SVR</a>, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>.</li>



<li>Alternatively, the server can be “split up” into multiple pieces that are each run by different parties. The idea here is that the user must contact <em>T</em> out of <em>N</em> different servers in order to obtain the correct key (a common example is 2-of-3.) As long as an attacker cannot compromise <em>T</em> different servers, the combined system will still be able to enforce the guessing limits and prevent attackers from getting the key. Naturally this idea fundamentally depends on the assumption that the servers are not run by the same party!</li>
</ol>



<p>And at last, we come to Juicebox.</p>



<p>Juicebox is an software-based distributed key hardening service that can be implemented across multiple servers. Users can “enroll” their account into the system, at which point the Juicebox servers will convert their PIN/password into a strong cryptographic key (by mixing it with a secret stored on the Juicebox servers.) Later on, they can contact the Juicebox servers and — assuming they enter the right password, and don’t try too many incorrect guesses —&nbsp;they can obtain that same cryptographic key from the system. Users can specify the number of servers (<em>N</em>) and the threshold (<em>T</em>), and the goal is that the system can survive the loss (or unavailability) of N-T servers, and it should retain its security even if an attacker compromises <em>A&lt;T</em> of them. Most critically, Juicebox enforces limits: if too many incorrect passwords are entered, Juicebox will lock or destroy the user’s account.</p>



<p>In principle, Juicebox servers (called “<em>realms</em>” in the project’s lingo) can be either “software based” or they can be deployed inside of HSMs. <span>However, to the best of my knowledge the HSM capability is not fully supported outside of </span><u>Juicebox</u><span>’s one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superfell.bsky.social/post/3lr765dux5c2b">test deployment</a></span>, and has not been used in deployments (at X or anywhere else.) This means the security of XChat’s version of Juicebox probably comes down to a question of who runs the servers.</p>



<h3>So who runs X’s Juicebox servers, and do they use HSMs?</h3>



<p>To the best of my knowledge, all of the XChat servers are run in software by Twitter/X itself. If this turns out to be incorrect, I will be thrilled to update this post. But so far I’ve seen nothing to indicate that they’re run by different parties, or that this system is in any way hardened against legal requests.</p>



<p>To put this more explicitly, without any protections like the verifiable use of HSMs and/or distributing Juicebox servers across mutually-distrustful operators, having three servers does relatively little to protect users’ secrets against the service operator. And even if X is secretly implementing these protections, implementing them in secret is <span>stupid.</span> As a wise man once said:</p>

<p>Verifying that the XChat Juicebox servers are software-only is more complicated. Digging around in the Juicebox Github, you’ll find a software-only as well as an HSM-specific implementation of their “realms.” Specifically, there is an <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm">entire repository</a> dedicated to supporting Juicebox on <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/hsm/nshield-solo">Entrust nShield Solo XC HSMs</a> (see here for <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/blog/running-a-hsm-realm">instructions</a>) although this same code can also be deployed outside of HSMs. There is even a cool “<a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/ceremony">ceremony</a>” document that a group of administrators can perform to certify that they set the HSM up correctly, and that they destroyed all of the cards that could allow it to be re-programmed! </p>





<p>However, after speaking to Juicebox’s protocol designer <a href="https://github.com/imperiopolis">Nora Trapp</a>, I’m doubtful that any of this is in use at X. Nora told me that the Juicebox project shut down over a year ago and the engineers moved on, and what code there is now open source and not actively maintained (this matches with project commits I can see.) Nora also looked at XChat’s Juicebox deployment and sent me the following commentary:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From what I’ve seen, there are four realms currently in use by Twitter: <code><a href="http://realm-a.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-a.x.com</a></code>, <code><a href="http://realm-b.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-b.x.com</a></code>, <code><a href="http://realm-east1.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-east1.x.com</a></code>, and <code><a href="http://realm-west1.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-west1.x.com</a></code>.</p>

<li><code>realm-a</code> and <code>realm-b</code> are definitely software realms. They don’t use Noise (only true of software realms) and rely solely on TLS. In contrast, HSM-backed realms use Noise within TLS, with TLS terminated at the LB and Noise inside the HSM.</li>



<li><code>realm-east1</code> and <code>realm-west1</code> appear to run code from <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">juicebox-hsm-realm</a>. For example, hitting <code><a href="https://realm-east1.x.com/livez" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://realm-east1.x.com/livez</a></code> shows they’re likely using the repo unmodified from <code>main</code>. However, this doesn’t mean they’re HSM-backed. The repo includes a “software HSM” for testing, which is insecure and doesn’t provide actual HSM properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>Timing analysis (e.g. via the convenient&nbsp;<code>x-exec-time</code>&nbsp;response header X left in place) suggests these are indeed using the software HSM. Real HSMs are typically significantly slower. And even if by some chance they’re running real HSMs, no ceremony has been published, so there’s no reason to trust they’re secure or that the key material isn’t exfiltrated.</p>

<p>Nora also <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/blog/dont-put-all-your-juice-in-one-box">wrote a post very recently warning deployers to stop placing all servers under the control of a single service provider</a>, which seems very applicable to what Twitter/X is doing.</p>



<p>Obviously this doesn’t prove that X isn’t using HSMs. Though, obviously, there’s no reason that you should hope something is secure when the deployer is going out of their way not to tell you it is. When it comes to XChat, my advice is that you should assume this deployment is (1) entirely in software, and (2) all Juicebox “realms” are run by the same organization. This means you should assume that <em>your decryption keys could be recovered by X’s server administrators</em> with at most a little fuss, unless you use a very strong password.</p>



<h3>That’s bad, but let’s talk more about the Juicebox protocol anyway!</h3>



<p>If all you came for was a bit of discussion about the security posture of XChat, then <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">Matthew’s post</a> and the additional notes above are all you need. Unless and until X proves that they’re using HSMs (and have destroyed all programming cards) you should just assume that their Juicebox instantiation is based on software realms under X’s control, and that means it is likely vulnerable to brute-force password-guessing attacks.</p>



<p>The rest of this post is going to look past X. </p>



<p>Let’s assume that a deployer has configured Juicebox intelligently: meaning that some/all realms will be deployed inside of HSMs, and/or realms are spread across multiple organizational trust boundaries — such that no single organization can easily demand recovery of anyone’s password. The question we want to ask now is: what guarantees does Juicebox provide in this setting, and how does the protocol work?</p>



<p><strong>Threshold OPRFs. </strong>The core cryptographic primitive <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">inside of Juicebox</a> is called a <em>threshold oblivious pseudorandom function</em>, or t-OPRF. I’ve written about OPRFs before, specifically <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">in the context of Password-Authenticated Key Agreement</a> (PAKE schemes.) Nonetheless, I think it’s helpful to start from the top.</p>



<p>Let’s leave aside the “oblivious” part for a minute. <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/05/08/prfs-prps-and-other-fantastic-things/">PRFs are functions</a> that take in a key <em>K</em> and a string <em>P</em> (for example, a password), and output a string of bits. We might write as: </p>



<p><em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>)</p>



<p>Provided that an attacker does not know the key, the resulting string <em>O</em> should <span>look</span> random, meaning that the output of a PRF makes for excellent cryptographic keys. In many practical implementations, PRFs are realized using functions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC-MAC">CBC-MAC</a>; however, there are many different ways to build them.</p>



<p>An <span>oblivious</span> PRF (OPRF) is a two-party cryptographic protocol that helps a client and server jointly compute the output of a PRF. It works like this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Imagine a server has the cryptographic key <em>K.</em></li>



<li>The client has their string <em>P</em> (such as a password.)</li>



<li>At the end of a successful protocol run, the <span>client</span> should obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). The server gets no output at all.</li>



<li>Critically: <span>neither party should learn the other party’s input</span>, and the server <span>should not learn the client’s result</span>, either.</li>
</ol>



<p>With this tool in hand, it’s easy to build a very simple password-hardening protocol. Simply configure the server with a key <em>K </em>(preferably a different key for every user account), and then have the client run the OPRF protocol with the server to obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). The resulting value <em>O</em> will make for an excellent encryption key, which the client can use to encrypt any secret values it wants. The best part of this arrangement is that the OPRF protocol ensures that the server never learns the user’s password <em>P</em>, so no information leaks even if the server is fully malicious!</p>



<p>This basic design has some limitations, of course. It does not allow the server to <span>limit</span> the number password guesses, nor does it allow us to spread the process over many different servers.</p>



<p>Addressing the first problem is easy. When the client first registers their account with the server, they can run the OPRF protocol to obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). Next, they compute some “authenticator tag” <em>T </em>that’s derived in some way from the secret <em>O</em>. They can then store that tag <em>T</em> on the server. When a user returns to log back into the system, the client and server can run the OPRF protocol, and then conduct some process to verify that the <em>O</em> received by the client is consistent with the tag <em>T</em> stored at the server. (<span>The exact process for doing this is important, and I’ll discuss it further below.)</span> If this is <em>unsuccessful</em>, then the server can increment a counter to indicate an incorrect password guess on that user’s account. If the protocol completes successfully, then the server should reset that counter back to zero.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>Critically, when the counter reaches some maximum (usually ten incorrect attempts), the server must lock the user’s account — or much better, delete the account-specific key <em>K</em>. This is what prevents attackers from systematically guessing their way through every possible PIN.</p>



<p>Splitting up the PRF into multiple servers is only slightly more complicated. The basic idea relies on the fact that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9497/">specific OPRF used by Juicebox</a> is based on elliptic curves, and this makes it very amenable to threshold implementations. I’m going to put the details into a <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/some-quick-notes-on-t-oprfs/">separate page right here </a>since it’s a little boring. But you should just take away that (1) the service operator can split up the key <em>K</em> across multiple servers, and (2) a client can talk to any <em>T</em> of them and eventually obtain PRF(K, P). </p>



<h3><strong>How does the client prove it got the right key</strong>, and what attacks are there?</h3>



<p>You’ll notice that these “incorrect attempt” counters are a big part of the protection inside of a system like Juicebox. As long as an attacker can only make, say, a maximum of ten incorrect guessing attempts, then even a relatively weak password like 234984 is probably not too bad. If an attacker can make <em>many possible</em> guesses, then the whole system is fairly weak.</p>



<p>Note that in most of these attacks we are going to make the very strong assumption that <span>the server operator is the attacker</span><em> </em>and that they’ve deployed Juicebox in such a way that they can’t just read the secrets out of their own instance (e.g., in this hypothetical scenario, they have deployed Juicebox using HSMs or distributed trust.) Since the whole point of end-to-end encryption is that users’ secret keys should not be known to a server operator, this isn’t too strong of an assumption. Moreover, we’ve recently <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/12/u-k-asks-to-backdoor-icloud-backup-encryption/">seen governments make secret requests to companies like Apple</a> to force them to bypass their end-to-end encrypted services. This means that both hacking and legal compulsion are real concerns. </p>



<p>Within this setting there exist a handful of attacks that could come up in a system like Juicebox. Some are easier than others to prevent:</p>



<ol>
<li>An attacker could try to enter a few password guesses, then wait for the real user to log in. As long as the real user enters the correct password, the attempt counter on the server(s) will drop back to zero. This attack could allow you to make up to, say, nine invalid guesses for each genuine user login.<sup>2</sup> <p>The existence of this attack is kind of unavoidable in systems like Juicebox. Fortunately it’s probably not a very <em>efficient</em> attack. Unless the user is logging on constantly (say, because a web browser caches the user’s password and runs the protocol automatically), the rate of attacker guesses is going to be very low. Moreover: this attack can be mitigated by having the server inform the client of the number of incorrect guesses it’s seen since the last time the user logged in, which should help the user to detect the fact that they’re under attack.</p></li>



<li>If the servers don’t coordinate with each other, a smart attacker could try to guess passwords against different subsets of the Juicebox servers: for example if 2-of-10 servers are needed to recover the key, then an attacker actually could actually obtain many more than ten guesses. This is because the attacker could make at least ten attempts with each <em>subset</em> comprising two servers, before all the necessary servers locked them out. Juicebox’s <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm?tab=readme-ov-file">HSM implementation</a> actually goes to some lengths to prevent this (as <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/SecureValueRecovery2">SVR</a> did before them) by having servers share the current password counter values with each other using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus protocol</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Another possibility is that a malicious (software) server operator could try to attack the protocol directly. Just for fun, I thought it might be interesting to conclude with one <em>possible</em> attack I noticed while perusing the protocol description. I’m almost certain this won’t work in practice — and the Juicebox developers agree, but I thought it was a fun illustration of the <em>types</em> of vulnerabilities that show up in these systems.</p>



<p>Recall that whenever a Juicebox client successfully completes the protocol with a set of <em>T</em> servers, it must somehow convince those servers that it obtained the right key. This is necessary because a correct password entry should <span>reset</span> those servers’ attempt counters back to zero, whereas an <em>incorrect</em> guess will increase the attempt counter. (Without a mechanism to reset the counter, the counter will keep rising until the user’s account gets permanently locked.)</p>



<p><a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">The client deals with this</a> by first computing a value called the unlockKey from the t-OPRF output, and then calculating a set of “tags” called the unlockKeyTags, one for each server (realm) in the system:</p>


<div>

<p>The calculation of each unlockKeyTags[i] value is customized to include the “realm ID” of the server, which means that the tag for server <em>i</em> is specific only to that server. It cannot be extracted from a malicious server <em>i </em>and replayed against server <em>j</em>, which would be very bad. The client then sends each value unlockKeyTags[i] to the appropriate server. The servers can verify the received tag against a copy they stored during the account registration process. If it matches, they reset their counter back to zero as follows:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png"><img data-attachment-id="8614" data-permalink="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/06/09/a-bit-more-on-twitter-xs-new-encrypted-messaging/image-87/" data-orig-file="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png" data-orig-size="1246,408" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?w=700" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="335" src="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?w=1024" alt=""></a></figure></div>


<p>However, the only thing that differentiates these tags from one another is the notion that realm IDs for different servers will always be different. What if this assumption isn’t correct?</p>



<p>The attack I’m concerned about is pretty bizarre, but it looks like this. Imagine a user has previously registered its key into several real HSM-based servers. Now someone hacks into the service provider. This hacker “tricks” clients into sending subsequent login requests to a <span>new set of malicious servers</span> that the attacker spins up using software (i.e., no HSM protections.)</p>



<p>Ordinarily this attack wouldn’t be a disaster, since the OPRF should prevent those new servers from learning the user’s password inputs. But let’s imagine that the hacker sets the “realm ID” of these new servers to be identical to the realm ID of the real (HSM) servers. In this case, the value of unlockKeyTag[i] sent to the malicious servers will be <em>identical</em> to the value that would have been stored within the HSM-based servers. Once the attacker learns this value, they can make an unlimited number of guesses against the HSM server with the same realm ID: this is because the stolen unlockKeyTags[i] value will reset the HSM server’s counter. </p>



<p>I ran this past Nora and she pointed out a number of practical issues that will probably make this sort of attack much less likely to work, but it’s still fun to find this sort of thing. More importantly, I think it shows how delicate distributed protocols like this can be, and how sometimes one’s assumptions may not always be valid. </p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>



<ol>
<li>Obviously this can be dangerous. An attacker who just wants to deny service to the user can enter deliberately-incorrect guesses until the user’s account becomes permanently locked. To prevent this, most services require that you log In using a traditional password first, then you can access the password strengthening server second. Some systems also add time delays, to ensure that an attacker cannot quickly exhaust the counter.</li>



<li>The “try N attempts and then let the client log in normally” attack was outlined to me by Ian Miers.</li>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are intelligent, available when they’re offline, and that protect their privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The framework has native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code. Guided generation, tool calling, and more are all built into the framework, making it easier than ever to implement generative capabilities right into an existing app. For example, Automattic is using the framework in its Day One journaling app to bring users privacy-centric intelligence features.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The Foundation Model framework has helped us rethink what’s possible with journaling,” said Paul Mayne, head of Day One at Automattic. “Now we can bring intelligence and privacy together in ways that deeply respect our users.”

                 <div>To ensure kids have enjoyable, enriching, and appropriate in-app experiences, developers can utilize a range of tools — including parental controls and the Sensitive Content Analysis framework — to enhance child safety and ensure privacy. Building on these existing tools, developers can use the new Declared Age Range API to deliver age-appropriate content based on a user’s age range. When developers implement this API, parents can allow their children to share their age range without disclosing a birthdate or other sensitive information, enabling developers to tailor experiences accordingly. The feature is built around privacy: Age range data is shared only if parents choose to allow it, and they can disable sharing at any time.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS started as a toy project to practice systems programming, and over the years morphed into a full-blown OS and a playground to explore new ideas. It aims to re-examine principles of OS design, and see how much is really needed today to make a functional OS, and where shortcuts can be taken using modern tools. The design has no pretention to be superior to anything else, rather it is an experiment in striving for simplicity of the codebase (but not necessarily a lightweight binary or minimal dependencies).</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, here are usual cornerstones of OS design that Munal OS does <strong>NOT</strong> implement:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bootloader</li>
<li>Page mapping</li>
<li>Virtual address space</li>
<li>Interrupts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EFI binary</h3><a id="user-content-efi-binary" aria-label="Permalink: EFI binary" href="#efi-binary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has no bootloader; instead, the entire OS is compiled into a single EFI binary that embeds the kernel, the WASM engine and all the applications. The UEFI boot services are exited almost immediately and no UEFI services are used except for the system clock.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Address space</h3><a id="user-content-address-space" aria-label="Permalink: Address space" href="#address-space"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">UEFI leaves the address space as identity-mapped and Munal OS does not remap it. In fact the page tables are not touched at all, because the OS does not make use of virtual address mechanisms. The entire OS technically runs within a single memory space, but something akin to the userspace/kernelspace distinction is provided by WASM sandboxing (see below), preventing arbitrary access to kernel memory by user applications.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drivers</h3><a id="user-content-drivers" aria-label="Permalink: Drivers" href="#drivers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS does not rely on PS/2 inputs or VGA/UEFI GOP framebuffers for display. Instead, it implements a PCI driver which is used to communicate with QEMU via the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html" rel="nofollow">VirtIO 1.1 specification</a>. A generic virtqueue system serves as the basis for 4 different VirtIO drivers: keyboard, mouse, network and GPU. Notably, the drivers are entirely polling-based and do not rely on CPU interrupts at all (in fact Munal OS does not implement any).</p>
<p dir="auto">The reliance on VirtIO means Munal OS does not support running on real hardware yet; more work would be needed, either to use BIOS/UEFI-provided methods (such as PS/2, VGA, GOP) or to implement full-blown GPU and USB drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Event loop</h3><a id="user-content-event-loop" aria-label="Permalink: Event loop" href="#event-loop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For simplicity, Munal OS does not implement multi-core support or even interrupts, and everything happens linearly within one single, global event loop. Every iteration of the loop polls the network and input drivers, draws the desktop interface, runs one step of each active WASM application, and flushes the GPU framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">One advantage of this approach is that it is trivial to inspect the performance of each OS component and user application, simply by measuring how much of the total frametime they eat. For now, the loop should run at well over 60 FPS on a modern CPU with all applications open.</p>
<p dir="auto">The downside of course is that each step of the loop is not allowed to hold the CPU for arbitrary amounts of time, and must explicitly yield for long-running tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Applications</h3><a id="user-content-applications" aria-label="Permalink: Applications" href="#applications"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS embeds the <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">wasmi</a> WASM engine for running WASM applications. This achieves full sandboxing of user applications and memory separation from the kernel without the use of a virtual address space (or, moving the virtual address space to a VM, rather). A "system call" API is provided by the kernel so that apps can interact with the system. In particular, apps can query mouse/keyboard events, open/use TCP sockets, and send output framebuffers which are then read by the OS and composited onto the desktop. This lets apps use any drawing library they want (at the cost of a framebuffer copy).</p>
<p dir="auto">All showcased applications are written in Rust, but there would be nothing preventing apps to be made in other languages, as long as it can compile to WASM.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of its custom "system call" API, Munal OS does not aim for compatibility with the WASI standards. However, the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/README.md">WASI Preview1</a> standard is partially supported, mostly so that applications can be compiled without using <code>#![no_std]</code> (which is often a blocker for pulling in external dependencies). Only the bare minimum is implemented, and WASI functions that have no analog in Munal OS (e.g <code>path_rename()</code>) are simply stubbed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS relies on cooperative scheduling, meaning that applications are given control of the CPU every iteration of the global event loop, and must explicitly relinquish it. This is less an intentional design decision and more a consequence of using Wasmi as the WASM engine, which does not support interrupting and resuming functions mid-excution. However Wasmi does support fuel limiting, and so in theory it would be possible to terminate misbehaving apps that hold the CPU for too long (though that's not implemented yet).</p>
<p dir="auto">Each app has a dedicated log stream (akin to stdout in the UNIX world) which can be inspected from the desktop in a dedicated "audit" view. This view also shows how much of the system resources (frametime, memory, resources) are consumed by this app.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UI Library</h3><a id="user-content-ui-library" aria-label="Permalink: UI Library" href="#ui-library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has its own UI toolkit (plainly named Uitk) which is used throughout the desktop UI. It is also used by WASM applications, though that's just for convenience and consistency with the desktop styling; it is just a shared library and applications could in theory swap for any other library they wish, as long as it can render to a generic framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">Uitk is an immediate mode toolkit which supports some basic widgets: buttons, progress bars, text editing, scrollable canvas...a generic triangle rasterizer is also provided (which is used to draw the radial pie menu and the 3D cube demo),</p>
<p dir="auto">Styling is supported via a global stylesheet which can be shared between OS and apps, and can be overriden for individual UI elements.</p>
<p dir="auto">A basic caching system is implemented to avoid unnecessary redraws: for example, generic scrollable canvases (like the web browser) are split into "tiles" tracked with a unique content ID. A system based on Rust's mutability rules automatically keeps track of changes to the content, and so tiles are only redrawn if the content ID changes, and pulled from a cache otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and running</h2><a id="user-content-building-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Building and running" href="#building-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project compiles as of Rust Nightly 2025-06-01 and runs as of QEMU 10.0.0.</p>
<p dir="auto">First add the required rustup components:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"><pre><code>rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then execute this script to build and run:</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/munal-os/blob/master/run.sh">run.sh</a> script is very straightforward, it simply builds the WASM apps one by one, then builds the kernel, then runs QEMU.</p>
<p dir="auto">The script assumes that the QEMU command is named <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>, so if that's not the case on your system just replace it with the proper name.</p>
