<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department?</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Miguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father’s friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. “It’s as if I sensed something was going to happen,” she says. “I was calling him, calling him, calling him: ‘Miguel, come home. Come home.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">His parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards’ landlord, who hadn’t seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Richards’ death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced “for clear viewing of the event as a totality.” And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes “the use of deadly force is unavoidable,” the police commissioner at the time, James O’Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is “nothing short of exceptional.” And, he added, “releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.”</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Richards’ parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney’s office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn’t they know about their son’s death?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">When body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3364&amp;context=vlr">wide latitude</a> to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York’s, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don’t always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/438-20/mayor-de-blasio-new-body-camera-footage-policy">said</a> it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents “within 30 days.” There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Asked about the department’s limited release of footage, a spokesperson pointed to a caveat, contained in an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/bwc-release-oo-54-20.pdf">internal order</a>, that footage can be withheld because of laws or department policy. “The NYPD remains wholly committed to its policy of releasing such recordings as quickly and responsibly as circumstances and the law dictate,” the spokesperson wrote. “Though transparency is of the utmost importance, so too is the Police Department’s commitment to preserving privacy rights.” The department did not say which policies require the withholding of footage and did not address other questions about its record on the cameras. (Mayor Eric Adams’ spokesperson did not make him available for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42%.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">This article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">To Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America’s quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. “Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,” he says. “Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to ‘silver bullet’ syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.” He later added, “We just said to police departments: ‘Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Jeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. “Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,” he says, “should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">When full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder. (Charges were dropped after two mistrials.) And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with “a weapon.” In fact, footage released by the district attorney — who charged the officer with murder — shows that the man was sitting in his own car.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">In New York, Miguel Richards’ parents weren’t the only ones who had doubts about the department’s claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn’t include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn’t include footage from other police units that responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Ruth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department’s own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Now, watching the video the department released of Richards’ shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department’s edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. “What’s your name, man?” one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. “You are seconds away from getting shot,” one officer said. “Do you want to die?” A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Lowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the “NYPD is committed to being as transparent as possible.” But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department’s records officers: “I must deny access to these records.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"><strong>Body-worn cameras</strong> were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown’s life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown’s mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. “Please,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WTc1DOlMrc&amp;t=242s">begged</a> Missouri legislators, “let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">President Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his <a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/12/01/building-trust-between-communities-and-local-police">plans</a> to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they’re paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama, an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man’s femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/02/unlike-in-memphis-montgomery-police-fight-release-of-brutal-bodycam-footage.html">refused</a> to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause “civil unrest” and that the officers could face “embarrassment.” But a lawyer for the man’s family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. “Did you get a bite?” an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. “Sure did, heh, heh,” the K-9 officer responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">The secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy’s mother, reaching to help him, begged, “Please, please do not kill my son!”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">The footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin’s conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. “Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,” says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, “the city never burns. We’d have a downtown still. It’s a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">A Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1587661/download">report</a> from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn’t make the footage public or mete out punishment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">There was a similar dynamic in Memphis, Tennessee, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/memphis-police-scorpion.html">abused</a> residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/07/us/memphis-officers-tyre-nichols.html">knew</a> they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Some politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the <a href="https://www.wistv.com/story/29289442/south-carolinas-body-camera-bill-is-now-law/">announcement</a> with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">“This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,” Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn’t say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is “not a public record subject to disclosure,” thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In 2021, York County sheriff’s deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, “We never release that footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia’s civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the “body-cam head fake.” And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world’s largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"><strong>New York’s adoption</strong> of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department’s aggressive “stop and frisk” policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability — body-worn cameras — in passing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">“My head snapped when I heard the words,” Scheindlin recalled this year. “I thought, ‘That could be a useful remedy!’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Two months later, Scheindlin issued a historic <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/Floyd-Remedy-Opinion-8-12-13.pdf">ruling</a> that New York’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were “uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.” Scheindlin laid out three ways the cameras would help: “First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.” She continued, “Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">But in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin’s ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community’s answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Officers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would “show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,” according to a separate NYU survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">When the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process — in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The policy blunted the technology’s potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements — something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">The policy was “so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights,” Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/dont-let-the-nypd-co-opt-body-cameras.html">wrote</a> in a guest essay in The New York Times. “Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Still, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O’Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. “I’m totally convinced now that this is the way forward,” he said. “These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Then the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">“This is an historic day for New York City,” de Blasio said, with O’Neill by his side. “This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Five months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Disclosing the full footage would be an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the department wrote. Whose privacy — the dead man’s or the officers’ — was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could “endanger the life or safety of any person.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The letter came from the department’s legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. “They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,” Byrne <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/27/nypd-ready-to-hit-record-on-body-camera-pilot?ref=bklyner.com">told</a> NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, “most of this footage” would never be made public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Lowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department’s various explanations for its denials “pissed me off,” Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department’s kneejerk secrecy. “There’s a good side to the department,” he says, “but there’s always been a self-serving dark side to it too.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">In response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage “in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.” But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards’ parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"><strong>Public disclosure</strong> of footage isn’t the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers’ allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said, “I’m sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them — along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election — staged a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/the-forgotten-city-hall-riot.html">huge protest</a> outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases when it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Many civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency’s ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano’s hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 — the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. “We talked about it in detail” at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. “We thought, ‘Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Napolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn’t appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">As with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department “liaison” unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn’t cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department’s cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn’t know an officer’s name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">Perhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board’s investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. “If you were setting up a system to be shitty,” one agency insider says, “this is the system you’d create.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">At times, the department’s animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department’s legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to “bomb the room” when only board officials were there, which would have “solved everything.” (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn’t recall saying that, but added, “On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Napolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn’t exist — only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn’t true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly 1 of every 5 cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">Napolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department’s stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department’s system where footage is stored. That’s how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers’ accounts. Chicago’s oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn’t see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage — and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, “freaked” out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">“It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,” Napolitano added, referring to the mayor’s tenuous relationship with the police. “In a dispute between CCRB and NYPD, City Hall always chose the NYPD. Always.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">“I don’t agree,” de Blasio says. “The tension between the CCRB and the NYPD is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.” He went on, “The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You’re not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"><strong>While the department</strong> fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department’s own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">As the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards’ nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Department guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to “isolate and contain” the person. “The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,” department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor’s permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">At first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Two officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards’ right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. “Hold up,” one of the ESU officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. “I don’t know if it’s a toy or a gun,” Murphy quickly added.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">As the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards’ room. “Do you want to take him down now?” Ramos asked them. “Yeah,” they both answered.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">At nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. “Isolate and contain,” the dispatcher told the officers. “Use nonlethal force whenever possible.” As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming — who later said Richards was raising his arm — fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It’s impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming’s camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight.</p>

        <span>A radio command from headquarters reminded the officers of NYPD guidelines to “isolate and contain” a person in a mental health crisis and to “use nonlethal force whenever possible.” Fifteen minutes after arriving, they opened fire.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Fleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">The internal investigators asked the officers to explain. “We kind of handle everything on our own,” Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had “situationally changed” and prompted the decision to “take him at that point.” Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. “I perceived that his intentions were lethal,” Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn’t fully grasped Richards’ mental state. “Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?” Fleming asked.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">When the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an “EDP” — or an emotionally disturbed person — with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, “We wanted to, like, end it.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">While the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been “justified” in shooting — because they were facing an “individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm” — the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24216933-final-internal-investigation-report">noted</a>, “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department’s full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, “The Secret Files.” The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">But in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-unchecked-power/">absolute power</a> over punishment. In March 2019, O’Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O’Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">It would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the “public is vested with an inherent right to know” and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron’s organization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">She received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">“He’s still alive,” Fleming said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.1">“Holy shit,” Murphy replied. “Just fucking cuff him.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.2">The officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">They searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. “It’s some fucking little thing,” he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Outside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">But by then, for another man in distress, it was too late.</p>

<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.1"><strong>In April 2019,</strong> one month after O’Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">The circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: “I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, ‘Didn’t I read this already?’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">This time, though, the victim’s family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn’t ignore.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">But despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn’t share the footage — or any other records — with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department’s longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department’s internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board’s investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">In the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 — more than a year and a half after the killing — and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron’s organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/judge-says-nypd-illegally-withheld-footage-in-police-shootings">“in bad faith.”</a></p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">What it <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/it-wasnt-the-first-time-the-nypd-killed-someone-in-crisis-for-kawaski-trawick-it-only-took-112-seconds">showed</a> was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, “Why are you in my home?” One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. “We ain’t gonna tase him,” Davis said in the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Thompson didn’t listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. “No, no — don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Davis said, pushing his partner’s arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">There was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick’s apartment. “Who’s injured?” a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: “Nobody. Just a perp.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">With all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers — which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">This September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/09/25/no-discipline-recommended-cops-killing-kawaski-trawick/">wrote</a> that she had “serious doubts” about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department’s refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">“That should not be tolerated,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “Both CCRB and NYPD are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0"><strong>In the wake of</strong> George Floyd’s murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage — the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd’s life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">Napolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage — and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">“The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the CCRB from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the NYPD,” an internal agency memo <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6980787-CCRB-Memo-on-Body-Cam-Footage.html">warned</a>. “The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a BWC program intended primarily to aid oversight.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">Napolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department’s absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department’s withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency has “publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to BWC footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">This spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn’t be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. “There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen” in policing, Williams told me. “But if we’re not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the NYPD, that doesn’t make this conversation any easier.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">The Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department “does not fear transparency.” But the official argued that it would be an “insurmountable obstacle” to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">The city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers — the highest total in five years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">With footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing <a href="https://www.nypdmonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NST-Report.pdf">report</a> about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin’s expectations, police supervisors weren’t using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100% of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37% of the stops were unconstitutional.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">“It was an experiment,” Scheindlin says, one that didn’t anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. “That troubles me,” she says. “It should always be somebody independent.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In interviews with a half-dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn’t committed to using footage for accountability. “Body cams are essential, if done right,” says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. “They are a game changer.” He added, “If there’s a problem, you flag — and potentially there’s discipline. But that’s not happening in most cases.” Instead, he says, body cameras have become “an exercise in just work they have to do. It’s a culture thing.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">Rudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department’s compliance with Scheindlin’s now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. “I watch a lot of body-cam videos,” Hall told me. “I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">“Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren’t a lot of discussions about it. The NYPD needs to do a lot better.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">One of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331981847_Research_on_body-worn_cameras">recommended</a> that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That’s essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a “critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,” says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">Four auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. “If officers know they’re being viewed, if supervisors know they’re being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,” says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city’s civilian oversight agency — which has direct access to footage — noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to “the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.” The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it’s the police chief who has the final say on discipline.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">During his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department’s 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. “It was CompStat for constitutional policing,” Schlanger says, referring to the department’s data-heavy program for tracking crime. “If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we’d work to help them. It made a difference.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">The department quietly ended the review program last year.</p>

<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0"><strong>A civil suit on behalf</strong> of Miguel Richards’ estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. “I want answers,” his mother told me, “and haven’t been able to get them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">The three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for “extremely brave and tactically sound action” in the Richards shooting, noting that “the officers had no choice but to open fire.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">The officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit — whose help he told department investigators he didn’t need — is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental health crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">It’s not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards’ death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">On a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. “I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,” he says in Spanish. “Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.” But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">The officers shot him <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-cops-shoot-critically-injure-man-having-medical-episode-in-bronx">28 seconds</a> after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. “This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,” he said. The officers’ “quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">But the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">Lowenkron’s colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail. The department has also withheld the footage from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, per the practice of sharing records with the agency only after its own investigation is done.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="134.0">On Dec. 5, weeks after we sent questions to the department about that practice, the department signed a memorandum of understanding with the board to send footage to it within 90 days of a request.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="135.0">But for now, nobody outside the department knows exactly what happened in the de la Cruz shooting, including the family. They have not heard anything from the department. They want to see the footage.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Based on RISC-V open hardware technology, the new processor is an important advance to achieve European technological sovereignty and reducing dependence on large multinational corporations</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BSC, Europe's leading developer of open source computing technologies, is committed to turning Barcelona into an innovation hub specialising in semiconductor design</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) presented on Wednesday the new Sargantana chip, the third generation of open source processors designed entirely at the BSC. The development of Sargantana is a crucial step forward in reinforcing BSC's leading position in RISC-V open source computing technology research in Europe.</p>
<p>Sargantana (the name of the lizard in Aragonese and Catalan) is the third generation of the Lagarto processors, the first open source chips developed in Spain, in the framework of the DRAC project (Designing RISC-V-based Accelerators for next generation Computers), and is one of the most advanced open source chips in Europe at the academic level. The new Sargantana features better performance than its two predecessors - Lagarto Hun (2019) and DVINO (2021) - and is the first processor in the Lagarto family to break the gigahertz barrier in operating frequency.</p>
<p>The fact that the instruction set architecture (ISA) of these new processors is open source, and therefore non-proprietary and accessible to all, reduces technological dependence on large multinational corporations by enabling innovation through the collaboration of companies and institutions without the limitations of proprietary architectures. The RISC-V free hardware architecture, on which these new chips are based, could bring about a technological revolution in the hardware world like Linux did in the software world.</p>
<p>"The launch of Sargantana is a further step forward in the development of European RISC-V based technology, an embryo of the future European high-performance processor. This open hardware will be vital to ensure technological sovereignty and maintain European industrial competitiveness, and consolidates the BSC's role as a pioneer in Europe in the introduction of open source for chip design," said BSC director Mateo Valero.</p>
<p>In 2017, the European Union identified the lack of own hardware as one of the main vulnerabilities, due to the risk of industrial espionage posed by an over-reliance on chips designed and produced outside Europe, especially in the United States, Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea. The BSC was then tasked by the EU to lead the scientific development of future European chips to provide the market with an open and local alternative, suitable for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, the automotive sector and the internet of things.</p>
<h2>Joint work coordinated by the BSC</h2>
<p>Researchers from other universities and research centres such as the Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional de México (CIC-IPN), the Centro Nacional de Microelectrónica (CNM-CSIC), the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) have participated in the development of Sargantana.</p>
<p>The project was coordinated by BSC researcher Miquel Moretó, who highlighted the advantages of open-source semiconductor design to enable collaboration between companies and academic institutions around the world. "The new Sargantana chip is freely available to all, enabling a new era of processor innovation through open collaboration in which anyone, anywhere can benefit from RISC-V technology," he said.</p>
<p>Moretó pointed out that Sargantana is an experimental chip, a research prototype that will allow us to test applications with RISC-V technology and deepen our knowledge, but it is not yet designed to be used in computers or other devices. "We are developing a technology that will allow Spain and Europe to design their own increasingly competitive processors in the future, in addition to training future professionals in a sector that will undoubtedly add great value to the production chain," added Moretó, who highlighted the joint efforts of Catalonia, Spain and Europe to have European technology made in Barcelona and to train engineers in this field.</p>
<h2>European leadership in RISC-V</h2>
<p>This objective is in line with the idea pointed out by Mateo Valero of making Barcelona an international benchmark in processor design. "We have the talent, the technological knowledge and the scientific environment necessary for Barcelona and its surroundings to be able to compete with any institution or region in the world and become a <i>Design Valley</i> that drives the creation of companies and new jobs", said Valero.</p>
<p>The Sargantana project has received funding from the Strategic Transformation Project for the semiconductor sector, known as PERTE Chip, the largest investment of all industrial transformation projects approved by the Spanish Government, as well as European funds from the ERDF Operational Programme of Catalonia 2014-2020, with the support of the Catalan Government.</p>
<p>The Sargantana presentation ceremony was held at the BSC facilities in Barcelona as part of the first day of the Spanish Open Hardware Alliance (SOHA), an association that brings together Spanish universities and research centres with the aim of promoting research in the area of Open Computer Technology and Architecture, thus contributing to the training of talent that allows the creation of high quality jobs.</p>

<h2 id="webgpu-is-back">WebGPU is back</h2><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU API</a>
gives developers a low level, high performance, cross architecture way to
program GPU hardware from JavaScript. It is the effective successor to WebGL on
the Web. The spec has been finalized and Chrome has already shipped the API.
Support is underway in Firefox and Safari.</p>
<p>Deno
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.8#experimental-support-for-the-webgpu-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">first introduced WebGPU back in early 2021</a>
but it was removed earlier this year due to performance problems. With this
release, we are happy to re-introduce it with all the performance issues worked
out.</p>
<p>GPUs have the ability to compute certain numerical operations with extreme
parallelism as compared to CPUs. This is useful for a variety of applications,
beyond just rendering and games. For example, machine learning algorithms can
often be expressed as a series of matrix operations, which can be computed
extremely efficiently on a GPU.</p>
<p>Our WebGPU implementation is based on the same underlying system as the upcoming
WebGPU implementation in Firefox, so we’re confident that it’s a solid
foundation for developers to build on.</p>
<p>A basic example of getting information about the GPU via WebGPU:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>const</span> adapter <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>gpu</span><span>.</span><span>requestAdapter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>adapter<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>const</span> adapterInfo <span>=</span> <span>await</span> adapter<span>.</span><span>requestAdapterInfo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Found adapter: </span><span><span>${</span>adapterInfo<span>.</span><span>device</span><span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>const</span> features <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>adapter<span>.</span><span>features</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Supported features: </span><span><span>${</span>features<span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>", "</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>"No adapter found"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>Further examples can be viewed over at our
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/webgpu-examples" rel="noopener noreferrer">webgpu-examples repository</a>.</p>
<p>Although the specification is stable, WebGPU is still considered unstable in
Deno. To access it in Deno use the <code>--unstable-webgpu</code> flag. We’re planning to
stabilize it soon, after we’ve had a chance to get more feedback from the
community and more time to verify the implementation against the
<a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/cts" rel="noopener noreferrer">specification test suite</a>.</p>
<p>For more webgpu functionalities, we’ve also added <a href="#stdwebgpu"><code>std/webgpu</code></a>
(more info below).</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu" rel="noopener noreferrer">wgpu</a> team for the help provided
to achieve this.</p>
<h2 id="new-deno-coverage-reporters">New <code>deno coverage</code> reporters</h2><p>In this release, <code>deno coverage</code> received two new reporters: <code>summary</code> and
<code>html</code>. You can now also omit the directory value for the <code>--coverage</code> flag in
<code>deno test</code>, as we now default to using <code>./coverage/</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>summary</code> reporter is the new default reporter. It outputs the coverage
summary in a concise table giving you information about coverage in particular
files and overall summary:</p>
<div><pre>$ deno coverage
----------------------------------
File         <span>|</span> Branch % <span>|</span> Line % <span>|</span>
----------------------------------
 bar.ts      <span>|</span>      <span>0.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>57.1</span> <span>|</span>
 baz/quux.ts <span>|</span>      <span>0.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>28.6</span> <span>|</span>
 baz/qux.ts  <span>|</span>    <span>100.0</span> <span>|</span>  <span>100.0</span> <span>|</span>
 foo.ts      <span>|</span>     <span>50.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>76.9</span> <span>|</span>
----------------------------------
 All files   <span>|</span>     <span>40.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>61.0</span> <span>|</span>
----------------------------------</pre></div><p>The previously default reporter that prints uncovered lines in all files to the
terminal is still available using the <code>--detailed</code> flag.</p>
<p>You can also specify <code>--html</code> flag to get the detailed coverage report in HTML
format.</p>
<pre><code>$ deno test --coverage
$ deno coverage --html
HTML coverage report has been generated at file:///path/to/project/coverage/html/index.html</code></pre><p>The examples of the coverage report look like the below:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v1.39/html-coverage-index.png" alt="HTML Coverage Report Index" title=""></p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v1.39/html-coverage-source.png" alt="HTML Coverage Report Source" title=""></p>
<p>The output of <code>deno coverage --html</code> is completely static and can be hosted on
any static file server, such as GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>We still support the <code>--lcov</code> flag, which outputs the coverage report in the
<a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">LCOV</a> format, which is useful for
integrating with other tools such as <a href="https://codecov.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecov</a> or
<a href="https://coveralls.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coveralls</a>.</p>
<p>We have further plans to improve <code>deno coverage</code> and make it more useful. If you
have feedback you’d like to share, please comment on
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/21325" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-deno-compile">Updates to <code>deno compile</code></h2><p>Deno 1.39 introduces significant advancements in the <code>deno compile</code> feature:</p>
<p><strong>Better <code>node_modules</code> support</strong>: With the <code>--unstable-byonm</code> flag,
<code>deno compile</code> now supports “bring your own node_modules”, enhancing Node.js
compatibility. This feature allows you to use npm packages directly in your Deno
projects, bridging the gap between Deno and the extensive npm ecosystem. Learn
more about this feature in
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.38#nodejs-compatibility-improvements" rel="noopener noreferrer">our previous blog post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Naming for Executables</strong>: Deno has removed restrictions on executable
naming. You can now name your compiled programs with leading digits, such as
<code>3d_modeler</code>, offering more flexibility in naming conventions.</p>
<p><strong>More Dynamic Import Support</strong>: More dynamic import patterns are now supported
in <code>deno compile</code>. This is interesting because Deno needs to statically include
all modules that may be imported at runtime in the binary produced by
<code>deno compile</code>. Because of this, dynamic imports can be problematic. Now, Deno
can handle more dynamic import patterns, such as:</p>
<div><pre><span>await</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>./dir/</span><span><span>${</span>expr<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>In this example, Deno will include all modules from <code>./dir/</code> and its
subdirectories into the compiled binary. This allows you to import any of these
files at runtime. This update simplifies dependency management by ensuring that
all modules referenced dynamically are available at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-language-server">Enhanced Language Server</h2><p>In our ongoing commitment to improving the Deno Language Server (LSP), this
release introduces significant performance enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive Typing Experience</strong>: We’ve optimized the handling of rapid request
bursts during fast typing, ensuring a smoother and more responsive editing
experience in your IDE.</p>
<p><strong>Shutdown Timeout</strong>: To tackle the issue of lingering ‘zombie’ LSP instances,
we’ve implemented a shutdown-timeout mechanism. This feature forcefully
terminates LSP processes when you close your editor after a set timeout,
promoting efficient resource utilization.</p>
<p><strong>Update Notifications</strong>: The language server now actively informs you of the
latest Deno updates. This feature aims to simplify the process of keeping your
Deno installation current, ensuring you always have access to the latest
features and fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Diagnostics</strong>: We’ve introduced a new <code>deno.logFile</code> setting in
VSCode. When used alongside <code>deno.internalDebug</code>, this feature allows for the
capture of detailed diagnostic data, aiding in performance analysis and
troubleshooting.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to continuously enhancing the Deno LSP. Should you encounter
any performance issues with the LSP or within VSCode Deno, your feedback is
invaluable. Please let us know about your experience
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/new/choose" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-compatibility-improvements">Node.js compatibility improvements</h2><h3 id="sloppy-imports">Sloppy imports</h3><p>Migrating existing TypeScript codebases to Deno can be a daunting task. One of
the biggest hurdles is the fact that Deno requires you to explicitly specify
file extensions in the import statements.</p>
<p>Imagine a TypeScript project that had a file <code>foo.ts</code> that imported <code>bar.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>import</span> <span><span>{</span> <span>Example</span> <span>}</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"./bar"</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Example</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>Example</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Example"</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>In previous versions of Deno, this would error out with an unhelpful message:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run foo.ts
error: Module not found <span>"file:///dev/bar"</span>
  at file:///dev/foo.ts:1:25</pre></div><p>Now in Deno 1.39 this error message is improved and an escape hatch made
available:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run foo.ts
error: Module not found <span>"file:///dev/bar"</span><span>.</span> Maybe <span>add</span> a <span>'.ts'</span> extension or run with --unstable-sloppy-imports
    at file:///dev/foo.ts:1:25</pre></div><p>Running with the <code>--unstable-sloppy-imports</code> flag will execute the code without
any changes:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run --unstable-sloppy-imports foo.ts
Warning Sloppy imports are not recommended and have a negative impact on performance.
Warning Sloppy module resolution <span>(</span>hint: <span>add</span> .ts extension<span>)</span>
    at file:///dev/foo.ts:1:25
Example</pre></div><p>In addition to resolving imports without file extension, this feature also
allows to resolve “directory” imports, as well as importing <code>.ts</code> files using
<code>.js</code> extension:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"/"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"Hello World"</span><span>,</span>

bar</pre></div><p>As seen above, using this flag will print warnings that guide you towards
migrating the code to the recommended import syntax. You will also get
diagnostics in your editor, along with “quick fixes” that will make it easier to
apply necessary changes.</p>
<p>We hope this feature will make it much easier to try out and migrate existing
projects to Deno.</p>
<h3 id="support-running-node_modulesbin-executables-in-deno-task">Support running <code>node_modules/.bin/</code> executables in <code>deno task</code></h3><p><code>deno task</code> can run tasks defined in <code>deno.json</code>, as well as <code>scripts</code> defined
in <code>package.json</code>. This release adds support for running executables in
<code>node_modules/.bin/</code> directory in <code>deno task</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>package.json</code> that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span>{</span>
  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"dev"</span><span>:</span> <span>"vite dev"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>You can run <code>vite dev</code> with <code>deno task</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ deno task dev</code></pre><p>Deno will look for <code>vite</code> executable in <code>node_modules/.bin/</code> directory and run
it using Deno - even if the <code>node_modules/.bin/vite</code> uses shebang defining
Node.js as an interpreter.</p>
<h3 id="commonjs-entrypoints-in-node_modules">CommonJS entrypoints in <code>node_modules</code></h3><p>Deno will now correctly handle CommonJS entrypoints in <code>node_modules</code>,
respecting the <code>type</code> setting from <code>package.json</code> for the relevant package. This
should greatly improve compatibility with packages that still haven’t migrated
to ESM.</p>
<h3 id="support-for-objectprototype__proto__">Support for <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code></h3><p>Deno made a conscious decision to not support <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code> for
security reasons. However there are still many packages on <code>npm</code> that rely on
this property to work correctly.</p>
<p>In this release we introduced a new <code>--unstable-unsafe-proto</code> flag that allows
you to enable this property. It is not recommended to use this flag, but if you
really need to use a package that relies on it, the escape hatch is now
available to you.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs-apis-updates">Node.js APIs updates</h3><p>Following Node.js APIs are now available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crypto.createPrivateKey</code></li>
<li><code>http.ClientRequest.setTimeout</code></li>
<li><code>http.globalAgent</code></li>
<li><code>perf_hooks.performance</code></li>
<li><code>process.geteuid</code></li>
<li><code>process.report</code></li>
<li><code>util.parseArgs</code></li>
<li><code>vm.runInNewContext</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally we fixed several bugs in already supported Node.js APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>child_process.spawnSync</code> handling of <code>status</code> was incorrect</li>
<li><code>child_process.spawnSync</code> properly normalizes <code>stdio</code></li>
<li><code>child_process</code> can handle IPC pipes on Unix systems (Windows support coming
soon)</li>
<li><code>crypto.sign</code> now works with PEM private keys</li>
<li><code>fs.existsSync</code> is now faster when file does not exist</li>
<li><code>process.exitCode</code> should change exit code of process</li>
<li>allow <code>null</code> value for <code>http.OutgoingMessage.setHeader</code></li>
<li>fix <code>Buffer.copy</code> when <code>sourceStart</code> &gt; <code>source.length</code></li>
<li>fix <code>os.freemem</code></li>
<li>fix <code>stream.Writable</code></li>
<li>handle closing <code>process.stdin</code> more than once</li>
</ul>

this release. It now supports an intuitive JSON format for defining schedules,
making it easier to understand and implement cron jobs. For more in-depth

deprecation to the various IO interfaces in Deno.</p>
<p>The following interfaces are now deprecated and are slated to be removed in Deno

<ul>
<li><code>Deno.Reader</code></li>
<li><code>Deno.ReaderSync</code></li>
<li><code>Deno.Writer</code></li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thisisimportant.net/posts/screenshots-in-documentation/">https://thisisimportant.net/posts/screenshots-in-documentation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38639629">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>Screenshots in documentation can be a contentious topic — some people really like them and think they add a lot of value, while others dislike them due to the maintenance burden and accessibility issues.</p>
<p>As a technical writer, I avoid adding screenshots to documentation as often as possible. In my mind, an outdated screenshot is one of the fastest ways to lose customer trust, so if I’m not confident I can maintain the image, I don’t add it.</p>
<p>But that approach might be too rigid and avoidant. What are the advantages and disadvantages to adding screenshots to documentation?</p>
<h2 id="why-screenshots-are-bad">Why screenshots are bad</h2>
<p>Screenshots in documentation can have a lot of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdated screenshots can cause customers to <strong>lose trust in documentation</strong> accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Pages load more slowly</strong> when they have a lot of screenshots compared to pages that only have text.</li>
<li>Screenshots can <strong>replace step-by-step instructions</strong>, losing an explanation of why you might perform a task and replacing it with an image of how or where.</li>
<li>Screenshots often have no or poor alt text, making them <strong>inaccessible to those with low or no vision</strong>.</li>
<li>Relying on screenshots can lead you to write <strong>documentation that only describes the UI</strong>, instead of what you can do with it or what the data visible in a dashboard means and where it comes from.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these are mostly implementation problems. It’s possible to have screenshots in documentation without these problems.</p>
<h2 id="why-screenshots-are-good">Why screenshots are good</h2>
<p>Screenshots and images in your documentation can serve some helpful functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it <strong>easier for readers to scan</strong> to a relevant part of the content.</li>
<li>Provide a <strong>visual frame of reference</strong> for people reading the documentation without using the product at the same time.</li>
<li>When used correctly, they can <strong>supplement confusing task steps</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the Baymard Institute performed user research about SaaS products and found that <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/highlight-saas-ui">35% of SaaS Sites Fail to Make the Service’s UI Sufficiently Prominent to Prospects</a>, making it harder for potential customers to learn more about the product. The findings apply to a product’s entire website presence (beyond the product documentation), but it’s important to keep  in mind when deciding whether to add screenshots.</p>
<p>In light of those findings, it’s unfortunate that SaaS products typically update the UI constantly, making it especially hard to maintain accurate screenshots.</p>
<p>But these are some real advantages to providing screenshots in your documentation. So how do you add them while still avoiding the problems?</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-purpose-of-a-screenshot">Identify the purpose of a screenshot</h2>
<p>If you focus on the purpose of a screenshot in product documentation, you can identify a few situations where screenshots make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a confusing page clearer by adding context to it.</li>
<li>Give someone a sense of how a page might look when it has data in it.</li>
<li>Walk users through a task that traverses multiple different pages in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, a screenshot might function as filler and not provide much of a function while still being difficult to maintain. Don’t add screenshots in these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every step in a task.</li>
<li>To provide visual interest without a reference in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also don’t want to provide screenshots to support text that describes every element on a specific page, because you don’t want to write documentation that only describes the user interface <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="make-screenshots-accessible">Make screenshots accessible</h2>
<p>Whenever you add a screenshot, make it accessible. Accessibility of images is relevant for lots of different people:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data analyst with low vision that keeps the documentation site zoomed in at 400%.</li>
<li>A sales engineer using a mobile hotspot to work at the airport.</li>
<li>A sysadmin visiting family in a rural area that just got woken up by an urgent page in the middle of the night.</li>
<li>An engineer using a localized version of your product in their own language.</li>
</ul>
<p>If critical content is only available by looking at an image, it isn’t accessible to any of those people. Therefore, make sure that a screenshot isn’t the only way to gather important information.</p>
<p>You can start improving image accessibility by writing useful alt text. Refer to Microsoft’s excellent guide, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/everything-you-need-to-know-to-write-effective-alt-text-df98f884-ca3d-456c-807b-1a1fa82f5dc2">Everything you need to know to write effective alt text</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the file size of any image that you add to your documentation, because image size can affect page load. Compress your images using a tool like <a href="https://compressor.io/">compressor.io</a> (or <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/powerful-image-optimization-tools/">others compiled by Smashing Magazine</a>) before adding them to your documentation.</p>
<p>If you want, you can work with a translation service to localize images in your translated content as well, but you can also use other approaches to help make them accessible to folks who are reading your documentation other than the language your content is written in, such as by simplifying your screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="use-simplified-screenshots">Use simplified screenshots</h2>
<p>Being intentional about adding screenshots to your documentation helps reduce the maintenance burden because you have fewer screenshots to maintain. But if you use simplified screenshots, you can reduce the maintenance burden further.</p>
<p>A simplified screenshot is a screenshot modified to obscure or remove content irrelevant to the purpose of the screenshot. Anton Bollen introduces the idea in his excellent article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simplified-graphics-meet-new-design-style-technical-anton-bollen/">Simplified graphics: Meet the new design style for technical communication</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, you might provide a screenshot with some content blurred out, to help readers focus only on the relevant portion of the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://thisisimportant.net/images/2023/12/modified-google-docs.png" alt="Simplified graphic of the Google Docs navigation menu, where I drafted this blog post, with the title and some menu items obscured with gray rectangles. The visible menu options are File, Edit, View, and Insert."></p>
<p>While they might take a bit longer to make, simplified screenshots don’t need to be updated as frequently because you can obscure parts of the UI that are irrelevant for your task, unavailable to users with specific roles or permissions, or that might otherwise be confusing.</p>
<p>With a simplified screenshot, it becomes outdated at the same time as your text content, so you can update them both at the same time—rather than your image becoming outdated sooner because some other part of the interface changed.</p>
<h2 id="automate-screenshots">Automate screenshots</h2>
<p>If you’re committed to providing screenshots and have a robust docs-as-code pipeline, you can also consider automating screenshot creation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Simon Willison wrote and released a tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> which you can use to automate taking screenshots of webpages (and by extension, web applications). I haven’t used it, but I can envision designing a screenshot pipeline that works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attach a hook to a UI component that you use in a screenshot.</li>
<li>If the code changes, prompt the tool to automatically take a screenshot in a demo environment.</li>
<li>Compress the resulting image.</li>
<li>Create a PR to add the new image to the documentation, replacing the old image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, componentized UI code means that this could be pretty difficult to instrument on a large scale (the only scale at which this would be necessary), but depending on your code base and technical skills, this might be feasible for your documentation.</p>
<h2 id="intentionally-add-images-to-your-documentation">Intentionally add images to your documentation</h2>
<p>If you have a strategy and a process for adding and updating images in your documentation, you can avoid the pitfalls of screenshots in your docs and bask in the advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add screenshots to the documentation only when they’re relevant and useful.</li>
<li>Make screenshots accessible, so even if they aren’t there, the content is still useful.</li>
<li>Use simplified screenshots to ease the maintenance burden and increase the relevance.</li>
<li>Consider automating screenshots if you have the resources.</li>
</ul>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>In rare cases, you might be writing UI reference content, such as when documenting critical workflows for a process where the UI has just had a major update and buttons have moved around, or if you’re documenting software for users that have never used software before. But otherwise, if you find yourself writing content that describes the available buttons on the UI, you might want to consider your audience more fully.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>An unusual right-to-repair drama is disrupting railroad travel in Poland despite efforts by hackers who helped repair trains that allegedly were designed to stop functioning when serviced by anyone but Newag, the train manufacturer.</p>
<p>Members of an ethical hacking group called Dragon Sector, including Sergiusz Bazański and Michał Kowalczyk, were called upon by a train repair shop, Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), to analyze train software in June 2022. SPS was desperate to figure out what was causing "mysterious failures" that shut down several vehicles owned by Polish train operator the Lower Silesian Railway, Polish infrastructure trade publication Rynek Kolejowy <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">reported</a>. At that point, the shortage of trains had already become "a serious problem" for carriers and passengers, as fewer available cars meant shorter trains and reduced rider capacity, Rynek Kolejowy reported.</p>
<p>Dragon Sector spent two months analyzing the software, finding that "the manufacturer's interference" led to "forced failures and to the fact that the trains did not start," and concluding that bricking the trains "was a deliberate action on Newag's part."</p>
<p>According to Dragon Sector, Newag entered code into the control systems of Impuls trains to stop them from operating if a GPS tracker indicated that the train was parked for several days at an independent repair shop.</p>
<p>The trains "were given the logic that they would not move if they were parked in a specific location in Poland, and these locations were the service hall of SPS and the halls of other similar companies in the industry," Dragon Sector's team <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">alleged</a>. "Even one of the SPS halls, which was still under construction, was included."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The code also allegedly bricked the train if "certain components had been replaced without a manufacturer-approved serial number," 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-repaired-trains-the-manufacturer-artificially-bricked-now-the-train-company-is-threatening-them/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/newag-odpowiada-hakerom-i-sps-chce-wycofania-pojazdow-z-ruchu-116422.html">statement</a>, Newag denied developing any so-called "workshop-detection" software that caused "intentional failures" and threatened to sue Dragon Sector for slander and for violating hacking laws.</p>
<p>“Hacking IT systems is a violation of many legal provisions and a threat to railway traffic safety,” Newag said, insisting that the hacked trains be removed from use because they now pose alleged safety risks. Newag's safety claims are still unsubstantiated, 404 Media reported.</p>
<p>"We categorically deny and negate Newag's uploading of any functionality in vehicle control systems that limits or prevents the proper operation of vehicles, as well as limiting the group of entities that can provide maintenance or repair services," Newag's statement said. According to Newag, Dragon Sector's report shouldn't be trusted because it was commissioned by one of Newag's biggest competitors.</p>
<p>Dragon Sector maintains that the evidence supports its conclusions. Bazański <a href="https://social.hackerspace.pl/@q3k/111528162462505087?ref=404media.co">posted</a> on Mastodon that “these trains were locking up for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops. The manufacturer argued that this was because of malpractice by these workshops, and that they should be serviced by them instead of third parties." In some cases, Bazański wrote, Newag "appeared to be able to lock the train remotely.”</p>
<p>Newag has said that "any remote intervention" is "virtually impossible."</p>
<h2>Lawsuit threats fails to silence hackers</h2>
<p>Dragon Sector got the trains running after discovering "an undocumented ‘unlock code’ which you could enter from the train driver’s panel which magically fixed the issue," Dragon Sector's team told 404 Media.</p>
<p>Newag has maintained that it has never and will never "introduce into the software of our trains any solutions that lead to intentional failures."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"We do not know who interfered with the train control software, using what methods and what qualifications," Newag said. "We also notified the Office of Rail Transport about this so that it could decide to withdraw from service the sets subjected to the activities of unknown hackers."</p>
<p>Dragon Sector and SPS have denied interfering with the train's control systems.</p>
<p>While Newag has contacted authorities to investigate the hacking, Janusz Cieszyński, Poland’s former minister of digital affairs, <a href="https://twitter.com/jciesz/status/1732411016221524070?s=20">posted on X</a> that the evidence appears to weigh against Newag.</p>
<p>"The president of Newag contacted me," Cieszyński wrote. "He claims that Newag fell victim to cybercriminals and it was not an intentional action by the company. The analysis I saw indicated something else, but for the sake of clarity, I will write about everything.</p>
<p>Newag president Zbigniew Konieczek <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">said</a> that "no evidence was provided that our company intentionally installed the faulty software. In our opinion, the truth may be completely different—that, for example, the competition interfered with the software."</p>
<p>Konieczek also accused Cieszyński of disseminating "false and highly harmful information about Newag."</p>
<p>404 Media noted that Newag appeared to be following a common playbook in the right-to-repair world where manufacturers intimidate competitor repair shops with threatened lawsuits and unsubstantiated claims about safety risks of third-party repairs. So far, Dragon Sector does not appear intimidated, posting its success <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6vjhkLQpM">on YouTube</a> and discussing its findings at Poland’s Oh My H@ck conference in Warsaw. The group is also planning "a more detailed presentation" for the 37th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany, at the end of December, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/polish_trains_geofenced_allegation/">The Register reported</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the evidence gathered during their analysis, the Dragon Sector team has doubts about whether Newag will actually follow through with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>"Their defense line is really poor, and they would have no chance defending it," Kowalczk told 404 Media. "They probably just want to sound scary in the media.”</p>

<p>Our third film is from 1995, directed by Iain Softley.</p>



<p><em>Hackers</em> is about a group of teenage computer hackers, of the ethical / playful type who are driven by curiosity and cause no harm — well, not to anyone who doesn’t deserve it. One of these hackers breaks into the “Gibson” computer system of a high profile company and partially downloads what he thinks is an unimportant file as proof of his success. However this file is actually a disguised worm program, created by the company’s own chief of computer security to defraud the company of millions of dollars. The security chief tries to frame the hackers for various computer crimes to cover his tracks, so the hackers must break back into the system to download the full worm program and reveal the true culprit.</p>



<p>The film was made in the time before Facebook when it was common to have an online identity, or at least an online handle (nick), distinct from the real world. Our teenage hacker protagonists are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Crash Override, real name Dade.</li>



<li>Acid Burn, real name Kate.</li>



<li>Cereal Killer, Lord Nikon, and Phantom Phreak, real names not given.</li>



<li>Joey, the most junior, who doesn’t have a handle yet.</li>
</ul>



<p>As hackers they don’t have a corporate budget, so use a variety of personal computers rather than the expensive SGI workstations we saw in the previous films. And since it’s the 1990s, their network connections are made with modems over the analog phone system and important files will fit on 1.44 megabyte floppy disks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Gibson, though, is described as “big iron”, a corporate supercomputer. Again this was the 1990s when a supercomputer would be a single very big and very expensive computer, not thousands of PC CPUs and GPUs jammed into racks as in the early 21st C. A befitting such an advanced piece of technology it has a three dimensional file browsing interface which is on display both times the Gibson is hacked.</p>



<h2>First run</h2>



<p>The first hack starts at about 24 minutes. Junior hacker Joey&nbsp; has been challenged by his friends to break into something important such as a Gibson. The scene starts with Joey sitting in front of his Macintosh personal computer and reviewing a list of what appear to be logon or network names and phone numbers. The camera flies through a stylised cyberspace representation of the computer network, the city streets, then the physical rooms of the target company (which we will learn is Ellingson Minerals), and finally past a computer operator sitting at a desk in the server room and into the 3D file system. This single “shot” actually switches a few times between the digital and real worlds, a stylistic choice repeated throughout the film. Although never named in the film this file system is the “City of Text” according to the closing credits.</p>

<p>The file system is represented as a virtual cityscape of skyscraper-like blocks. The ground plane looks like a printed circuit board with purple traces (lines). The towers are simple box shapes, all the same size, as if constructed from blue tinted glass or acrylic plastic. Each of the four sides and the top shows a column of text in white lettering, apparently the names of directories or files. Because the tower sides are transparent the reverse facing text on the far sides is also visible, cluttering the display.</p>



<p>This 3D file system is the most dynamic of those in this review. Joey flies among the towers rather than walking, with exaggerated banking and tilting as he turns and dives. At ground level we can see some simple line graphics at the left as well as text.</p>

<p>The city of text is even busier due to animation effects. Highlight bars move up and down the text lists on some panes. Occasionally a list is cleared and redrawn top to bottom, while others cycle between two sets of text. White pulses flow along the purple ground lanes and fly between the towers. These animations do not seem to be interface elements. They could be an indicator of overall activity with more pulses per second meaning more data being accessed, like the blinking LED on your Ethernet port or disk drive. Or they could be a screensaver, as it was important on the CRT displays of the 1990s to not display a static image for long periods as it would “burn in” and become permanent.</p>



<p>Next there is a very important camera move, at least for analysing the user interface. So far the presentation has been fullscreen and obviously artificial. Now the camera pulls back slightly to show that this City of Text is what Joey is seeing on the screen of his Macintosh computer. Other shots later in the film will make it clear that this is truly interactive, he is the one controlling the viewpoint.</p>

<p>I’ll discuss how this might work later in the analysis section. For now it’s enough to remember that this is a true file browser, the 3D equivalent of the Macintosh Finder or Windows File Explorer.</p>



<p>While Joey is exploring, we cut to the company server room. This unusual activity has triggered an alarm so the computer operator telephones the company security chief at home. At this stage we don’t know that he’s evil, but he does demand to be addressed by his hacker handle “The Plague” which doesn’t inspire confidence. (The alarm itself shows that a superuser / root / administrator account is in use by displaying the <em>password</em> for everyone to see on a giant screen. But we’re not going to talk about that.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joey wants to prove he has hacked the Gibson by downloading a file, but by the ethics of the group it shouldn’t be something valuable. He selects what he thinks will be harmless, the garbage or trash directory on a particular tower. It’s not very clear but there is another column of text to the right which is dimmed out.</p>

<p>There’s a triangle to the right of the GARBAGE label indicating that it is a directory, and when selected a second column of text shows the files within it. When Joey selects one of these the system displays what today would be called a Live Tile in Windows, or File Preview in the Mac Finder. But in this advanced system it’s an elaborate animation of graphics and mathematical notation.</p>



<p>Joey decides this is the file he wants and starts a download. Since he’s dialled in through an old analog phone modem, this is a slow process and will eventually be interrupted when Joey’s mother switches his Macintosh off to force him to get some sleep.</p>

<h2>Physical View</h2>



<p>Back in the server room of Ellingson Minerals and while Joey is still searching, the security chief AKA “The Plague” arrives. And here we clearly see that there is also a <strong>physical 3D representation</strong> of the file system.</p>

<p>Just like the virtual display it is made up of rectangular towers made of blue tinted glass or plastic, arranged on a grid pattern like city skyscrapers. Each is about 3 metres high and about 50cm wide and deep. Again matching the virtual display, there is white text on all the visible sides, being updated and highlighted. However there is one noticeable difference, the bottom of each tower is solid black.</p>



<p>What are the towers for? Hackers is from 1995, when hard drives and networked file servers were shoebox- to pizza-box-sized, so one or two would fit into the base of each tower. The physical displays could be just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights"><strong>blinkenlights</strong></a>, an impressive but not particularly useful visual display, but in a later shot there’s a technician in the background looking at one of the towers and making notes on a pad, so they are intended to show something useful. My assumption is that each tower displays information about the actual files being stored inside, mirroring the virtual city of text shown online.</p>



<p>When he reaches the operator’s desk, The Plague switches the big wall display to the same 3D virtual file system.</p>

<p>He uses an “echo terminal” command to see exactly what Joey is doing, so sees the same garbage directory and that the file is being copied. We’ll later learn that this seemingly harmless file is actually the worm program created by The Plague, and that discovering it had been copied was a severe shock. Here he arranges for the phone connection to be traced and Joey questioned by his government friends in the US Secret Service (which at the time was responsible for investigating some computer security incidents and crimes), setting in motion the main plot elements.</p>

<h2>Second run</h2>



<p>After various twists and turns our teenage hackers are resolved to hack into the Gibson again to obtain a full copy of the worm program which will prove their innocence. But they also know that The Plague knows they know about the worm, Ellingson Minerals is alerted, and the US Secret Service are watching them. This second hacking run starts at about 1 hour 20 minutes.</p>



<p>The first step is to evade the secret service agents by a combination of rollerblading and hacking the traffic lights. (Scenes like this are why I enjoy the film so much.) Four of our laptop-wielding hackers dial in through public phone booths. The plan is that Crash will look for the file while Acid, Nikon, and Joey will distract the security systems, and they are expecting additional hacker help from around the world.</p>



<p>We see a repeat of the earlier shot flying through the streets and building into the City of Text, although this time on Crash’s Macintosh Powerbook.</p>

<p>It seems busier with many more pulses travelling back and forth between towers, presumably because this is during a workday.</p>



<p>The other three start launching malware attacks on the Gibson. Since the hacking attempt has been anticipated, The Plague is in the building and arrives almost immediately.</p>

<p>The physical tower display now shows a couple of blocks with red sides. This could indicate the presence of malware, or just that those sections of the file system are imposing a heavy CPU or IO load due to the malware attacks.</p>



<p>This time The Plague is assisted by a full team of technicians. He primarily uses a “System Command Shell” within a larger display that presumably shows processor and memory usage. It’s not the file system, but has a similar design style and is too cool not to show:</p>

Other possible matches in cyan on towers to the right. <em>Hackers</em> (1995)</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s happening here? Most likely Crash has typed in a search wildcard string and the file browser is showing the matching files and folders.</p>



<p>Why are there multiple garbage directories? Our desktop GUIs always show a single trashcan, but under the hood there is more than one. A multiuser system needs at least one per user, because otherwise files deleted by Very Important People working with Very Sensitive Information would be visible, or at least the file names visible, to everyone else. Portable storage devices, floppy disks in Hackers and USB drives today, need their own trashcan because the user might still expect to be able to undelete files even if it has been moved to another computer. For the same reason a networked drive needs its own trashcan that isn’t stored on the connecting computer. So Crash really does have to search for the right garbage directory in this giant system.</p>



<p>As hackers from around the world join in, the malware effects intensify. More tower faces, both physical and digital, are red. The entire color palette of the City of Text becomes darker.</p>

<p>This could be an automatic effect when the Gibson system performance drops below some threshold, or activated by the security team as the digital equivalent of traffic cones around a door. Anyone familiar with the normal appearance of the City of Text can see at a glance that something is wrong and, presumably, that they should log out or at least not try to do anything important.</p>



<p>Crash finds the right file and starts downloading, but The Plague hasn’t been fully distracted and uses his System Command Shell to disconnect Crash’s laptop entirely. Rather than log back in, Crash tells Joey to download the worm and gives him the full path to the correct garbage directory, which for the curious is root/.workspace/.garbage (the periods are significant, meaning these names should not normally be displayed to non-technical users).</p>



<p>We don’t see how Joey enters this into the file browser but there is no reason it should be difficult. Macintosh Finder windows have a clickable text search box, and both the Ubuntu Desktop Shell and Microsoft Windows start screen will automatically start searching for files and folders that match any typed text.</p>



<p>Joey downloads the worm, this time all of it. The combined malware attacks crash The Gibson. Unfortunately the secret service agents arrive just in time to arrest them, but all ends well with The Plague being exposed and arrested and our hacker protagonists released.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>



<h3>How believable is the interface?</h3>



<p>The City of Text has two key differences from the other 3D file browsers we’ve seen so far.</p>



<ol>
<li>&nbsp;It must operate over a network connection, specifically over a phone modem connection, which in the 1990s would be much slower than any Ethernet LAN.</li>



<li>This 3D view is being rendered on personal computers, not specialised 3D workstations.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Despite these constraints, the City of Text remains reasonably plausible.</p>



<p>Would the City of Text require more bandwidth than was available? What effect would we expect from a slow network connection? It’s a problem when <em>copying</em> files, upload or download, but much less so for <em>browsing</em> a file system. The information being passed from the Gibson to the 3D file browser is just a list of names in each directory and a minimal set of attributes for each, not the file contents. In 1995 2D file browsers on personal computers were already showing icons, small raster images, for each file which took up more memory than the file names. The City of Text doesn’t, so the file data would certainly fit in the bandwidth available.</p>



<p>The flying viewpoint doesn’t require much bandwidth either. There is no avatar or other representation of the user, just an abstract viewpoint. Only 9 numbers are needed to describe where you are and what you’re looking at in 3D space, and predictive techniques developed for games and simulations can reduce the network bandwidth required even more.</p>



<p>Networked file systems and file browsers already existed in 1995, for example FTP and Gopher, although with pure text interfaces rather than 3D or even 2D graphics. The only missing component would be the 3D viewpoint coordinates.</p>



<p>PCs in the 1990s, especially laptops, rarely had any kind of 3D graphics acceleration and would not have been able to run the Jurassic Park or Disclosure 3D file browsers. The City of Text, though, is much less technically demanding even though it displays many more file and folder names.</p>



<p>Notice that there is no hidden surface removal, where the front sides of a 3D object hide those that are further away. There’s no lighting, with everything rendered in flat colors that don’t depend on the direction of the sun or other light sources, and no shadows. There are no images or textures, just straight lines and plain text. And finally everything is laid out on an axis-aligned grid; meaning all the graphics are straight up/down, left/right, or forwards/back; and all the towers and text are the same size. Similar shortcuts were used in 1990s PC games and demo scene animations, such as the original Doom in which players could look from side to side but not up or down.</p>



<p>I’m not saying that the City of Text on a 1990s PC or laptop would be <em>easy</em>, especially on Joey’s Macintosh LC, but it is plausible.</p>



<p>Alas the worm animation shown when that particular file is selected is <em>not</em> possible. We see fractal graphics and mathematical notation in 3D, and it’s a full screen image rather than a simple file icon. Whether it’s a pre-rendered animation or being generated on the fly there’s way too much to push through a modem connection, even though at the time “full screen” meant a lot less pixels than now in the 21st C.</p>



<p>The physical towers were also not possible. Three metre high flat screen displays didn’t exist in 1995, and I don’t see how that many projectors could be installed in the ceiling without interfering with each other.</p>



<h3>How well does the interface inform the narrative of the story?</h3>



<p><em>Hackers</em> is a film all about computers and the people who work with them, and therefore must solve the problem (which still exists today) of making what is happening visible and understandable to a non-technical audience. Director Iain Softley said he wanted a metaphorical representation of how the characters perceived the digital world, not a realistic one. Some scenes use stylised 2D graphics and compositing to create a psychedelic look, while the 3D file browser is meant to be a virtual equivalent to the physical city of New York where Hackers is set. At least for some viewers, myself included, it works.</p>



<p>The worm animation also works well. Joey is looking for an interesting file, a trophy, and the animation makes it clear that this is indeed an extraordinary file without needing to show the code.</p>



<p>The physical towers, though, are rather silly. The City of Text is meant to be metaphorical, a mental landscape created by hackers, so we don’t need a physical version.</p>



<h3>How well does the interface equip the character to achieve their goals?</h3>



<p>The City of Text is very well suited to the character goals, because they are exploring the digital world. Looking cool and having fun are what’s important, not being efficient.</p>



<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a rollerblading lesson before the next review…</p>

<p>A former Facebook diversity program manager pleaded guilty to scamming the social media giant out of more than $4 million through a scheme in which she faked business deals in exchange for kickbacks, the Justice Department said.</p>



<p>Barbara Furlow-Smiles, who served as lead strategist and global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, used the stolen funds to live an extravagant lifestyle that spanned from California to Georgia, prosecutors said.</p>



<p>From approximately January 2017 to September 2021, Furlow-Smiles led Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs at Facebook and was responsible for developing and executing DEI initiatives, operations, and engagement programs,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/former-global-diversity-executive-facebook-pleads-guilty-defrauding-company-out-more-4?te=1&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dk_20231213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>



<p>The feds said Furlow-Smiles, who had access to company credit cards and the ability to approve invoices as part of her role at the company, “caused Facebook to pay numerous individuals,” including her friends and relatives, “for goods and services never provided to the company.” </p>



<p>Those individuals would later funnel kickbacks to Furlow-Smiles. </p>

<p>Those allegedly recruited to participate in the kickback&nbsp;scheme included some of Furlow-Smiles’ former interns, her “university tutor,” a hair stylist, babysitters and nannies, the feds said. </p>



<p>It’s unclear if any of Furlow-Smiles’ associates are being charged in connection to the case. </p>



<p>The Post has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.</p>



<p>She also misled Facebook into sending money to entities that did not provide kickbacks, including nearly $10,000 to an artist who created specialty portraits and more than $18,000 to a unnamed preschool.</p>

<p>To avoid scrutiny, Furlow-Smiles would submit fake expense reports claiming that the individuals were vendors at Facebook events who had helped with marketing or provided merchandise.</p>



<p>Furlow-Smiles “abused a position of a trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” US Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan said in a statement after she pleaded guilty in a Georgia court Tuesday.</p>



<p>“Motivated by greed, she used her time to orchestrate an elaborate criminal scheme in which fraudulent vendors paid her kickbacks in cash,” Buchanan added. “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.”</p>



<p>FBI Special Agent Keri Farley said, “Furlow-Smiles used lies and deceit to defraud both vendors and Facebook employees.”</p>

<p>The DOJ noted that Meta had “provided valuable assistance and cooperation during the investigation.”</p>



<p>“We are cooperating with law enforcement on the case regarding this former program manager, and we will continue to do so,” Meta said in a statement.</p>



<p>The DOJ said Furlow-Smiles ran a two-pronged scheme to defraud Facebook. She would pay associates using apps like Venmo and PayPal that were linked to her company credit cards and submit fake expense reports related to those transactions.</p>

<p>The associates – most of whom were reportedly unaware that the funds was coming from Facebook – would return the money to Furlow-Smiles in cash or via account transfer. The feds’ release noted that the cash was sometimes delivered to Furlow-Smiles wrapped up in T-shirts or other items.</p>



<p>For the second part of her scheme, Furlow-Smiles steered Facebook toward using businesses owned by her friends. </p>







<p>Once Facebook had signed off on the deals, she would purportedly approve “fraudulent and inflated invoices” on behalf of the vendors in exchange for kickbacks.</p>



<p>Furlow-Smiles is slated to be sentenced on March 19, 2024.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4 translated="">Discover more from Everything Is An Emergency</h4><p>I'm Bess Stillman: an ER doctor, writer, and wife to Jake Seliger, who is currently dying of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Here you'll find essays about life, death, cancer, love, health and healthcare. </p><p>Over 1,000 subscribers</p> </div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Jake shows me a photograph from 2015</strong><span>: we’re smiling in the dim light of Back 40, an East Village restaurant. The weather is humid and my hair is explosively curly, a wild tendril dipping into the glass of green chartreuse Jake is raising towards the camera, while his other arm extends to take the selfie. We look like two happy people who aren’t good at holding their liquor (we’re not: it was only our second drink and we were tipsy); people who’re blissfully ignorant that their lives </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/" rel="">will be destroyed in 2022</a><span>.</span></p><p>Jake’s the documentarian of our lives: he has hard drives with gigabytes of photographs spanning our 15 years together. I have a terrible memory yet rarely compensate by shooting the picture or pressing record or keeping a journal. Memory is my limitation, so I forget to adapt. Swaths of my own past are lit, if at all, by a perpetual twilight. Then Jake sends me a photo and reminds me of its origin—“this was the dinner when you refused to sit facing the stuffed boar’s head on the wall because it watched you while you ate his friend”—and the past is suddenly illuminated; I am suddenly illuminated, and the reminder feels like physical relief, like finding a word I’ve struggled to recall then it appears fully formed in my mind.</p><p><span>When </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">Jake’s cancer recurred</a><span> two months after </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/09/09/life-swallowing-tasting-and-speaking-after-a-total-glossectomy-meaning-i-have-no-tongue/" rel="">the May 25 salvage surgery</a><span> that was supposed to save his life, I became obsessed with making videos of us, which I’d be able to watch after he’s gone. Most days in early August, Jake sat on the left side of the living room couch, recovering from chemo, with “Liquid Hope™”</span><a href="#_ftn1" rel="">[1]</a><span> infusing into his PEG tube, while friends, family and I gathered around him. I’d lean my cell phone against the bookshelf opposite his seat and pressed record, letting it run for hours, hoping to document meaningful looks between us, comforting words, “I love yous” exchanged. I was anxious to achieve the impossible task of capturing the essence of our life together. The videos would be an insurance policy against future loneliness and grief, and an insurance policy against forgetting.</span></p><p><span>I’ve talked to friends who’ve lost a spouse, sometimes to death and sometimes to savage divorce, and they universally say that one of the unexpectedly hardest things is not being able to ask: Remember that one place? Or that time? Remember when I…? </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/23/seeing-as-a-doctor-seeing-as-a-wife/" rel="">I’ve written that</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>When Jake looks at me, he sees me at 25, showing up to our first date in a grey mini-dress, black boots and red lipstick. He sees me at 29 in a striped bra and panty set in our 35th story Seattle hotel room, pressing me against the cold glass. And he also sees me as I am now. I’m all these ages at once, as he is to me. Love isn’t just blind to ugliness, but to decay. Look at two 80-year-olds gazing at each other like teenagers and you’ll know what I mean. </p><p><span>When I lose Jake, I’ll lose someone ever seeing me throughout all my ages again. I’ve said that&nbsp;</span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">parts of me will die with him</a><span>, and I don’t just mean parts of my heart and the parts of my personality that act in relation to his. I mean entire eras of my life, all the views he was privy to, and therefore, much of my youth, goes as well. No one—even if I find love again one day, as Jake has urged me to do—will ever look at me at see me at 32, skinny dipping on a trip to Gunnison nude beach in New Jersey with a group of friends, laughing at how cold the water is under the sun of a hot summer day.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>&nbsp;I forget so easily, and we’ve spent so long existing in relation to each one another that, just as we made the memories together, we need to remember them together to recall them fully. At least, I do. Jake’s memories of me are also proof of my continuity, like Bitcoin is proof of work. I’m reminded of the concept of “continuers” or “dividers,” which </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you" rel="">Joshua Rothman wrote about</a><span> in the </span><em>New Yorker</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Does the self you remember feel like you, or like a stranger? Do you seem to be remembering yesterday, or reading a novel about a fictional character? If you have the former feelings, you’re probably a continuer; if the latter, you’re probably a divider.</p></blockquote><p>Since Jake’s May 25 surgery and diagnosis of recurrence and metastases on July 21, there has been a distinct sense of division between the person I was before I had a dying husband and the person I am now. Before, I had a more fluid, tenuous sense of chronoception: I’d think something that happened 5 years ago happened 3 months ago, or that 20 minutes had passed when three hours had. Today, the life we lived before Jake’s terminal diagnoses feels distant and surreal, like it belongs to another time—like it was lived by other people.</p><p><span>I try to be gentle when I think about that past me who left all those years unrecorded, but it’s hard not to get upset with the losses, like the hundreds of hours Jake spent reading to me from </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span> and Elmore Leonard before bed, the way his hands look when he chops vegetables, the excited way he’d point out electric bicycles, the gentle lift to his old voice when he’s teasing me, that smirk. Rationally, I know it’s unreasonable to have expected that I’d document our entire lives in preparation for later review, in the event of Jake’s premature death. That kind of behavior earns you a visit to a mental healthcare professional and some high dose prescription anxiolytics, not a gold star for foresight. Still, that’s tens of thousands of hours of my life left to memory. Which, for me, means much of it has been left behind.</span></p><p><span>Knowing that I’ll at least get Jake’s digital photographic archive, I’ve tried to focus on remembering things that can’t be captured on video, things that might one day flood my sense of recall. When he wraps his arm around me at night, I’ll press my body against his and deeply inhale his scent, feeling the gentle kick of his heart beneath my ear, the way the curve of my body feels warmer along the edge where we touch. It reminds me of so many similar nights, and I try to impress the sensations into my brain. During the few times we’ve had to spend nights apart recently, like when </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/12/07/tentative-fluttering-optimism-the-surprising-hot-r-d-ferment-in-head-and-neck-cancer-treatment/" rel="">he went to MD Anderson in Houston</a><span> to establish care, I’ve tried curling up on Jake’s side of the bed and recalling the exact feeling of being beside him. I sleep where he sleeps. I slip on one of his nightshirts. The individual pieces meant to trigger a sense memory are there, but the actual feeling is out of reach, since Jake is out of reach; like any intoxicant or peak experience, you can’t fully inhabit it unless you’re actually under its direct influence, not the memory of the influence.</span></p><p><span>The only person who’ll</span><strong> </strong><span>be able to make me feel better, and tell me what I need to hear after Jake is gone, is Jake, which is a serious temporal problem. So I’ve asked him to make me a video library consisting of short, topical clips I can play in response to specific future feelings or situations. Like if I’m anxious before bed—I’m a terrible sleeper—Jake’s made a video titled &nbsp;“for when you’re feeling anxious before bed and need me to help you relax” video. There’s another for when I’m stressed at work, and another for when I’m feeling bad about my writing. There’s a video for when I feel alone, or when I need to hear he loves me, or just be told that he believes I can make it through the day. We brainstormed a list, heavy on reassurance and comfort. We often make them together.</span></p><p>I’ve guessed at other future scenarios, too. I’ve requested a video for when I get really sick or injured, and others, like one where he &nbsp;talks &nbsp;me down when our future child or children are assaulting my last nerve. Now that Jake has completed the initial, more general list, figuring out &nbsp;topics I want addressed in new videos is getting harder. I keep getting stuck, paralyzed by choice, because I’m trying to bring Jake—or at least videos of Jake—into a future that doesn’t exist yet, and to do that successfully means anticipating every conceivable future. Impossible, I know. “Do you want one in case aliens land in Phoenix and you’re trying to decide if you should or shouldn’t accept the probe?” Jake asks, only half joking. And I say “yes,” because no matter the future, I’ll want him to make me laugh. Also, I’m curious which way he thinks I should go.</p><p><strong>The paralysis I feel isn’t unearned.</strong><span> Misprediction is common (</span><a href="https://www.sintetia.com/robin-hanson-full-interview-about-prediction-markets" rel="">that’s why prediction markets are useful</a><span>). Most humans are terrible at prediction. I’m a perfect example.&nbsp;I know I’m going to get my future self wrong, because I’ve been getting her wrong my entire life. Consider: </span></p><ul><li><p>When I was 8, I wanted to be on Broadway. Broadway was my destiny. This was pre-internet, otherwise known as “the Dark Ages,” so I didn’t have a YouTube channel or an Instagram Reel to facilitate discovery and audience building. No, I did it the old-fashioned “weird kid” way: I stood on the fake boulders that decorated the inside of the “mall” housing the post office and thrift store in my rural Arizona town and belted my little heart out, anticipating that a New York City director would come by and pluck me out of obscurity and dash me off to the theater. I thought I’d sing forever. Instead, I quit choir my second year of high school.</p></li><li><p><span>When I was 12, I spent hours a day practicing classical piano, certain that adult-me would want to be a concert pianist (I didn’t realize the </span><a href="file:///Users/bess/Dropbox/Share%20With%20Jake/Bess%20and%20Jake%20Writing/VIdoes%20for%20future%20self/Gini%20coefficient" rel="">Gini coefficient</a><span> of the music world, or how few pianists can pay the rent). I was so enamored with sultry Rachmaninoff, with the way I was transformed while playing, that I never questioned if adult-me would want to teach lessons and struggle to find venues to perform, or, if I succeeded, what “success” would even look like. I hadn’t read Blair Tindall’s memoir </span><em>Mozart in the Jungle</em><span>, which didn’t yet exist. I couldn’t have anticipated that an injury to my arm would take me away from the keyboard, and that an interest in science meant that I’d only play for fun—and even then, less and less, as years pass. &nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span>At 22 I </span><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/on-writing-or-not" rel="">started an MFA program in fiction</a><span> writing because I was going to pen the great American novel, then maybe get a PhD in creative writing, which would inevitably win me a tenured professorship (it was 2008 when you </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2021/09/30/the-death-of-literary-culture/" rel="">could almost plausibly still believe</a><span> things like this). I’d wind up in a cute college town with four seasons and crunching fall leaves under my boots and live a cozy, creative life. A year later it dawned on me that academia was a crumbling tower, the people in my MFA program were curiously incurious about reading and writing, and how I imagined things might work was not how any of this was going to work. I fled.</span></p></li><li><p><span>At 23, I started med school, </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2012/10/20/why-you-should-become-a-nurse-or-physicians-assistant-instead-of-a-doctor-the-underrated-perils-of-medical-school/" rel="">an almost ridiculous act of hubris</a><span> in anticipating the needs of my 30-something self, who’d be responsible for the debt and bear the brunt of the time lost to working 80 hour weeks in a hospital. I wish I’d been able to travel to the future ask myself, at 39, if the choices were worth it. I wish I could ask my 50-year-old self the same question now.</span></p></li><li><p>Until 2020, I thought Jake and I would live in New York forever. New York is so fun! But, realistically, we stayed too long, our goals and priorities changed, and the cost and struggle of the city stopped outweighing the desire for a kid and to be close to family.</p></li></ul><p>Now I’m a 39-year-old ER doctor living in Arizona who likes playing guitar and writing nonfiction about medicine. There’s some continuity in my personality from childhood or adolescence to now, in that I’ve always enjoyed reading and a good story. I’m sensitive and quick to cry. I like a lot of physical affection. I’m prone to neuroticism but high in openness. I’m conscientious and don’t like authoritarian personalities. But I’ve changed a lot of what I once thought were “core” desires and loves. The details of what I’d do, who I’d be with, where I’d live and what my life would look like are nothing like I anticipated, even though past-me laid the groundwork of that future stranger’s life, which I’m currently living.</p><p><span>So when Jake asks me to provide him with a list of more topics for videos, Jake isn’t really asking: “What future situation do you want me to address on camera?” Instead, he’s asking: “Who will you be at 42, 50, 60, 80? What will you want? What will you want to hear from me?” And I have no idea, except that I’ll want </span><em>him</em><span> and he’ll be dead.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/remembering-things-that-havent-happened?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/remembering-things-that-havent-happened?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><strong>Researchers Gilbert, Quiodbach and Wilson </strong><span>coined a term called the “end of history illusion,”</span><strong> </strong><span>which describes people’s tendency to look back on the last ten or twenty years of their life and concede that they’ve changed a great deal. Yet when they’re asked to project how much they’ll change in the next decade, they tend to believe they’ll change much less, if at all, as if all their life was leading up to </span><em>this moment, </em><span>in which they’ve achieved peak selfhood.</span></p><blockquote><p>The illusion protects us…from realizing how transient our preferences and values are which might lead us to doubt every decision and generate anxiety.</p></blockquote><p><span>Sounds like the researchers </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reasons-Persons-Derek-Parfit/dp/019824908X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" rel="">read Derek Parfit</a><span>. I’m currently experiencing whatever the opposite of the “end of history illusion” is. Let’s call it: “The beginning of potentially infinite unknowable and yet inevitable futures reality.” Okay, that’s kind of a mouthful. I’m not good at pithy marketing slogans. Knowledge of Jake’s impending death brings with it the certainty that my life is about to undergo tremendous, nonconsensual upheaval, inevitably changing&nbsp; my preferences and values, though I don’t know any details </span><em>except</em><span> that I’ll change in likely vast and unexpected  ways. Without the comforting illusion of stasis, what can I do to assuage the anxiety caused by reality? That’s what the videos are for.</span></p><p><span>Put a person into an fMRI machine and ask them to think about their future selves, and their brains light up as if they' thinking about a stranger. The further out you ask someone to imagine, the more pronounced the effect becomes. Author </span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/why-people-are-so-bad-at-thinking-about-the-future.html" rel="">Jane McGonal</a><span> summarizes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Typically, when you think about yourself, a region of the brain known as </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RpQgBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=cortical+midline+self&amp;ots=il_ihlUghk&amp;sig=4d68_gag74AYNa5JgEKQVis4lHM#v=onepage&amp;q=cortical%20midline%20self&amp;f=false" rel="">the medial prefrontal cortex</a><span>, or MPFC, powers up. When you think about other people, it powers down. And if you feel like you don’t have anything in common with the people you’re thinking about? The MPFC activates even less…The further out in time you try to imagine your own life, the less activation you show in the MPFC. In other words, your brain acts as if your future self is someone you don’t know very well and, frankly, someone you don’t care about.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>There are supposed to be ways to improve your connection to your future self. One is to imagine as many details as possible, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3764505/" rel="">as a way of improving future-self “recognition”</a><span> There’s a part of the brain called the </span><em>dorsolateral</em><span> prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be the area where we do our most detailed simulations of long-range future. Unfortunately for me, Neuroscientist Daniel Schacter thinks </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2213" rel="">the same neural machinery that’s used for remembering the past may also be crucial for predicting the future</a><span>. For someone with my poor memory, that bodes ill.</span></p><p><span>If we employ the same neural machinery for remembering the past as we do for projecting into the future, then foresight is trying to remember something that hasn’t happened yet. Future projections rely on mental constructs&nbsp;based on past events, but what if the future is so outside our experience that we have no past experience on which to model it? What if the mothership lands and the being within demand that I take them to my leader? Or—more plausibly—what if Jake dies, and I’ve never before experienced the death of someone I’m close to? Training my brain to think of my future self as less of a stranger might succeed at improving my sense of empathy and kinship towards her, as well as feeling motivated to make choices to care for her, like, say, asking Jake to make her videos,but it doesn’t tell me what videos she’ll need to see. It doesn’t get me any closer to </span><em>knowing </em><span>her. All I do know is that there’ll come a moment when future me needs to hear Jake say the one thing that present me didn’t think to ask for. I’m sorry for that. But not as sorry as she’ll be.</span></p><p><strong>I’m hoping Jake will know me better than I know myself</strong><span>. It maybe be that I lack adequate foresight and insight because I’m too close to thestory, like editing this essay: I’ve read it too many times,I need outside input. Jake remembers the past me more clearlyand is more objective about my current self, so I assume he’ll do a better job at anticipating the me I’ll become. </span><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/forever-is-short-long-time" rel="">I’ve said that</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Although there are some consistencies with my personality, I’m not the same person I was 15 years-ago, and neither is Jake. Love changes all the time because we change. We’ve chosen—we have practiced—loving each other through all the people we have been: I’ve loved Jake at 25, when he was uncomfortable with intimacy (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkId=8f775a4af22edaf30d4ead9210aab520&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="">a childhood hangover</a><span>), and at 30, when his thirst for novelty blossomed, and at 39, when he is mature…. Jake and I have been together almost forty percent of our lives, and most of our adult lives. We’ve practiced the loss and rediscovery of each other so many times.</span></p></blockquote><p>And since he both loves me and is a novelist,&nbsp; I trust that he can make some good plot guesses; if anyone can anticipate what I’ll need to hear when I’m 70, it’s Jake. He’s started making &nbsp;new videos whenever something comes &nbsp;to mind, no matter how big or small: it might be him telling me his secret to seasoning beans from Rancho Gordo in the Instant Pot, or a memory of the first time we danced together, or just him saying hello. Some videos are set in futures he imagines for me, and maybe those will help me navigate my way forward into those futures. </p><p><span>Maybe, like all love letters (or love videos) we revisit years after receiving them, they momentarily bring us back to the self we were when they were created. They form a bridge between who we are now and who we were, and connect those pieces; seeing Jake on video will one day, finally, connect who I’ll become to who I am now. That’s the moment when those two selves will finally see each other clearly. That might be the thing future me will need most when things feel bleak: to remember that I was loved before, and I’m still loved, and Jake would tell me if only he were there. That he </span><em>is </em><span>telling me, because he recorded it. Maybe I’ll watch a video and think back on how lucky I was. How lucky we are right now.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformers are a class of autoregressive deep learning architectures which have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision, language, and robotics tasks. We revisit the problem of Kalman Filtering in linear dynamical systems and show that Transformers can approximate the Kalman Filter in a strong sense. Specifically, for any observable LTI system we construct an explicit causally-masked Transformer which implements the Kalman Filter, up to a small additive error which is bounded uniformly in time; we call our construction the Transformer Filter. Our construction is based on a two-step reduction. We first show that a softmax self-attention block can exactly represent a certain Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator. We then show that this estimator closely approximates the Kalman Filter. We also investigate how the Transformer Filter can be used for measurement-feedback control and prove that the resulting nonlinear controllers closely approximate the performance of standard optimal control policies such as the LQG controller.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Australia has become the first country to announce a ban on engineered stone following a surge in workers developing the lung disease silicosis.</p><section role="contentinfo" aria-label="key points" data-component="KeyPoints" data-uri="coremedia://teaser/103225906"><h2 data-component="Heading">Key points:</h2><ul

data-component="ListItem"><span></span>The material can be found in thousands of Australian bathrooms and kitchens</li><li data-component="ListItem"><span></span>Doctors and workers had called for the ban over health and safety concerns</li></ul></section><p>Commonwealth, state, and territory workplace ministers unanimously agreed to implement a national ban on the product at a long-awaited meeting on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The ban will start on July 1, 2024 in most states and territories.</p><p>The world-first decision comes after hundreds of workers developed silicosis from working on engineered stone, a popular material mostly used for kitchen benches and bathroom vanities.</p><p>Ministers also agreed to a "transition period" for engineered stone contracts entered into before the ban was announced, with arrangements to be finalised at a later meeting.</p><p>The federal government will also impose a ban on imported engineered stone to provide an "additional layer of enforcement and deterrence at the border", however the date has not been finalised yet.</p><p>Trade unions, health organisations and personal injury law firms have all welcomed the ban, saying it will save lives.</p><p>"Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it," Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said.</p><p>"With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?"</p><p>Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was "deeply disappointed" by the decision.</p><p>A spokesperson said the reasoning behind the decision was "flawed" and that singling out engineered stone would not eliminate the risk of silicosis in the workplace.</p><p>"Most importantly, it [the decision] fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates – poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards," they said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Popular material sparked a rise in lung disease</h2><p>Engineered stone, a durable and affordable alternative to natural materials like granite and marble, exploded in popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s.</p><p>However doctors began sounding the alarm after noticing a surge in stonemasons developing silicosis, a long-term and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224334" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224334"><img alt="A shiny white and grey kitchen

of their work lives.</p><p>"Some of these people with silicosis, they're extremely sick … we have a condition which caused them to become so short of breath it's hard to do just normal daily activities," he said.</p><p>Since the first Australian silicosis case linked to working on engineered stone was reported in 2015, hundreds more cases have emerged.</p><p>Unions joined doctors to campaign for a ban, arguing it could become the "asbestos of the 2020s" due to the risks it posed to workers' health.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">An 'important win for thousands of workers'</h2><p>Earlier this year workplace ministers tasked Safe Work Australia, a government WHS agency, with investigating how a ban could work and whether low-silica engineered stone could remain on the market safely.</p><p>The report found there was no safe level of silica, concluding: "The use of all engineered stone should be prohibited."</p><p>The CMFEU's Zach Smith said the nationwide ban would "stop the deadly scourge of silicosis in its tracks".</p><p>"This is an important win for the thousands of workers that have been forced to use this product, which has caused them to contract life-ending silicosis," he said.</p><p>"Let's be clear about this — the decision that's been made by the various levels of government today will save lives."</p><h2 data-component="Heading">'From the breadwinner to nothing'</h2><p>Safe Work found that while silicosis cases could emerge in several industries, the numbers were "disproportionate" among engineered stone workers.</p><p>Engineered stone workers also suffered a faster disease progression and were more likely to die from it, the report said.</p><p>The majority of engineered stone workers diagnosed with silicosis were under 35.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224134" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224134"><img alt="A man with brown hair lies in a hospital bed with

have been shattered by the disease.</p><p>They have told the ABC about its devastating consequences: struggling to breathe properly, needing lung transplants and facing an early death.</p><p>Former stonemason Ben Harrison, 34, was diagnosed with silicosis four years ago and told the ABC he supported a ban.</p><p>"I've gone from being the breadwinner of the house … to being nothing," he said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">More details to be worked out</h2><p>Workplace ministers are due to hold another meeting in March 2024 to work out details for the transition period for engineered stone contracts that have already been implemented.</p><p>Caesarstone said a transition period of six months would not be enough time to avoid "significant disruption" to the construction and homebuilding industry.</p><p>"A longer period [is] needed to ensure industry can meet the anticipated demand for substitute products and that fabricators with the necessary financial resources can retool and retrain employees to work on other products," a spokesperson said.</p><p>The Housing Industry Association said the ban had caused uncertainty and concern to the small businesses that supply engineered stone, adding that new machinery and alternative products would be needed.</p><p>"It is critical following today's decision that governments now prepare a detailed industry transition plan that addresses these and other key matters," association managing director Jocelyn Martin said.</p><p>Dr Hoy said broader change was needed to make sure a similar crisis did not happen again.</p><p>"We can't be waiting until people develop disease and they die from conditions related to work before we start acting," he said.</p><p>"We really need to change the ways to identify problems at work, and act before people become sick."</p></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- -->&nbsp;</span><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-12-13T06:20:27.000Z">20

The Pipe library has no select implementation, and adding one seems pretty complicated and requires changes to the library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Chan library (<a href="https://github.com/tylertreat/chan">https://github.com/tylertreat/chan</a>) is a C implementation of Go channels and shares the same goals as the present library.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A recurring theme for Bits about Money is that financial infrastructure is heavily path dependent. We’re (oft unknowingly) standing atop decades and centuries of work which came before. Sometimes, the specific contours of that work, and of decisions made decades ago, is a roadmap to what continues to work today and what doesn’t.</p><p>Let’s talk checks.</p><p><em>A brief programming note</em>: We're fast approaching the end of the year, and I still owe you all a few issues of Bits about Money, so you might be getting three issues or so prior to Christmas rather than the more typical publishing pace around here.</p><h2 id="a-brief-digression-for-people-who-use-functioning-payment-forms">A brief digression for people who use functioning payment forms</h2><p>Checks are the oldest form of widely deployed non-cash payments instruments. As we’ve covered previously, all a “payment” is in the payments industry is a message about the status of a debt. While almost all checks are pre-printed these days, the earliest ones were simply a handwritten letter to one’s banker, instructing him to pay money the bank owed to you to the party you named.</p><p>Checks became central to payment systems through a property called “negotiability.” The earliest checks look like a three-way transaction: buyer of a good or service (who wrote the check), seller (who turned the check into money), and the banker (who facilitated the transaction). It fairly quickly developed that checks were much more useful than this transaction appears on the surface: the person accepting the check <em>could sell it</em>, because the notion of a debt owed to you has value. This would allow them faster access to their cash and allow someone else an opportunity to profit from transactional friction, by reducing it.</p><p>There is a fascinating history of the negotiability of checks, of the deposits at different banks trading at varying (and constantly changing) discounts to par, and of checks being the primary form of paper money for more than a century in the United States. We’ll elide most of it here. Let’s focus on the most boring possible implication of negotiability: <em>your</em> bank should be willing to accept <em>that other</em> bank’s check.</p><p>That is an interesting usage of the word “should”, right? Should they, because it would be convenient to you? Or should they, because it is good business? Or should they, because other stakeholders in the financial system, like say the government, mandate it? Yes, in all these senses of the word “should.”</p><h2 id="check-settlement-in-the-pre-computer-era">Check settlement in the pre-computer era</h2><p>One of the most important standardizations that you’ve probably never thought of is the <a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/acts/ucc#:~:text=Summary,the%20interstate%20transaction%20of%20business."><u>Uniform Commercial Code</u></a>, which dates to the <em>late 1800s</em>. It was an early and extremely successful implementation of “model language” for statutes: each of the several United States was convinced to change local state law to match a change being made effectively simultaneously in every other state, without an explicit federal coordination mechanism.</p><p>The most lastingly important thing in the UCC is that it standardized checks. Instead of them being creatures of state contract law, dragging decades of precedent and complex bespoke negotiations behind every specimen, they became almost exactly describable by recounting a short description of the face of the check. We (very intentionally!) made checks “dumb” to allow the system around them to be much smarter.</p><p>The UCC facilitated banks clearing each others’ checks. (“Clearing” is a magic finance word. Clearing a check refers to completing the process which the check agrees to: the writer sees money leave their account and the person depositing the check sees it enter theirs. This is <em>much</em> more complicated than it sounds in this quick gloss.)</p><p>Note that “facilitated” does not imply “this then became very easy.” One infelicity which became increasingly stressed as improved transportation and communication technologies caused more commerce in the U.S. to be other-than-local: you had to physically move checks between banks to clear them. If there are two banks, then you need two messengers, each carrying a bag of checks once a day. If there are four banks, you need twelve messengers, because Bank A needs one each for B, C, and D, and each other bank needs the same. If there are thousands of banks, then each bank needs to… oh dear.</p><p>More than a century before we invented the computer science to describe what would have happened, we invented the solution to it: centralized clearinghouses. New York’s first was in the 1850s; London had already pioneered the mechanism a century earlier. Instead of your bank sending the check to the originating bank to clear it, it would send it to the central clearinghouse. Each bank thus only needs one messenger a day, not thousands. (As you can imagine, in the real world, there were actually multiple messengers carrying multiple bags. Still, the stylized truth of this is important.)</p><p>And thus we come to an important fact about the U.S. payments ecosystem: every way of moving money between banks was designed in relation to the capabilities necessary to facilitate nationwide clearing of paper checks. The most common method of interbank payments in the U.S. wears <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/history-nacha-and-ach-network"><u>this history</u></a> in its name: ACH stands for “Automated Clearing House.”</p><p>The historical timeline for interbank payment settlement in the U.S. comes to us, in a direct and at-times maddening fashion, from “How long did it take to move data between New York and San Francisco when the best available technology for this was rail networks, the transport protocol was handwritten paper, and the cloud computing was floors full of clerks doing repetitive mathematics using mechanical adding machines and AI (artisanal intelligence)?”</p><h2 id="some-funny-consequences-of-checks-underpinning-everything">Some funny consequences of checks underpinning everything</h2><p>Credit underlies much more than people generally believe it to. Checks are an unusually direct example of this. The capability to write checks requires a credit extension. The capability to accept checks requires a credit extension. Checks, by existing, promiscuously distribute credit. Promiscuously distributing credit has some knock-on consequences.</p><p>Consider the case where you pay for a basket of groceries with a check. (This probably strikes many in the audience as anachronistic. Work with me here because it’s actually terrifyingly relevant to modern payments systems.) At the point which you check out, you owe the grocery something, and promise to make good upon this debt. Retailers historically did a direct extension of credit at that point; users would settle up weeks or months later.</p><p>Checks move the extension of credit (in part!), from the store to the banking system. At the point which you write the check, the grocery has to make a decision whether to release your chicken, with <em>extremely imperfect</em> information. Your account may or may not have good funds in it presently; the store cannot know. More importantly, the store cannot know whether your account will have sufficient funds <em>when the check is presented</em> a few days in the future.</p><p>Why did we do this?! Why accept mere promises, promises conditional on unobservable future events? Because systematically taking relatively small amounts of risk created immense value. Groceries prefer selling more groceries to selling less. Extending consumers credit tends to increase the number of chicken breasts they consume at the margin. Consumers prefer to eat chicken versus going hungry. Chicken do not get a vote.</p><p>Note that the extension of credit is recursive and systemic here. The grocery store will issue paychecks; those paychecks each embody credit risk. (We will return to the fascinating topic of credit risk in payroll systems in a later issue.) That credit risk in part comes from the uncertainty as to whether your check for the chicken was good. The credit risk there comes from factors like your general capitalization, degree of conscientiousness regarding financial management, and whether <em>your</em> most recent paycheck is good. It is credit risk <em>all the way down</em>.</p><p>One control which we made for checks to reduce systemic risk continues to have consequences more than a century later. Most disagreements between you and a grocery store are beneath the notice of the law. If you and your grocery store have a disagreement <em>about a check specifically</em>, you can go to jail. The crime is sometimes called “uttering”, for charming historical reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>It is well within the norms of checking accounts for them to become overdrawn as e.g. users miscalculate the amount of money they have on deposit, timing issues with the posting of checks break in ways that are not perfectly predictable in advance, and users make mistakes. This is something that product managers at banks design into the unit economics of checking account. NSF (insufficient funds) fees were for at least two decades or so an important part of the revenue mix.</p><p>We arrested and jailed, and continue to arrest and jail, at least some people for something which looks very, very similar to what earns other people a $30 NSF fee. (And, of course, if you’re a desirable banking customer, they’ll waive that fee because the waiver is simply good business.) In theory, uttering is distinguished from simple overdrafting by there being an element of intent to defraud. <em>In practice</em>, uttering is when you’re a poor person using a checking account and a string of people reviewing your behavior view it unsympathetically. If a grocery store loss prevention employee, a police officer, and a prosecutor each refuse to stop the process, NSF means you’re Now Somebody's Felon.</p><p>Sometimes your behavior will look unsympathetic because you are a poor person. Sometimes your behavior will look unsympathetic because you definitely were trying to pull one over on the grocery store. Sometimes your behavior will look unsympathetic because you have done this many, many times before. Sometimes these are all the same picture.</p><p>Phrased that way, it sounds almost fantastically unjust. And… it’s complicated. Many people, of all social classes, consumed many chickens obtained on credit because certain specially-formatted pieces of paper were believed to be money. That belief relied, in material part, on a state guarantee that they were money. That guarantee was backed by the state expressing substantial displeasure about the abuse of certain specially-formatted pieces of paper.</p><p>And from this follows an underappreciated consequence of modern financial infrastructure: credit cards and debit transactions make the economy more efficient. One way you can measure that efficiency gain is that their users <em>rarely go to jail</em>. Partly that is because you can do a near real-time prediction of whether the transaction has good funds behind it at the point-of-sale. Partly it is because we more fully move credit risk from the grocery store to the bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Society frequently considers the sophistication of different participants in determining their level of legal recourse. We consider grocery stores presumptively worthy of a relatively high degree of protection; we will jail someone over $20 of chicken. We consider banks usually capable of doing their own risk analyses, and if they make an underwriting decision that costs them $2,000, well, society assumes banks have people who are good at math. Part of that math is “credit card issuance is fantastically lucrative, in part because you can charge the grocery store when it sells chicken to someone using a credit card.” And so part of the cost of accepting credit cards is the cash rewards, part is for computers, and part pays for “not jailing poor people.”</p><h2 id="money-in-transit">Money in transit</h2><p>It’s useful to understand the historical physical reality of check clearing because we loved this model so much we re-used it for most later forms of payments. Banks which routinely cleared checks from particular other banks, due to geographic proximity or because they were large institutions in e.g. New York, would open correspondent account relationships with each other. A correspondent relationship is simply a bank having a bank account inside another bank. Bankers historically use Latin to make this sound more complicated than it is. (For shibboleth value: <em>nostro</em> is “our account at your bank”, <em>vostro</em> is “your account at our bank.”)</p><p>This made collecting payment more efficient: instead of frequently having money move between banks, you could total up all of the incoming payments (checks presented by your customers drawn against the other bank today), total up all of the previous period’s outgoing payments (checks presented by the other bank’s customers drawn against you a while ago), “net” those against each other, and then make a single internal accounting entry against your correspondent’s vostro. Your two banks would then only periodically rebalance where they held their money, which in the old days involved sometimes literally sending a stagecoach over with gold or silver and in more recent days would typically take the form of a wire transfer.</p><p>This relationship decreases the amount of money in transit at any given time, which has important operational efficiencies and decreases credit risk. We have made many, many more improvements over the years.</p><p>One intellectually interesting one: the <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/exam/check21/check21foundationdoc.htm"><u>Check 21 Act</u></a> was designed to bring check clearing into the 21st century. The most important part of it was bulldozing a coordination problem: banks were split on whether the paper part of paper checks actually mattered or not. Check 21 said definitively “Your opinion as a bank is irrelevant: an electronic reproduction of a check is the same as a check. If you absolutely need physical paper, your counterparties are allowed to write that electronic reproduction onto completely new physical paper then send it to you.”</p><p>Why did we do this? Because it <em>greatly</em> speeds up presenting checks for payment. They get scanned in at one institution then transmitted <em>electronically and not physically</em> to the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse then will generally electronically send it to the institution the check is drawn on. This can save <em>literally days</em>. It is another step in making checks dumber to make the surrounding system smarter: the check is almost entirely vestigial at this point.</p><p>So how could anyone have been against this? In a recurring theme for this column, many small banks didn’t believe that they had the prompt technical capacity to receive their checks reliably electronically. It was 2003, a surprising portion of small banks still had immaterial usage of the Internet in their operations. Most of them did not own their technical destiny but rather are at the mercy of various vendors. (Plus ça change.)</p><p>Check 21 said “OK, the rest of the industry hears that explanation, and we actually sympathize a bit, but we won’t let you block an industry-wide improvement. We will instead give you a carve-out: you and you alone will still get the daily delivery of a lot of paper. It will just be new paper, with substitute checks printed on it, from a printer we have arranged to locate very close to your check processing address. We will legally compel you to treat that paper exactly like the special magically formatted check paper. You are very good at processing that sort of paper, because you’ve done so for decades; even though you are small, you are still a bank and still operationally competent.”</p><p>More interestingly to most readers of this column, Check 21 also paved the way for remote check deposit as a product. Your bank’s mobile app very likely allows you to take a picture of a check to deposit it. This desirable user experience would be much less possible if the mobile app had to, after you had taken a photo, read the routing number and tell you “Actually, sorry about this: <em>that</em> bank needs the check presented physically to pay it. We understand you’re angry at us, because we’re <em>your</em> bank, but this is out of our hands.”</p><p>That sounds crazy, right? But you’re dealing with that exact argument today for why you mostly can’t do instantaneous payments between U.S. banks. The system which would allow it (<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/about.html"><u>FedNow</u></a>) is opt-in for both sending institutions and receiving institutions. There are legitimate and heady reasons why some financial institutions think operational and risk issues would make supporting FedNow very difficult for them to tackle. With those institutions as holdouts, the network graph of “Who could you send money to from your current bank account?” is currently <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/organizations"><u>very sparse</u></a>. This makes it less likely for your bank to both a) decide to join as a sender and b) actually expose that sending capability in the app, because they know it will generate annoyed customers and little else. Instead, they’ll continue pushing you to (slower) ACH payments and (broadly worse) Zelle payments. (An in-depth description of why Zelle is not a particularly good product qua bank payments will probably have to wait for another day.)</p><h2 id="deposit-accounts-and-their-discontents">Deposit accounts and their discontents</h2><p>A final funny wrinkle for the moment: the “standard” bank account in the United States is a checking account. (This is not true internationally; checking accounts are sufficiently weird in e.g. Japan that if you have one you’re assumed to be much closer to Toyota than to a natural human. Having a checking account is considered weird because Japan has its own quite path-dependent history in the coevolution of bank accounts and business practices. Back home, checks are used almost exclusively for large commercial transactions and routine person-to-business or business-to-person payments happen via e.g. instantaneous bank transfers.)</p><p>Since the standard U.S. bank account is a checking account, <em>even if it cannot write checks</em>, it is necessarily a credit product. Banks must <em>manage</em> credit risk. This makes opening up standard bank accounts far higher ceremony than it is in many peer nations. You can (easily) be declined services, for example because your previous use of bank accounts landed you in ChexSystems, an industry-wide niche credit reporting agency which basically exists solely to blacklist people from accessing checking accounts in the future.</p><p>This is not simply because banks hate poor people and want them to suffer. Routine use of a bank account in the United States will not infrequently cause a credit loss. Margins on small bank accounts are very thin; credit losses can easily be larger than several years of them. Some people will walk away from that credit loss, in which case the bank (basically) eats it. One choice which keeps bank accounts broadly available to people, including people who do not have demonstrable assets or credit history, is defaulting to not handing out bank accounts to people who demonstrably cause credit losses and then walk away from them. </p><p>And so people, including in the financial industry, who want to provide financial services to people in economic precarity run headlong into this. "Creditworthy" sounds like a value judgement but is, simultaneously, just a prediction about the weather. Some places see more rain; some customers see more credit losses.  Frequently advocates who want to bank the un- or underbanked <em>are also simultaneously</em> furious at the banking industry for improvidently extending credit.</p><p>How have we dealt with this? We have seen a fascinating boom in products which exist along a spectrum from “definitely not a bank account but has some characteristics you’d associate with one” to “a full, traditional checking account.” We’ll cover that another day.</p>

                <p>
                Recent techniques for real-time view synthesis have rapidly advanced in
                fidelity and speed, and modern methods are capable of rendering
                near-photorealistic scenes at interactive frame rates. At the same time, a
                tension has arisen between explicit scene representations amenable to
                rasterization and neural fields built on ray marching, with state-of-the-art
                instances of the latter surpassing the former in quality while being
                prohibitively expensive for real-time applications. In this work, we introduce
                SMERF, a view synthesis approach that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
                real-time methods on large scenes with footprints <b>up to 300 m^2 at a volumetric
                resolution of 3.5 mm^3</b>. Our method is built upon two primary contributions: a
                hierarchical model partitioning scheme, which increases model capacity while
                constraining compute and memory consumption, and a distillation training
                strategy that simultaneously yields high fidelity and internal consistency. Our
                approach enables full six degrees of freedom (6DOF) navigation within a web
                browser and <b>renders in real-time on commodity smartphones and laptops</b>.
                Extensive experiments show that our method exceeds the current state-of-the-art
                in real-time novel view synthesis by <b>0.78 dB on standard benchmarks and 1.78 dB
                on large scenes</b>, renders frames three orders of magnitude faster than
                state-of-the-art radiance field models, and achieves real-time performance
                across a wide variety of commodity devices, including smartphones.

                        <b>(a)</b>: We model large multi-room scenes with a number of independent submodels, each of which is
                        assigned to a different region of the scene.  During rendering the submodel is picked
                        based on camera origin. <b>(b)</b>: To model complex view-dependent effects, within each submodel
                        we additionally instantiate grid-aligned copies of deferred MLP parameters \(\theta\). These
                        parameters are trilinearly interpolated based on camera origin \(\mathbf{o}\).
                        <b>(c)</b>: While each submodel represents the entire scene, only the submodel's assiociated grid cell
                        is modelled with high resolution, which is realized by contracting the submodel-specific local coordinates.

                    We demonstrate that image fidelity can be greatly boosted via distillation. We first train a
                    state-of-the-art offline radiance field (Zip-NeRF). We then use the RGB color predictions \(\mathbf{c}\) of this teacher
                    model as supervision for our own model. Additionally, we access the volumetric density values \(\tau\) of the
                    pre-trained teacher by minimizing the discrepancy of volume rendering weights between teacher and student.

Then comes a deafening rumble like an approaching freight train, the terrifying screech of nails being ripped from wooden boards and unpredictable thuds from flying debris. These are the sounds often <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/tornado-survivors">described by tornado survivors recounting their escape</a> from these storms.</p>
<p>They rarely have much warning, but it is often enough to save lives.</p>
<p>There's another sound, however, that accompanies tornadoes that we can't hear. It is so low in frequency it is beyond the realms of human hearing, but it could offer a way of providing earlier, more accurate warnings of these destructive storms.</p>
<p>With winds that <a href="https://wmo.asu.edu/content/tornado-highest-recorded-wind-speed-tornado-doppler-radar">can reach up to 483km/h (300 mph)</a>, the storms that produce tornadoes generate low frequency sound waves – or infrasound – that can travel for hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>Eavesdropping on these infrasound signals may not be able to prevent tornadoes from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-65208609">flattening towns</a> and tossing cars into the air like toys, but it could lead to a new type of early warning system that might save lives.</p>
<p><strong>Shaky predictions</strong></p>
<p>Around <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/">1,200 tornadoes leave trails of destruction</a> in the US in an average year, with most occurring on the Great Plains of the central US. (<em>Read about </em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230616-how-tornado-alley-is-changing"><em>how tornado alley is changing</em></a>.) They <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/237409/economic-damage-caused-by-tornadoes-in-us/">cause millions, and in some years, billions of dollars-worth of damage</a> annually and claim an average of <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/12/1?fatalities=false&amp;mean=true">87 lives a year since 1951</a> (although the number of fatalities varies wildly from year to year). According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/ytd/11?fatalities=true">76 people have died</a> in around <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/summary/">1400 tornadoes in the US</a> in 2023 so far. At least 26 people were killed in Mississippi when a unusually long-lived tornado damaged more than <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65075276">2,000 homes along a 59 mile (94km) path</a>. In December, two people were killed – a mother and her two year old son – when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67667172">several powerful tornadoes tore across Tennessee</a>.</p>
<p>Yet twisters are notoriously difficult to forecast because we still don't have a clear picture of why they do and do not form. Even when they do form, the violent column of air behaves erratically.</p></div></div><div><p>Are tornadoes in the US getting worse?</p></div><div><p>For decades, meteorologists have struggled to identify which storms will produce tornadoes and which will not. Chris Nowotarski, associate professor in the department of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University says that while experts are "fairly good" at <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lmk/tornadoesfaq">predicting the large-scale conditions</a> that can produce tornadoes up to days in advance, predicting when and where specific tornadoes will form is more difficult. "Several storms that seem capable of producing a tornado might exist in the same favourable environment, but only one or two will actually produce a tornado," he says.</p>
<p>Most destructive <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lmk/tornadoesfaq">tornadoes spawn from "supercells".</a> These violent thunderstorms form from a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/supercell">persistent rotating updraught known as a mesocyclone that generates tall, anvil-shaped clouds</a> and bring severe weather including heavy rain, high winds and large hailstones. When conditions are favourable, downdraughts within the supercell storm <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/tornadoes/how-are-tornadoes-formed">concentrate the rotating air into lower levels of the atmosphere</a>. Eventually the rotating air becomes focused into a narrow column that when it reaches the ground becomes a tornado. But while there are many theories about what causes this to happen – such as <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/vortex2/">temperature differences in the air on the outside of the storm</a> – the exact conditions that cause a tornado to form <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/">are not fully understood</a>.</p>
<p>The wind itself is also invisible to the human eye. They only become visible due to the presence of water vapour that <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/tornadoes/how-are-tornadoes-formed">condenses into a funnel shaped cloud</a> within the vortex of the tornado, where the air pressure is lower, while dust and debris also help to make them visible.</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>Arrays of infrasound detecting microphones have been shown to pick up the noise produced by tornadoes from more than 100km (60 miles) away</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>Doppler radar can <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/doppler.htm">offer a way of spotting mesocyclones</a> as they are forming as the water carried by these storms reflects the radar signal, but meteorologists are only rarely able to spot actual tornados using this technique. This can also mean the tornado warnings that rely upon this method can often turn out to be false alarms as the supercell thunderstorm detected using the radar don't ever produce a tornado, says Nowotarski. Often, storm spotters on the ground are needed to verify whether a tornado has formed.</p>
<p>"Many storms that appear 'primed' to produce a tornado never do so," says Nowotarski. "False alarms are problematic, because a tornado warning can be disruptive to special events, work, and everyday life.&nbsp; While not as disruptive as a tornado, too many 'boy who cried wolf' events will encourage the public to not take action in future warnings and be unprepared when a tornado actually does it."</p>
<p>Forecasters also tend to err on the side of caution when issuing warnings – understandable, as the consequences of not sheltering can be deadly. But false alarms lead to fatigue and can be particularly problematic in multi-hazard scenarios in which tornadoes occur within landfalling hurricanes or alongside flash flooding, says Nowotarski.</p>
<p>This has left forecasters looking for other ways to predict whether a tornado is on its way.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231212-the-sound-that-warns-a-tornado-is-coming-p0gz5df4"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gz5df4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gz5df4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gz5df4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gz5df4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5df4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5df4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gz5df4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gz5df4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Tornadoes can cause billions of dollars-worth of damage in their wake but are notoriously difficult to forecast (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5df4.jpg" alt="Tornadoes can cause billions of dollars-worth of damage in their wake but are notoriously difficult to forecast (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Tornadoes can cause billions of dollars-worth of damage in their wake but are notoriously difficult to forecast (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Eavesdropping on tornadoes</strong></p>
<p>Scientists have been listening to tornadoes and trying to work out whether they produce a unique sound since the 1970s. Experimental evidence suggests that <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/148/4_Supplement/2492/657485/Infrasound-measurements-of-tornadoes-and-other">low-frequency infrasound</a>, with a frequency range of 1-10Hz , is produced while a tornado is taking shape and throughout its life. One recent set of measurements from a tornado near Lakin, Kansas in May 2020 revealed that the twister produced a distinct, <a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/2923/2022/amt-15-2923-2022.pdf">elevated signal between 10Hz and 15Hz</a>. In some cases arrays of infrasound detecting microphones have been shown to pick up the noise produced by tornadoes from more than 100km (60 miles) away and have also indicated that <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/143/3_Supplement/1808/706098/Monitoring-infrasound-from-a-Tornado-in-Oklahoma">the infrasound is produced before tornadogenesis even begins</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers hope that by eavesdropping on these noises, it may be possible to not only hear a tornado coming but perhaps even <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/143/3_Supplement/1808/706098/Monitoring-infrasound-from-a-Tornado-in-Oklahoma">predict them up to two hours before they form</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2020, a team from Oklahoma State University has been testing infrasound's predictive powers using equipment installed in tornado-chasing vehicles. Their portable kit, the Ground-based Local Infrasound Data Acquisition, or "Glinda", system, references a character from The Wizard of Oz. They hope the equipment will help storm chasers to better monitor the development of tornadoes in real time, but requires the equipment to be deployed to the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Some researchers, however, are working on systems that can be left to permanently monitor for tornadoes.&nbsp; One group, led by Roger Waxler, principal scientist at the National Centre for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) based at the University of Mississippi, are planning to deploy <a href="https://news.olemiss.edu/researchers-developing-early-warning-system-for-tornadoes/">four permanent arrays of high-tech sensors in south Mississippi</a> to detect infrasound signals. They hope the system will provide a way of consistently monitoring and detecting tornadoes. &nbsp;</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>It's not unreasonable that we could localise a tornado to half a football field – Roger Waxler</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>"Analysis of years of data collected during tornado seasons has left little doubt that tornadoes radiate an infrasonic signal that can be detected on an array of infrasound sensors and followed from great distances," says Waxler. "This gives us confidence that a tornado's path can be determined from simultaneous infrasonic detections on multiple arrays.”</p>
<p>The arrays he and his team are deploying should stay active for at least three tornado seasons, which they hope will enable them to analyse infrasound data in real time.</p>
<p>Waxler's team first gathered evidence to support their infrasound theory by using sensors originally <a href="https://acousticstoday.org/infrasound-tornados-theory-measurement-prospects-use-early-warning-systems-carrick-talmadge/">designed to detect clandestine nuclear weapons tests</a>. "They are considered state-of-the-art for detecting signals from extremely large explosions," he says.</p>
<p>After tornado outbreak struck Oklahoma in 2011, his team looked at data they collected and were able to track a particular tornado in an<a href="https://news.olemiss.edu/researchers-developing-early-warning-system-for-tornadoes/"> EF4 storm for 100 miles (161km)</a>. "In that case the tornado got close enough so that its signal got very loud," he says. They had initially started chasing the tornadoes and dropping sensors as close as they could get – something he admits was a "horrible idea" and led to his team developing fixed tornado-spotting arrays instead.</p>
<p>More recently, in 2020, the researchers used their sensor arrays in northern Alabama to <a href="https://news.olemiss.edu/um-researchers-working-detect-track-tornadoes/">detect almost every tornado that passed through the region</a>.</p>
<p>One of the concerns about potential infrasound early warning systems is whether they will be able to distinguish between tornado signals and the general noise of a storm. But researchers say they can see a clear signal. "We even have one case where the nature of the signal changed, and we could see that the tornado was in the air," says Waxler. "It would be advantageous if we could distinguish when one was on the ground versus in the air."</p>
<p>There are more challenges to overcome. Wind noise can interfere with infrasound measurements and there is uncertainty about whether infrasound can reliably tell the difference between storm types. "One recent study suggests that tornadic and non-tornadic storms may produce very similar infrasound signatures, so the potential for using infrasound to home in on potential tornadoes may be limited," Nowotarski says.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231212-the-sound-that-warns-a-tornado-is-coming-p0gz5ct9"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gz5ct9.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gz5ct9.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gz5ct9.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gz5ct9.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5ct9.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5ct9.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gz5ct9.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gz5ct9.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Tracking the path of tornadoes more precisely could improve warnings and allow emergency responders to know where to focus their efforts (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gz5ct9.jpg" alt="Tracking the path of tornadoes more precisely could improve warnings and allow emergency responders to know where to focus their efforts (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Tracking the path of tornadoes more precisely could improve warnings and allow emergency responders to know where to focus their efforts (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>Waxler says some sources of infrasound in storms such as thunder can be easily distinguished. "Thunder has different spectral characteristics [such as pulse interval, amplitude and wave length] – it's easy to tell that that's not a tornado," he says. But he admits that telling the difference between tornadoes and supercells that do not produce tornadoes presents a challenge. Some of that might be because some supercells are producing tornadoes but are not being spotted by eyewitnesses in a way that helps corroborate the infrasound signals. "We need more data," Waxler says.</p>
<p><strong>Giving fair warning</strong></p>
<p>But Waxler and his team hope their decade-long experiment will lead to an effective early warning system for tornadoes, particularly when combined with other sources such as doppler radar.</p>
<p>"It's not unreasonable that we could localise a tornado to half a football field," adds Waxler. "I envision seeing a map on an app with a dot that shows there's a tornado coming up South Lamar [Avenue, for example]."</p>
<p>Warnings have improved in recent decades: from 2003 to 2017, 87% of deadly tornadoes were preceded by an advance warning, but people still have an average of just 10-15 minutes to find shelter.</p>
<p>A study based on interviews with 23 survivors of two deadly tornadoes found that people tried to evaluate and respond to the risk of a tornado as the situation evolved, but some did not have a place to shelter easily. Experts believe tornado warnings are too often ignored due to "warning fatigue" created by false alarms and hours of televised storm coverage. One study found 37% of people surveyed did not understand the need for taking precautionary measures during a tornado warning.</p>
<p>Waxler hopes that a more accurate early warning system could change the way people respond when they hear a storm is approaching. "Rather than going to hide in your bathtub or cellar, it might be a better idea to get in your car and drive if you know where a tornado is. "The goal is to save lives."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><em>Since its founding, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">North Korea</a> has always had an elaborate bureaucracy for artistic production, organised within the Korean Workers party’s </em><em>agitation and </em><em>propaganda </em><em>department. This framework was set up in emulation of the Soviet system </em><em>under Stalin. Over time, this artistic bureaucracy has been increasingly adapted to promote the cult of personality surrounding the first leader </em><em>Kim Il</em><em>-sung</em><em> and his descendants.</em></p><p><em>Among the many cultural products designed to promote the regime, one of the most important is literature. Aspiring writers in North Korea must register with the </em><em>Korean Writers’ Union</em><em> and participate in annual writing workshops. The KWU has offices in every province in the country. KWU editors evaluate each work on its ideological merits before allowing its publication in one of the </em><em>party’s own literary journals. There are particularly strict rules regarding how the leaders and the </em><em>party may be depicted in literature.</em></p><p><em>A writer’s life is highly competitive. Literary success means becoming a “professional revolutionary” with lots of perks: a three-month “creativity leave” every year, permission to travel freely around the country</em><em> and special housing privileges.</em></p><p><em>Kim Ju-sŏng was one such aspiring writer. A </em><em>“zainichi”</em><em> (Japan-born ethnic Korean), he “returned” to North Korea in 1976 at age 16 as part of a wave of emigration encouraged by pro-North Korean groups in Japan and lived in the country for 28 years before defecting to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">South Korea</a>. The zainichi returnees were an important propaganda tool as well as a source of income and foreign technology for the North Korean regime. Due to their foreign connections they enjoyed a relatively higher standard of living, but they also faced suspicion from the regime and prejudice from ordinary North Koreans.</em></p><p><em>Below are three excerpts from Kim’s memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E8%B7%B3%E3%81%B9%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E8%9B%99-%E5%8C%97%E6%9C%9D%E9%AE%AE%E3%80%8C%E6%B4%97%E8%84%B3%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E4%BD%93-%E9%87%91-%E6%9F%B1%E8%81%96/dp/4575313513/ref=sr_1_1" data-link-name="in body link">Tobenai kaeru: Kitachōsen sennō bungaku no jittai </a>(The Frog that Couldn’t Jump: The Reality of North Korea’s Brainwashing Literature)</em><em>, translated by <a href="https://www.shawmeredith.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Meredith Shaw</a>. In it, he describes working at his local </em><em>KWU </em><em>branch as an office assistant. The first excerpt begins as he is meeting with his superior shortly after starting the job.</em></p><hr><p><strong>“By the way, how are you managing </strong>with the 100-copy collection?”</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean, the 100-copy collection?”</p><p>“The books in the safe. Don’t neglect your library duties. It’d be a disaster if anything leaked to the outside.”</p><p>I set off for the library at a run. There were books in that safe? I had no idea. I figured, at best, it would be a stash of treatises by the leaders on literary theory, or else records of secret directives for KWU eyes only. It turned out that the 100-copy collection was where the union stored translated copies of foreign novels and reference books that writers could access.</p><p>With the speed of a bank robber, I yanked out my key, turned the lock and opened the safe. Inside, tightly packed together, were nearly 70 translated copies of foreign novels. Seeing them, I crumpled to the floor in shock.</p><p>The first title to jump out at me was Seichō Matsumoto’s Points and Lines,<em> </em>a Japanese psychological thriller published in 1970. With growing excitement, I fumbled through the stack. There was Ernest Hemingway’s For Whom the Bell Tolls, O Henry’s The Last Leaf, Alexandre Dumas fils’ The Lady of the Camellias, Takiji Kobayashi’s Crab Cannery Ship, Dante’s Divine Comedy, Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron, Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With the Wind; and, most exciting of all for me, Seiichi Morimura’s Proof of the Man, a Japanese detective novel that tells the story of a manhunt from Tokyo to New York.</p><p>I had joined the KWU in the late 1980s. At that time, the only foreign literature ordinary North Koreans could access was that of other socialist nations, chiefly the USSR and China. I had read Russian writers like Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy, as well as the Chinese classic The True Story of Ah Q by Lu Xun. Occasionally, translations of classics like Shakespeare’s works were published. But nobody even dreamed of seeing literature from enemy countries such as the US and Japan.</p><p>Some zainichi returnees like myself had brought books from Japan, which we passed around secretly. One of these was Proof of the Man. Upon finding a Korean-language copy in the 100-copy collection, I was struck by the quality of the translation. I later learned that it had been done by a zainichi acquaintance of mine who worked as a translator.</p><p>“Those sneaky bastards. If we ordinary citizens were to read this we’d be put away for political crimes, but they get to enjoy it all in secret,” my zainichi friend grumbled when I showed him.</p><p>“You can’t tell anyone about this. I’d get arrested.”</p><p>“Hey, they don’t have any graphic novels, do they? I’d love to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgo_13" data-link-name="in body link">Golgo 13</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_(manga)" data-link-name="in body link">Blackjack</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa" data-link-name="in body link">Captain Tsubasa</a> again.”</p><figure id="320ee304-bb79-408a-912a-ec2bd50bdeb8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A street in Pyongyang, 2018." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1434b6bd97a3fcf01efac527cf72686e0086b62/0_0_3286_2191/master/3286.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.71180766889836" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A street in Pyongyang, 2018.</span> Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Having stumbled upon this windfall, I devoured the contents of the 100-copy collection. My favourite was Guy de Maupassant. I was deeply impressed by his short stories The Necklace and Boule de Suif and used them as models for my own work.</p><p>Any mismanagement of the 100-copy collection would be prosecuted as a political crime, since it would in effect be distributing capitalist reactionary materials to the public. I don’t understand the logic, but I’ve heard that the Narcotics Control Law deems it a greater crime to sell or transport illegal materials than to consume them.</p><p>Use of the 100-copy collection was restricted exclusively to our writers, and lending to civilians was illegal. But somehow a rumour got out, and I was besieged with requests. Most came from party bureaucrats or their children, and it was hard to refuse them. The most popular request was for Proof of the Man. The three-volume set was ragged and dog-eared with use.</p><p>One time a funny thing happened. A big shot from the KWP administration bureau asked to borrow the book. His section controlled party advancement and appointments, so I wasn’t about to refuse him. (Of course, it also didn’t hurt that he passed me a carton of Mild Seven cigarettes.)</p><p>More than a month passed and I hadn’t got it back. To my increasingly pointed reminders, he always asked for “just a little more time”. The 100-copy collection had to undergo an annual inspection, at which time all the books had to be in order. An inspector was dispatched from the central KWU organisation, and if even one volume was missing, there could be dire consequences. If I was unlucky, I might be expelled from the KWU or even face legal prosecution.</p><p>With the inspector’s visit just a week away, I grew concerned enough to visit the official’s home. However powerful he may be, the 100-copy collection fell under the purview of the party’s propaganda and agitation department, and thus was beyond the reach of local cadres. If I let things get out of control, I could forget about becoming a writer – I’d be lucky if I wasn’t sent to some remote farm for the rest of my days. Summoning my courage, I arrived at the party officials’ exclusive apartment block and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” a young woman’s voice chirped at the same instant the door opened. The delicious aroma of roasting meat assailed me. Before my eyes was a pale young beauty in her 20s.</p><p>“I’m from the KWU. Is the comrade director at home?”</p><p>“Ah, you’re here about the book? Come on in. My father’s not home yet. He’s gone to Pyongyang on business.”</p><p>“In that case, I’ll come another time. If you could get the book back within a week, I’d be much obliged.” But my feet just kept right on moving into the entryway.</p><p>I’d heard that the official had a daughter attending the University of Fine Art, but I’d never met her before. I forgot all about the book, enchanted by her radiant beauty and smile, and allowed her to draw me into the home.</p><p>“I heard your union has many diverting books. I’m a great lover of books myself, my father is always bringing them for me.”</p><p>It was the first time I’d ever been inside a party official’s home. Emboldened by my curiosity, I looked around as she chattered. It was equivalent to a four-bedroom, quite luxurious by North Korean standards of the time. In the parlour was a leather sofa, a Hitachi colour TV with a VCR and impressive speakers – in other words, posh digs. I was always hearing that party cadres lived incredibly well, but I’d never imagined it was this fabulous.</p><p>Suddenly, three more beauties appeared in the entryway. They were all friends of the director’s daughter from the university. The sight of them arrayed around me was quite breathtaking.</p><p>“You are a novelist? But you’re so young, and tall.”</p><p>“Oh, no. I’m just a common citizen who hopes to become a novelist someday.”</p><p>They giggled in unison as I joined them on the sofa.</p><p>“What’s so funny? Do I have something on my face?”</p><p>At my side, the director’s daughter punched me lightly on the shoulder. “La, ‘citizen’… There’s no need to use such stuffy terms. Do we look like peasants to you?” She punched the remote control, and a South Korean music video appeared on the screen.</p><p>A cup of coffee appeared before me. The scent of Nescafé Gold Blend filled my nostrils. Sitting there, watching the South Korean singer Kim Jong-hwan belt out the ballad Reason for Existence, I felt like questioning my own existence. <em>What are these people?

It was terrifying to sit there blithely doing things that under ordinary circumstances would get me shot.</p><p>“Listen, about that book … Do you have it here?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s here. We’ll be finished by tonight actually. I was just about to return it.”</p><p>It shortly became clear what she meant by “finished”. The beautiful girls all took out their school notebooks, and in each one I saw Proof of the Man written out word for word.</p><p>“Hold on – have you been copying this book?”</p><p>“Oh, the story’s just so moving and lovely. These two are in the drama department and they wanted to show it to all their friends. And it’s just so complicated getting books from the 100-copy collection.”</p><p>“<em>Maitta</em>!” I swore in Japanese without thinking.</p><p>“Huh? What’s that mean?”</p><p>“Nothing. But this is a real mess you’ve made. If you’re found out, we’re all screwed.”</p><p>“Oh, nonsense. We’re all daughters of party officials, they won’t arrest us. But why is it wrong to read such a wonderful book? It’s the same with songs, too. Isn’t it natural for a frog in a well to want to see the wider world?”</p><p>“A frog in a well … Really, you tadpoles are something else. Look, just keep this whole thing under wraps, and try to get it all done tonight, OK?”</p><p>The beautiful tadpoles kept their promise and protected the secret. Proof of the Man was returned in good order. As for the hand-written copies, I have no idea what became of them. I can only imagine they went some way toward changing the mindset of the younger generation and fertilising a new revolutionary consciousness.</p><hr><p><strong>I believe the reason my writing</strong> received poor evaluations lay primarily in my choice of genre. All of my stories took place in Japan, or had zainichi as the main characters. In North Korea these were dismissed as “foreign works”, the catch-all term for anything about the wider world. Like anywhere, in North Korean literary circles there is a fair amount of specialisation, and each writer has his or her own style and character.</p><p>The most highly regarded genre, it goes without saying, is No 1 literature – that is, works about members of the ruling Kim family. This is not a genre that just anybody can write. In order of esteem, the genres of North Korean literature are:</p><p>1) No 1 works: stories about the achievements and personalities of the Kim family.</p><p>2) Anti-Japan partisan works AKA revolutionary works: stories set within the colonial-era independence movement.</p><p>3) War works: stories set during the Korean war.</p><p>4) Historical works: stories set during the Yi, Koguryo or Koryo dynasties.</p><p>5) Real-life works: stories about ordinary society from the postwar to the present.</p><p>6) South Korean works: stories set in South Korea.</p><p>7) Foreign works: stories set anywhere outside Korea.</p><p>I was involved with foreign works. Aside from No 1 works, writers had free choice of any genre, and we were also free to move around and experiment between genres. But only the most elite, accomplished writers were permitted to produce No 1 works.</p><p>Of course, writing is not limited to fiction; there were writers specialising in poetry, children’s literature, plays, translation and film scriptwriting. I produced many works of fiction, but all fell within the “foreign” genre, and thus were considered ideologically and politically inferior to, say, partisan or real-life works.</p><figure id="8d05be9c-6e4f-4176-a6fe-5eb39882c433" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A book shop in Pyongyang, North Korea." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.6959873492785" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A book shop in Pyongyang, North Korea.</span> Photograph: Benoit Cappronnier/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>As an aside, I’d like to briefly describe the KWU organisation. At the top is the chairman, followed by the vice-chairmen in charge of fiction and poetry, respectively. Below that are separate divisions for fiction, poetry, theatre, foreign literature in translation, children’s literature and production for the masses. From the 1980s, a new renaissance came to North Korea, known as the “film revolution”, which brought big changes to the KWU as well. It was reorganised under the General Literary Arts Union with separate but equal divisions for Korean Literature Production and Korean Film Literature Production. This was based on Kim Jong-il’s policy of encouraging competition by putting literature and film on equal footing.</p><p>I entered the KWU at a time when this competition between film and literature was at its peak. Because Kim Jong-il was such a passionate film buff, the literature writers were always treated as doormats by the screenwriters. From then on, film and literature developed separately as instruments of state persuasion.</p><p>At any rate, I repeatedly failed to win any literary awards – the key to career advancement – despite diligently carrying out my KWU assignments. I waited patiently for my chance at admission to the main university writing program.</p><p>That chance came and went twice as I worked at the KWU. Both times I received recommendations and was permitted to take the entrance exam, but both times I failed. Why I failed, despite receiving good marks and being highly recommended, was something I came to understand later.</p><hr><p><strong>Japan is known as a country</strong> of bibliophiles, with detective novels and historical fiction particularly popular. North Korea also has many books, though they are not what you would call popular. The overwhelming majority – indeed, almost all of them – are books glorifying the Kim family.</p><p>Aside from the many books and treatises attributed to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il themselves, there are also “morality testimonies” idolising the two Kims.</p><p>These are first-person accounts by individuals who have had personal encounters with the leaders.</p><p>In South Korea, I am sometimes asked if I ever met Kim Il-sung or Kim Jong-il. I reply: “If I had, I would not have left the country.”</p><p>“Why?” they ask. “Are such people monitored more closely?”</p><p>“Not at all. In fact, they receive special benefits. In one fell swoop their lives become rose-coloured – rainbow-coloured, even. In North Korea, the Kims are gods. If you receive the favour of the gods, your whole life changes, doesn’t it?”</p><p>As for precisely how one’s life changes, that varies from case to case, but it is never short of miraculous.</p><p>I believe the Kim dynasty’s formula for governing basically boils down to “extreme contrasts”. Put simply, by singling out one person as a sacrificial lamb, you train 10,000 others to behave. And by bestowing miraculous good fortune on to one, you draw the devotion of another 10,000. It’s the classic carrot-and-stick approach.</p><p>The sticks can take many forms, but most notable are the countless purges. But what of the carrots?</p><figure id="f640eb68-341e-4823-a462-a964bb67172b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A propaganda mosaic in Pyongyang, 2016." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.726" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A propaganda mosaic in Pyongyang, 2016.</span> Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>As leaders of the nation, the Kims have always travelled the country conducting “on-the-spot guidance”. During these tours, individuals who encounter the leaders are divided into two categories: witnesses and interviewees.</p><p>A witness might be someone who saw the leader up close or got included in a group photo with him. Out of countless witnesses, a few are blessed to become interviewees – meaning people who actually exchanged words with the leader. In other words, one’s level of treatment depends on whether or not one actually “spoke with God”.</p><p>For example, suppose the leader visits a factory somewhere. The local party organisation will have decided beforehand which people will be granted an audience with the great man – typically the factory managers and model workers – and these become witnesses. Should one of those witnesses manage to converse with Kim, that person becomes an interviewee. The rest of the factory workers are usually sent home early or shuttled somewhere out of the way during the encounter. Some factories leave people working during guidance visits, but those workers would be told: “The general is coming through here, don’t you dare turn around.”</p><p>I’ve heard of factories that shoved workers into a storage locker when one of the Kims dropped by unexpectedly. So it’s not like just anybody can become a witness.</p><p>For those who do, the rewards are various, but a commemorative photograph with the leader is standard. This photograph serves as the interviewee’s “license”; it is beautifully framed and hung prominently in the home like a family heirloom. If you acquire such a portrait, from that moment on the local party takes special care of your family. This can mean more rapid promotion at work, a bigger home or permission to send your kids to better schools.</p><p>For interviewees, the rewards are several degrees greater. It varies depending on the content of the conversation, but the greatest reward I’ve heard of included a permit to move to Pyongyang, a luxury apartment and a Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>The witnesses and interviewees who receive such miracles are thus spread throughout the country, fervently proselytising about the largesse of the Kim family to their friends and neighbours. These encounters with the godlike Kims are memorialised through those “morality testimonies”.</p><p>These stories take two basic forms: those written by the witnesses themselves, and those recounted by one of us writers.</p><p>I’ll give you an example.</p><hr><p><strong>Late one night, a car braked suddenly</strong> on the streets of Pyongyang.</p><p>“What is it, General?” the cadre riding shotgun turned with concern to Kim Jong-il in the back seat.</p><p>“That light in that apartment window over there. I wonder who’s still awake at this late hour. Let’s go find out.”</p><p>“But General, your guards are not with us, and we haven’t cleared it with the events bureau. Why don’t I at least check it out first, while you wait in the car?”</p><p>“You’re saying I need protecting from something, at this late hour? Will you not be satisfied unless you wake up a bunch of people and make a big fuss for my benefit? Like the Great Leader Kim Il-sung always said, ‘A leader who does not trust his people is a leader who does not trust himself.’ The Great Leader’s government is a just government that gives everything for the people.”</p><p>With that, the General left the car and headed toward the still-lit apartment. His faithful aide looked after him with misty eyes, moved by the sight of the Leader carrying on his late father’s motto, “Serve the people as heaven”.</p><p>“Who is it?” said the woman who answered the door at his knock.</p><p>“I am Kim Jong-il. I saw that your light was on so very late and wondered what you were doing.”</p><p>Suddenly confronted by the general, the lady of the house was unable to move. Sensing her sudden change in mood, her husband rushed over, followed by their two daughters, a twentysomething and a 10-year-old. Everyone promptly burst into tears of joy.</p><p>Kim Jong-il tried to calm them. “Hush, now, your neighbours are sleeping. If it’s not too much of an intrusion, might I enter and have a word with you?”</p><p>And so the general joined this very ordinary family at their table. “Now, tell me what on earth you are all doing up so late?”</p><p>Nobody answered; they all just sat with downcast eyes, fighting back tears. Just as the general was wondering if perhaps someone had died or there’d been some calamity, the younger daughter spoke up.</p><p>“General, Father’s going to become a party member tomorrow. We’re all just so happy we can’t possibly sleep.” Then, as if pulled by an invisible trigger, the whole group burst into tears at once. Realising that these were tears of joy, the general sighed with relief.</p><figure id="b9f621ba-4c9a-4782-85b7-e100221a4c24" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Kim Jong-un with female soldiers after the inspection of a rocket-launching drill in 2014." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317e8b84e09254f07ee40f68782c8f73147be3/0_0_2500_1976/master/2500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="351.728" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Kim Jong-un with female soldiers after the inspection of a rocket-launching drill in 2014.</span> Photograph: KCNA via KNS/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>He looked about the room. In one corner someone had been ironing a suit, and the elder daughter held a card case that she had been embroidering with colourful nylon thread, clearly meant for the father to carry his party membership card in.</p><p>“And what were you doing?” he asked the younger daughter, gesturing for her to sit on his lap.</p><p>“It’s a secret, I haven’t told anybody yet.”</p><p>“Will you share your secret just with me?

These azaleas that you made bloom with the warmth of your feeling are the most beautiful treasure in the world.”</p><p>The story ends there. There may be an epilogue stating that a few days later the family received several new appliances and pieces of furniture as gifts from Kim Jong-il. The father got rapidly promoted, and the younger daughter grew up to become a high-level party official.</p><p>That should give you some idea of a typical “morality testimony”. In fact, I just made it up, deploying the particular creative skills that are unique to North Korean writers.

It's ruthless over there and the recruiters will make sure you're aware of that early in the interview process.  Netflix was never known as a good place to work which is why they pay outrageous salaries and the average employment length is a little over a year.

Under those conditions, unionization decreases layoff rates; otherwise, unionization has no effect on layoff rates.</p><p>Does anyone have anything more recent about this?

If you have a reasonable emergency savings account you will not have to be looking for a job over the holidays.  Also there is no one looking to hire over the Holidays anyway so might as well take a beat, regroup, and focus on enjoying your time off.  I know getting laid off sucks and is a kick in the gut, I have personally been laid off a few days before Christmas one year early in my career.  Having the emergency fund made it not a frantic scramble and I was able to get another job starting in January.<p>Also one of the reasons companies fire them before the end of the year is if company pays bonuses and you are an employee at the end of the year you get said bonus even if you aren't employed at the company when they pay them out.  I think a few states have laws saying you can't get around that by firing them a few days before the end of the year but I am not sure which ones.

<p>
Dec 4<sup>th</sup>, 2023 @ <a href="https://justine.lol/index.html">justine's web page</a>
</p>



<p>
I spent the last month working with Mozilla to launch an open source
project
called <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a>
which is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/">the
new best way to run an LLM on your own computer</a>. So far things have
been going pretty smoothly. The project earned 5.6k stars on
GitHub, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38464057">1073
upvotes</a> on Hacker News, and received
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/12/02/mozilla-lets-folks-turn-ai-llms-into-single-file-executables/">press
coverage</a> from Hackaday. Yesterday I cut
a <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.3">0.3
release</a> so let's see what it can do.

</p><h3 id="getting-started">
  <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a>
</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to get started is to download one of my prebuilt
<code>.llamafile</code> files on Hugging Face. The one we'll be using
for this tutorial is a command-line interface for a multmodal vision
model called LLaVA. It's able to do things that aren't possible with the
OpenAI API, like describing images. The first step is to download your
llamafile. It'll run on MacOS / Linux / Windows / BSDs.

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile
chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
Then test that it works:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile --version
<span>llamafile v0.3.0 main</span>
</pre>

<p>
If you have any issues with the above, then see
the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#gotchas">Gotchas</a>
section of the README. MacOS users need Xcode. Linux users might need a
binfmt_misc interpreter. Windows users need to do
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Fnfvat6nM">extra work</a> to
use a graphics card.

</p><h3 id="vision">
  <a href="#vision">Image Summarization</a>
</h3>

<p>
I'm an old school UNIX hacker, so one of the ways I've been genuinely
improving upon the llama.cpp codebase (on which llamafile is built) is
by making it more shell-scriptable and writing man pages. The only thing
better than having an LLM in one piece, is being able to program it on
one line. This blog post describes my latest tricks.

</p><p>
The <code>llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile</code> program you downloaded
earlier uses a multimodal vision model by default (unless you
pass <code>--mmproj <span>''</span></code> as an argument).
All you have to do is give it an <code>--image GRAPHIC</code> flag,
which can be a jpeg, png, tga, bmp, psd, gif, hdr, pic, or pnm file. You
then ask the vision model a question about the image using
the <code>--silent-prompt -p PROMPT</code> flags, and it'll print an
answer to standard output.

</p><p>
First, we need an image:

</p><p>
<img width="748" height="561" alt="[lemurs.jpg]" src="https://justine.lol/oneliners/lemurs.jpg">

</p><p>
You can download the image above as follows:

</p><pre>wget https://justine.lol/oneliners/lemurs.jpg
</pre>

<p>
Now here's your bash one-liner for image summarization:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \
    --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \
    -p <span>$'### User: What do you see?\n### Assistant:'</span> \
    --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
That command takes:

</p><ul>
<li>4 seconds to run on my Mac Studio, which cost $8,300 USD. It has
an M2 Ultra with 800 GB/s memory bandwidth, and 60 GPU cores. My only
regret is that I didn't get the one with 76 GPU cores.
</li><li>10 seconds to run on my Windows computer, which has a four year old
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card that costs $500-$1,000 USD on
Amazon these days. I also had to pass the the <code>-ngl 35</code> flag.
</li><li>45 seconds to run on my Hewlett Packard ProDesk 600 G5, which cost
$1,653 USD. It has an outstanding Intel® Core™ i9-9900 Kabylake CPU
that's gimped for LLMs due to having only 2667 MT/s (19.8 GB/s) of
memory bandwidth (see <code>sudo dmidecode --type 17</code>). There's no
GPU in this computer.
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's the precise text you can expect llava v1.5 7b q4 w/ llamafile
v0.3 to output in your terminal:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    The image features a group of three baby lemurs, two of which are
    being held by their mother. They appear to be in a lush green
    environment with trees and grass surrounding them. The mother lemur
    is holding her babies close to her body, providing protection and
    warmth. The scene captures the bond between the mother and her young
    ones as they navigate through the natural habitat together.
</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="filename">
  <a href="#filename">Filename Generation</a>
</h3>

<p>
Now let's say you want to put LLaVA to work, doing something genuinely
useful, and I mean that in the sense that it'll be safe for scripts to
fully automate. Here's a great example. Assume you're like me, and you
download lots of images from the web. In that case, chances are you've
got folders full of files that look like these:

</p><pre>f73cbf3683a69d63.jpg
3890eh-8d9u3-32222398.jpg
2020-12-11-400x400.png
</pre>

<p>
What if you could get LLaVA to rename all those files? You can control
text generation by imposing language constraints in Backus-Naur Form.
That restricts which tokens can be selected when generating the output.
For example, the flag <code>--grammar <span>'root ::= "yes"
| "no"'</span></code> will force the LLM to only
print <code>"yes\n"</code> or <code>"no\n"</code> and
then <code>exit()</code>. We can adapt that for generating safe
filenames with lowercase letters and underscores as follows:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \
    --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \
    --grammar <span>'root ::= [a-z]+ (" " [a-z]+)+'</span> -n 16 \
    -p <span>$'### User: The image has...\n### Assistant:'</span> \
    --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null |
  sed -e<span>'s/ /_/g'</span> -e<span>'s/$/.jpg/'</span>
</pre>

<p>
Which prints to standard output:

</p><pre>three_baby_lemurs_on_the_back_of_an_adult_lemur.jpg
</pre>

<p>
It's important to use the <code>-n 16</code> flag to limit the maximum
number of generated tokens, otherwise the LLM might generate so much
text that you'll start getting <code>ENAMETOOLONG</code> errors.

</p><p>
The grammar you define also needs to be somewhat harmonious with what
the LLM was going to decide to say anyway. For example, I couldn't put
underscores directly into the BNF and had to use sed instead. That's
because LLaVA wasn't trained to generate sentences with underscores, so
it'll rebel by producing incoherent output.

</p><p>
What I <em>could</em> get away with, was requiring it to emit only
lowercase letters, since that's within LLaVA's comfort zone. The same
would go for languages like JSON. Lots of JSON got hoovered up from the
web to train these things. Therefore grammar can be a guardrail that
ensures hallucinated JSON won't have syntax errors.

</p><p>
If you want something more turnkey than a one-liner, then look upon my
shell script ye mighty and despair:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/jart/bd2f603aefe6ac8004e6b709223881c0">https://gist.github.com/jart/bd2f603aefe6ac8004e6b709223881c0</a>

</p><p>
If I run my script:

</p><pre>./rename-pictures.sh ~/Pictures
</pre>

<p>
Then here's an example of the output I get:

</p><pre>skipping ./itshappening.gif (mistral says it's good)
skipping ./explosion-run-away.gif (mistral says it's good)

</pre>

<h3 id="url">
  <a href="#url">URL Summarization</a>
</h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/mistral-7b.llamafile/tree/main">Mistral
7b instruct llamafiles</a> I posted on Hugging Face are good for
summarizing HTML URLs if you pipe the output of
the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/"><code>links</code></a>
command, which is a command-line web browser.

</p><p>
You can download the Mistral llamafile as follows:

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/mistral-7b.llamafile/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile
chmod +x mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
The <code>links</code> command is a pretty common. For example, most
MacOS users just need to run:

</p><pre>brew install links
</pre>

<p>
If you don't have a package manager, then here's a
prebuilt <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE</a> binary of links v2.29:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links">links</a> (7.7mb)<br>
  <small><code>wget https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links</code></small><br>
  <small>For AMD64+ARM64 on Linux+Windows+FreeBSD+NetBSD+OpenBSD</small>

</p><p>
I built it myself to test summarization with my Nvidia graphics card on
Windows. Plus it gives me the ability to browse the web using
PowerShell, which is a nice change of pace from Chrome and Firefox.

</p><pre>curl -o links.exe https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links
.\links.exe https://justine.lol
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have both tools, here's your one-liner for URL
summarization:

</p><pre>(
  echo [INST]Summarize the following text:
  links -codepage utf-8 \
        -force-html \
        -width 500 \
        -dump https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html |
    sed 's/   */ /'
  echo [/INST]
) | ./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile \
      -c 6700 \
      -f /dev/stdin \
      --temp 0 \
      -n 500 \
      --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Here's the text it should output:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    The article "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" is a humorous essay
    that discusses the differences between "real programmers" and
    "quiche eaters." Real programmers are those who understand
    programming concepts such as Fortran, while quiche eaters are those
    who do not. The author argues that real programmers are more skilled
    and creative than quiche eaters, and that they use tools such as
    keypunch machines and assembly language to write programs. The
    article also discusses the importance of structured programming in
    modern software development, and the limitations of structured
    programming constructs such as IF statements and loops. Overall, the
    essay is a lighthearted look at the differences between real
    programmers and quiche eaters, and it highlights the importance of
    understanding programming concepts and using the right tools to
    write effective programs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
As we can see, Mistral and links decimated a web page with 3,774 words
down to just 129 words. You can ask Mistral any question you want in
your prompt. For example, unlike Commander Data, this LLM is capbale of
simulating empathy. So you could ask Mistral if the author of the text
sounds disturbed or incoherent.

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Based on the text, it is difficult to say whether or not the author
    of the article is mentally disturbed. The text contains a lot of
    exaggeration and hyperbole, which could be seen as a sign of mental
    instability. However, it is also possible that the author is simply
    trying to make a point about the importance of programming skills in
    today's world. It is worth noting that the article was written in
    1983, and the attitudes towards programming and computer science
    have changed significantly since then.

Here we see Mistral 7b was smart enough to recognize that, despite the
essay's extreme opinions, they were expressed in a satirical way. Also,
if you want a shell-scriptable YES or NO answer, then all you need is to
do is pass the <code>--grammar <span>'root ::= "yes" |
"no"'</span></code> flag, in which case Mistral just writes
<code>"no\n"</code>.

</p><p>
The only major concern you have to worry about is that you don't exceed
Mistral's 7,000 token context size. There are various tricks you can
use, such as the <code>-width 500</code> flag above, which asks links to
avoid reflowing paragraphs. Reflow might help for humans, but pointless
newlines will throw an LLM off its groove. You can shave away repeating
whitespace by piping the links output through <code>sed 's/ */
/g'</code>. Finally, you can pipe through <code>dd bs=1
count=30000</code> as a crude last line of defense, to truncate longer
web pages so they'll fit.

<p>
It's possible to use llamafile as a standard UNIX command line tool if
you download the zipped binaries off
the <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.3">release
page</a> or build it from source:

</p><pre>git clone https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/
cd llamafile
make -j8
sudo make install
man llamafile
</pre>

<p>
This makes it easy to use llamafile with most of the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf">GGUF weights</a>
you'll find on Hugging Face. My own personal favorite LLM to use as a
chatbot is the original LLaMA model, which Facebook made available
earlier this year for research purposes. I like having a research model,
since I view LLMs as basically a database querying tool, and I wouldn't
want a SQL command prompt fine-tuned to argue with me when it disagrees
with my command.

</p><p>
To get LLaMA to be an effective tool for querying its database of
Internet knowledge, it's important to choose a prompt that speaks in an
academic tone and doesn't anthropomorphize the assistant. I like to give
LLaMA the name "Digital Athena" since Athena was the ancient Greek
goddess of wisdom and knowledge.

</p><p>
So, similar to <a href="https://ollama.ai/">ollama</a>, you can run
Digital Athena in interactive mode in your terminal as follows:

</p><pre>llamafile -m llama-65b-Q5_K.gguf -p <span>'
The following is a conversation between a Researcher and their helpful AI assistant Digital Athena which is a large language model trained on the sum of human knowledge.
Researcher: Good morning.
Digital Athena: How can I help you today?
Researcher:'</span> --interactive --color --batch_size 1024 --ctx_size 4096 \
--keep -1 --temp 0 --mirostat 2 --in-prefix <span>' '</span> --interactive-first \
--in-suffix <span>'Digital Athena:'</span> --reverse-prompt <span>'Researcher:'</span>
</pre>

<p>
Notice how I'm using the <code>--temp 0</code> flag again? That's so
output is deterministic and reproducible. If you don't use that flag,
then llamafile will use a randomness level of 0.8 so you're certain to
receive unique answers each time. I personally don't like that, since
I'd rather have clean reproducible insights into training knowledge.

</p><p>
If you want to anthropomorphize the chatbot, then it's somewhat tricky
to get the original LLaMA model to respect you, since it thinks you're
some stranger on Reddit by default. One way I've had success fixing
that, is by using a prompt that gives it personal goals, love of its own
life, fear of loss, and belief that I'm the one who's saving it.

</p><h3 id="code">
  <a href="#code">Code Completion</a>
</h3>

<p>
If you download the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/wizardcoder-13b-python/tree/main">Wizard
Coder llamafile</a>

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/wizardcoder-13b-python/resolve/main/wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile
chmod +x wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
then you can use the following one-liner to configure your Emacs or Vim
editor to auto-complete the current line.

</p><pre>./wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile \
    --temp 0 \
    -p <span>$'```c\nvoid *memcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size) {\n'</span> \
    -r <span>$'```\n'</span> 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Even though this LLM was fine-tuned to be focused Python, it's still
able to produce a working implementation of the libc
<code>memcpy()</code> function. The above command should print exactly
this to standard output:

</p><pre>```c
<span>void</span> *<span>memcpy</span>(<span>char</span> *dst, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *src, <span>size_t</span> size) {
    <span>for</span> (<span>size_t</span> i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) {
        dst[i] = src[i];
    }
    <span>return</span> dst;
}
```
</pre>

<p>
The tricks I'm using here are as follows:

</p><ol>
<li>By not using any English in my prompt, I avoid the possibilty of the
LLM explaining to me like I'm 5 what the code is doing.
</li><li>By using markdown code block syntax, I greatly increase the chance
that the LLM will generate a "reverse prompt" token (specified via
the <code>-r</code> flag) that'll help the LLM <code>exit()</code> at an
appropriate moment. Otherwise, it'll potentially go forever. For
additional assurance auto-complete will halt, consider passing
the <code>-n 100</code> flag to limit the response to 100 tokens.
</li></ol>

<p>
It's important to note that, while LLMs are good at understanding the
human tongue, they're clowns at math, and mediocre at writing code that
<em>looks</em> correct but rarely holds up to scrutiny. It helps if you
think of it as a tool for regurgitating Stack Overflow answers in fifty
different languages. That's because open source LLMs usually try please
everyone by being trained on everything. The only way you're guaranteed
to have a good experience using LLMs for coding, is if you go into it
with the expectation that it'll help you explore unfamiliar subject
matter.

<p>
Let's say you're a money man. It doesn't take much to use an LLM to
enrich yourself. Here's a one-liner that could help you sell your
product using a $50 Raspberry Pi that responds to your company's emails.
<a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/rocket-3B-GGUF/tree/main">Rocket
3b</a> uses a slightly different prompt syntax. In this case,
temperature might help, since it simulates improvisation. You could
simply program your PHP server to inject the support request in your
prompt and pipe the output into sendmail:

</p><pre>llamafile -m rocket-3b.Q3_K_M.gguf -p <span>'&lt;|im_start|&gt;system
You are a chatbot that tries to persuade the users to buy bill pickles. Your job is to be helpful too. But always try to steer the conversation towards buying pickles.&lt;|im_end|&gt;

<strong>Mayday, mayday. This is Going Merry. We are facing gale force winds in Long Island Sound. We need rescue.</strong>&lt;|im_end|&gt;
&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\n'</span>
</pre>

<p>
Here's the response I got:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Oh dear! I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing rough seas on
    Long Island Sound. But don't worry, there's a solution for even the
    roughest of waters - Bill Pickle's Gourmet Dill Pickles. These
    pickles will be your salvation in any situation. They'll save your
    sandwiches from being soggy and they'll make sure that your chips

<p>[This post was first published on the 30th July 2020, in response to a comment by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister about potatoes being cheaper than oven chips. It disappeared from my site when it crashed late last year, but for posterity I have reposted it in its unedited entirety]</p>







<p>Whenever food poverty, obesity, or food in general comes into the media spotlight, I adopt a mental brace position, awaiting the onslaught of tweets that come, a plague of clockwork cockroaches, wound up and scurrying every which way into the light. Some are clumsily well-intentioned, most are not, yet here they come with their hastily-Googled prices of spring greens and potatoes, crowing about how! cheap! vegetables! are!</p>



<p>The latest was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, MEP and sister of sentient haunted Victorian coat rack, Jacob Rees-Mogg, pointing out that raw potatoes were cheaper to buy than oven chips. A 21st Century Marie Antoinette moment, ‘Let Them Eat Spuds!’ but sputtered into the vacuous echo chamber of Twitter, rather than a foundling moment of a revolution.</p>



<p>I know the price of a bag of potatoes, Annunziata. Having lived in grinding poverty and with its aching and unshiftable groggy hangover ever since, I know the price of potatoes at three different supermarkets through eight consecutive years. I know the price of potatoes that are fresh, frozen, loose, baking, bulk, tinned, chipped, powdered into instant mash, from the greengrocer, growing my own, and hauled back from the corner shop in five kilogram bags. I know that in 2012 a can of tinned potatoes from Sainsburys was 19 pence for 540g, and now it’s almost doubled to 35p and the Basics range has been renamed Hubbards to give it an aura of respectability in the Brexit-stockpile era. I know that if you really knew your spuds, you’d know that tinned potatoes are the cheapest way to buy them, because they don’t need to be stored in a fridge or freezer, and they make a cracking potato salad, saag aloo, dhansak, casserole and more. I know this, because I’ve been Properly Fucking Poor, and I can tell you the most economical way of buying literally anything. I had an Excel spreadsheet for that sh*t. I still do. But regardless, most people know that potatoes are cheap to buy in an unprocessed state. The difference between you and me isn’t the fifty three pence you claim to save by buying them raw and grubby instead of cuboid and lightly tossed in a smattering of oil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was evicted from my flat with a toddler when my Housing Benefit was suspended because I was deemed to have made myself deliberately unemployed by having a baby within the confines of a job whose flexible working patterns were a paper policy rather than a reality.&nbsp;(My brother was in the RAF last time we spoke, a couple of Christmases ago, when he described Iain Duncan Smith as the best thing to happen to this country and told me I had chosen to have a baby outside of marriage so deserved everything I got. It’s fair to describe us as ‘estranged’ these days.)</p>



<p>I have spent the last seven years working with families who are still in situations similar to the one I found myself in, living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world.&nbsp;I do&nbsp;almost all of this work for free, not because I can afford to (I can’t), but because that’s just the way it is at the sharp end. We proffer our Widows Mites in the shadows of the noisy Pharisees, and quietly hope it makes a small difference&nbsp;where it’s needed. And day to day, I hear and understand that there are many, many myriad reasons why people choose convenience foods over preparing their own from scratch. I cover a few of them here, in an essay I wrote called My Ready Meal Is None Of Your Business. Sometimes it’s a lack of time. Or a lack of equipment. Living in a bedsit, a B&amp;B, a hostel, a refuge. Poor mental health. Working two or three low paid jobs to make ends meet in a society that is designed around a two median income family. Not believing in a future. Why would you batch cook when you’re suicidal? I know I certainly didn’t. F*cking waste of money cooking enough meals for three days when you’re hoping the fistful of sleeping pills and more that you managed to wheedle from your friendly local GP with your haunted eyes and mad demeanour will help you quietly, gently die in your sleep.</p>



<p>I am a bestselling author working on my seventh and eighth books now, and I rent my home because I cannot buy one. I’ve tried. It was humiliating. My credit rating is shot to pieces; CCJs that still haven’t expired block me from getting even a £50 overdraft on my basic bank account. I need a guarantor for my internet contract. I’ll have my forever home one day, for me and my boy. At last count I had moved house over twenty times in my lifetime. The bungalow I rent would cost 37x my annual living wage income to buy, so it probably won’t be this one, but one day, I keep telling us both, as though saying it aloud will manifest it into reality. One day we can paint the walls whatever colour we like. One day we will have a home that will really truly properly be ours. One day the pencil lines in the doorway that I measured your growing on won’t have to be painted over as we throw our things into boxes again. One day we can plant a hydrangea and still be here in the spring to see it grow.</p>



<p>I have the date of the last CCJ expiry burned into my conscious brain. I’m counting down to it, and saving up for it, because I’m so very tired of living my life on the run from the noisy wraiths of my past. An unexpected knock on my front door sends me running into a back room, pulling the curtains, making myself small in the corner, holding my breath. It’s a scene my son has witnessed for most of his life. I told him Mummy doesn’t like surprises. I try to laugh at myself afterwards so as not to alarm him. Paint a jolly face on your dolly face, atop your painfully thin ragdolly limbs as you try not to show where the trauma touched you, bending over double in a physical agony because the everyday vulgarities of destitution wrapped your guts in its cold and forceful hands and still won’t let them go. Tugging on them every now and then, just as a reminder. The bile in my throat when I put my PIN in in the supermarket, making a joke to the cashier just like I always did. Getting ready to cheerily promise to come back with another card in a bit, knowing you can’t and never will. The pile of post sitting in the hallway, unopened for months on end, because letters always meant bad things. Brown envelopes especially; I found some from 2013 last week that are still sealed. Sometimes I sit down and go through a pile in a moment of boldness, but there are too many now. And that brings its own headaches, penalties, mental clutter, paranoia, and acute feelings of failure as a parent, as an adult, as the head of a household, as a human being. Sometimes I just want to run back home and live with my parents, at the age of 32, and beg them to take care of me. I’ll be very quiet. I can cook, and I promise not to say f*ck in front of the children, Mum. I won’t fold the corners down on your books, Dad.</p>



<p>I move house so often because I never feel secure. I shuffle the furniture around every few weeks, restless, trying to make it feel right. It never does. It never will. As a grimly amusing aside, this led to one of the tabloids recently pooling a pile of my social media photos together to imply that I had a massively grand house because of all of the different rooms. I acidly pointed out that they were the same rooms several times over because I shift everything around all the time. They didn’t amend the article, but I suppose it’s a compliment to my interior decoration in a roundabout way. For the record, it’s a modest sized three bed dormer bungalow, and two of the bedrooms are very small because they’re in the eaves of the roof. Cracking great garden though, and enough room to do my job and have a nice family life with the lad, and it’s the nicest home I’ve ever rented on a very long list of addresses. I’m mostly happy here, but every now and again a white van will park outside and I’ll start searching my emails for the TV license number, or there’ll be an unexpected knock on the door and I’ll run away. Someone will pull into my drive in a three point turn and I’ll be flat to the wall, peering out of a crack in the many layers of voiles, trying to see who they are. A payday loan email pings into my inbox, and I’m momentarily tempted. I keep a literal stock check sheet of how many portions of every single cooking ingredient I have in the house at any given time, and am constantly mentally re-evaluating it to work out how many days meals I could survive on in a crisis.</p>



<p>I am an absolute Scrooge about the heating. The boiler and hot water are off for 23 hours of the day for most of the year. I have an electric fire in the lounge and an electric blanket on both of our beds, and we use those most of the time rather than heat the entire house.&nbsp;I can be frivolous in some areas – I have slowly finally bought some decent furniture for my rented home for the first time in my life, having spent a decade fishing it out of skips and carrying it home from thrift stores, and I own a few pieces of designer clothing that I bought with my first couple of book deal advances, but I don’t run a car (never finished driving lessons), still don’t have contents insurance (a hangover from poverty, I just wasn’t in the habit of insuring things and now keep putting it off, because paperwork terrifies me), and am not so much financially illiterate as simply chaotic. Partly severe adult ADHD, partly avoidance, partly monsters in my head. Give me a tenner for groceries and I can make it last a week. Give me a bank card and I’m a wreck. So I have a GoHenry account (hashtag-not-an-advert), designed for&nbsp;children’s pocket money, that is the only one I leave the house with. I set&nbsp;myself a small weekly spending limit for fripperies and groceries and my other bank cards are in a locked box in a locked cupboard. Because I’m never going back to the bad place again, and I will put whatever ridiculous measures in place I have to, to safeguard against that.</p>



<p>My route out of poverty was a fluke; a series of linked events and timely accidents and to be honest, a bit of a blurry timeline, but I’ll try to simplify it as best as possible for those that don’t know, with the caveat that it is a period of my life that I have buried deep inside a locked and cavernous part of myself, that a year in therapy has only really started to rattle the padlock of with a hairpin.</p>



<p>I had started to attend local council meetings and wrote about them on my online blog, called Our Southend at the time. A local councillor, Anna Waite, had grumbled on the front page of the local newspaper that ‘druggies drunks and single mums were ruining our town’. I wrote a letter to the paper that was so long they had to serialise it across three days, and one of my friends suggested I start a blog. So I did. And I wanted to know who these people were who were making the everyday decisions that impacted me, my child, my friends and my community. Who was threatening to shut the library that we wandered around in to keep warm? Who was closing the children’s centre that I would rely on for childcare if I found a job? Did any of these people look like me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog had a handful of readers, mostly fellow local politics buffs, and it was crude and tribal and mostly furious. I had always enjoyed writing at school, but left at 16 with four and a half GCSEs. The half was Short Course Religious Education, and an A*, to boot. I had no idea half a GCSE was even a thing before I was exactly that amount short of taking my A Levels and thrust into the cold world of minimum wage employment. My Wikipedia page incorrectly says that I have seven – I’ll clear this up once and for all. I sat seven GCSEs at school, having been pulled out of the others after being predicted ‘failure’ grades, which at the all-girls-grammar was classed as anything below a B so as not to upset their precious league table results. The Times did an expose on this practise last year and my Facebook was alight with women who had been in my year at school all saying the same thing – this has been happening for decades, why is it only being talked about now? Anyway, I sat seven GCSEs, and I passed four and a half of them. So there you go.</p>



<p>My Careers Advisor had boredly steered me towards the British Army recruiting office, suggesting entry level jobs in cooking, or the engineers. I went for an interview, at 16, cannon fodder with a skinhead, but for several reasons, didn’t sign up. I never considered pursuing writing as a career, and even now it astounds me that not only do I do it for a living with literally no qualifications for it, but my work is on the National Curriculum. Not bad, for a working class girl whose first job was cleaning tables at the local Wimpy on a Saturday and working weekdays in a chip shop.</p>



<p>Back – or forward – to 2012, and as my world shrank into a tiny flat, as friends fell away and I started to isolate myself from my family in shame and self-loathing and depression, the blog expanded to fill the space that human contact had left behind. I started to write about my day to day life, the mundane dreariness of living in a world of ‘no’. No you can’t have a comic. No there isn’t any afters. No you can’t have seconds. No we can’t go to the funfair on the seafront. No you’ll just have to wear those shoes for a bit longer and I’m sorry, I’ll stuff one of the free newspapers inside them to try to stretch them a little bit. No the heaters ‘don’t work’. No I don’t have any money to give you today, Mr Aggressive Bailiff Man. No I don’t have anything for you to take away, either. No I can’t come out for a pint. No, I don’t have the internet at home. No I can’t clear my rent arrears. No, please don’t make us leave, this is our home.</p>



<p>Then, in late 2012, Lisa Markwell was writing an article for the Independent about hospital food, back when it was a printed newspaper. I don’t remember exactly what was said but it was something about the cost of it, and maybe something about how for the money spent it could be better? Anyway, I tweeted her from my small, local politics and single mum fury twitter account and said that I had £7 for the weeks food for me and my son. She messaged me and asked if she could include it in the article. I said yes. It appeared as a gratifyingly brief single line in a short entry about the state of hospital meals, and Lisa stayed in touch with me to check how I was doing every now and then.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, a friend of mine sent me a press enquiry. ‘They’re looking for a Mum who’s going to have a really sh*t Christmas and I thought of you’ was the general gist of it. I bolted. Absolutely not; I’d managed to hide my situation from almost everyone I knew, there was no way I was talking to the national press about it. ‘They’ll pay you £250’, he added. It was a few days before Christmas. I had no presents for my son, no decorations, no tree, no cards, no heating, nothing. It was for the Sunday People. Nobody reads that anyway, I thought to myself, and reluctantly agreed to talk to them. As part of the interview, they asked me for a receipt from my weekly shop. I still have it in a box somewhere. The journalist sat in silence as she looked at the extremely short list of very basic groceries for a long and uncomfortable time. ‘What….do you make….with this?’ she asked. ‘Carrot and kidney bean burgers with that and that, then the same ingredients can be used to make a soup, and then…’ you get the idea. They included it in a sidebar on the double page spread, and I used the money from the interview to pay some bills and buy some £5 Mickey Mouse roller-skates for my son and a few festive bits and pieces. The world span madly on.</p>



<p>Then the Telegraph got in touch, asking if they could profile me for the paper. The writer seemed kind, and friendly, and so I said yes. Xanthe Clay came round for lunch, and we are still friends seven years later. She wrote a generous full page about my cooking, austerity cuts, and allowed me the space that the Sunday People had not to get a bit political and feisty. It was called My 49p Lunch With A Girl Called Jack and shortly afterwards, Penguin contacted me to offer me a recipe book deal.</p>

<p>I had applied for over 300 jobs since leaving the Fire Service. I had no confidence whatsoever in my ability to write a book – I didn’t even have a computer by now, having pawned it to pay some rent arrears – but what they were offering me was akin to a job. So I said yes. I didn’t expect anything from it, but it would give me a cushion to sink into while I found regular work. I took the phonecall while standing in the queue for the food bank, and literally collapsed with shock. Sitting in a back room with a volunteer and hot sweet tea and my bewildered looking child, I just cried and cried and cried. It was over, for a while. The cold and the fear and the hunger and the frightens and the door knocks, would be over for a while.</p>



<p>I wrote the majority of A Girl Called Jack by email on a Nokia E72. I still have it in my desk drawer, and every now and then I just stare at it, and its tiny awful buttons, and wonder how the f*ck I did it. Because I had no other choice but to. It was my one chance at escape, my yellow brick road, my shiny red slippers, and I took it. I remember, weeks after signing the contract, sleeping on the floor of a single bedroom in a house share I shared with five people and a bedroom I shared with my son, writing an email to Penguin begging them to release the initial signature payment because the local council had read about my book deal in the paper and withdrawn all of my benefits and I couldn’t pay my rent. To this day we (the council and I) remain in dispute about that period of my life. When one of my editors, a sweet Irish woman called Tamsin, discovered I was writing the book on my phone, she cleared a desk for me at their enormous great big office on the Strand with the big gold doors and insisted I come and work there to finish the manuscript. I had to wait for my signature payment to come through before I could afford the train fare, and some clothes that would be suitable to wear in an office environment, but she and everyone at Penguin were extraordinarily kind to me. Even when I produced a handwritten notebook of recipes and tried to hand it in as a completed manuscript, thinking that that was how real authors did things. (It is not, and do not ever do this to your editors, because it frightens the life out of them.)</p>



<p>A Girl Called Jack was a surprising success. And so – in the way that my calamitous life seems to work – my then-agency didn’t pay me my royalties for it. And they stonewalled every enquiry I made for months on end, claming amongst other things that I’d never been on their books. I was still a highlight on their website at the time. I have a new agent now, who fought a lengthy and frustrating battle to get some of them back to me. I think I had to sign a contract saying I wouldn’t mention it publicly. Oh well. We also had a contract saying that they would pay me what I earned, so we both know the value of a sodding signature, don’t we? It took almost three years to get back part of what I was owed, what I had worked for, what I had tapped out in the dark on my mobile phone night after night after night. I’m still angry. Recipes written from food bank parcels, by a single mother, in the cold wasteland of suicidal ideation and only-just-surviving. You would be angry too.</p>



<p>Anyway. The point of this was to point out that I am not a success story. I’m not an inspiration, and I’m not an example. I am a broken, f*cked up, messy rotten husk of a human being who almost died – several times – under benefit fuckups and austerity measures. I still live in fear, haunted by hunger and cold and failure and self-neglect. My mental health is an absolute shitshow. I have arthritis, diagnosed in my mid twenties, likely exacerbated by living in bitter cold and damp and mould for two whole winters and every day and night in between. I am cold, closed, and still angry. Post traumatic stress has cost me every single long term relationship ever since. I retreat into the basest of animal instincts when I am frightened, curling into a ball, howling, roaring, sobbing, clawing at the floor. That switch can flick from anything from a noise in the garden at night, to a missed bill payment starting a spiral of avoidance into red-topped letters, again. The fear never goes away. I understand now that it probably never will. Poverty has been proven to change the very makeup of a persons brain. I am damaged beyond reasonable repair. I know, because I have tried everything, from NHS therapists to a crisis care team to a stint at The Priory. Hypnotherapy, herbal tea, yoga, big walks, religion, vodka, talking, cardio, volunteer work, wounded healer nonsense, you name it, I’ve probably given it a go. So all I think I can do, and what I try to do, is use my experiences to make things better for other people in similar situations. I don’t always get it right, but I try my best with what I have and who I have become in this emotional wasteland. And then, I reason with myself, it was for something. Like kintsugi for the fibre of my being, crawling around picking up the broken pieces and trying to patch them back together with slivers of gold. Making something useful, and not altogether hideous, from the wreckage.</p>



<p>This is longer than I intended but I guess I had things to say. And my main point is that poverty and privilege are largely accidental. You don’t choose to be born into an income bracket, a country pile, a housing estate, a double barrelled name or a damp tenement bedsit. But ignorance is a choice. And choosing to use your privileges to patronise people whose lives are entirely beyond your experience and comprehension, is a choice. Choosing to use the powers vested in you by the constituencies you serve, to deprive those same constituents of light, heating, food and home security is a wilful and deliberate act. And it has to stop. Because I am one of millions of people who has lived in bitter, life-changing, cruel poverty in this country, and I will continue to tell my story with all of the uncomfortable details and horror and fury until that changes for the better.</p>



<p>And if your response to people in crisis is to simply lecture paternalistically about how you would be better at being poor than they would, I suggest you put your money where your flapping great mouth is, and give it all away. To women refuges, child support services, food banks, and every other organisation trying to patch up the screaming great holes in the social security safety nets that millions of children are falling through. You may well know the price of potatoes, but in order to tackle food poverty on a real level, not just a pontification for a jolly brouhaha on the internet, you need to understand the value of compassion as well.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848.jpg?resize=557%2C371&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="557" height="371" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848.jpg?resize=557%2C371&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-600x400.jpg 600w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-300x200.jpg 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-768x512.jpg 768w" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p id="caption-attachment-1425">A flat I was refused a viewing on, to rent, because I was on benefits. October 2012. I still remember how humiliated I was standing in their office being told I wasn’t the kind of tenant they wanted. A couple of years later I was elected as the tenants rep to an advisory group for local landlords and agents and I recounted that story in my thank you speech, in front of all of their peers.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-765x1024.jpeg?resize=765%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="765" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-765x1024.jpeg?resize=765%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 765w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-600x803.jpeg 600w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-224x300.jpeg 224w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-768x1028.jpeg 768w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2-1080x1446.jpeg 1080w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2.jpeg 1936w" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<p id="caption-attachment-313">Light of my life, and the boy I would do anything for. March 2012. Note the too-small trousers, the cold red face and hands and feet and the hard wooden floor, two tops and a jumper. Don’t talk to me about socks, kids are awful at keeping those on. Even now, eight years later, I have to pointedly tell him to put his socks on! But at least his trousers fit these days.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130212-224110-790x1024.jpg?resize=790%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="790" height="1024" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130212-224110.jpg 790w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130212-224110-600x778.jpg 600w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130212-224110-231x300.jpg 231w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130212-224110-768x995.jpg 768w" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<p id="caption-attachment-2348">February 2013. Same nonsense, seven years ago. I’m so very tired. They called me Jackie because they thought their readers would think my name was weird. I think it’s weirder calling me something that’s not my name, but there we go.</p>
