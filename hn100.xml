<p>When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends <strong>all</strong> DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that <strong>all</strong> requests must be routed through the proxy.</p>
<h2>But…</h2>
<p>While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests—particularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs—were not being received by our proxy!</p>
<p>There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing <strong>some</strong> requests to bypass the installed DNS proxy and be sent unencrypted to the system’s default name server instead.</p>
<p>Note that this bug likely affects any kind of DNS proxy, not just Little Snitch.</p>
<p>So, if you rely on the new DNS encryption feature of Little Snitch 6, or if you are using another third-party DNS proxy, be aware that some DNS lookups may bypass the proxy until Apple provides a fix in a future macOS update.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DNS lookups performed via higher-level APIs do not appear to be affected by this bug. For example, your web-browsing in Safari or Chrome still fully benefits from encrypted lookups. Firefox, on the other hand, does seem to be affected.</p>
<h2>How to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enable DNS encryption in Little Snitch &gt; Settings.</li>
<li>Start <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> with a capture filter for <code>port 53</code>.</li>
<li>Run the following code in an Xcode playground:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>import Foundation

let domain = "dnsproxytest.com"
var result: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;addrinfo&gt;?
let status = getaddrinfo(domain, nil, nil, &amp; result)</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the lookup for <code>dnsproxytest.com</code> can be seen in Wireshark in unencrypted form on UDP port 53 (the default for unencrypted lookups).</p>
<p>Additionally, you will see that Little Snitch Network Monitor does not display any traffic for the lookup because the lookup completely bypasses the network filter!</p>
<p>We have reported this bug to Apple and hope for a fix soon. Please stay tuned, we will keep you updated here.</p>
<h2>Update 2024-09-17, 7:10 p.m.</h2>
<p>After further investigation, we found that this bug has already existed at least since macOS 14.5 Sonoma (maybe even earlier, but we currently don’t have access to an older 14.x system for testing).</p></section>

  <p>We’re delighted to announce the general availability of Swift 6. This is a major new release that expands Swift to more platforms and domains.</p>

<p>Many people know of Swift as a language for app development, with a million apps on the App Store. But Swift is great for more than just apps. Swift’s safety, speed, and approachability make it a great choice for many other use cases including libraries, internet-scale services, and the most performance-critical and secure code.</p>

<p>Swift 6 scales even further through new low-level programming features, an embedded Swift language subset, expanded Linux and Windows support, new cross-platform APIs including the new Swift Testing library, and more.</p>

<p>Read on for a deep dive into changes to the language, standard libraries, debugging, platform support, and next steps for getting started with Swift 6.</p>

<h2 id="language-and-standard-library">Language and Standard Library <a title="Permalink for Language and Standard Library section" href="#language-and-standard-library">
            <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?--> 
          </a></h2>



<p>Swift has long offered memory safety, ensuring that variables are initialized before they’re used, memory isn’t accessed after it’s been deallocated, and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.  Swift 6 now includes a new, opt-in language mode that extends Swift’s safety guarantees to prevent data races in concurrent code by diagnosing potential data races in your code as compiler errors.</p>

<p>Data-race safety checks were previously available as warnings in Swift 5.10 through the <code>-strict-concurrency=complete</code> compiler flag. Thanks to improved <code>Sendable</code> inference and new compiler analysis for transferring mutable state from one actor to another, Swift 6 warnings about data-race safety have fewer false positives. You can find more information about the Swift 6 language mode and how to migrate at <a href="http://swift.org/migration">Swift.org/migration</a>.</p>

<p>Swift 6 marks the start of the journey to make data-race safety dramatically easier. The usability of data-race safety remains an area of active development, and your feedback will help shape future improvements.</p>

<p>Swift 6 also comes with a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/synchronization">Synchronization library</a> for low-level concurrency APIs, including atomic operations and a new mutex API.</p>



<p>Swift 6 enables functions to specify the type of error that they throw as part of their signature. This feature is useful in generic code that forwards along errors thrown in client code, or in resource-constrained environments that cannot allocate memory, such as in embedded Swift code.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span> <span>string</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>ParseError</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Record</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>// ... </span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A call to <code>parseRecord(from:)</code> will either return a <code>Record</code> instance or throw an error of type <code>ParseError</code>. A <code>do..catch</code> block will infer <code>ParseError</code> as the type of the <code>error</code> variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>do</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>record</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>myString</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// 'error' has type 'ParseError'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Typed throws generalizes over throwing and non-throwing functions. A function that is specified as <code>throws</code> (without a specific error type) is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(any Error)</code>, whereas a non-throwing function is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(Never)</code>. Calls to functions that are <code>throws(Never)</code> are non-throwing and don’t require error handling at the call site.</p>

<p>Typed throws can also be used in generic functions to propagate error types from parameters, in a manner that is more precise than <code>rethrows</code>. For example, the <code>Sequence.map</code> method can propagate the thrown error type from its closure parameter, indicating that it only throws the same type of errors as the closure:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>extension</span> <span>Sequence</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Element</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>// ... </span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When given a closure that throws <code>ParseError</code>, <code>map</code> will throw <code>ParseError</code>. When given a non-throwing closure, <code>E</code> is inferred to <code>Never</code> and <code>map</code> will not throw.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced non-copyable types with the <code>~Copyable</code> syntax for modeling resources with unique ownership, and writing performance-conscious code by eliminating the runtime overhead associated with copying. Swift 6 now supports these types with the generics system, making it possible to write generic code that works with both copyable and non-copyable types.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>protocol</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>:</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>consuming</span> <span>func</span> <span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>,</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Water</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>consuming</span> <span>some</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>~Copyable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>())</span>
<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Water</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>Drinkable</code> protocol has no requirement that its conforming types are <code>Copyable</code>. This means both the non-copyable type <code>Coffee</code> and copyable type <code>Water</code> can be passed into the generic <code>drink</code> function.</p>

<p>Switch statements can now be written to avoid copying within enum pattern-matching operations. This means that switch statements can be used with non-copyable payloads and can also provide performance benefits for copyable payloads, especially those based on copy-on-write containers like <code>Array</code> and <code>Dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>Non-copyable types are already used throughout the standard libraries. For instance, the new <code>Atomic</code> type in the Synchronization library is based on <code>~Copyable</code>, <code>Optional</code> and <code>Result</code> can now wrap non-copyable types, and the unsafe buffer pointer types can now point to non-copyable elements. C++ interoperability also uses non-copyable types to expose C++ move-only types to Swift.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced bidirectional interoperability with C++ to seamlessly bring Swift to more existing projects. Swift 6 expands interoperability support to C++ move-only types, virtual methods, default arguments, and more standard library types including <code>std::map</code> and <code>std::optional</code>.</p>

<p>C++ types that do not have a copy constructor can now be accessed from Swift 6 as non-copyable types with <code>~Copyable</code>. And for those times when it’s useful to expose a C++ type with a copy constructor as <code>~Copyable</code> in Swift for better performance, a new <code>SWIFT_NONCOPYABLE</code> annotation can be applied to the C++ type.</p>

<p>Swift now also supports calls of C++ virtual methods on types annotated as <code>SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE</code> or <code>SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE</code>.</p>

<p>When calling C++ functions or methods that have default argument values for some of their parameters, Swift now respects these default values, rather than requiring you to explicitly pass an argument.</p>



<p>Swift 6 includes a preview of <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Embedded Swift</a>, a language subset and compilation mode suitable for embedded software development, such as programming microcontrollers. The toolchain supports ARM and RISC-V bare-metal targets.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift produces small and standalone binaries by relying on generic specialization. Since it doesn’t rely on a runtime or type metadata, Embedded Swift is suitable for platforms with tight memory constraints as well as use in low-level environments with limited runtime dependencies.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift remains an experimental feature, with ongoing development before stable support in a future Swift release.</p>



<p>Swift 6 rounds out the set of low-level integer primitives with the addition of signed and unsigned <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0425-int128.md">128-bit integer types</a>. These are available on all Swift platforms, and provide the same API as other fixed-width integer types in the standard library.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces a number of productivity enhancements, including <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/count(where:)"><code>count(where:)</code></a> to streamline counting the number of elements in a sequence that satisfy a predicate, <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/pack-iteration/">pack iteration</a> for writing natural <code>for</code>-loops over the elements in a value parameter pack, access control for imports to keep implementation details from leaking into your public APIs, <code>@attached(body)</code> macros for synthesizing and augmenting function implementations, expression macros as default arguments, and more.</p>

<p>You can find a complete list of language proposals that were accepted through the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a> process and implemented in Swift 6 on the <a href="https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/#?version=6.0">Swift Evolution dashboard</a>.</p>





<p>Swift 6 provides a new debugging macro to easily customize how an object is displayed in LLDB when using the <code>p</code> command, and in the variables view in Xcode and VSCode, by using a formatting scheme that does not run arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Types that conform to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> provide a <code>debugDescription</code> property that returns a string describing the object. In LLDB, the <code>po</code> command calls this computed property on an object. In contrast, the <code>p</code> command uses LLDB’s type summary formatters to directly format the object using its stored property values.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugdescription()"><code>@DebugDescription</code></a> is a new macro in the standard library which lets you specify LLDB type summaries for your own types directly in code. The macro processes the <code>debugDescription</code> property, translating simple string interpolations involving stored properties into LLDB type summaries. This allows LLDB to use your custom formatting even when using <code>p</code>, and also in Xcode or VSCode’s variable display windows. The macro can use an existing conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, or you can provide a separate string interpolation only for use in LLDB’s <code>p</code> command. Providing a separate LLDB description string is useful if your <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> implementation doesn’t meet the requirements of the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro, or if you’re familiar with the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/variable.html#summary-strings">LLDB Summary String syntax</a> and you want to use it directly.</p>

<p>For example, the following code customizes how <code>po</code> in LLDB displays the <code>Organization</code> type with a conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, and the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro exposes this custom formatting to the <code>p</code> command and the variables view:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@DebugDescription</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Organization</span><span>:</span> <span>CustomDebugStringConvertible</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>manager</span><span>:</span> <span>Person</span>
  <span>// ... and more</span>

  <span>var</span> <span>debugDescription</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"#</span><span>\(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>\(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span> [</span><span>\(</span><span>manager</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>]"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>(lldb) p myOrg
(Organization) myOrg = "`#100 Worldwide Travel [Jonathan Swift]`" 
</code></pre></div>



<p>Swift 6 dramatically improves startup performance in the debugger when you use explicit module builds. When debugging locally-built code, LLDB can now import explicitly-built Swift and Clang modules directly from the project build artifacts. This avoids the need to recompile implicit Clang module dependencies from source, which can take a long time, and it’s very sensitive to issues with header search paths. If the first <code>p</code> or <code>po</code> command in LLDB takes a long time due to Clang module compilation, or if your debugging is frequently blocked by Clang header import problems, consider adopting explicit modules in your project!</p>





<p>Swift 6 unifies the implementation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/">Foundation</a> across all platforms. The modern, portable Swift implementation provides consistency across platforms, it’s more robust, and it’s open source. macOS and iOS started using the Swift implementation of Foundation alongside Swift 5.9, and Swift 6 brings these improvements to Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Core types like <code>JSONDecoder</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>Calendar</code>, <code>FileManager</code>, <code>ProcessInfo</code>, and more have been completely reimplemented in Swift. These types share their implementation with macOS 15 and iOS 18, providing a new level of cross-platform consistency, reliability, and performance. Recently released APIs like <code>FormatStyle</code>, <code>ParseStrategy</code>, <code>Predicate</code>, and <code>JSON5</code>, from past macOS and iOS releases are now available on all Swift platforms. New Foundation APIs like <code>Expression</code>, calendar enumeration improvements, calendar recurrence rules, format style enhancements, and more are available simultaneously on macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows - and they were built with community involvement.</p>

<p>If your Linux or Windows app imports the <code>Foundation</code> library from the Swift toolchain today, you get all of these improvements for free. And if your app is particularly sensitive to binary size, you can now import the <code>FoundationEssentials</code> library, which provides a more targeted subset of Foundation’s features that omits internationalization and localization data.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces Swift Testing, a new testing library designed from the ground up for Swift. It includes expressive APIs that make it easy to write and organize tests. It provides detailed output when a test fails using macros like <code>#expect</code>. And it scales to large codebases with features like parameterization to easily repeat a test with different arguments.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@Test</span><span>(</span><span>"Continents mentioned in videos"</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"A Beach"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"By the Lake"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"Camping in the Woods"</span>
<span>])</span>
<span>func</span> <span>mentionedContinents</span><span>(</span><span>videoName</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>throws</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>videoLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>VideoLibrary</span><span>()</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>video</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>#require</span><span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>videoLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>video</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span> <span>videoName</span><span>))</span>
  <span>#expect(video.mentionedContinents.count &lt;= 3)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Swift Testing takes full advantage of macros. Its <code>@Test</code> and <code>@Suite</code> attached macros declare test functions and suite types respectively, and they accept arguments (known as traits) to customize various behaviors. The <code>#expect</code> and <code>#require</code> expression macros validate expected behaviors, and capture rich representation of expressions and their sub-values to produce detailed failure messages.</p>

<p>Since Swift Testing is included directly in Swift 6 toolchains, you can <code>import Testing</code> without needing to declare a package dependency. This means your tests do not need to build Swift Testing or its dependencies (including swift-syntax), and its macro implementation comes prebuilt. The package manager in Swift 6 automatically builds and runs Swift Testing tests in addition to XCTests (if present), and shows results from both libraries in log output. Swift Testing supports all platforms that Swift officially supports, including all Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows.</p>

<p>To learn more about this new open source project, visit the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-testing">swift-testing</a> repository on GitHub, and get involved with its ongoing development <a href="https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/swift-testing/103">on the forums</a>.</p>



<p>Swift is designed to support development and execution on all major operating systems, and platform consistency and expansion underpins Swift’s ability to reach new programming domains. Swift 6 brings major improvements to Linux and Windows across the board, including support for more Linux distributions and Windows architectures. Toolchains for all of the following platforms are available for download from <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/">Swift.org/install</a>.</p>



<p>Swift 6 supports building fully statically linked executables for Linux; these have no external dependencies, so they are ideal for situations where you want to copy a program directly onto a system or into a container and run it without installing any extra software. The SDK can also be used to cross-compile to Linux from other platforms. Learn how to <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html">get started with the static SDK for Linux</a> on <a href="http://swift.org/">Swift.org</a>.</p>



<p>Swift 6 adds official support and testing for Debian and Fedora, as well as on Ubuntu 24.04.</p>



<p>Prebuilt toolchains are now available for the arm64 architecture, which provides improved compiler performance for Windows on ARM hosts. In Swift 6, the Swift package manager also parallelizes builds across multiple cores on Windows by default. On a 10-core machine, this can improve build performance by up to a factor of 10!</p>





<p>You can try out these exciting new developments in Swift 6 today! Install the official Swift 6 toolchains for macOS, Linux, and Windows at <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/">Swift.org/install</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/">The Swift Programming Language</a> book has been updated to reflect the latest Swift 6 syntax and features. It serves as the official Swift guide and an excellent starting point for learning the language.</p>

<p>To help kickstart your Swift journey, <a href="https://www.swift.org/getting-started/">Swift.org/getting-started</a> offers tutorials for various use cases, including building a cross-platform library, a web service using Vapor, and an embedded application for a microcontroller. There are also articles for diving deeper into some of Swift’s most popular features.</p>



<p>The Swift package ecosystem is continuously growing with new technologies to help you with a variety of tasks in your projects. You can explore package highlights at <a href="https://www.swift.org/packages/">Swift.org/packages</a>, which features popular package categories and a selection of new and notable packages that are hand-curated from an open nomination process every month.</p>

<p>“This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backwards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another employee suggested they’d rather be put on the company’s aggressive <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/">performance improvement plan</a> than comply with the mandate: “Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me… Take my money and leave?”</p>



<p>Employees aren’t just talking about quitting, a small few have already changed their status on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/">LinkedIn</a> to #opentowork as they openly search for more flexible jobs.</p>



<p>“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the networking platform.</p>



<p>“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”</p>



<p>A <span>commentator on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>&nbsp;who claims to have worked at Amazon for three years sai</span>d that they’re mentally checking out of their current role while they hunt for another.</p>



<p>“Probably going to soft quit and get a new job. F—k Jassy,” the user wrote, describing the measure as a “swift kick to the nuts.”</p>







<p>Amazon veteran, Jassy—who took the helm after Jeff Bezos <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/">stepped down</a> in 2021—issued a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" rel="noopener">memo</a> to all staffers yesterday that said they will be required to work in the office “the way we were before the onset of COVID.”</p>



<p>“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,” Jassy, who started working at the $1.94 trillion tech giant in 1997, wrote.</p>



<p>Of course, many people moved to the suburbs and made childcare arrangements according to the company’s current 3 day in-office policy—or as Jassy puts it “set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments.”</p>



<p>That’s why the 56-year-old said that the new stricter enforcement will not kick in until the new year to “help ensure a smooth transition.”</p>



<p>The CEO added that moving forward remote working will be reserved for emergency scenarios like “if you or your child” is sick.</p>



<h2>‘What better way to cut jobs’</h2>



<p>Jassy positioned the changes at Amazon—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work.</p>



<p>“We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another,” Jassy insisted.</p>



<p>However, some disgruntled proffesionals have suggested that the new policy is designed to reduce its current 1.5 million-plus headcount.</p>



<p>“This is a layoff in disguise,” one user complained on Reddit. “Return to the office or you’re fired and we don’t have to pay any severance or unemployment.”</p>



<p>“What better way to cut jobs than to force everyone back into the office and watch people quit in droves,” another wrote.</p>



<p>Amazon didn’t respond to <em>Fortune’s</em> request for comment, including whether the policy is a thinly veiled headcount reduction.</p>



<p>However, the company has previously used its in-office mandate to cut out defiant workers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Amazon managers were given the green light to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/">fire employees</a> who fail to show face three days a week in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile the company’s “return-to-hub” mandate in July forced remote workers to pick working (and in some cases <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" rel="noopener">relocating</a>) to the closest office to them—or resign.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>When you are developing a game for PC – or porting one – then you will have to deal with user input, generally from three distinct categories of sources: <strong>mouse</strong>, <strong>keyboard</strong>, and <strong>gamepads</strong>.</p><p>At first, it could reasonably be assumed that mouse and keyboard should be the simplest parts of this to deal with, but in reality, they are not – at least if we are talking about Windows. In fact, <strong><em>several extremely popular AAA games ship with severe mouse input issues when specific high-end mice are used</em></strong>, and some popular engines have issues that are still extant.</p><p>In this article we’ll explore a few reasons why that is the case, and end up with a solution that works but is still unsatisfactory. I assume that there is a whole other level of complexity involved in properly dealing with accessories like steering wheels, flight sticks, and so on in simulators, but so far I never had the pleasure of working on a game that required this, and this article will not cover those types of input devices.</p><blockquote><p>If you are already an expert on game input on Windows, please skip directly to <a href="#our-current-solution">our current solution</a> and tell us how to do it better, because I hope fervently that it’s not the best!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>While the vast majority of this article is about mouse input, we also recently discovered something really interesting about xinput performance that we will share <a href="#a-note-on-xinput">towards the end of the article</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="background--raw-input">Background – Raw Input</h2><p>In Windows, there are many ways to receive input from the user. The most traditional one is to receive Windows messages, which are sent to your application’s message queue. This is how you receive keyboard and mouse input in a typical Windows application. However, this method has a few drawbacks when it comes to games.</p><p>The most notable of these drawbacks is that you cannot use the message queue to receive precise and unaltered mouse input, which is particularly important for any game where the mouse is used to control a 3D camera. Traditional input is meant to control a cursor, and the system will apply acceleration and other transformations to the input before it reaches your application, and also won’t give you sub-pixel precision.</p><blockquote><p>If your game only has cursor-based input, e.g. a strategy game or point-and-click adventure, then you can probably get away with ignoring everything mouse-related in this article and just blissfully use standard Windows messages.</p></blockquote><p>The solution to this problem is to use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/using-raw-input">Raw Input API</a>, which allows you to receive input from devices like mice and keyboards in a raw, unaltered form. This is the API that most games use to receive input from the mouse, and the linked article provides a good overview of how to use it, which I will not repeat here.</p><p>So, why the somewhat whiny undertone of this article? Oh, we’re just getting started.</p><p><a href="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg"><img data-src="/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg" alt="A Razer Viper mouse with 8k polling rate" width="90%" id="fancyimg" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg"></a> <em>A Razer Viper mouse with 8k polling rate – I assume that all of these people stare in bewilderment as to why some of their games drop by 100 FPS when they use it (Image source: Razer)</em></p><h2 id="using-raw-input"><span>Using Raw Input</span><a href="#using-raw-input"><i></i></a></h2><p>If you are familiar with the Raw Input API, or just read the linked documentation, then you might believe that I’m just getting at the importance of using buffered input rather than processing individual events, but really, that wouldn’t be too bad or worth an article. The real problem is that it is not nearly as simple as that – in fact, as far as I can tell, <strong>there is no good general way to do this at all</strong>.</p><p>Let’s step back a bit – for those who have not done this before, there are two ways to receive raw input from a device:</p><ol><li><p>Using <strong>standard reads</strong> from the device, which is the most straightforward way to do it. This basically just involves receiving additional messages of type <code>WM_INPUT</code> in your message queue, which you can then process.</p></li><li><p>Using <strong>buffered reads</strong>, where you access all extant raw input events at once by calling <code>GetRawInputBuffer</code>.</p></li></ol><p>As you might surmise, the latter method is designed to be more performant, as message handling of individual events using the message queue is not particularly efficient.</p><p>Now, actually doing this, and doing it correctly, is not as easy as it should be – or maybe I just missed something. As far as I can tell, to prevent problems related to “losing” messages that occur at specific points in time, while only processing raw input in batched form, you need to do something like the following:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>As shown in the code snippet above, you need to peek all messages except <code>WM_INPUT</code> to ensure that you don’t lose any messages that occur between the times you are processing batched raw input and “normal” messages. This is not made particularly clear in the documentation, and it’s also not made particularly easy by the API, but a few extra lines of code can solve the problem.</p><p>All of this <em>still</em> wouldn’t be a big deal, just the normal amount of scuff you expect when working on an operating system which has a few decades of backwards compatibility to maintain. So, let’s get to the real problem.</p><h2 id="the-real-problem"><span>The Real Problem</span><a href="#the-real-problem"><i></i></a></h2><p>Let’s assume you did all this correctly, and are now receiving raw input from the mouse, in a buffered way, as suggested. You might think that you are done, but you are not. In fact, you are <em>still</em> just getting started.</p><p><a href="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png"><img data-src="/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png" alt="Comparison Frametime Chart with and without mouse movement" width="90%" id="fancyimg" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png"></a> <em>Comparison between no mouse movement (upper part) and mouse movement (lower part), everything else equal</em></p><p>What you see above is a comparison of the frametime performance chart of a game, in the exact same scene. The only difference is that in the lower part, the mouse is being vigorously shaken about – and not just any mouse, but a high-end one with a polling rate of 8 kHz. As you can see, just moving the mouse around destroys performance, dropping from being consistently pegged at the soft FPS cap (around 360 FPS) to ~133 FPS and becoming completely unstable. <strong><em>Just by vigorous mouse movement.</em></strong></p><p>Now you might think “Aha, he included this to show how important it is to use batched processing!”. Sadly not, what you see above <em>is, in fact, the performance of the game when using batched raw input processing</em>. Let’s talk about why this is the case, and what to do about it.</p><h2 id="the-bane-of-legacy-input"><span>The Bane of Legacy Input</span><a href="#the-bane-of-legacy-input"><i></i></a></h2><p>To make a long story short, the problem is so-called <strong>“legacy input”</strong>. When you initialize raw input for a device using <code>RegisterRawInputDevices</code>, you can specify the <code>RIDEV_NOLEGACY</code> flag. This flag prevents the system from generating “legacy” messages, such as <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code>. And there we have our problem: if you don’t specify this flag, then the system will generate both raw input messages and legacy messages, and the latter will still clutter your message queue.</p><p>So once again, why am I whining about this? Just disable legacy input, right? Indeed, that completely solves the performance issue – as long as you do everything else correctly as outlined above of course.</p><p>And then you congratulate yourself on a job well done, and move on to the next task. A few days later after the build is pushed to beta testers, you get a bug report that the game window can no longer be moved around. And then you realize that you just disabled the system’s ability to move the window around, because that is done using legacy input.</p><blockquote><p>Disabling legacy input disables any form of input interaction that you would normally expect to be handled by the system.</p></blockquote><p>So what can we do about this? Here is a short list of things I considered, or even fully implemented, and which either don’t work, can not actually be done, or are just silly in terms of complexity:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use a separate message-only window and thread for input processing</strong>. This seemed like a good solution, so I went through the trouble of implementing it. It basically involves creating an entirely separate invisible window and registering raw input with it rather than the main window. A bit of a hassle, but it seemed like it would resolve the issue and do it “right”. No luck: the system will still generate high-frequency legacy messages for the main window, even if the raw input device is registered with the other window.</p><blockquote><p>Raw input affects the entire process, even though the API takes a window handle.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Only disable legacy input in fullscreen modes</strong>. This would at least solve the problem for the vast majority of users, but it’s not possible, as far as I can tell. You seemingly <strong>cannot</strong> switch between legacy and raw input once you’ve enabled it. You might think <code>RIDEV_REMOVE</code> would help, but that completely removes all input that the device generates, including both legacy and raw input.</p><blockquote><p>You can’t switch between legacy and raw input once you’ve enabled it.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Use a separate process to provide raw input</strong>. This is a bit of a silly idea, but it’s one that I can think of that would actually work. You could create a separate process that provides raw input to the main process, and then use some form of IPC to communicate the input. This would be a massive hassle, and I really don’t want to support something like that, but I’m pretty sure it would work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disable legacy input, create your own legacy input events at low frequency</strong>. Another one in the category of “silly ideas that probably could work”, but there are a <em>lot</em> of legacy messages and this would be another support nightmare.</p></li><li><p><strong>Move everything else out of the thread that does the main message queue processing</strong>. This is something I would probably try if I was doing greenfield development, but it’s a massive change to make to an existing codebase, as in our porting use case. And it would still mean that this one thread is spending tons of time uselessly going through input messages.</p></li></ol><p>So option 1 and 2 would be somewhat viable, but the former doesn’t actually work, and the latter is not possible. The others are, in my opinion, too silly to explore for actually shipping a game, or infeasible for a porting project.</p><p>So perhaps now you can see both why there are AAA games shipping on PC which break with 8 kHz mice, and why I’m <em>just a bit</em> frustrated with the situation. So what are we actually doing?</p><h2 id="our-current-solution">Our Current Solution</h2><p>Our current solution is very dumb and seems like it shouldn’t work, or at least have some severe repercussions, but so far it does seem to work fine and not have any issues. It’s a bit of a hack, but it’s the best we’ve got so far.</p><p>This solution involves <strong>keeping legacy input enabled</strong>, but using <strong>batched raw input for actual game input</strong>. And then the stupid trick: <strong>prevent performance collapse by just not processing more than <code>N</code> message queue events per frame.</strong></p><p>We are currently working with <code>N=5</code>, but that’s a somewhat random choice. When I tried this I had a lot of concerns: what if tons of messages build up? What if the window becomes unresponsive? I didn’t worry about the game input itself, because we rapidly and with very low latency get all the buffered raw input events, but the window interactions might become unresponsive due to message buildup.</p><p>After quite a lot of testing with an 8 kHz mouse, none of that seems to happen, even if you really try to make it happen.</p><p>So, that’s where we are: an entirely unsatisfactory solution that seems to work fine, and provides 8k raw input without performance collapse and without affecting “legacy” windows interactions. If you know how to actually do this properly, please write a comment to this post, or failing that send an email, stop me in the street and tell me, or even send a carrier pigeon. I would be very grateful.</p><h2 id="a-note-on-xinput">A Note on XInput</h2><p>This is completely unrelated to the rest of the article, other than being about input, but I found it interesting and it might be new to some. When you use the XInput API to work with gamepads, you might think there is very little you can do wrong. It’s an exceedingly simple API, and mostly you just use <code>XInputGetState</code>. However, the documentation has this curious note, which is quite easy to miss:</p><blockquote><p>For performance reasons, don’t call XInputGetState for an ‘empty’ user slot every frame. We recommend that you space out checks for new controllers every few seconds instead.</p></blockquote><p>This is not an empty phrase: we have observed performance losses of 10-15% in extremely CPU-limited cases just by calling <code>XInputGetState</code> for all controllers every frame while none are connected!</p><p>I have no idea why the API would be designed like this, and not have some internal event-based tracking that makes calls for disconnected controller slots essentially free, but there you have it. You actually have to implement your own fallback mechanism to avoid this performance hit, since there’s no alternative API (at least in pure XInput) to tell you whether a controller is connected.</p><p>This is another area where an existing API is quite unsatisfactory – you generally want to avoid things that make every Nth frame take longer than the ones surrounding it, so you’d need to move all that to another thread. But it’s still much easier to deal with than the raw mouse input / high polling rate issue.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Game input in Windows ain’t great. I hope this article saves someone the time it took me to delve into this rabbit hole, and as I said above I’d love to hear from you if you know how to do this truly <strong>properly</strong>.</p><p><em>And we haven’t even gone into keyboard layouts yet!</em> Are you a QWERTZ user and have you ever wondered why some games have default bindings that have actions on e.g. <code>Z</code>, <code>X</code> and <code>C</code>, which makes no sense on your input device? But that’s a story for another day.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Question for Quote Investigator: </strong>Apparently, sometime during the 1950s a popular writer of detective fiction crafted a short passage parodying science fiction. Within the passage the word “Google” appeared long before the company Google existed. The passage displayed remarkable prescience. The word “Google” referred to an entity that provided information. Would you please explore this topic and provide a citation?</p>



<p><strong>Reply from Quote Investigator: </strong>The writer Raymond Chandler is best known as the creator of the hardboiled detective character Philip Marlowe. In 1953 Chandler sent a letter to a friend which included a jargon-filled passage parodying science fiction writing. Boldface added to excerpts by <strong>QI</strong>:<sup data-fn="ff8d2b0d-dcda-4a73-823e-bfdbc411f44a"><a href="#ff8d2b0d-dcda-4a73-823e-bfdbc411f44a" id="ff8d2b0d-dcda-4a73-823e-bfdbc411f44a-link">1</a></sup></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Did you ever read what they call Science Fiction. It’s a scream. It is written like this: <strong>“I checked out with K 19 on Aldabaran III, and stepped out through the crummalite hatch on my 22 Model Sirus Hardtop. I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue manda grass. My breath froze into pink pretzels.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The final sentence of Chandler’s passage included the word “Google”:<sup data-fn="586089a3-2066-4980-b374-0508cf457454"><a href="#586089a3-2066-4980-b374-0508cf457454" id="586089a3-2066-4980-b374-0508cf457454-link">2</a></sup></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. <strong>I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn’t enough. </strong>He was right.”</p>



<p>They pay brisk money for this crap?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Chandler used the pronoun “he” when referring back to “Google”; hence, the character “Google” may have been a male human, a male alien, or a personified computing device.</p>



<p>Chandler played cricket when he was young, and he may have been influenced by the term “google” which is applied to balls which break or swerve. Alternatively, Chandler may have been influenced by the comic strip character Barney Google or by the term “Googol” which refers to the enormous number 10<sup>100</sup> which can be written as 1 followed by one hundred zeroes.</p>



<p>Below are additional selected citations in chronological order.</p>



<p>In 1990 the science fiction anthology “Universe 1” included a story by Barry N. Malzberg which began with a reprint of Chandler’s letter. Malzberg’s goal was to construct an entertaining story which included every phrase of Chandler’s mocking prose.<sup data-fn="69955daa-ed3b-41e0-97e9-3f858a261555"><a href="#69955daa-ed3b-41e0-97e9-3f858a261555" id="69955daa-ed3b-41e0-97e9-3f858a261555-link">3</a></sup> Here is an excerpt from Malzberg’s tale:<sup data-fn="139e8dd4-5381-489a-8423-8e5b5b179ce2"><a href="#139e8dd4-5381-489a-8423-8e5b5b179ce2" id="139e8dd4-5381-489a-8423-8e5b5b179ce2-link">4</a></sup></p>



<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>waded through the bright blue manda grass</strong> toward the beckoning Bryll, feeling the pull of the mud as I tried to clamber away, retain balance. This more than anything else they enjoy, taking our dignity, making us cartoons, yanking from us the solemnity of our distress and placing us on a flat and colorful map where we deal with pale, exploded forms who may or may not be representative of the Brylls themselves. We do not know if it is submission or some parody of conquest. <strong>My breath froze into pink pretzels </strong>as I squeaked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sergey Brin and Larry Page were the original creators of a search engine called Backrub which was renamed Google in 1997. It is natural to wonder whether they might have somehow encountered the passage written by Chandler, but there is no evidence supporting that possibility. Instead, the book “In the Plex” by journalist Steven Levy presented the following explanation for the name choice:<sup data-fn="a4271451-ada1-4156-8078-6a253d965441"><a href="#a4271451-ada1-4156-8078-6a253d965441" id="a4271451-ada1-4156-8078-6a253d965441-link">5</a></sup></p>



<blockquote>
<p>In September 1997, Page and Brin renamed BackRub to something they hoped would be suitable for a business . . . <strong>Page’s dorm roommate suggested they call it “googol.” </strong>. . . “The name reflected the scale of what we were doing,” Brin explained a few years later. “It actually became a better choice of name later on, because now we have billions of pages and images and groups and documents, and hundreds of millions of searches a day.” <strong>Page misspelled the word,</strong> which was just as well since the Internet address for the correct spelling was already taken. “Google” was available. “It was easy to type and memorable,” says Page.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2006 “The Wit &amp; Wisdom of Great Writers” compiled by Nick Holt included an entry which reprinted part of the Chandler’s science fiction passage while crediting Chandler.<sup data-fn="75d0a7d7-a979-4a52-9292-f65fdf61a5be"><a href="#75d0a7d7-a979-4a52-9292-f65fdf61a5be" id="75d0a7d7-a979-4a52-9292-f65fdf61a5be-link">6</a></sup></p>



<p>In 2015 “The Verge” website posted an article titled “Google was a 1953 Raymond Chandler joke” by journalist Vlad Savov. The piece reprinted the passage and included this comment:<sup data-fn="dab43b5f-6a57-45ef-9d82-c7d8e2d5d507"><a href="#dab43b5f-6a57-45ef-9d82-c7d8e2d5d507" id="dab43b5f-6a57-45ef-9d82-c7d8e2d5d507-link">7</a></sup></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Chandler indulges in a brilliantly entertaining, paragraph-long parody of sci-fi writing, which hits every trope and cliché of the genre. Oh, and he namedrops Google some 45 years before Larry and Sergey registered the domain.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In conclusion, Raymond Chandler did use the term “Google” in a 1953 letter to a friend. It appeared within a comical science-fiction pastiche filled with jargon; however, the precise meaning of “Google” was unclear. “Google” was the source of information, and Chandler used the pronoun “he” when referring back to “Google”.</p>



<p>Acknowledgement: Great thanks to the anonymous person whose inquiry led QI to formulate this question and perform this exploration. Thanks to Rich Lowenthal who told QI about the use of the term google in cricket. Also, thanks to John Baker for his feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Use more accurate but slower matching by mime type</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">By default, rga will match files using file extensions. Some programs,
such as sqlite3, don't care about the file extension at all, so users
sometimes use any or no extension at all. With this flag, rga will try
to detect the mime type of input files using the magic bytes (similar
to the `file` utility), and use that to choose the adapter.
Detection is only done on the first 8KiB of the file, since we can't
always seek on the input (in archives).</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>--rga-no-cache</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Disable caching of results</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">By default, rga caches the extracted text, if it is small enough, to a
database in ${XDG_CACHE_DIR-~/.cache}/ripgrep-all on Linux,
<em>~/Library/Caches/ripgrep-all</em> on macOS, or
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\ripgrep-all on Windows. This way,
repeated searches on the same set of files will be much faster. If you
pass this flag, all caching will be disabled.</p>

<p>The idea of confronting one’s own stupidity and living with it productively – even joyfully! – feels even more central to me in mathematics than in science. The article touches on learning science, but it’s really about research. Stupidity is part of confronting the new, and being a capable science student means you might not have to face it that much when you’re merely absorbing the knowledge that previous scientists have already uncovered.</p>
<p>Math seems different to me. Everyone who learns math is familiar with the experience of being stuck on some new idea or problem, banging their head against it, and then, when they finally understand the answer (or having someone tell them), feeling stupid. There’s something fundamental in the nature of mathematics that makes it easy once you get it, and impossible before.</p>
<p>To wit: there’s an old joke where a professor is lecturing and remarks, “It’s obvious why this equation holds, of course.” A brave student raises her hand and says what everyone is thinking: “Could you please explain it? It doesn’t seem obvious.” The professor looks at the equation. “Isn’t it obvious?” He starts mumbling to himself. He starts to write on the white board, then stops. Finally he just stands there, looking at the board. Ten minutes pass. The students shift awkwardly and the seconds tick by. Suddenly the professor exclaims, “Aha! It <i>is</i> obvious!”</p>
<p>I’ve had numerous experiences in mathematics that left me feeling stupid. The one that made it clearest, I think, was taking real analysis in college. There’s a technical business with <i>epsilons</i> and <i>deltas</i>: one arbitrarily small value has to be smaller than another, thus proving that a function is continuous in a more rigorous way than high school calculus ever bothers to consider. It was arcane and baffling when I took the course. Six months later, it felt so simple that I couldn’t understand what my problem had been. Why had I been so stupid before, that this obvious mathematical idea had eluded me?</p>
<p>My personal theory about this (and this is untested, as far as I know) is that mathematics is somewhat unique in the way new learning develops in the mind. Piaget studied mathematical leaps in understanding in young children, and noticed that there are almost switches that flip at certain ages: before they’ve flipped, an idea is essentially impossible to understand; after, they’re obvious.</p>
<p>A classic example from Piaget is conservation of volume. (It’s worth checking out the video below if you’re not familiar with this one.) A child confirms two quantities of liquid are the same, sees one poured into a taller, thinner glass, and then says that the taller one has more water in it, <i>despite seeing it proved that the two have the same amount of liquid</i>.</p>
<p><iframe title="A typical child on Piaget's conservation tasks" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnArvcWaH6I?start=78&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Is the boy stupid? No. None of us were, and we all went through this phase. At some age, none of us could see that the amount of liquid stays constant. But once you see it, it’s impossible not to see it. And it’s almost impossible to imagine how it wouldn’t be obvious to anyone.</p>
<p>I suspect that mathematical understanding requires similar mental leaps, no matter how long you study it. It’s almost as if we construct new highways in our mind. As long as the construction goes on, no cars drive on it, and our mind hits the same confusion again and again. Then one day, the new road opens, and we “get it.” Once the cars can drive from one side of our mind to the other, the new idea feels obvious. And more, you are so changed by the new perspective that <i>you can’t even understand your own prior lack of understanding</i>. I don’t know any other field of study that so regularly gives you this experience. And if you track topics in mathematics, you can see this happening again and again: with base 10, fractions, algebra, calculus… it’s all hard, until it suddenly feels easy.</p>
<p>These jumps in comprehension can be thrilling, and they’re one reason math is so fun. But they do create a challenge for the student. The evidence that you learned something hard is that you feel like you’re stupid. That stupidity is essential to the process, not of pushing at the boundaries of what is known, but simply of getting your mind to take in tools and ideas more abstract than it was ever meant to learn. Students need to know that this feeling is the norm when it comes to learning math.</p>
<p>The centrality of stupidity can be especially challenging for the teacher. Being in the position of understanding means that we are distanced from someone who doesn’t understand. It takes an act of remembering that borders on wholesale invention to get a sense of how someone couldn’t see what seems so obvious once you see it. What’s happening in their mind? If you couldn’t understand your own inability from a few weeks ago, how do you understand theirs?</p>
<p>I’ve come to believe that one of the best ways to address the centrality of stupidity is to take on two opposing efforts at once: you need to assure students that they are <i>not</i> stupid, while at the same time communicating that feeling like they are stupid is totally natural. The message isn’t that they <i>shouldn’t</i> be feeling stupid – that denies their honest feeling to learning the subject. The message is that <i>of course</i> they’re feeling stupid… that’s how everyone <i>has</i> to feel in order to learn math!</p>
<p>It’s all just another reason math is deviously difficult, and spectacularly wonderful to learn. Is there any other study that changes you so deeply, and so often?</p>

            Engineers at NASA have successfully fired up a set of thrusters Voyager 1 hasn’t used in decades to solve an issue that could keep the 47-year-old spacecraft from communicating with Earth from billions of miles away.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000d356kk0lnlkhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            When Voyager 1 lifted off to space on September 5, 1977, no one expected that the probe would still be operating today.
    </p>

            As a result of its exceptionally long-lived mission, Voyager 1 experiences issues as its parts age in the frigid outer reaches beyond our solar system. When an issue crops up, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have to get creative while still being careful of how the spacecraft will react to any changes.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000f356k61svp3tj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth, Voyager 1 is about 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away. The probe operates beyond the heliosphere — the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond Pluto’s orbit — where its instruments directly sample interstellar space.
    </p>

            Earlier this year, engineers spotted an issue when the fuel tube inside one of Voyager’s thrusters became clogged. If the thrusters are clogged, they can’t generate as much force to keep the spacecraft steady. Voyager’s thrusters keep the spacecraft oriented in a way that it can communicate with Earth.
    </p>

            If Voyager 1 isn’t positioned in such a way so that its antenna is pointed at Earth, the spacecraft can’t “hear” commands from mission control or send back data, according to Calla Cofield, media relations specialist at JPL.

            “If the thrusters that keep the antenna pointed at Earth get clogged, that would be end of mission,” she said.</p><p>  The team realized it would have to send commands to the spacecraft to switch to another set of thrusters, but the fix wouldn’t be a simple one.

            It’s not the first time Voyager 1 has needed to switch over to another set of thrusters in recent decades. Fortunately, the spacecraft has three sets of thrusters: two sets of attitude propulsion thrusters and one set devoted to trajectory correction maneuvers.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000k356k2ihwj82m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Voyager 1 used the thrusters for a variety of purposes as it flew by planets such as Jupiter and Saturn in 1979 and 1980, respectively.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000l356kilhsekhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Now, the spacecraft is traveling on an unchanging path away from our solar system, so it just requires one set of thrusters to help keep its antenna pointed at Earth. To fuel the thrusters, liquid hydrazine is converted into gas and released in about 40 short puffs per day to keep Voyager 1 oriented correctly.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000m356kp8f1xm22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Over time, engineers discovered that a fuel tube inside the thrusters can become clogged with silicon dioxide, a byproduct of the fuel tank’s rubber diaphragm aging. As the thrusters become clogged, they generate less force.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000n356k826xmu5q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In 2002, the team commanded Voyager 1 to switch to its second set of attitude propulsion thrusters when the first set showed signs of clogging. Engineers switched again to the trajectory correction thruster set in 2018 when the second set also appeared clogged.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000o356koea4hpa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But when the team recently checked on the status of Voyager’s trajectory correction thrusters, they were even more clogged than the previous two sets of thrusters.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000p356k0jccl6ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            When the team initially switched Voyager over to the trajectory correction thrusters six years ago, the tube opening was 0.01 inches (0.25 millimeters) across. But now, clogging has reduced it to 0.0015 inches (0.035 millimeters) — half the width of a human hair, according to NASA.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000q356ks4r6q5j7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            It was time to rotate back to another set of attitude propulsion thrusters.
    </p>

            As Voyager 1 and its twin probe, Voyager 2, have aged, the mission team has slowly turned off nonessential systems on both spacecraft to conserve power, including heaters. As a result, components on Voyager 1 are colder now, and the team knew it couldn’t just send a command to Voyager 1 to switch immediately to one of the attitude propulsion thrusters without doing something to warm them up.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000s356kqzxsz9pb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But Voyager 1 doesn’t have enough power to switch any heaters back on without turning something else off, and its scientific instruments are too valuable to shut off in case they don’t come back on, the team said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000t356ka4b80mki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            After going back to the drawing board, the team realized it could shut off one of the spacecraft’s main heaters for about an hour, which would enable engineers to turn on the thruster heaters and safely make the switch.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000u356k0gxerimf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            This plan worked, and by August 27, Voyager 1 was back to relying on one of its original thruster sets to stay in touch with Earth.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000v356kf29yd0b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The team has taken steps to use the thrusters less, and it is expecting to get another two to three years out of the original set, said Todd Barber, Voyager propulsion engineer.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000w356ks4pq4lsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Once the spacecraft has exhausted this thruster set, Voyager 1’s remaining option is the other already clogged set of attitude propulsion thrusters.
    </p>

            “All the decisions we will have to make going forward are going to require a lot more analysis and caution than they once did,” said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager’s project manager, in a statement.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000y356k31p1ashf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Voyager 2 has also gone through thruster swaps in 1999 and 2019, and “the situation there is less dire,” Barber said. Voyager 2 has traveled more than 12 billion miles (20 billion kilometers) from Earth.
    </p>

            The information collected by these long-lived probes is helping scientists learn about the cometlike shape of the heliosphere and how it protects Earth from energized particles and radiation in interstellar space.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>This post has a little bit of everything. Hardware diagnostics, some suspiciously similar datasheets from two separate Taiwan chip manufacturers, and firmware reverse engineering. Read on if that sounds like fun!</p>



<p>Lately, I’ve been enjoying watching random electronics repair channels on YouTube. There’s something oddly satisfying about watching someone take a broken device from totally nonfunctional to perfectly working, all by replacing a $0.05 capacitor that has failed shorted or maybe a blown $0.75 IC. Two of my favorite channels about this topic are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BuyitFixit" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@BuyitFixit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy it Fix it</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StezStixFix" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@StezStixFix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StezStix Fix?</a>.</p>



<p>The videos inspired me. I thought, “I should totally try this!” So I went on eBay and looked for broken devices. I have a pretty decent understanding of how video encoders and decoders work, so I thought it would be a fun project to try to fix an HDMI capture card. I found a broken Elgato Game Capture HD60 S USB 3.0 device. The listing said that nothing happened when you plugged it in.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hd60s.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hd60s.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hd60s.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hd60s-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hd60s-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>When it arrived, I was able to verify exactly what the listing said. Nothing showed up on my computer when I plugged it in. I cracked it open and had a look at what was happening internally when it powered up. I started by poking around at voltages on the board with it plugged in, and it was pretty obvious that something was dragging the power rails down. Little did I know at that point what I was getting myself into.</p>



<p>Honestly I could tell what was getting hot just by feeling around with my finger, but this was a good excuse to use my thermal camera to take some fun pictures.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="240" height="320" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot1.jpg 240w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a></figure>



<p>In this one, the red cursor indicating the hottest point in the image is pointing to a small chip in the upper-left corner of the board marked “fiVJVE”.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="243" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-300x243.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-300x243.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-1024x830.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-768x623.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>This was pretty clearly some kind of a switching regulator, which I concluded due to its proximity to the “2R2” inductor (meaning 2.2 uH). Measuring the pins, I could see 5V going in, but obviously something was wrong because the voltage at the inductor (the output) was far too low.</p>



<p>There was also another fiVJVE chip on the board, with a pretty much identical circuit next to another 2.2 uH inductor. The circuit was missing a component, but I was pretty sure it was normal because the solder blobs looked like they came that way from the factory. It wasn’t getting hot, but it was also putting out a low voltage so I suspected something was wrong with it too:</p>

<p>In the heat image above you can see another area on the board (near the bottom) that was also getting hot. It turns out it was actually originating from the other side:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="320" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg 240w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a></figure>



<p>Yeah, that’s my finger in the picture. It helped adjust the levels in the image so the chip that’s getting hot is easier to pinpoint. This chip was labeled PFNI:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="216" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-300x216.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>OK, so what could I do with this information? I found two chips that were getting hot, and another chip that likely wasn’t putting out its correct voltage. I started out by trying to identify what they were. Small chips with markings like this can be quite difficult to figure out. Luckily, there are a few SMD marking code search engines out there. Searching <a href="https://smd.yooneed.one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smd.yooneed.one</a> for fiVJ didn’t result in any exact matches, but it did point out that the code “fi” went with the Fitipower FP6121-IS9P. This led me to <a href="https://www.fitipower.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitipower’s website</a>, where I saw they had a bunch of different chips. Using Google’s help I was eventually able to narrow it down to being the FP6373A.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="725" height="315" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png 725w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"></a></figure>



<p>The pinout made sense on the board, and the fiV marking also matched. Yay! Now I had an idea what I was looking for. The PFNI chip ended up being even easier to identify. Google led me straight to the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPS60403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TI TPS60403DBV voltage inverter</a>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="331" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 678w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px"></a></figure>



<p>One thing in common with all of these chips is they were all taking in 5V for their input and I was measuring that their outputs all had a pretty low resistance to ground. I started wondering if maybe someone fried this device by somehow putting more than 5V into it. How they did that, I have no idea.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure why the other FP6373A regulator wasn’t getting hot. It wasn’t putting out much voltage and nothing else was getting hot on the board, so I decided to try injecting voltage on its output power rail instead to see where the low resistance was coming from. I could deduce its correct output voltage because it was going to a Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ SPI flash chip rated for 2.7 to 3.6V. I was pretty sure it was on a 3.3V rail. I soldered wires to the regulator’s output and ground and used my bench power supply to inject 2.7V into the circuit with a small controlled current that I could slowly turn up. The idea was that I could find what was getting hot on the board and determine what to blame for this power rail being bad.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="549" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This process pretty quickly revealed the FP6373A itself as the root problem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="320" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg 240w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a></figure>



<p>I think maybe during normal operation when it was being supplied with 5V, it was putting itself into some kind of safety shutdown mode and killing its output power rail. The datasheet does mention overcurrent and overtemperature shutdown capability. When I injected voltage directly, the regulator couldn’t shut off the power rail so it had no choice but to get hot and announce “hey, I’m the problem!” through my thermal camera.</p>



<p>This was actually great. I wasn’t totally confident about whether the TI chip was to blame rather than something downstream of it, but since two other chips on the 5V rail were also fried, I thought a good first step would be to replace all three of them and see what would happen. Unfortunately the FP6373A isn’t available at the usual US distributors, but I was able to find it for sale on <a href="https://www.lcsc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LCSC</a> at $0.17 a pop, and the TI chip was conveniently also available there for $0.58. Would it really be this easy? Just replace three chips totaling less than a dollar in value, even in quantities of 1? The shipping and handling was orders of magnitude more expensive than just the parts themselves!</p>



<p>After the parts arrived from China, I was able to successfully replace them. I’m always paranoid about upsetting nearby resistors and capacitors when I’m using hot air, so I like to use Kapton tape to shield everything else.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="619" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-1024x619.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-768x465.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal.jpg 1339w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The process of soldering in the new chips was mostly easy, but the ground pins did soak up quite a bit of heat. I think this PCB design doesn’t have great thermal relief on the grounds. I did accidentally lift a pad for one of the regulators, but it wasn’t connected to anything (the “PG” signal) so there was no harm done. The fact that it wasn’t connected to anything was exactly why it was so easy to lift it. Also, the heat that the ground pin was eating up misled me into thinking I could use the same heat on the other pins.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>In addition to my lifted pad (middle pin on the right), you can see here how much trouble I had soldering the ground pin (middle pin on the left). It really didn’t want to heat up. I probably could have heated the whole board to help my soldering iron out, but hey, it’s connected.</p>



<p>Anyway, after replacing all three chips, it worked! None of the new chips were getting hot, the HD60 S showed up as a USB device when plugged in, and it worked perfectly for capturing and passing through an HDMI signal. I was pretty excited to successfully fix it, but there was still a problem: none of the indicator lights worked. There are seven white LEDs and seven red LEDs, and they are supposed to <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058716852-Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-S-Status-Lights-LEDs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do various things to tell you what’s going on</a>. The white lights are supposed to blink twice when you first plug it in, for example.</p>



<p>This was a little deflating. I had kind of fixed it, but not really. Now what?</p>



<p>Back to the drawing board. I looked closer at the PCB to understand how the LEDs work. The relevant chip is the IT1504, made by <a href="https://www.innochip.com.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Innochip</a>. Looking further at <a href="http://www.innochip.com.tw/datasheet/IT1504.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its datasheet</a>, it is a 16-channel LED driver chip. You talk to it with a serial data interface that appears to be very similar to SPI. It turns out a lot of LED driver chips from many manufacturers such as Toshiba and ST also use this same communication scheme. At first I though it was odd, but it seems pretty standard. It’s a variant of SPI where you send a particular number of clock pulses to choose which command you want to perform.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I monitored the relevant data input pins on the IT1504 using my oscilloscope, and I could definitely see some traffic being sent to it. By the way, I followed the traces and discovered that the IT1504 is being controlled by a Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-300x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>The presence of SPI traffic here proved it was at least trying to do <em>something</em>, so I assumed that the LED driver chip was probably fried. That presented a pretty big problem though: how could I find a replacement for the IT1504? It wasn’t stocked anywhere. LCSC didn’t have it, and of course none of the US distributors had it either. I couldn’t even find any sellers on AliExpress or utsource.</p>



<p>I reached out to Innotech, who surprisingly wrote back the next day and kindly offered to send me a few free samples for the price of shipping, but then realized they only have full reels in stock so they couldn’t send me any samples. That was nice of them to check, but I definitely wasn’t going to buy a full reel of IT1504 chips just to fix this one problem.</p>



<p>This pushed me toward a huge search all over the internet for LED drivers to try to find a suitable equivalent replacement. The IT1504 datasheet I had access to didn’t include the full command info, so I wasn’t sure exactly what I was looking for. There were several discontinued parts from other well-known manufacturers that looked similar, but I wasn’t finding any exact matches. That’s when I discovered something really strange.</p>



<p>I somehow stumbled upon <a href="https://www.mblock.com.tw/en" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.mblock.com.tw/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macroblock</a>‘s product offerings. Specifically, the MBI5040. The datasheet seemed to match up pretty well with the IT1504. In fact, a little too well. Here is an example of what I mean (click if you want it larger so you can read it):</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-1024x357.png 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-300x105.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-768x268.png 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Here are a few more side-by-side comparisons to really hit the point home:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="992" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-992x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-992x1024.png 992w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-291x300.png 291w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-768x793.png 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png 1302w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></figure>



<p>They’re almost exactly the same! Everything is laid out in precisely the same order. The current output specs differ slightly, but aside from that, they’re the exact same product, right down to having identical block diagrams. The wording has been tweaked here and there, but both of these datasheets are clearly from the same source. These companies are both based in Taiwan. Maybe one of them licensed the design from the other? Or perhaps there is some industrial espionage going on? There is definitely some funky stuff going on with the fonts on the Innochip datasheet’s general description page. It randomly switches around between serif and sans-serif. It’s the kind of thing you notice when you’re reading an email that somebody sent and you can tell they’ve obviously been copying and pasting while writing it. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but I thought it was weird.</p>



<p>Heck, even the part numbers are pretty much the same. If you pretend that the capital letter “I” in MBI5040 is really the number 1, you have MB<strong>1504</strong>0 and IT<strong>1504</strong>.</p>



<p>I have no idea which product is the original here, but either way, this was really good news for me. I had successfully discovered another chip that would likely be suitable as a replacement for my assumed-to-be-fried IT1504. Additionally, the MBI5040 datasheet actually had command info, so if it came down to it, I could dive deeper and really try to understand what the SPI traffic was doing. I was able to find the MBI5040GF available for purchase on both AliExpress and utsource, so I bought a few.</p>



<p>Replacing the LED driver chip was a pretty simple job. Once again I used Kapton tape to protect me from myself.</p>

<p>I was feeling pretty good about my situation at this point. I cleaned up all the flux residue and anxiously plugged in the HD60 S to my computer.</p>



<p>Video capture worked fine, so I didn’t make it any worse, but the lights were still not working! What in the world? Next I started wondering if perhaps the LEDs themselves were broken. I rigged up my bench power supply and a resistor so that I could pass current through them (without the whole device powered on, of course), and the LEDs all tested out fine physically. I was able to light each one up.</p>



<p>I was totally out of ideas at this point. A brand new chip didn’t fix it, and the LEDs were known good. That’s when I started searching on Google and found something shocking: apparently the LEDs going out on these Elgato HD60 S capture cards is a known problem that multiple people have experienced. In particular I found two different Reddit posts with four unique users complaining about running into this same problem:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elgato/comments/pcvtqj/why_doesnt_my_elgato_hd60s_light_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.reddit.com/r/elgato/comments/pcvtqj/why_doesnt_my_elgato_hd60s_light_up/</a></li>

</ul>



<p>Not only that, but sometime during this whole saga I also bought another “dead” HD60 S on eBay that turned out to work fine but had the exact same LED fault. It was starting to look like this indicator light failure was actually quite common!</p>



<p>So yeah. It’s very likely that the LEDs on this one weren’t working even before the voltage regulators originally got fried. This led me to a new bonus challenge: Could I figure out why the LEDs didn’t work and fix them? After all, I now had two different units both experiencing this failure and I knew of at least four other people with the same problem. If you go to the parent post at the second link above, there’s a video that shows how the white LEDs are expected to flash white twice when you first plug it in.</p>



<p>My first idea was to verify that the actual LED circuitry on the board was functional. To perform this test, I lifted the relevant SPI input pins on my replacement MBI5040 LED driver and soldered wires to them, as well as ground:</p>

<p>This allowed me to rig something up with a Raspberry Pi Pico to manually control the LEDs by sending the appropriate commands as documented in the MBI5040 datasheet. I’ll let this picture speak for itself:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="617" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg 617w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px"></a></figure>



<p>It was at this point that I became very confident there was nothing physically wrong with my repaired HD60 S at all. I could perfectly control the lights with my Pi Pico, so the circuit was fine. The Nuvoton Cortex-M0 microcontroller was simply never deciding to turn them on.</p>



<p>This whole MBI5040 replacement story was all for nothing! I was so proud of myself for finding a suitable substitute IC, but it was all mostly just a big waste of time. The original chip was probably fine all along. I decided to confirm that theory just to be sure. I put the original IT1504 chip back onto the board. In order to avoid having to bend pins, I covered the 3 pads that I wanted to avoid soldering to the chip with Kapton tape. This kept them insulated, and then I just soldered all of the other pins normally.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Then I resoldered the wires and repeated the experiment with the Pi Pico. No surprises here — the original chip was totally fine too. After I was done tinkering, I simply pulled the Kapton tape out and then was able to solder the remaining 3 pins normally. I thought this solution was pretty clever and saved me some time! Here’s a view after I pulled out the tape, but before I soldered them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="276" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2-768x207.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>And yes, I know pin 1 looks messy. Once again, it’s a ground pin and I guess they didn’t add thermals on the ground pins on this board. It was a pain to solder. I fixed it up afterward though.</p>



<p>So yeah. The original IT1504 chip worked fine. I was a little annoyed, but this side quest wasn’t entirely a waste of time. Getting ahold of the MBI5040 datasheet importantly gave me a perfect reference for how the LEDs are controlled by software. It was looking more and more like this was a software problem as opposed to a hardware problem. I was invested in this problem at this point. I couldn’t give up now!</p>



<p>I began the next phase of this project with a simple idea: ask Elgato if there is some kind of known issue with the status lights. Maybe there was a setting I was missing that allowed you to disable them. Essentially, they politely told me to take a hike:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="668" height="180" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png 668w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s okay. I felt like solving it on my own anyway. I decided to focus on understanding what was going on in the firmware running in the Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller. By a stroke of pure luck, I had <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2023/09/porting-my-mac-rom-simm-programmer-from-avr-to-arm/" data-type="post" data-id="3566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gained some experience last year with Nuvoton MCUs when working on my Mac ROM SIMM programmer</a>. I already had a <a href="https://www.nuvoton.com/tool-and-software/debugger-and-programmer/1-to-1-debugger-and-programmer/nu-link2-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nu-Link2-Me</a> that was bundled with the dev board I bought for that project. The next step was to figure out how to access the programming pins on the microcontroller. It turns out that there are a couple of small JST connectors on the board: a 4-pin one and a 6-pin one. Tracing out the pins one by one, it quickly became apparent that the 4-pin JST connector was for programming the MCU! I hooked it up using the only 4-pin JST cable I had on hand, which had grabbers on the other end.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I didn’t check, but I think it’s a pretty good educated guess that the 6-pin JST connector next to it is for programming the Altera MAX II CPLD that is also on this board. It just makes sense.</p>



<p>I didn’t care about the CPLD though. I tried to read the firmware out of the Nuvoton chip using NuMicro ICP Programming Tool, but of course Elgato protected the contents:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="304" height="180" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png 304w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"></a></figure>



<p>Never fear, though. It turns out that Elgato includes the latest firmware with their 4K Capture Utility:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="651" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png 878w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-300x222.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>Reading the included ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json file in the same folder also provided some insight. This firmware is specifically for the version of the device with USB product ID 118 (0x0076), which definitely matches mine. Elgato refers to this device as the “Game Capture HD60 S Rev.4”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="355" height="464" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png 355w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></a></figure>



<p>The firmware was already up to date when I checked in the 4K Capture Utility. You can also control-click the settings icon to enable an Update Firmware button, but it did nothing because the newest firmware was already installed on it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="530" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png 748w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></a></figure>



<p>This was great though! The FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin file looked very much like a normal Cortex-M0 firmware binary. You can tell by looking at the start of it in a hex editor. The very first 4-byte word should be the initial stack pointer, so something in RAM. Then following that is a bunch of interrupt vectors including the reset vector.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="622" height="262" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png 622w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></a></figure>



<p>This all checked out. 0x20000E70 looks like a valid stack pointer, and each 4-byte word following that looks like a valid flash address. It looks exactly like a Cortex-M0 vector table. I loaded it into <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghidra</a> and also used <a href="https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SVD-Loader</a> to try to map out some of the registers. I had to modify the SVD file (M031AE_v1.svd), which I got from the <a href="https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/numicro_dfp-nuvoton/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NuMicro_DFP pack on keil.arm.com</a>, to get it to load with the plugin. Apparently it doesn’t like if you have multiple addressBlocks per peripheral, so I modified the first one in each peripheral to contain the full range of addresses.</p>



<p>And thus began the humongous effort of trying to figure out what this little MCU was actually doing.</p>



<p>The SVD file helped me identify the various peripherals being used: mostly GPIO, a timer, and I<sup>2</sup>C. <a href="https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/M031BSP/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuvoton’s M031BSP project</a> was very valuable for identifying a ton of functions. I did it by hand, which was probably slightly insane, but I wasn’t sure what compiler had been used. Since I knew which pins were hooked up to the LED controller chip, I was fairly quickly able to identify functions that control the LEDs. It was hard to understand their purpose in the grand scheme of things though. Sometimes they were buried deep inside multiple layers of function calls.</p>



<p>Knowing that I<sup>2</sup>C was being used was very helpful, because I saw there were other chips onboard that would communicate through it: the ITE IT6802E and IT66121FN. The IT6802E is an HDMI receiver. I don’t have any detailed documentation for it, but I’m pretty sure it converts an incoming HDMI signal into a parallel data stream suitable for the capture portion of the device to read in. The IT66121FN is the opposite. It takes a parallel data stream and sends it out as HDMI. This would be necessary for the passthrough functionality, providing an HDMI output signal to go through to your TV or monitor.</p>



<p>Anyway, I found some ITE driver code in some random GitHub projects <a href="https://github.com/densengithub/DB_C10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as this one</a>, which quickly helped me identify a bunch of functions and variables as belonging to ITE’s drivers. This helped me gain a better understanding of what was happening in the firmware. I actually spent way too much time on this, but I think it was useful in the long run. Plus, it was good practice with Ghidra.</p>



<p>Once I had a good idea of the overall structure of the firmware, I decided to try figuring out how I could debug the code. The chip was protected, but I figured that I should be able to erase it and reflash the firmware. To be safe, I desoldered the original M031LD2AE chip and put a new empty one onto my board instead. They only cost $1.14 on Digi-Key in quantities of 1. Why not?</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>When I flashed FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin onto my brand-new blank chip, it definitely worked fine, but it re-protected itself so I couldn’t do any debugging! The offending code was pretty easy to find in Ghidra. There’s a function that is called to update the config registers with the proper locked state as well as the number of 512-byte data flash pages to reserve from the application ROM.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="669" height="835" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png 669w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"></a></figure>



<p>I simply had to hack this function to always leave the chip unlocked. Then I reflashed the chip and I was finally able to debug the code! I inserted some breakpoints and stepped through the initialization code with OpenOCD and GDB to figure out why the LEDs weren’t being controlled. I found some places in the code where LED control would happen, but they were being skipped. I decided to force the code to run by filling in register values and RAM in GDB, and sure enough, I was able to at least force the lights to turn on. So clearly the code was there to control the lights, but it wasn’t running for whatever reason.</p>



<p>This chip unlocking mess led me down another rabbit hole. I assumed that the original Nuvoton MCU I removed had some other protected contents like a bootloader, so I decided to see if I could extract it by installing my new unlocked firmware file as an update through Elgato’s software. The idea was that after my new unlocked firmware was installed, the protection would be disabled and then I could read out the entire contents with my Nu-Link2-Me. Why would I want to do this? Well, it would just be nice to have as a backup in case I screwed up one of the chips, plus the bootloader might contain other clues.</p>



<p>I tried it out on my <em>other</em> HD60 S with broken LEDs which still had its stock Nuvoton MCU fitted. This required modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to point to my unlocked firmware. I also had to change the version listed in this same file so that it would think it was out of date. After making these changes, the 4K Capture Utility allowed to install my new firmware through the normal firmware update mechanism. The utility did tell me the firmware update failed after it finished (more on that later).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="552" height="190" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png 552w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3-300x103.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px"></a></figure>



<p>This totally freaked me out because it appeared to brick the device. It didn’t work as a capture card anymore. But luckily, but I was left with an unlocked chip, just as I had hoped! This allowed me to read out the rest of the content of the flash that had previously been protected, including the LDROM (containing Elgato’s first-stage bootloader), data flash contents, and the correct original config register contents. This was <strong>really</strong> exciting because it meant I now had everything I would need in order to completely program a brand new Nuvoton MCU to contain Elgato’s stock firmware, including their bootloader. I rewrote the original Elgato firmware back to this second HD60 S’s APROM (application ROM) using Nuvoton’s tools, and re-locked the chip. Thankfully, this fully restored it to working order — except for the LEDs of course.</p>



<p>I also disassembled their small LDROM bootloader that I was able to read out of the chip, but it wasn’t really anything exciting. It receives commands and data over I<sup>2</sup>C and is capable of reflashing the APROM. Interestingly I discovered that if the chip is set for unprotected mode, the bootloader actually waits around for update commands instead of booting the application firmware. So Elgato is using the locked/unlocked bit as a way of signifying whether it should stay in the bootloader or not, which I find to be a little bit weird. That completely explained why my second HD60 S stopped working after I installed my unlocked firmware — it was stuck in the bootloader waiting forever because the chip was unprotected.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’ve really started to ramble on about things unrelated to the LED problem. Let’s get back on track. The point I’m trying to make here is that I was able to read out all of the stock microcontroller contents, which gave me the confidence I desperately needed in order to start tinkering even further to figure out the LED problem. I was kind of stuck at this point though. Why was the Nuvoton chip not controlling the LEDs? Some of the LED control happened over I<sup>2</sup>C from something else, so I was beginning to worry that the actual problem was once again at a different level.</p>



<p>Fortunately though, I was gaining a better understanding of the architecture of the entire product at this point. Here’s a broad overview of how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li>The main Cypress/Infineon CYUSB3014 USB 3.0 peripheral chip, which I haven’t mentioned until now, is an ARM926EJ-S. It sends commands to the Nuvoton MCU over I<sup>2</sup>C. This is the chip that actually communicates with the host PC through the USB 3.0 port.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller sets up and monitors the ITE video receiver and transmitter chips through a separate I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton MCU also controls the LEDs.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton MCU communicates status information back to the CYUSB3014 through I<sup>2</sup>C.</li>



<li>The CYUSB3014 receives the video data stream from the IT6802E (likely through the MAX II CPLD, putting it in a format suitable for the CYUSB3014 to grab) and sends it to the computer over USB.</li>
</ul>



<p>I thought I would take a break from the Nuvoton chip for a while and start trying to understand the main Cypress processor instead. Yes, as I just mentioned above, there are two different ARM processors working together to implement the video capture functionality. Fortunately, Cypress/Infineon also provides a free SDK for these USB chips. The firmware is stored unprotected in the Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ flash chip that I talked about very early on when I thought this was purely going to be a hardware repair project.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spiflash.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spiflash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spiflash.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spiflash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spiflash-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I desoldered the SPI flash chip and read it back using a programmer. It’s a 4 MB (32-megabit) chip. I also tried to do it in-circuit without removing the chip first, but I didn’t have any luck. I even accidentally knocked a small 0402 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor (seen above on the right) off the PCB while I was trying to clip onto it. Luckily the capacitor wasn’t damaged and I was able to put it right back on.</p>



<p>After dumping the chip contents, I used it to start trying to work my way through understanding what the CYUSB3014 was doing. I was able to use Cypress’s existing SDK binaries to help identify a lot of the functions in the dump. It turns out that the Cypress SDK uses the ThreadX RTOS under the hood.</p>



<p>I really didn’t want to dive deep into this firmware to the same level that I did for the Nuvoton chip though. I was already worn out from that disassembly. At the very least, I was able to see that the Cypress chip sends commands over I<sup>2</sup>C to the Nuvoton chip.</p>



<p>Looking through the rest of the SPI flash dump, I could see that starting at offset 0x300000, there were a bunch of small data chunks that looked like little pictures. Here’s an example:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="478" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png 620w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></a></figure>



<p>I couldn’t figure out why there would be little pictures in the flash chip here. What would the purpose be? It made me wonder if maybe it was some kind of small icon, since I’ve seen similar data for icons while analyzing old Mac ROM dumps. Given the context of this blog post, you might be screaming at me right now telling me what this data obviously is, but at the time I was totally oblivious.</p>



<p>I ended up solving this mystery as soon as I started looking into what was going on with five unknown GPIO pins in the firmware on the Nuvoton chip. There were a bunch of functions that controlled these pins, but I wasn’t sure what they did. I traced them out on the PCB and discovered they were going to a <a href="https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/PI5C3257.pdf">Diodes Incorporated PI5C3257 quad 2:1 mux/demux bus switch</a>.</p>



<p>This was the magic discovery that finally unblocked me. This bus switch is being used to decide whether the CYUSB3014 chip or the Nuvoton microcontroller should be wired up to the SPI flash chip. Prior to this moment, I thought that the SPI flash was entirely dedicated to the CYUSB3014. In reality, the Nuvoton microcontroller takes over control of the SPI flash after the CYUSB3014 has finished booting. This enabled me to disassemble a bunch of new functions which were all related to bit-banging SPI transactions, as well as higher-level functions for SPI flash chip erasing/reading/writing.</p>



<p>A light bulb went off in my head. Yes, these chunks of data in the flash chip <strong>were</strong> pictures! But not in the conventional sense. They were describing the various LED animations. Each set of 16 bytes is an animation frame written to the 14 LEDs. In the example above, a single red LED turns on and six of the seven white LEDs do stuff. The last two bytes in each row are a delay time before moving onto the next frame. The first 16 bytes looked kind of weird though. They looked like they possibly contained some header data for the animation or something.</p>



<p>I also found some code that was reading data from the start of the 0x300000 section, but in my SPI flash dump that section was pretty much completely empty:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="622" height="285" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png 622w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></a></figure>



<p>Everything was starting to make sense. There was a check in the Nuvoton MCU firmware to see if the first two bytes contained the 16-bit word value 0xAA55:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="636" height="287" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png 636w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px"></a></figure>



<p>In my dumps of the SPI flash chip contents from my units with nonfunctional LEDs, that section of the chip was empty. It was programmed as all 0x00. The firmware was bypassing all of the LED control code because expected data wasn’t stored starting at 0x300000 in the flash chip! I confirmed this data was missing on both of the HD60 S devices I was testing with.</p>



<p>Unless I wanted to go overboard trying to figure out how to artificially populate all this data from scratch, I had no choice but to buy a third HD60 S that was confirmed to be fully functional. That’s what I ended up doing. Unfortunately it was an older revision and had a completely different PCB, but it was still based on the CYUSB3014. It also used a Nuvoton microcontroller, but it was a different model. It still had an IT1504 for LED control though, as well as a Winbond SPI flash chip, so that was promising.</p>



<p>I confirmed that its LEDs worked fine, and then I dumped the SPI flash. By this point, I had figured out how to dump the flash contents without any soldering by forcing the CYUSB3014 to boot over USB (removing a jumper on the board) and then uploading a Cypress-provided RAM bootloader capable of dumping the SPI flash (cyfxflashprog.img), but I don’t want to stray too far from the LED issue at this point. Here’s the start of the good data at 0x300000:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="621" height="463" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png 621w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, that data makes way more sense. The first 16-bit word (little-endian) is 0xAA55 just like the firmware was looking for. It also has a bunch of other header data, indicating there are 26 different LED animations, and including info about whether they are even animations at all. To be honest, I haven’t figured out what every piece of this data actually means, but each animation has a 16-byte summary. They start at 0x300008. I think the last 4 bytes for each animation are probably a CRC-32 of something.</p>



<p>Also, if you noticed in the original chip dump, there was a section starting at 0x3000B8 with a bunch of 0xE5 bytes. This is the dot correction data that gets loaded into the IT1504. Based on the decompilation above, it’s actually supposed to be at 0x3007F8, which is exactly where it is in the good dump:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="624" height="62" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png 624w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14-300x30.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></a></figure>



<p>The 0x521114A7 that follows is a CRC-32 of the preceding 16 bytes of data.</p>



<p>Further inspection revealed that the data in the SPI flash of the broken devices differed quite a bit. In fact, they were different from each other as well. This led me to believe that the animation data was probably corrupted in them. For example, here’s what the animation at 0x31E000 looks like in the good HD60 S’s dump:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="621" height="541" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png 621w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></a></figure>



<p>Notice how there is no weird header at the top like the original “picture” I was inspecting from one of the other dumps? It just immediately starts with animation data that is consistent with the rest of the nearby data. It’s also longer. This data makes a lot more sense. On the other hand, it was corrupted in two completely different ways in my two HD60 S devices with nonfunctional LEDs.</p>



<p>Several (but not all) of the animations in my nonworking devices started with a weird “AB 03 12 39” header. I don’t think the header is supposed to be there. Maybe there was a bug in an update procedure or something? The Nuvoton firmware indeed has functions capable of erasing and rewriting data to the SPI flash chip. I’m wondering if that code ended up running and somehow destroying the original contents.</p>



<p>You may be able to guess what I did with this new knowledge. I took the original SPI flash contents from the two devices with nonfunctional status lights, and simply replaced all the LED data starting at 0x300000 with the data from the working one. Then I flashed this new “hybrid” image to the non-working devices. Oh, I should point out that each device has its own unique flash dump. The USB serial number is embedded in there somewhere. So I preferred to preserve the data from 0 to 0x2FFFFF for each individual device.</p>



<p>I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect by trying this. The good SPI flash data came from an older revision of the product with a different Nuvoton microcontroller, but it sure looked like it matched what the newer firmware was looking for.</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of what I saw as soon as I powered one of the problematic devices after I reflashed its SPI flash chip:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It freaking worked. The white lights flashed twice, and then the red lights briefly flashed once.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I think the red flash just means the signal was lost, because it also does it every single time I unplug an HDMI source from it. The older model doesn’t do this red flash on every powerup, but maybe it’s just a firmware difference about whether it should say “signal lost” immediately at startup with nothing plugged in. I’ve seen some mention online of red lights meaning that the signal is HDCP-protected, but I think that’s a different longer red blink which I’ve also seen when I first plug in my iPhone as an HDMI source.</p>



<p>I’ve also noticed that some of the animations that Elgato says it should do, like when I start or stop recording, don’t play on this newer model, even though they work fine with the older model. I haven’t been able to figure out if this is just a known difference with how the newer model works. I may try to get a good SPI flash dump of the correct LED animations from a newer matching model to confirm it for sure, but I have a feeling the animation data will be identical.</p>



<p>I also recently realized that the raw data for each animation is sitting around in C:\Program Files\Elgato\GameCapture\Animations if you have the older Game Capture utility installed, or /Applications/Game Capture HD.app/Contents/Resources/Animations on Mac.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="655" height="786" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png 655w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16-250x300.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></a></figure>



<p>Looking through each file (01.ani, 02.ani, etc.), it looks like the animation data perfectly matches my dump of the older working device. The bytes for each LED are out of order, but if I reorder them correctly, I can create an identical copy of all of the animation data that I extracted from the good flash chip.</p>



<p>Since those animations live inside the Game Capture app (or next to it), it seems as though the software has the capability to load them into the flash chip. I wonder if that explains how the stored animation data ended up corrupted in the first place. A botched update perhaps? That would make sense to me. Maybe they disabled the ability for their software to upload them after they discovered it was screwing up people’s devices? It might be interesting to disassemble the Windows and/or Mac software and try to figure out how to convince it to directly upload the animations, but I’m honestly out of motivation to do that at this point. It looks like LedCtrlDll.dll might be an interesting file to look at if anyone else is hooked enough to continue diving deeper. It contains classes with interesting names like Ub530LedSpiRom and I2cIO_Ub530. Some quick disassembly in Ghidra indeed shows it creating a 0x80C-byte array for the header data that would go into the flash chip at 0x300000, and populating the contents with the dot correction data.</p>



<p>One last thing I noticed is if I do a firmware update of the HD60 S inside of Elgato’s 4K Capture Utility in Windows, it doesn’t wait long enough. It seems to work fine on Mac, but Windows has some issues. The firmware update is still in progress when it tells me that it failed. If I sit there and wait, eventually the lights flash on the unit and it successfully reboots into the new firmware. If instead I unplug it quickly after Elgato’s software tells me the update failed, I end up with an incomplete flash. I wonder if this has fooled people into bricking their devices? Especially if the status LEDs don’t work at all. I was able to successfully fix this problem by increasing the updateDurationSec in ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json from 40 to 80. I get the feeling Elgato’s firmware update functionality is a little flaky, at least on Windows. In Elgato’s defense, <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027955132-Firmware-updates-and-Elgato-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they specifically recommend <em>not</em> to update firmware on the HD60 S unless their tech support tells you to</a>. And they hide the functionality behind a special key combination when entering the settings screen.</p>



<p>I would like to figure out a way to share how to easily fix the LEDs for anyone else who runs into this problem, but the process is admittedly quite convoluted. It requires you to begin a firmware update (modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to even allow you to install an update in the first place) and immediately unplug the device — otherwise the Nuvoton MCU takes control of the SPI flash, and you really need the Cypress chip to be in control in order to reflash its contents. Then, you remove the jumper on the PCB (instructing the Cypress chip to boot from USB), upload cyfxflashprog.img to RAM using download_fx3, and use a modified version of fx3_spitest to download the entire SPI flash contents and replace it with your patched LED section. Those are tools from the CYUSB3014 SDK. Finally, you unplug it, put the jumper back in, plug it back in, and perform a normal firmware update in 4K Capture Utility to restore the firmware back to the Nuvoton chip. You ignore the update failure message and wait another minute or so, and eventually it boots back up with working LEDs. If there ends up being enough interest in recovering these things, it might be possible for me to throw something together to automate the process, or at least provide binaries for everything. It would also be nice to figure out how to use Elgato’s software to directly reprogram the LED animations. For now though, I’m just going to sit back, relax, and celebrate my victory on this!</p>



<p>So in conclusion, yes, it really was that simple. All I needed to do was replace three chips for a total of less than $1 to bring this thing back to life. Every bit of extra time and money I spent on this project after that was all about figuring out a well-known indicator LED problem that really had nothing to do with my actual repair. I put way more effort into this than I should have, and yes I am probably a tiny bit crazy for actually doing this, but at least I now have an answer and fix for why the LEDs don’t work on some of these capture cards. It’s some sort of software/programming/update bug. I’m not sure which. Way to go Elgato!</p>

<article id="post-229078">
	<div>

		
		<p><em>Raleigh McCool | Longreads | September 5, 2024 | 3,082 words (11 minutes)</em></p><p>It’s my first day of spin class, and I am in the darkest corner of the room. My feet are crammed into shoes I rent from the front desk—little black Velcro things with cleats on the bottoms. The feet of other riders are strapped into sleek Nikes splashed in bright reds and volt blues and glow-in-the-dark neons. Dangling from my perch upon the bike’s seat, my feet strain at the pedals as I attempt to jam the cleats until they fit. I flail around for a second, until finally, a satisfying snap. I’m connected.</p><p>To the bike, I mean. Outside of class, I’m terribly lonely. That’s how I’ve ended up here.</p><p>There’s a tweet I wish I’d written about how the real miracle was Jesus having a dozen friends in his 30s, and as someone who has now outlived Jesus, I can testify to the divine work it takes to have friends. With few exceptions, all my friends are married, having kids, and buying houses in the ’burbs. Achieving domestic bliss has really started to cut into my friends’ hangout time.</p><p>In the bike room my feet are tethered to the pedals and I begin to spin my legs around in warm-up. I stand, pedal like I’m riding down Ridgewood Road to my friend Ross’s house—he lived down the street, and in the summer I’d bike over and we’d hole up in his attic, playing video games and the dice baseball game we invented. Riding my bike as a kid, my bowl cut whooshed in the hot Tennessee air. Here it’s pulled back with a headband, and the room is dark and cool, and the instructor announces we’ll start in a couple minutes. She comes up to me, introduces herself, thanks me for being there. Her name’s Karson. She makes sure my cleats are clipped in and that I have water, tugging on the handlebars to ensure everything is in place.</p><p>When class starts, the lights go out. “We ride to the beat of the music,” Karson says. The music is a pop remix I don’t recognize, and it’s playing at a volume that could raise the dead. She helps us find the cadence, “Right, left, right; right, left, right.” Karson announces that when the beat drops, we’ll rise up out of our seats, and we’ll ride, and we’ll, like, drop our elbows, or . . . something? And then, it happens. The music wobble-wobbles, and the lights flash on. Every last one of the 40 or so bikers is on their feet and bouncing up and down, their hands clutching the handlebars as they perform synchronized push-ups, even as their feet maintain the pulsing beat. I do my best to match, but I’m off, my legs too fast and my body too slow. Or maybe it’s the other way around. All around the room, everyone has <em>got it</em>, and it’s not just that their legs are pumping synchronously or that their push-ups are perfectly timed—it’s some ineffable flair, an extra zhuzh of swag that my bike neighbors are adding. I sort of want to pause and be like, “Well look at you <em>go</em>!” but the lights go dim again, and I am positively <em>gasping</em>. I use the dark to snatch at my towel, slug my water, and sit.</p><p>We are halfway through the first song.</p><hr><p>In a last-ditch effort to make friends at my gym, I recently plucked out my headphones and stepped up to the squat rack in silence. The only sounds were the clang of weights, the hum of the AC, and my grunty breaths. The idea was to signal to the people around me that I was open for connection, conversation, or a spot. I’d been going to that gym for the past year, and I’d never talked to a soul—each of us with our headphones on, in our own little worlds of isolation.</p><p>The no-headphones thing didn’t really work. A couple guys asked for a bench press spot, but providing a spot for these men strangely did not lead to close personal friendship, which put it in good company alongside organizing a wiffle ball game, throwing a birthday party, working at a restaurant, drinking alone at bars, and scrolling mindlessly on my phone, none of which had led to friendships either.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There’s a tweet I wish I’d written about how the real miracle was Jesus having a dozen friends in his 30s, and as someone who has now outlived Jesus, I can testify to the divine work it takes to have friends.</p></blockquote></figure><p>My 30s have been weird: isolating and demoralizing, a depressing gnarl in my stomach. A bone-deep, soul-swamped loneliness I can’t seem to text or swipe my way out of. Days alone in a crowded gym, nights alone on my couch, scrolling and hoping for connection and washing down hope with a handful of IPAs instead. I’m ashamed to be lonely, ashamed to ask for friends in the first place. Needing someone? How <em>embarrassing</em>.</p><p>I’ve read and listened to all the articles and podcasts: the friendship recession is upon us. I’m not alone in being alone, which knowledge does not help. I follow the results of my Google search on “how to make friends” to a T: I cohost a bowling night, join a flag football team. The bowling turnout is abysmal, and our flag football team is so bad we’ve all turned against each other. One day I search for group fitness classes near me, and a spin studio pops up: Full Ride Cycling is just down the street.</p><hr><p>The next time the beat drops, Karson adds another move to the dance, a little twist, and then a lean, and there’s a moment when she instructs us to “tap (y)our ass back” while riding, which seems simple enough when she does it and yet, my attempts to pump my legs and tighten my core and hurl my ass backward to the beat prove too much for my body altogether. I sit my ass down, and it stays there for the rest of class.</p><p>Somewhere in the latter half of my first spin class, I burst into tears. The room has gone completely dark. “This bike room is not about competition,” Karson says. “It’s not about getting it right, or how it looks.” There are two candles lit, the light fluttering up like she’s telling a ghost story; Karson blows them out. “It’s about showing up,” she says. “It’s about trying.” There’s no choreography or beat to keep, and in the utter darkness I slump my shoulders, looking up at the ceiling I can’t see. “You belong here,” she says, somewhere out there in the dark. “Every one of you. You are welcome.” The song’s too loud to hear my sniffles. I sit and slowly pedal.</p><hr><p>When I was little, we passed communion around on little trays—matzos wafers to crack apart, tiny plastic shot glasses of grape juice jiggling on a saucer. I loved church. All the people, our voices harmonizing together, the buzzy electrical currents of love, the huge beautiful mystery of God.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a good kid. I obeyed God, followed all the rules—I memorized the verses and respected my elders, didn’t lust or use the Lord’s name in vain. No one yelled it or painted it blood-red on a sign, but they told us: to disobey was sin. And sinners went to hell.</p><p>It didn’t hit me until decades later, how afraid I’d been. Fire. Eternal separation. How the flames singed the corners of everything, a childhood charred by fear. The story of Jesus still yanks at me—God on earth, grabbing hold of the lost, insisting they belong—but I don’t really go to church anymore. The fear is still near, hot to the touch.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, though, I miss it. The harmonies, the kind smiles, the whole messy lot of us together. When I miss it enough, I rise early and go to an Episcopal church down the street. When it’s time for communion, I file in line with strangers, and at the altar, the reverend hands me a hunk of torn-off bread and a goblet of wine. “This is the body of Christ broken for you,” she says, looking deeply into my eyes. “This is the blood of Christ shed for you,” she says, handing me the cup. When she finally unlocks her gaze, I close my eyes, let the bread and wine melt on my tongue.</p><hr><p>I go back to spin the week after, and the week after that. After a few classes, I feel like I’m becoming an expert at some of the moves, such as clipping into the pedals, adjusting the seat height, and unclipping from the pedals.</p><p>Beyond a few warm smiles and hellos, I don’t say much for the first few weeks. Sure, I’m lonely, but I don’t mind flying under the radar in spin class. I’m hopelessly novice, awkward and sweaty and limbs all a-floppy—I am thankful for the room’s dark. Also, as it turns out, there are a lot of women in spin class. Throngs of women in monochrome Lululemon astride the bikes. It feels like the inverse of the weight room, where meaty men roam the floor. In here, I’m the meaty man. I’m conscious of my place and try to keep a low profile. The femininity of the space feels almost sacred—huge smiles leap from women’s faces, encouraging claps spring from their hands. Their between-song <em>Woo!</em>s are like my church deacon father booming <em>Amen!</em> from the pews. I think that to speak up, I might puncture all that womanly holiness with my big boorish manness. Instead I sit back in my seat, try to breathe, one little boat lifted by the rising tide of female togetherness all around me.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I’d been going to that gym for the past year, and I’d never talked to a soul—each of us with our headphones on, in our own little worlds of isolation.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The instructor today is Meg, and I can tell right away she doesn’t play. Something about the way her ponytail is pulled tight behind her head, the way it bobs, itself keeping the frantic beat. Meg bounds around the room, ponytail a whip, praising all the better riders. <em>I see you, Jess!</em> She claps and shouts. <em>Keep those hips back, Lane!</em> I plod along in the back corner, safe in being unknown, unseen. Then, from across the room: <em>Go, Raleigh, go!</em> My heart catches as my body roils: I didn’t know she—or anyone—knew my name. Briefly, I beam in the pulsing dark. The bright sensation in my heart is replaced soon after with a burning in my chest, however, as Meg exhorts us to pedal at cartoonish Roadrunner speeds, pleading for us to tap our asses back like a demanding director on the set of an early-2000s rap music video.&nbsp;</p><p>During the break, I bring the towel to my face like a man who’s never eaten before, or a desperate sinner prostrate before God. All around me women clap, <em>Woo!</em>s raining in chorus, and when hands reach out in the dark to touch my handlebars, they seem to say <em>Hi</em>, and <em>Good job</em>, and <em>You’re welcome here</em>. I extend an offering in return, my voice barely audible over the music. “Way to go,” I say, but what I mean is, <em>And also with you</em>.</p><hr><p>Outside the bike room, life’s terrain is wildly shifting: I struggle up lonely haggard hills and coast down, face whipped by the wind, on the other side. I quit my job, get a new place, stop drinking. There are bright spots—a game night here, a storytelling night there, a dinner party on my birthday—but making friendships remains impossibly hard.</p><p>I keep showing up to class. My growth curve is steep, but I gain elevation quick—soon I find that I can crush the handlebar push-ups, and I begin to find the beat, to match the pace, if only for a moment. I spend great chunks of Meg’s classes trying not to die, at which I keep barely succeeding. One day after class, maybe my tenth or so, she tells me it usually takes people 40 or 50 classes to really start to get it. It’s a daunting yet somehow hopeful number. I think of friendship, the loving daily trudge of showing up, all the coffees and walks and lingering conversations by our cars that build over time into closeness, connection. I think of how I’m just getting started at that, too.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think that to speak up, I might puncture all that womanly holiness with my big boorish manness. Instead I sit back in my seat, try to breathe, one little boat lifted by the rising tide of female togetherness all around me.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Kenzie introduces herself before class. Shawna remembers my name from last week. Ely gives me a full-on sweaty high five. The distinct femininity of the place is changing me: it carves out huge swaths of real estate inside me—vast, arid, and untilled soil in my heart, places where love and even the great rainfalls of sweat have not yet reached. The eager welcome, the taps of encouragement, the group claps.</p><p>In my experience, men don’t do group claps. We tend to shy away from on-tempo towel twirls. The weight room doesn’t break out in <em>Woo!</em>s when one of the fellas tries his best on the bench press. We march through the gym alone, AirPods blasting, not because the Knocked Loose song makes us stronger, but because we think our independence does. Raised in the oppressive swirl of the patriarchy, we’ve learned to disconnect, to close off, to ride alone.</p><p>For men like me, spin is hard. Not just the workout, but the vulnerability: letting go of competition and leaning into the group, a dying of self so the room can revive. It requires a purging of entire realms of my shitty male points of view, from shaming self-talk to the latent homophobia I encounter within myself when the instructor tells us to dance, to “make it cute.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>One day after class, maybe my tenth or so, she tells me it usually takes people 40 or 50 classes to really start to get it.

My high-school basketball coach screaming at me for missing shots. Pastors barking about hell and all the ways you might get there—cussing, drinking, being a sissy. <em>No pain, no gain. Man up.</em> <em>Real men don’t cry</em>. All sorts of ways shame has molded me like clay. When the looming drill sergeants of my life enforced compliance, dishing out love or what passed for it only if you earned it, I got good at earning it.</p><p>In spin, I let go. There’s no earning it—because it’s already here. From the very first class, Karson and Meg and others snuck me in through a side door of vulnerability, built a safe little nook in which to practice being loved. <em>You are welcome here</em> and <em>You belong</em>. Belonging, whether your Apple Watch says you burned 600 calories or if you sat there and slowly pedaled in the dark. I’m a man who’s only ever earned. It’s how I learned to make people, parents, girlfriends, and God love me. To move in spin class only for the sake of moving, of the joyful challenge itself, of sweating and pushing and dancing, is cool water in my throat. To be loved, simply for showing up, is pure golden sun in my chest.</p><hr><p>In January, the studio offers a deal on their unlimited membership for a fraction of the price. I use it to slingshot into the bike’s seat four times a week. In February, I sail past 25 rides. The studio writes a little note and sticks it on my bike: “Thanks for jumping into this community. We’re going to keep cheering you on!” To commemorate, I buy my own bright red Nike cleats with a glow-in-the-dark neon swoosh, and allow my membership to roll over at the full price. March brings 50, which I celebrate by letting Meg careen my body past its physical limits, legs whooshing around like the blades of giant windmills. After, Meg takes my photo in front of the punctuation-less sign the girls at the front desk have splayed on the wall: <span>RALEIGHS 50TH CLASS</span>. In the photo, my smile provides the punctuation: I beam like I’m accepting the award for Greatest and Most Beloved Cycler and Friend Who We All Love Very Much Even if He Sweats A Lot. For my birthday in April, they drape a sparkly blue sash across my bike. With the sash cloaked across my sweaty shoulders like Britney Spears’s snake, I walk out the front door after class, an extra glitter in my 37-year-old step. “Hey,” Meg stops me at the door. “Happy birthday! I . . . think we need that back.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>In spin, I let go. There’s no earning it—because it’s already here.

The women at the front desk know my name. I’ve struck up a warm kinship with some folks in the afternoon classes—Lisa and Emmie, Jimmy and Mary. There’s always a couple minutes before class when we’re sort of twirling around on our bikes, the music not yet at skull-hammering volume. We’re talking very basic pleasantries. <em>Big weekend plans?</em> and <em>What brought you to Nashville? </em>and <em>Oh I have family in the Lansing area!</em> I’m not sure I’m in the running to be an honorary bridesmaid at Mary’s wedding or anything. But we talk—the talk of people about to share something together. You might just call it friendship.</p><hr><p>Life changes like clicks of a gear—it’s quick and marked, distinct. I get better. Not drinking helps. What were late nights and mornings with a fidget-spinner of anxiety lodged inside me are now clear-eyed and alive with purpose, a beat to catch in class. My challenges—yearning for more and closer friends, longing for a group, dreams of parties and game nights and road trips—still simmer. I just feel more hope that these things are coming, because 25 rides leads to 50, 50 leads to 100, and who knows who might be riding alongside me in the golden-hour road-trip glow by then.</p><p>On the way out of class the other day, I stop and hover on the outskirts of a conversation. <em>Great playlist! </em>and <em>That sure was a sweaty one, huh?</em> Somebody mentions heading to a taco spot. I’m orbiting on the fringes of the group, neither invited nor not invited. I know these people, kind of—Karson and Rileigh and Steven and Kaitlyn. We chat until the group dissolves, and I say my farewells. Halfway home, the clarity pierces me: <em>Invite yourself. Go.</em> I want to say I don’t know what got into me, but I do know: I want friends. Walking into the restaurant, I feel like a kid again, approaching the cool table at lunch. I’m nervous, but tenuously confident—it’s almost as if showing up and flinging my body and practicing the act of being welcomed in spin class has prepared me for this.&nbsp;</p><p>From across the dining room I can see them, laughing, hands reaching for chips like communion. When I walk up, there’s an empty seat. They saved it for me.

        <p>A discussion of why I don’t intend to turn Gwern.net into a book, and how trying to write a book can harm writers.</p>
        
      </div><div id="markdownBody">
        
        <p>Along with asking about doing podcasts, people sometimes ask me whether I am going to write a book or turn Gwern.net into a book. To their surprise, I have no such intention. Writing a book can be harmful; for many writers, writing a book is about the last thing they should do (unless they feel a book bursting out of them, much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger#bodyContent" title="Facehugger">facehugger</a>).</p>
        <p>But how can I not want to write a <em>book</em>? And I get it: writing a book is the ultimate achievement for Western intellectuals—better than being arrested in a protest (because you don’t have to get sweaty), better than a PhD (because not so devalued), and better even than going to Harvard (because that mostly means you got lucky in admissions). It’s something I’ve definitely aspired to since I became a bookworm, to join the pantheon of authors shelved in my local library, to be able to hold <em>my</em> book in my hands, and carp about how ‘the publisher chose the cover’.</p>

          <p>Yet, that’s the problem: I am in love with the idea of <em>having published</em> a book, but not with publishing <em>a specific book</em>. I want to have published a book and have the identity of ‘author’<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in the same way one might want to have ‘learned to read Mandarin’ or ‘become a bodybuilder’, but not to actually sweat through memorizing (and then forgetting) endless arbitrary characters or hours in the gym (followed by gluttony as cruel as the starvation).</p>

          </div>
          <p>It is easy for someone like a book agent or editor to suggest “hey, you should publish a book!”, since they aren’t the one writing it, and they have plenty on their plate. But what book, exactly, would I publish? “Gwern.net”? Leaving aside all the fun hypertext features, what would such a book be? It would have to be some sort of anthology, I suppose; but what a mongrel of an anthology it would be, if I look over my past few essays: <a href="https://gwern.net/review/the-last-unicorn" id="gwern-review-the-last-unicorn" title="‘Review Of <em>The Last Unicorn</em>’, Gwern 2024">a review</a> of a children’s movie about unicorns, then the moral philosophy of <a href="https://gwern.net/review/timecrimes" id="gwern-review-timecrimes" title="‘<em>Timecrimes</em>: Time Travel In Hell’, Gwern 2023">self-consistent time travel</a>, then there’s the <a href="https://gwern.net/dropcap" id="gwern-dropcap" title="‘Dropcap Generation With AI’, Gwern 2023">detailed technical tutorial</a> about generating fonts with 2023 generative AI models… (The anthology would not be ordered chronologically, safe to say.)</p>
          <p>I don’t feel enthused about it; but to make a book I would not be ashamed of, I would have to spend many hours revising, rewriting, stripping out hypertext features and deciding what should stay, reformatting for some arcane publisher workflow like EPUB (or worse). This is true whether it’s a big professional publication or a small boutique style, like the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new&amp;format=preview&amp;theme=classic" data-url-original="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new" title="LessWrong Books">LessWrong anthologies</a>—which are nice indeed, but I recall Oliver Habryka ballparking the necessary total effort at in the hundreds of man-hours. (For already-written LW posts!) And while I was in the middle of that, if I wanted to write something else, well, now I would get to feel extra-guilty about procrastinating on The Book™. I definitely won’t have time or energy to follow up on weird anomalies or interesting new rabbit-holes, and even if my output appears unaffected by The Book™, I am in reality eating my intellectual seed-corn and gradually falling out of date, as I neglect the ordinary work of reading &amp; discussion that may flower years later. (Authors who write books have a distinct tendency to <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/public-intellectuals-have-short-shelf-lives-but-why/" data-link-icon="Ss" data-link-icon-type="text">‘go stale’</a>.)</p>
          <p>I finish all this, and then what? Now it has to spend months working its way through the pipeline, still a distraction, and then—<em>mirabile dictu!</em>—it is done.</p>
          <p>Uh oh—that’s just the start, isn’t it? Now I have to go out and shill for pre-orders (as we are endlessly assured by apologetic authors that pre-orders are about the only sales number that matters these days and <em>oh god if you ever liked my writing please pre-order and don’t wait until afterwards just think of it as a donation if you have to but pre-order now</em>). If you opt for a low-key launch, skipping the pre-publication publicity campaign, well, you’re still going to have to publicize it once it’s out (<em>free copy to the first person to retweet this!</em>), and deal with reviews (soliciting them, specifically—you should be so lucky anyone actually wrote a review, good or bad, unsolicited) etc.</p>
          <p>And of course, the double-edged blade of the physical immutability of books as artifacts begins to cut both ways—now that your thoughts are committed to a book, you can never take them back or change them or tweak them. You are now in some respects frozen and reduced to a caricature, to a much greater degree watching your caricature self go around and about (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/borges/1962-borges-borgesandi.pdf" id="borges-1962" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Borges and I', Borges 1962">“Borges and I”</a>).</p>
          <p>So, a book is a lot of work for a writer, even if it is mostly already-written writing, which crowds out new writing or exploration, and which tends to freeze them in place. But it gets worse.</p>
          <p>A book commits you to a single task, one which will devour your time for years to come, cutting you off from readers and from opportunity; in the time that you are laboring over the book, which usually you can’t talk much about with readers or enjoy the feedback, you may be driving yourself <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/psychiatry/bipolar/energy/1989-jamison.pdf" id="jamison-1989" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="‘Mood Disorders and Patterns of Creativity in British Writers and Artists’, Jamison 1989">into depression</a>.</p>

          <p>PhD attrition rates are well-known, and much of it happens after qualifications, while writing the thesis; those who pay attention to biographies of writers will recall many more instances attested, if only in those odd lacuna to which biographers dismiss with a line entire years in which nothing seems to happen but a discarded manuscript.</p>

WBW… not so much. The reader will have one of two reactions: “who’s that?” and “oh yeah, whatever happened to him?”</p>
            <p>The answer is simple: on 2016-06-18, disgusted by the 2016 US Presidential election and American political trends (especially the Great Awokening), as he explains in his post-mortem, he <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/last-six-years.html" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="A Short History of My Last Six Years">decided to begin writing what would be a book</a> about politics, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="What’s Our Problem?"><em>What’s Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies</em></a> <span>(2023). This was a mistake.</span></p>
            <p>Re-emerging over half a decade later (or 2,440 days) to break his silence, he explains at length how it was a mistake: the scope kept sprawling, he kept thinking he was almost done only to redo more, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#bodyContent" title="Sunk cost § Fallacy effect">sunk cost fallacy</a> kept him from killing it, while he kept procrastinating and trying to do it all, to the extent that:</p>

            <p>Eventually, his girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, got pregnant. The thought of having a kid while <em>still</em> writing the book terrified him into finishing it off before the pregnancy did.</p>
            <p>Was the book any good? I couldn’t tell you. I’ve never read it or seen anyone mention it; when I brought it up in a chat, only one person had read it (and they didn’t like it). I suspect many more people read his post about writing the book than will ever read the book.</p>
            <p>And one can see the impact looking at <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/archive" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="Archive">his archives</a>. You do not need advanced statistics to see a change ~2016–2017 in the posting rate. (And this is neglecting that the later WBW posts are often short; counting words &amp; illustrations would probably show a larger loss.)</p>
            <p>Another way to put the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost#bodyContent" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> is to note that if WBW had kept up its lowest pre-book annual rate (2015’s 11 posts), then instead of a total of 11 posts to show for <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> (ie. less than an average year), it would have <em>55</em> more (66 total) posts.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          </section>
          <section id="anonymous">
            <h2><a href="#anonymous" title="Link to section: § 'Anonymous'">Anonymous</a></h2>
            <p>In another case, the author has not written a post-mortem, but I think the same thing happened.</p>
            <p>Around roughly the same time as WBW, there was another popular Internet blogger and writer, who gave well-received talks; he too decided to write a book to sum it all up and popularize his views, and went silent.</p>
            <p>About 2–3 years later, I went to dinner with him; I tried to avoid bringing up the book at all, and felt I could sense his constant strain and anxiety that I would ask about it, which made conversation a little difficult. This depression was also clearly visible in their minimal online activity. I wondered if they would ever publish the book, or if the moment had already passed.</p>
            <p>And then <em>4 years</em> after that, somewhat to my surprise, the book finally came out—and it was good! It was positively reviewed and I still see it mentioned (which is more than &gt;99% of books can say), and people still ask occasionally “whatever happened to him?” (If you google his name, “what happened to <em>X</em>” is the first suggested search query.)</p>
            <p>So, the reward was real but modest. What was the cost? Unfortunately, he has not returned to his previous activities; so in his case, the opportunity cost appears to have been… <em>everything</em>. Everything he would’ve written if he hadn’t been writing the book. As far as I can tell, several years later, he has not begun writing another book nor taken up any major non-writing activities; he just exists—burned out by the trauma of writing the book. And you can’t fix burnout by doing the same kind of thing, I think, <a href="https://gwern.net/backstop#burnout" id="gwern-backstop--burnout">only totally different things</a>.</p>
            <p>This is regrettable.</p>
            
            <p>As a third case, one could mention Scott Alexander again—at the same time as WBW he was writing, and finishing (on 2017-05-17), his online fantasy novel <a href="https://unsongbook.com/" id="alexander-2015" data-link-icon="ℵ" data-link-icon-type="text" title="'<em>Unsong</em>', Alexander 2015"><em>Unsong</em></a>, which <a href="https://gwern.net/review/book#unsong-alexander-2017" id="gwern-review-book--unsong-alexander-2017">I enjoyed</a>. He has since been editing and polishing it up for publication, according to occasional mentions on SSC and later on ACX up to the present. After 7 years of ‘editing’ and negotiations for publication, during which “various things went wrong and I procrastinated”, a fan volunteered to <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/unsong-available-in-paperback" data-link-icon="SSC" data-link-icon-type="text,tri" title="'<em>Unsong</em> Available In Paperback', Scott Alexander 2024-04-31">help get it self-published on Amazon</a>. It’s nice that <em>a</em> book now exists, technically, but it feels like the mountain gave birth to a mouse, and one wonders if Scott Alexander would’ve been even more prolific <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> had he not had <em>Unsong</em> hanging from his neck…?</p>
            
            <p>And a fourth case would be The Last Psychiatrist: he stopped blogging in May 2014, a book having been mentioned, which arrived only in December 2020, almost 7 years later. Reviews were mixed, but one thing is clear—as of August 2024, he has not returned to any known public writing.</p>
            
            <p>Also worth mentioning Wildbow’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)#bodyContent" title="Worm (web serial)"><em>Worm</em></a>, supposedly undergoing intense editing—admittedly, quite necessary in <em>Worm</em>’s case—since <span>2013<sub>11ya</sub></span> for ebook &amp; print publication. Last I knew, it was still being edited, with no sign of <em>Worm</em> publication imminent; although meanwhile Wildbow has written at least 3 other web serials, of vast length &amp; at similar update speed, so it is unclear if the ‘editing’ has done him any harm.</p>

          <h2><a href="#keeping-the-book-inside-them" title="Link to section: § 'Keeping The Book Inside Them'">Keeping The Book Inside Them</a></h2>
          <p>Now of course, there is a second kind of author: authors who write books with little discernible impact on their newsletter or blog. They sit down for an hour (statistically, <a href="https://gwern.net/morning-writing" id="gwern-morning-writing" title="‘What Is The Morning Writing Effect?’, Gwern 2011">in the morning</a>), pound out their quota, and turn to the next task. The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months. More power to them—but I also think that most would-be book authors already know if they are one of <em>that</em> latter kind of writers, or if they are the former kind I’ve been discussing.</p>
          <p>If they are the former kind, then they should seriously doubt any plan to write a book: why do they think they will finish? Or that it will be worthwhile? Is there a clear professional reason that the writing has to be a <em>book</em>? (Unless they are named “J. K. Rowling”, they can usually rule out “sales” as an adequate professional reason.)</p>
          <p>More importantly, what will the effect on <em>them</em> be? And what is the opportunity cost of writing a book: if they spend the next 5 years devoting all their energies to a book, what will be excluded? Would they happily throw everything they wrote in the previous 5 years into a fireplace in exchange for a finished manuscript of the book they are fantasizing about? Would they willing to wager everything they might ever write on the book going well, rather than becoming an albatross and burning them out? If I had decided in 2019 to write up “a book about AI” in the wake of my <a href="https://gwern.net/gpt-2" id="gwern-presser-2019-poetry" title="‘GPT-2 Neural Network Poetry’, Gwern &amp; Presser 2019">GPT-2 experiments</a><span>, say, and only published it in 2024, and sacrificed writing like</span> <a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" id="gwern-scaling-hypothesis" title="'The Scaling Hypothesis', Gwern 2020">“The Scaling Hypothesis”</a> <span>(visionary in May 2020, hopelessly obsolete in August 2024), would I be better off than I am now?</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
          <p>I suspect that if many writers took seriously writing a book as a real project, rather than an aspirational cultural ideal of ‘being an author’ along the lines of ‘being a foreign language speaker’ or ‘being a PhD’, they would realize that it is a serious risk which can backfire. Everyone may have a book inside them, but some should keep it inside them.</p>
          <p>And for now, should a book come out of me despite my best efforts, I will take off and nuke it from orbit. (It’s the only way to be sure.)</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In Washington people never read books—they just write them…Washington intellectuals are masters of small mountains. Some of their peaks are more difficult to summit than others. Many smaller slopes are nonetheless jagged and foreboding; climbing these are a mark of true intellectual achievement. But whether the way is smoothly paved or roughly made, the destinations are the same: small heights, little occupied. Those who reach these heights can rest secure. Out of humanity’s many billions there are only a handful of individuals who know their chosen domain as well as they do. They have mastered their mountain: they know its every crag, they have walked its every gully. But it is a small mountain. At its summit their field of view is limited to the narrow range of their own expertise.</p>
                <p>The social function of such a book is entirely unrelated to its erudition, elegance, or analytical clarity. It is only partially related to the actual ideas or policy recommendations inside it. In this world of small mountains, books and reports are a sort of proof, a sign of achievement that can be seen by climbers of other peaks. An author has mastered her mountain. The wonk thirsts for authority: once she has written a book, other wonks will give it to her.</p>

                  <p>(from my peers) the MO for those who want to leave seems to be slacking until PIP/Focus/Pivot (for the payout) while looking for outside opportunities. There are a ton of companies out there that meet your criteria, but you’ll have to do some digging. YMMV</p>

Many packages traveling from coast to coast – like the Chengs’ – go through the Indy hub at some point on their journey, even if they aren’t being sent from or to Indiana.</p><p>The Marion County prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

<li>in addition to the experience being subpar if the terminal window is too small, if the terminal window is too large, rainfrog will crash due to the maximum area of ratatui buffers being <code>u16::MAX</code> (65,535). more details in <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2516294679" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/issues/60" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/achristmascarl/rainfrog/issues/60/hovercard" href="https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/issues/60">#60</a></li>

<li>on mac, for VS Code and terminal (and perhaps other editors), a setting for "use option as meta key" needs to be turned on for Alt/Opt keybindings to work.

<li>in visual mode, when selecting an entire line, the behavior is not the same as vim's, as it simply moves starts the selection at the head of the line, so moving up or down in lines will break the selection.</li>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.

<p>Date: September 17, 2024</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the
availability of FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE. This is the fifth release of
the stable/13 branch.</p>
<p>Since this release is occurring late in a legacy stable branch,
there are few new features; rather, the focus is primarily on
maintenance. As such, changes since 13.3-RELEASE consist mostly of
bug fixes, driver updates, and new versions of
externally-maintained software.</p>
<p>For a complete list of new features and known problems, please
see the online release notes and errata list, available at:</p>

<h2 id="_availability">Availability</h2>
<div>
<p>FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386,
powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv6, armv7, aarch64,
and riscv64 architectures.</p>
<p>FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images
or over the network. Some architectures also support installing
from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded as
described below.</p>
<p>SHA512 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and
SD card images are included at the bottom of this message.</p>
<p>PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available
at:</p>

</div>
<p>The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as
follows:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>dvd1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD
operating system, the documentation, debugging distribution sets,
and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical
workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a
"livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can
burn and use DVD-sized media.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the dvd1 image, assuming the USB
drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>disc1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also

<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bootonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does
not contain the installation distribution sets for installing
FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network
based install (e.g., from an HTTP or FTP server) after booting from
the CD.</p>

<dt>memstick</dt>
<dd>
<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It
also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are
no pre-built packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the
USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img \

<dt>mini-memstick</dt>
<dd>
<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
to boot a machine, but does not contain the installation
distribution sets on the medium itself, similar to the bootonly
image. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.
There are no pre-built packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image, assuming
the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like
this should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD/arm SD card images</dt>
<dd>
<p>These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the
supported arm system. The SD card image contains the full FreeBSD
installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as small as 5
GB.</p>
<p>For convenience for those without console access to the system,
a <code>freebsd</code> user with a password of <code>freebsd</code>
is available by default for <code>ssh(1)</code> access.
Additionally, the <code>root</code> user password is set to
<code>root</code>, which it is strongly recommended to change the
password for both users after gaining access to the system.</p>
<p>To write the FreeBSD/arm image to an SD card, use the
<code>dd(1)</code> utility, replacing <em>KERNEL</em> with the
appropriate kernel configuration name for the system.</p>

<p>Pre-installed virtual machine images are also available for the
amd64 (x86_64), i386 (x86_32), AArch64 (arm64), and RISCV (riscv64)
architectures in <code>QCOW2</code>, <code>VHD</code>, and
<code>VMDK</code> disk image formats, as well as raw (unformatted)
