<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header><section><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog">Blog</a><svg width="8" height="12" viewBox="0 0 8 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2 10L6 6L2 2" stroke="#667999" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="square"></path></svg><span>Bluesky: An Open Social Web</span></section><div><p>Feb 22, 2024</p><p><span>by <!-- -->The Bluesky Team</span></p></div></header><div><p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
<h2>How does this affect my experience on Bluesky?</h2>
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
<h2>If my experience doesn’t change, why federate?</h2>
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
<h2>Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon?</h2>
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A focus on the global conversation:</strong> On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted.</li>
<li><strong>Composable moderation:</strong> Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon.</li>
<li><strong>Composable feeds:</strong> We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds.</li>
<li><strong>Account portability:</strong> We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So how can I self-host and join the network?</h2>
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>

			<h2>
			Study puts fermentation, not fire, as pivot point behind our ancestors’ increasing cranial capacity		</h2>
		
</div><div>
<p>The large, capable human brain is a marvel of evolution, but how it evolved from a smaller primate brain into the creative, complex organ of today is a mystery. Scientists can pinpoint <em>when</em> our evolutionary ancestors evolved larger brains, which roughly tripled in size as humans evolved from the bipedal primates known as Australopithecines.</p>



<p>But <em>why </em>it happened when it did — what spurred that change — has remained elusive. While some have theorized that the use of fire, and the subsequent invention of cooking, provided enough nourishment for our larger-brained ancestors to become dominant, a new theory points to a different spark: fermentation.</p>



<p>The key to understanding how our brains grew is most likely rooted in what — and how — we eat, said Erin Hecht, one of the authors of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05517-3">“Fermentation technology as a driver of human brain expansion,”</a> which has just been published in Communications Biology.</p>



<p>“Brain tissue is metabolically expensive,” said Hecht, an assistant professor of human evolutionary biology. “It requires a lot of calories to keep it running, and in most animals, having enough energy just to survive is a constant problem.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-731x1024.jpg" alt="Erin Hecht." srcset="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-214x300.jpg 214w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-768x1076.jpg 768w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht-1462x2048.jpg 1462w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1785Erin-Hecht.jpg 1785w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px"><figcaption><p>“Whatever changed in their diets had to have happened before brains started getting bigger,” said Erin Hecht.</p><p>File photo by Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer</p></figcaption></figure>



<p>For the larger-brained Australopithecus to survive, therefore, something must have changed in their diet. Theories put forward have included changes in what they consumed or, most popularly, that the discovery of cooking gave them more usable calories from whatever they ate.</p>



<p>The problem with this theory is that the earliest evidence places the use of fire at approximately 1.5 million years ago — significantly later than the development of the hominid brain.</p>



<p>“Our ancestors’ cranial capacity began increasing 2.5 million years ago, which conservatively gives us about a 1-million-year gap in the timeline between brain size increasing and the possible emergence of cooking technology,” said <a href="https://klbryant.com/?page_id=290">Katherine L. Bryant</a>, another of the paper’s co-authors and currently a researcher at the Institute for Language, Communication, and the Brain at <a href="https://www.univ-amu.fr/">Aix-Marseille Université</a> in France. “Some other dietary change must have been releasing metabolic constraints on brain size, and fermentation seems like it could fit the bill.”<br></p>



<p>“Whatever changed in their diets had to have happened before brains started getting bigger,” said Hecht, who also noted that during the last few years researchers have postulated other options, such as the consumption of rotting meat.</p>



<p>In the new paper, she and her team offer a different hypothesis: that cached (or saved) food fermented, and that this “pre-digested” food provided a more accessible form of nourishment, fueling that bigger brain and allowing our ancestors to survive and thrive through natural selection.</p>

<p>The shift was probably a happy accident. “This was not necessarily an intentional endeavor,” Hecht posited. “It may have been an accidental side effect of caching food. And maybe, over time, traditions or superstitions could have led to practices that promoted fermentation or made fermentation more stable or more reliable.”</p>



<p>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the human large intestine is proportionally smaller than those of other primates, suggesting that we adapted to food that was already broken down by the chemical process of fermentation. In addition, fermented foods are found in all cultures and across food groups, from Europe’s wine and cheese to Asia’s soy sauce and <em>natto, </em>a Japanese soybean dish.</p>



<p>Hecht suggested that an additional study of brain responses to fermented and non-fermented foods might be useful, as might one of olfactory and taste receptors, perhaps using ancient DNA. For the evolutionary biologist, these are all fertile areas for other researchers to investigate. (Hecht’s focus is more on “how brain circuits have evolved to support complex behaviors,” with research on both living humans and dogs.)</p>



<p>As research progresses, Bryant sees possibilities for a wide range of benefits. “This hypothesis also gives us as scientists even more reasons to explore the role of fermented foods on human health and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome,” she said. “There have been a number of studies in recent years linking gut microbiome to not only physical but mental health.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today marks my first month <a href="https://www.sophiajt.com/youtube-addiction">clean from YouTube</a>. It was the right choice, but that's not to say it was easy.</p>
<p>Let's talk about it.</p>
<h2 id="quitting">Quitting</h2>
<p>When I decided to do something about my addiction, I had a few choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut back the amount I was watching</li>
<li>Quit cold turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>They both have their pluses and minuses, but by the time I figured out what was going I was <em>done</em> with being hooked on it. I was ashamed of getting caught up in it so badly. I chose going cold turkey.</p>
<p>Would I choose that path again? Good question, let's explore it.</p>
<h2 id="cold-turkey">Cold turkey</h2>
<p>It was pretty soon after I decided to quit that I blocked YouTube on all my devices. For most things, that meant finding the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file or equivalent for the OS, and adding a line to set <code>youtube.com</code> to <code>127.0.0.1</code>. That effectively shuts you out of YouTube the site.</p>
<p>On my phone, I used <code>AppBlock</code> to block the website. I would have preferred to edit <code>/etc/hosts</code> like I did with my machines, but unfortunately that part of the filesystem is read-only, and can only be modified if you jail-break your phone. App it is.</p>
<p>Once I blocked it everywhere I could, I tested it a few times to be sure it was working. Satisfied, I settled in to see what would change.</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>A few things changed right away. Now that I wasn't obliterating myself for 8-10 hours a day, I started noticing a lot of things. One was that on an average day prior to quitting YouTube, I consumed a <em>lot</em> of sugar. Multiple desserts, plus sugary snacks in between meals, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Before, when I was watching hours of YouTube, I'm guessing I would get up and find something to snack on and sit back down. Now, I don't have that kind of "permanently distracted" frame of mind, I notice that I eat fewer snacks and cut way back on the sugar.</p>
<p>I also had time to walk more - something I've always enjoyed. I started doing a 5km (3.1 mi) walk every morning. It takes me almost exactly an hour, and it's a nice way to start the day.</p>
<p>But the real changes started happening with my mental health.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health">Mental health</h2>
<p>One of the things that made me try to find out what was wrong with me was my declining mental health. Part of me wanted to become a shut-in and lose myself, and another part of me wanted to fight this. I felt worse as the weeks passed.</p>
<p>Once I stopped YouTube, I knew I needed a few things: I needed to understand <em>why</em> I got addicted in the first place, and I needed to work on healthier habits.</p>
<p>This is still very early on for me, but I wanted to mention a few things I did:</p>
<p>I talked to my doctor, who put me in for addiction counselling services. Here in New Zealand, you can get five free visits with an addiction counsellor as you begin your recovery.</p>
<p>I put in for the services, but I didn't know how long it would take to get into the system, so I also looked around locally for a therapist who could also give some support. This was a private therapist, so there are costs associated with it.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two could not have been more stark. The therapist was very gentle and sympathetic. The counsellor... well, let's say they have a specific task at hand.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-addicted-and-what-can-you-do-better">Why are you addicted and what can you do better?</h2>
<p>Addiction counselling, as best as I can figure, has a different goal that general therapy. They're trying to hold up a mirror so you can see something very important for you to see: you are not taking care of yourself.</p>
<p>More than that - your brain, in your current state, is not your friend.</p>
<p>These are some hard truths to swallow.</p>
<p>You work on habits you can change: how to make small changes each day, how to think about rewards and how you've been making bad assessments of what rewards are for and what you should do with them.</p>
<p>Did I mention that's all in the first half hour?</p>
<p>Then we started talking about the "why", in the same way of holding up a mirror and talking through ways of working with this stuff. I won't share the personal details here, but we covered a decent bit of ground. In the end, as best as I could understand, is that while you may have past experiences that caused your instincts to protect you, they're just that. We all try to protect ourselves from pain and danger. This is a good thing, unless it goes too far and we lose the ability to take normal daily risks and live a healthy life.</p>
<p>In a sense, the goal of building new habits isn't to only have new habits. It's to start rewiring the brain to process risks, pain, and danger in a healthier way. There will always be risks, like crossing a street, and we re-learn how to work with them.</p>
<p>To some folks, that might sound like total common sense. If it does for you, that's great. For me, it got surprisingly easy to create a safe illusion that turned into an unhealthy way to cope. I needed to see my way out of that.</p>
<h2 id="other-changes">Other changes</h2>
<p>After talking with my doctor, I also started cooking more. I'm not a particular good cook (actually I'm pretty bad, though getting better).</p>
<p>The act of cooking and eating your own food, though, is therapeutic. You can see how healthy (or not) the food you make is. You know the ingredients that go into it. You can make enough for leftovers.</p>
<p>By the time I knew I needed to quit YouTube last month, I'd given up on cooking. I might make a pizza here or there, but almost all my lunches and dinners came from delivery food. Now, this is reversed. I'll still get the occasional delivery, but almost all of what I eat these days I make.</p>
<h2 id="cravings">Cravings</h2>
<p>You may wonder how the actual quitting part is going. The short answer is that I have good days and bad days.</p>
<p>It's surprisingly easy some days to fill a day with fun things to do, so that I don't even notice it passing. Other days, I might do some work on the computer and then lay in the floor thinking about stuff I want to watch, scheming ways I could justifying watching <em>some</em> YouTube. That voice that says "watch a few hours to scratch the itch".</p>
<p>This, I know, would be a bad idea(tm).</p>
<h2 id="content-as-an-addiction">Content as an addiction</h2>
<p>In talking with lots of folks, at this point I'm convinced we've got content wrong. At least, how it's delivered to us.</p>
<p>You can take most of them and understand the business model as "retention = profits". The more time you spend on the site, the longer your eyeballs are taking in the ads and related, the more money the site makes off of you.</p>
<p>The way sites like TikTok and YouTube give you a feed of content means you can consume it in an unbroken fashion. It reminds me of the people you see at slot machines in casinos, pulling the lever to see what will happen. Maybe you'll get lucky and come across something awesome.</p>
<p>The content also keeps you in a kind of trance - a state where you don't <em>have</em> to think if you don't want to.</p>
<p>I feel like one of those people complaining about how televisions make us zombies.</p>
<p>I chatted with my addiction counsellor about about social media platforms, and I'm sure you're not at all surprised that they're also addictive.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to be <em>just</em> about the dangers of these platforms. There's more to it than I can really cover here, and those platforms can be used for good as well. The main thing, for me, is how they interact with our brains. Are we still able to live healthy lives? Form deep healthy relationships? Take daily risks of being our complete selves? Are our brains staying healthy?</p>
<h2 id="reaching-out">Reaching out</h2>
<p>Probably the most important thing, though, is to directly target what I needed most of all. Addiction is isolating. The particular addiction, YouTube, is a lot of wanting to connect to others in a very safe way. So, to combat this, the goal is to "reach out". To connect to real people. To get my 'cup' filled with real intimacy and connections with others.</p>
<p>What in the world that means is something I'm trying to figure out. I know that my cup was very, very empty. Despite having so many friends, fun online interactions, game nights, etc. Those things are great, but they don't meet the need for real connection.</p>
<p>I'm signing up for meetups, volunteering, and going and chatting with random people where I can to get face-to-face interactions again.</p>
<h2 id="step-at-a-time">Step at a time</h2>
<p>That's it. That's where I'm at. Figuring out what I can, making changes where I can, and learning as I go.</p>
<p>To all the folks who reached out with their stories of struggles and recovery: thank you. Sincerely, thank you. The suggestions and words of encouragement have helped. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Here's to the hope my cup, and yours, will be filled.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a cheap used copy of the book <a href="https://books.google.it/books/about/A_Programmer_s_Guide_to_COMMON_LISP.html?id=saIZAQAAIAAJ"><em>A Programmer's Guide to COMMON LISP</em></a> by Deborah G. Tatar, Digital Press, 1987.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.snap.as/tqNa1b4B.jpg"><img src="https://i.snap.as/tqNa1b4B.jpg" alt="The book A Programmer's Guide to COMMON LISP by Deborah G."></a></p>

<p>Why did I read such an old book, published a few years after CLtL1 and well before ANSI finalized the Common Lisp standard?</p>

<p>I'm always looking for good Lisp books. Since <a href="https://interlisp.org/">Medley</a> is my primary Lisp environment, I'm particularly interested in books published when the system was originally developed and used. These works are relevant because they cover a set of features close to the state of the Common Lisp implementation of Medley, and present a programming style typical of Lisp development in those years.</p>

<p>Two old reviews got me curious about <em>A Programmer's Guide to COMMON LISP</em>, one <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1862396.1862402">by Daniel Weinreb</a> and the other <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/24900.885745">by Richard Caruana</a>.</p>

<p>Both reviews point out the book is different from most contemporary introductory Lisp books which focus on AI. Although Tatar's does contain some AI code, such as an interesting and complete toy expert system, the sample code spans a wider range of domains like a text formatter similar to <code>nroff</code>.</p>

<p>What sets <em>A Programmer's Guide to COMMON LISP</em> apart from other Lisp books is its environment independent discussion of the interactive Lisp programming process. Writing code in the editor, evaluating expressions from the editor, interacting with the REPL for testing expressions and exploring, and so on.</p>

<p>I've never seen the process expressed so clearly in any book, past of present. I'm familiar with it but the material is particulary helpful for complete beginners.</p>

<p>Although the short chapter on macros presents some interesting examples like a simplified version of <code>defstruct</code>, it doesn't discuss <code>gensym</code> and variable capture. This is unusual. But it's only one of a few issues and the book is a valuable addition to my Lisp library.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why design a&nbsp;new&nbsp;typeface?</h2>
<p>We <em>really</em> care about creating the best reading and writing experience. Our note-taking app, Supernotes, has always been about speed and simplicity – open the app and <a href="https://supernotes.app/features/super-fast/">within seconds start jotting down your thoughts</a>. There’s only one font available <mark>to help you keep focused and just take notes</mark>. We don’t want you to spend time debating between Arial and Times New Roman, but that means it’s important we get that one font right.</p>
<p>Over the last five years we’ve tried out a bunch of different typefaces for Supernotes. While some have looked fantastic, we’ve always run into the same developmental challenges. Sometimes we had to add hacky margins to certain characters so they’d display correctly and certain characters weren’t available at all. Our community also notices these small details, asking for more consistent weights, improved ligatures and better international language support. We’ve outgrown current font family offerings and needed something more fine-tuned.</p>

    </span></p><h5>Supernotes Co-founders, Tobias and Connor, designing and discussing SN Pro</h5>
<p>We previously built a custom markdown text editor, based on an open source library <a href="https://supernotes.app/open-source/">we support</a>, so why not do the same for a font family? With the recent launch of our mobile apps, we set out to do exactly that –&nbsp;design, build and test our brand new typeface, SN Pro. <mark>You’re actually reading SN Pro right now.</mark></p>
<h2>The Devil is in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Details</h2>
<p>SN Pro is based on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nunito</a>, a brilliant rounded font designed by Vernon Adams. While very fond of Nunito, there have always been things we wished we could adjust.</p>
<p>So we took it upon ourselves to carefully re-think each and every character –&nbsp;lowering cap heights, improving kerning (spacing between characters), and modifying any quirky characters that looked a bit out of place, such as the <kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>t</kbd>. Have a look for yourself:</p>

    </span></p><p>We also gave SN Pro a little flair, such as a swish in the lowercase “e”. To finish off we also modified the font weight ratios, so that bold would be <strong>bolder</strong> and more distinct.

<p>SN stands for both Supernotes, the note-taking app this was designed for and “<em>Super</em>” Nunito, the open-source font we started with. We’re serious about note-taking, so we need a professional font to match, hence the addition of ‘Pro’. </p>
<p>SN Pro is available in eight different weights ranging from Thin to Black. Currently only Latin and Cyrillic are supported but we will be increasing support for other languages in the future. </p>

<h2>Open Source. Free for you. Always.</h2>
<p>At Supernotes, we put a big emphasis on data ownership – everything is private, secure and yours. While our app isn’t open-source, all your notes are written in a portable markdown format, so you can export them whenever you like.</p>
<p>We continued this ethos with SN Pro. It’s free and open source, so you can safely use anything made with Supernotes for any personal and commercial projects. You can even add SN Pro as a font to your favorite third-party applications to create a more familiar ‘transitional environment’. For example, expanding your ideas in Microsoft Word for that university essay or displaying a presentation with iA Presenter. </p>
<p>Here’s how how SN Pro looks in the wild with a few different font pairings:</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The new terminal (Beta) is now in JetBrains IDEs and will be available in the new UI starting from the 2024.1 version of the IDEs. You can switch between the old and new terminal in <em>Settings/Preferences | Tools | Terminal | Enable New Terminal</em>. Currently, it supports only Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell, with other shells in development. This blog post covers the architectural and visual changes and outlines our plans.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1600" height="640" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-79.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Software developers use terminals for a variety of tasks. Though it’s a basic element of programming, the convenience of a terminal lies in its ability to provide a universal way of managing tasks without needing to be proficient in all UI elements. Modern solutions, on the other hand, come with numerous productivity enhancements, such as smart layouts for the command prompt and output, command completion with a list of options, AI-powered functions, and many others.</p>



<p>Aiming to combine both basic and advanced capabilities, the new terminal&nbsp; is a familiar tool presented in a fresh way and with an expanded set of features. Our goals are to preserve the functionality of working in a terminal, enhance convenience and simplicity, and address long-standing issues. This article will guide you through the changes to the terminal in JetBrains IDEs and our plans for the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Visual changes</strong></h2>



<p>The new terminal aligns with the look and feel of the new UI and is available in all JetBrains IDEs starting from version 2024.1. The primary visual distinction of the new terminal is that each command is now presented in a separate block. This helps you quickly locate the start and end of each command, enhancing the readability of the output. This change brings other new capabilities, such as easy navigation between blocks using arrows and the <em>⌘↑ / ⌘↓</em> (macOS) and <em>Ctrl+↑ / Ctrl+↓</em> (Windows and Linux) shortcuts that enable you to easily switch between the prompt and output.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/navigation.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Another significant change is the command completion feature that supports commands, paths, arguments, and options, aimed at simplifying command entry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QULxSq2WHjSg2t94A3GtzBvfuG9ZEBVI44CXexGGBTsXXCTGum2TeutNXzsn-eAsQqnkvt7bAS9kClRFjDLXxTIjcFqoNbd073AqO-sRIy0rm9l6ujJNdYioKisK9pdl0-uekitU3n3WjlEUMhZb_tc" alt=""></figure>



<p>A new, convenient command history has been added, which allows for filtering and makes it easier to navigate through recently executed commands. The UX designers have also revamped the color scheme – the palette is now aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/history.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><strong>Architectural changes</strong></h2>



<div><p>The new terminal is not just visual changes, but a new architecture that made these changes possible. Here are the most notable changes:</p><p>We took full control over the prompt area of the terminal. You can now use editor actions and move the cursor with the mouse during command input. At this stage, some shell shortcuts either do not work or behave incorrectly. We are working to address these issues.</p></div>



<p>We reworked command completion that integrates all of the IDE’s knowledge into the suggestions. Since we are still working on this update, some completion options may not be available or they may differ from shell-based completion.</p>



<p>We added our own command prompt, which shows the current directory, Git branch, Python virtual environment, and Anaconda environment. This is intended to provide a rich, modern command prompt even if it is not configured in a shell. We understand that some prefer having the same prompt as in the system terminal, and we are working on an option to allow this.</p>



<h2><strong>How to enable the new terminal</strong></h2>



<p>Starting from version 2024.1, when the <em>Terminal</em> tool window is opened for the first time, you will see a promotional window for the new terminal. After that, you can switch between the old and new terminal using the three dots menu in the upper right corner of your <em>Terminal </em>tool window or via <em>Settings/Preferences | Tools | Terminal | Enable New Terminal</em>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/enable.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>At the moment, we only support a limited set of shells: Zsh, Bash, and PowerShell. If you use any other shell, you will see the old terminal even if the new setting is enabled.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>



<p>Currently, we’ve only taken the first step in overhauling the terminal, and there’s much more work ahead. Our immediate focus is on improving the stability of the new terminal and refining its current behavior.</p>



<p>We plan to introduce more terminal customization options (fonts, spacing, etc.), improve command completion, add the ability to switch between the built-in and shell prompt, introduce context actions for blocks, and streamline tab management in the terminal. Additionally, we have plans to implement useful AI capabilities, such as assisting in command typing or explaining the obtained results.</p>



<h2><strong>How to provide feedback</strong></h2>



<p>The new JetBrains IDE terminal, which will be made available from v2024.1, is in Beta and currently undergoing changes and improvements. At this stage, your feedback is crucial to us. Our goal is that the new terminal will have the same capabilities as the old one, while offering a host of beneficial new features.&nbsp;</p>

If a user registers with a password and later signs in with a social account sharing the same email, new screens make account linking straightforward, enhancing user convenience and reducing support inquiries.</li>
<li><strong>Passwordless "Magic Code"</strong>: Introduce a passwordless login method with "Magic Code," which sends a one-time code to the user's email for sign-up and login. This method can also serve as a fallback when users forget their password or their social login is unavailable, streamlining the login process and improving user accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Session to JWT Conversion</strong>: Convert an Ory Session Cookie or Ory Session Token into a JSON Web Token (JWT), providing more flexibility in handling sessions and integrating with other systems. This feature allows for seamless authentication and authorization processes across different platforms and services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;To ensure a seamless upgrade experience with minimal impact, some of these features are gated behind the&nbsp;<code>feature_flags</code>&nbsp;config parameter, allowing controlled deployment and testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better reliability when sending out emails across different providers.</li>
<li>Streamlining the HTTP API and improving related SDK methods.</li>
<li>Better performance when calling the whoami API endpoint, updating identities, and listing identities.</li>
<li>The performance of listing identities has significantly improved with the introduction of keyset pagination. Page pagination is still available but will be fully deprecated soon.</li>
<li>Ability to list multiple identities in a batch call.</li>
<li>Passkeys and WebAuthn now support multiple origins, useful when working with subdomains.</li>
<li>The logout flow now redirects the user back to the&nbsp;<code>return_to</code>&nbsp;parameter set in the API call.</li>
<li>When updating their settings, the user was sometimes incorrectly asked to confirm the changes by providing their password. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When signing up with an account that already exists, the user will be shown a hint helping them sign in to their existing account.</li>
<li>CORS configuration can now be hot-reloaded.</li>
<li>The integration with Ory OAuth2 / Ory Hydra has improved for logout, login session management, verification, and recovery flows.</li>
<li>A new passwordless method has been added: "Magic code". It sends a one-time code to the user's email during sign-up and log-in. This method can additionally be used as a fallback login method when the user forgets their password.</li>
<li>Integration with social sign-in has improved, and it is now possible to use the email verified status from the social sign-in provider.</li>
<li>Ory Elements and the default Ory Account Experience are now internationalized with translations.</li>
<li>It is now possible to convert an Ory Session Cookie or Ory Session Token into a JSON Web Token.</li>
<li>Recovery on native apps has improved significantly and no longer requires the user to switch to a browser for the recovery step.</li>
<li>Administrators can now find users by their identifiers with fuzzy search - this feature is still in preview.</li>
<li>Importing HMAC-hashed passwords is now possible.</li>
<li>Webhooks can now update identity admin metadata.</li>
<li>New screens have been added to make account linking possible when a user has registered with a password and later tries signing in with a social account sharing the same email.</li>
<li>Ability to revoke all sessions of a user when they change their password.</li>
<li>Webhooks are now available for all login, registration, and login methods, including Passkeys, TOTP, and others.</li>
<li>The login screen now longer shows “ID” for the primary identifier, but instead extracts the correct label - for example, “Email” or “Username” from the Identity Schema.</li>
<li>Login hints help users with guidance when they are unable to sign in (wrong social sign-in provider) but have an active account.</li>
<li>Phone numbers can now be verified via an SMS gateway like Twilio.</li>
<li>SMS OTP is now a two-factor option.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following features have been shipped exclusively to Ory Network for this version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/organizations" rel="nofollow">B2B SSO</a></strong>&nbsp;allows your customers to connect their LDAP / Okta / AD / … to your login. Ory selects the correct login provider based on the user’s email domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/api/eventual-consistency" rel="nofollow">Significantly better API performance</a></strong> for expensive API operations by specifying the desired consistency (<code>strong</code>,&nbsp;<code>eventual</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Finding users effortlessly</strong>&nbsp;with our new fuzzy search for credential identifiers available for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/listIdentities" rel="nofollow">Identity List API</a>.</li>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>Pagination parameters for the <code>list identities</code> CLI command have changed from arguments to flags <code>--page-token</code> and <code>page-size</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="- kratos list identities 1 100
+ kratos list identities --page-size 100 --page-token ..."><pre><code>- kratos list identities 1 100
+ kratos list identities --page-size 100 --page-token ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>Furthermore, the JSON / JSON pretty output of <code>list identities</code> has changed:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="-[
-  { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;...&quot; },
-  { /* ... */ },
-  // ...
-]
+{
+  &quot;identities&quot;: [

+  &quot;next_page_token&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
+}"><pre><span><span>-</span>[</span>

<p>Omit irrelevant OIDC providers in forced refresh login flows (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/3608" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/pull/3608/hovercard">#3608</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/912dccdf04a550604c5bfeb53ccf79c5f1133ef2">912dccd</a>):</p>
<p>Whenever an user is asked to reauthenticate (e.g. because they wish to execute settings flow touching their credentials and their session is no longer privileged) they are asked to provide their credentials again. The forced-refresh login flow generated for such cases already excludes some strategies that are enabled in Kratos but cannot be used to authenticate as current identity, and for example the form presented to the user will not have a password field if the identity does not have a password credential.</p>
<p>This, however, does not currently apply to OIDC providers; the user will always see the full set even if some of them can't be used to sign in as current identity. This change causes forced refresh login flows to also omit irrelevant OIDC providers in generated form in order to avoid confunding the user about which strategies/providers are valid and can actually be used to reauthenticate.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add ability to convert session to JWT when calling whoami (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/3472" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/pull/3472/hovercard">#3472</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/57b7bb846c8072f786ea6b80cd688fdee75805da">57b7bb8</a>), closes <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2487" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/issues/2487/hovercard">#2487</a>:</p>
<p>This patch adds a query parameter <code>tokenize_as</code> to <code>/session/whoami</code> which encodes the session to a JWT. It is possible to customize the JWT claims by using a JsonNet template, and furthermore change the expiry of the token.</p>
<p>The tokenize feature supports multiple templates, which makes it easy to use the resulting JWT in a variety of use cases.</p>

<p>This PR adds the ability to search for sub-strings and similar strings in credential identifiers.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>postgres</strong> and <strong>CRDB</strong> migrations create special indexes useful for this feature. To use <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/online-schema-changes" rel="nofollow">online schema changes</a> with cockroach, we recommend to manually copy the index definition and run it before applying migrations. The migration will then be a no-op.</p>
<p>If you run on <strong>mysql</strong> (or <strong>sqlite</strong>), no special index is created. If desired, you can create such an index manually, and it would be highly appreciated if you could contribute its definition.</p>
<p>This feature is a preview and will change in behavior! Similarity search is not expected to return deterministic results but are useful for humans.</p>

<p>Adds the ability to complete the recovery flow properly on API flows. This PR also streamlines the behavior for SPA flows to not return 422 errors anymore. To enable this new behavior, set the features.use_continue_with_transitions flag in the config to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Currently, the Kratos system does not automatically log out or invalidate other active sessions when a user changes their password. This poses a significant security risk as it allows potentially unauthorized individuals to maintain access to the account even after the password has been updated.</p>

<p>When user tries to login with OIDC for the first time but has already registered before with email/password a credentials identifier conflict may be detected by Kratos. In this case user needs to login with email/password first and then link OIDC credentials on a settings screen.<br>
This PR simplifies UX and allows user to link OIDC credentials to existing account right in the login flow, without<br>
switching to settings flow.</p>

                    <p>At long last, we bring you the final development version before <span>GIMP</span> 3! While the release of 2.99.18 is a bit behind <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/10373#timeline">our intended schedule</a>, there are a number of new features and improvements that we’re very excited to share with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>⚠️ ☢️ <br>
We remind that a <em>development version</em> means that this is a release to show
work-in-progress but also give an opportunity to the community to detect issues
early and report issues. In other word, this is an <strong>unstable</strong> version and we
do not recommend to use it in production. Use it because you want to help <span>GIMP</span>
improve by <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues">reporting bugs</a>.</p>
<p>This version 2.99.18 in particular might be one of the most unstable releases in
the 2.99 series because of the space invasion. It is expected and normal.<br>

<h2 id="color-space-invasion">(Color) Space Invasion<a href="#color-space-invasion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have been working very hard on the Space Invasion project, which is&nbsp;— as <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/08/19/gimp-2-10-6-released/#prepare-for-the-space-invasion">you might
recall</a>&nbsp;—
our codename for the project of making <span>GIMP</span> more <em>correct</em> regarding&nbsp;colors.</p>
<p>Lately we have been porting older internal color structures (<code>GimpRGB</code>,
<code>GimpCMYK</code>, <code>GimpHSV</code>…) which we used to carry color information to
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/api/gegl/class.Color.html"><code>GeglColor</code></a>. This
generic object can contain any color data regardless of color model, precision
or space supported by <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a>, our pixel encoding&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>What it means for color correctness in particular is that we will now do color
conversion only when needed (last-second conversion) and therefore won’t lose
information when it could have been avoided. For instance, say you color-pick
color from an image: if we were to convert to an intermediate format, before
using it on a second image (which may or may not be in another color format),
we’d do 2 conversions. Which means more possibility of precision loss. The issue
is even more flagrant if the input and output formats are the same (i.e. no
conversion should happen at all). And this will be even more a problem when we
will have core <span>CMYK</span> backend (we really want to avoid doing a round-trip to an
intermediate format with <span>CMYK</span>, which doesn’t have bijective conversion with most
other color models, even when working unbounded and ignoring precision&nbsp;issues).</p>
<p>We are also slowly moving stored data to this generic color object. In
particular it means that color palettes will be able to contain <span>CMYK</span> colors,
<span>CIELAB</span> colors or in any other supported model (and not only these colors after a
conversion to unbounded&nbsp;sRGB).</p>
<p>A consequence for code maintainance is that it makes it a lot easier to handle
color conversions within our codebase, now that the structure embeds both the
data and its “meaning”. It makes color handling a lot less bug-prone compared to
when we had to keep track of both information as separate&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Lastly we are working toward showing color space information in various parts of
the interface, when relevant, such as when displaying or choosing <span>RGB</span>, <span>CMYK</span>, <span>HSL</span>
or <span>HSV</span> data.
Values in these color models without the associated color space are
near-meaningless. Interface displaying values in <code>RGB</code> without further
information are a remnant of the past when it mostly meant sRGB. This is
clearly not true anymore in modern graphic work and the interface should make
this&nbsp;clear.</p>
<p>The below video shows some of this interface work where <span>RGB</span>, <span>HSV</span> or <span>CMYK</span> models
for instance are always displaying the color space the values are in (which very
often means the name of the <span>ICC</span> profile). This is being done in the color picker
tool, color samples, <span>FG</span>/<span>BG</span> Color dockable, “<em>Change Foreground/Background Color</em>”
dialog and in more&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>Not only this, but when people select a soft-proofing profile and activate
soft-proofing (e.g. through the nice new simulation toggle which <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/08/27/gimp-2-99-12-released/#simulation-toggle-in-the-status-bar">was added in <span>GIMP</span>
2.99.12</a>),
we will also show out-of-gamut area not only within the image’s color space, but
also the soft-proof&nbsp;space.</p>

<p><strong>Very important warning</strong>: this is once again a huge port in our codebase,
which impacted litterally thousands of lines of code. This work is unfinished
though it will have to be finished before the first release candidate. Therefore
unstabilities or bugs are to be expected in this update so if you encounter any
issue, we recommend to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues">report
them</a>.</p>
<h2 id="improved-color-algorithms">Improved Color Algorithms<a href="#improved-color-algorithms" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Øyvind Kolås improved a few internal&nbsp;algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achromatic pixels in the Hue-Saturation tool are now special-cased so that
  grayscale pixels (saturation of 0) are only changed by the master adjustment,
  not by the red&nbsp;adjustment.</li>
<li>Grayscale gradients are now kept achromatic even with “Dithering” checked in
  the Gradient&nbsp;tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the <a href="#color-space-invasion">space invasion</a> project goes on, getting things
consistent is getting easier in various color-related algorithms, hence enabling
us to discover issues quickly and fix&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="initial-non-destructive-editing">Initial Non-Destructive Editing<a href="#initial-non-destructive-editing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One area we’re “ahead of schedule” on is the much-requested non-destructive editing! The foundation for these features has been laid by many developers over many years, since the introduction of <span>GEGL</span> into <span>GIMP</span>. Originally planned for the 3.2 roadmap, an initial implementation was made as a continuation of a Google Summer of Code project. If you are not familiar with the term, “non-destructive editing” means that filter effects such as Blur are kept separate from the layer’s pixels. This means that if later on you want to change a setting, rearrange, or even remove the filter, you can easily do so without affecting the rest of the image. Until now, <span>GIMP</span> has followed a destructive editing workflow where effects were immediately merged down onto the layer, so this is a major&nbsp;change!</p>
<p>Any <span>GEGL</span> operation that has a <span>GUI</span> is now applied to layers non-destructively (Non-destructive effects for layer masks and channels are planned for future updates.). This includes third-party <span>GEGL</span> plug-ins and custom operations created with our <span>GEGL</span> Graph tool. These effects can be saved and loaded in <code>.xcf</code> project files, although not all <span>GEGL</span> properties are supported in the current&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>Once a filter has been applied, you can interact with it further by clicking the filter icon in the layers dockable. This will open a pop-up that shows all filters currently applied to the layer. From here, you can toggle the filter’s visibility, edit the filter settings, re-order the filters, and delete individual effects. You can also merge down all filters to recreate a destructive&nbsp;workflow. </p>
<figure>

<em>Non-destructive layer effects - <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.18</em>

</figure>

<p>Note that this is only an early implementation, and much work remains to be done for a full-featured version of non-destructive editing. We will continue to refine the existing features for the 3.0 release based on user testing and feedback, and extend them further afterwards.
The interface itself is not how we envision this feature ideally and a first
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/specifications/layer-effects-ui/">specification draft was layed out</a>
for a much more integrated&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<p>The below screenshot is a mockup from this first specification which would show
layer effects within the main layer list, sharing the same “eye” and “lock”
buttons, but also with their own easily editable&nbsp;mask:</p>

<p>Nevertheless creating this new interface will be its own challenge so we decided
to delay it to after <span>GIMP</span> 3 release and to propose this early implementation at&nbsp;first.</p>

<h2 id="font-handling-improvements">Font Handling Improvements<a href="#font-handling-improvements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Idriss Fekir, another GSoC 2023 student, has been working with long-time developer Liam Quinn to improve how <span>GIMP</span> handles fonts. A lot of this work was internal to improve <span>GIMP</span>’s ability to handle  future font and text updates. Some of the more visible changes&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>GIMP</span> no longer relies on font names being unique to distinguish between them. This means it won’t append “#1”, “#2” and so on but instead keep the original names in the font selection list. Despite the apparent name clash, both identically named font will now work&nbsp;properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>GIMP</span> can now load fonts using custom styles (bypassing Pango which is unable
  to load&nbsp;them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can now load more types of fonts than before. In cases where we don’t support a font yet (or the font is non-existent), we can better detect this and fall back to a default font. This also improves support when loading an .xcf file created on another computer to different fonts&nbsp;available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, we force the Pango backend to always use anti-aliasing. This improves the readability of menu text on that operating system, especially with a dark&nbsp;theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span>XCF</span>-saving code now stores font information much more accurately which
  helps to avoid loading the wrong font when reopening some <span>XCF</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignment of text in text layers for <span>RTL</span> languages is now more consistent with
  how it works in other software (such as LibreOffice or&nbsp;Scribus).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are a lot less flashy relatively to some of the other features and
therefore may feel less important, yet they are actually the foundation work on
making text handling a lot more reliable in <span>GIMP</span>. We are envisionning a future
where text editing will be simpler while much more powerful and featureful (in
particular OpenType features are some of the big improvements we hope to get&nbsp;eventually).</p>
<h2 id="auto-expanding-layers">Auto-Expanding Layers<a href="#auto-expanding-layers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The third GSoC project last summer by student Shubham Daule brought a long requested feature – auto-expanding layers! Brush tools now have an additional “Expand Layers” option. When checked, painting past the layer boundaries will cause them to automatically expand so you don’t have to manage the layer size yourself. If you want to expand the layer beyond the current size of the canvas, you’ll need to also check the “Show All” option in the View&nbsp;menu.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<em>Auto-expanding layers - <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.18</em>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Expand Layers option also has additional settings when selected. You can decide how much you want the layer boundaries to expand by whenever the brush reaches them. There are also options to specify how the new areas of the layer and layer mask should be filled in when&nbsp;expanded.</p>
<h2 id="new-snapping-options">New Snapping Options<a href="#new-snapping-options" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>New contributor mr. fantastic developed two new options for aligning layers on the canvas. With “Snap to Bounding Boxes” enabled, dynamic guides will now show when the layer you are moving is aligned with the center or sides of others. The active layer will also snap to those boundaries to assist you with arranging them properly. The second option, “Snap to Equidistance”, allows you to snap between three layers that are equidistant from each&nbsp;other.</p>
<figure>

<h2 id="themes">Themes<a href="#themes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>We continued to improve the user interface and style for this release. One of the biggest improvements was dealing with “system theme leaks”. There are styles that were not specifically defined in our themes, thus allowing different systems to supply their own (often conflicting) styles. With the help and feedback of several contributors and users, we’ve made a lot of progress in defining those styles so that everyone has a consistent&nbsp;experience!</p>
<p>Recently Jehan worked on re-organizing and simplifying our theme system. In past development versions we had five different themes: Default, Gray, System, Darker, and Compact (Each with light and dark options). These have been simplified into the System theme and a single Default theme with three possible states – light, dark, and gray. Similarly, our four separate icon themes were condensed into the Legacy set and a Default with Color and Symbolic options. We think these changes will reduce user confusion and make it easier for them to find their preferred interface&nbsp;appearance.</p>
<p>In addition, on Windows the main titlebar (and most dialog title bars) now adjust to light or dark mode depending on the selected&nbsp;theme. </p>
<h2 id="welcome-dialog">Welcome Dialog<a href="#welcome-dialog" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Welcome Dialog has been expanded to provide quick access to a number of useful features and options. There are now four new&nbsp;sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personalize: There are several customization options that require you to dig through the Preference Dialog to change. Now from this page you can easily change the color and icon themes, the user interface language and font size, and <span>OS</span>-specific&nbsp;settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create: This page shows your eight most recently opened images and allows you to quickly reopen them. There are also buttons to create a new image or load an existing one. As with other programs, you can set this screen to automatically appear when <span>GIMP</span> starts for immediate access to these&nbsp;features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute: We consolidated some of the many ways you can be involved in <span>GIMP</span>’s development on this page. There are direct links to report bugs, write code, assist with translation or donate&nbsp;financially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release Notes: Originally these were shown on the lower half of the Welcome page. Now we have a full tab dedicated to them for easier&nbsp;reading.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-formats">File Formats<a href="#file-formats" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As in other releases, we have made improvements to existing file formats and added import and export support for some new&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h3 id="dds"><span>DDS</span><a href="#dds" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new contributor Stayd has been working with developer Jacob Boerema to make many improvements to the <span>DDS</span> plug-in. As a start, the import functions have been written to be simpler and easier to extend in the future. Some of the other additional updates&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loading 16 and 32 bits per channel <span>RGBA</span> <span>DDS</span> images is now&nbsp;possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mvps.org/directx/articles/catmull/">Catmull-Rom</a> cubic filter has been added for mipmap generation, and all mipmap generation calculations are performed at 32-bit&nbsp;precision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>DDS</span> images in the <span>R8G8</span>, R16, and <span>R16G16</span> formats can now be loaded as&nbsp;well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An option to flip <span>DDS</span> images vertical on import was added to mirror the existing export option, as some game images store their data this&nbsp;way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gif"><span>GIF</span><a href="#gif" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the past, overwriting a <span>GIF</span> rather than exporting would always convert it into a single frame image. Now we check to see if the <span>GIF</span> is an animation on load, so it will stay that way when&nbsp;overwritten.</p>
<h3 id="heif-and-jpeg-xl"><span>HEIF</span> and <span>JPEG</span>-<span>XL</span><a href="#heif-and-jpeg-xl" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Both plug-ins now use their respective libraries (<a href="https://github.com/strukturag/libheif">libheif</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl">libjxl</a>) to load metadata. As a result, we have removed our custom code to interpret the image orientation and rely on the information supplied from the library&nbsp;instead.</p>
<h3 id="openexr">OpenEXR<a href="#openexr" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenEXR allows for channels to have custom names besides the color type. In these cases we now treat any single channel image with an unconventional name as grayscale. On import, we also display a notification so that users are aware of the&nbsp;conversion.</p>
<h3 id="pdf"><span>PDF</span><a href="#pdf" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The “Layers as Pages” export option now works even if there is only a single layer group. Previously this option was not available, as the plug-in only checked if there was more than one “layer” without considering if it was a layer group with multiple&nbsp;sub-layers.</p>
<h3 id="png"><span>PNG</span><a href="#png" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Safe-to-copy <span>PNG</span> chunks are now preserved on import and included in the exported image. Additionally, an often-reported issue with exporting transparent indexed PNGs has been fixed. Now the exported indexed colors should be displayed&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<h3 id="psd"><span>PSD</span><a href="#psd" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jacob Boerema continued his work to improve the <span>PSD</span> plug-in. In addition to bug fixes such as correcting the layer order on import, he also clarified the export warning on layer mode compatibility between <span>GIMP</span> and&nbsp;Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="psp"><span>PSP</span><a href="#psp" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Paintshop Pro plug-in now supports importing more features from the project file, such as the <span>ICC</span> color profile, guides, grids, and the active selection from when the file was saved. The <span>ZDI</span>-<span>CAN</span>-22096 and <span>ZDI</span>-<span>CAN</span>-22097 security vulnerabilities were also patched in this&nbsp;release.</p>
<h3 id="new-image-format-supports-farbfeld-esm-software-pix-hej2">New image format supports: Farbfeld, Esm Software <span>PIX</span>, <span>HEJ2</span><a href="#new-image-format-supports-farbfeld-esm-software-pix-hej2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>We recently added import and export support for <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/farbfeld/">Farbfeld</a>, an sRGB image format intended to be easy to parse, pipe, and compress&nbsp;externally.</p>
<p>We also added import only support for the following new file&nbsp;formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Esm_Software_PIX">Esm Software <span>PIX</span></a>: A modified <span>JPEG</span> format used exclusively by the Esm Software company to store their customized images. This was implemented in response to a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/10058">bug report</a> that confused this format with our existing <a href="http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Alias_PIX">Alias <span>PIX</span></a> image&nbsp;support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format#JPEG_compression_formats_in_HEIF_files"><span>HEJ2</span></a>: An addition to our existing <span>HEIF</span> plug-in by contributor Daniel Novomeský which allows importing <span>JPEG</span> 2000 compressed&nbsp;images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-palette-format-support-swatchbooker">New palette format support: Swatchbooker<a href="#new-palette-format-support-swatchbooker" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.selapa.net/swatchbooker/">Swatchbooker</a> is a free/libre open source software that creates and converts color palettes in a variety of formats. While the software itself has not been updated in many years, its custom palette format .sbz is the most comprehensive of all the ones we currently support. Among its many features are allowing multiple color model definitions per palette entry, localizable names and descriptions, and support for per-entry <span>ICC</span> color&nbsp;profiles. </p>
<p>While working on our import support, we were able to contribute information that led to <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=474583">a bug fix</a> in Krita’s support for Swatchbooker.  It’s always great when projects can work together and help each&nbsp;other!</p>
<h2 id="wayland-tablet-pad-interactions">Wayland Tablet Pad Interactions<a href="#wayland-tablet-pad-interactions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Long-time <span>GNOME</span> contributor Carlos Garnacho added support for interacting with <span>GIMP</span> via tablet pads. When a tablet is plugged in, you can now assign different actions to the tablet controls via the “Input Device” dialog under the Edit&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>This work also involved <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/merge_requests/6095">porting features</a> to <span>GTK</span> 3, the <span>GUI</span> framework that <span>GIMP</span> is built on. Note that this feature is currently only supported on&nbsp;Wayland.</p>
<h2 id="api-updates"><span>API</span> Updates<a href="#api-updates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Application Programming Interface, for plug-in makers, is steadily being
reworked as part of the <span>GIMP</span> 3 overhaul. Part of it is that when colors are
involved, we are moving the <span>API</span> to use <code>GeglColor</code> as part of the more general
<a href="#color-space-invasion">Space Invasion project</a>. Yet it’s only a small part of
the whole <span>API</span>&nbsp;improvements.</p>
<p>We are also moving towards more classes to represent the various resources
managed by <span>GIMP</span> (brushes, fonts, patterns, etc.) instead of only representing
these by names (which was a historical limitation whereas it is absolutely
possible for 2 resource makers to choose the same name and the fact is that we
see such cases in the wild — for instance 2 fonts independently created may have
the same&nbsp;name).</p>
<p>Another big move is replacing the <code>GimpValueArray</code> representing the ordered
arguments of a plug-in procedure by a <code>GimpProcedureConfig</code> which contains
arguments by name instead of by order. This allows much more semantic usage of
plug-in procedures (especially when they have long list of arguments) but also
will make it easier to enhance plug-ins in the future, with new or reordered
arguments without creating new procedures because the order and number arguments
matter a lot less. It means that adding new arguments in the future won’t break
existing scripts depending on past versions of these plug-ins anymore (plug-in
writers will still have to choose appropriate defaults for the new arguments in
order for this to be true, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>In parallel, we continue to improve the ability of automatic <span>GUI</span> creation given
to plug-ins, making creating dialogs more easy than ever. This includes (among
many other enhancements) a new type of procedure argument named <code>GimpChoice</code>
which is a string list of choices which can be displayed to creators as
drop-down list widgets in your plug-in&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>We are planning to write and release tutorial for plug-in writers in the
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/resource/">Resource Development</a> section of our
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/">developer website</a> in the same time as <span>GIMP</span> 3
release, or not long&nbsp;after.</p>
<h2 id="gegl-and-babl"><span>GEGL</span> and babl<a href="#gegl-and-babl" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This release of <span>GIMP</span> is accompanied by new releases of <a href="https://gegl.org/"><span>GEGL</span></a> and <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a>, both of which assist with the color space invasion&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>babl 0.1.108 brings a new <code>babl_space_is_rgb</code> function to help us directly confirm a color space is <span>RGB</span> (rather than doing multiple tests to see if it’s not <span>CMYK</span> or grayscale). There were also several improvements to the build process and to the babl command-line interface&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p><span>GEGL</span> 0.4.48 provides several updates to the <code>GeglColor</code> object which now supports much of <span>GIMP</span>’s color operation. Specific improvements include being able to directly get and set <span>CMYK</span> color values, as well as assigning the color space when setting <span>RGB</span>(A)&nbsp;colors.</p>
<p>A crash in the existing <code>gegl:voroni</code> filter was fixed, and a long-standing bug with the <code>gegl:dropshadow</code> filter which prevented the effect from shrinking was corrected&nbsp;too. </p>
<p>Last but not least, a new <code>gegl:shuffle-search</code> filter was added to the workshop. It shuffles neighboring pixels to create a more optimized dithering&nbsp;effect.</p>

<p>Access rights to the <code>git</code> repository were recently given to Bruno Lopes (who has been very active improving our build process and Windows&nbsp;packaging).</p>
<p>Several long term or recent developers or packagers who started to contribute to
the new developer website were also given access to the associated <code>git</code>
repository.</p>
<p>More contributors are now actively participating to testing releases and
packaging, and this is the first news for years which Jehan has not written
nearly entirely! Thanks a lot to Alx Sa (a.k.a. Nikc or CmykStudent) for taking
up on collaborative news&nbsp;writing!</p>
<p>Clearly we are consolidating day after day a solid core team of contributors and
this shows in our release process having more and more feedback at each&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>We are also particularly happy and proud that the 4 GSoC projects we had, since
we started again subscribing to this mentoring program, were all successful and
ended up being merged to the main code branch within half a year at most after
the internship&nbsp;end.</p>

<p>Since our <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2023/08/13/experimental-windows-arm-installer/">news for an experimental build on Windows for <span>ARM</span> 64-bit
architecture</a>,
we received help from Hernan Martinez, well known contributor in the <span>MSYS2</span>
project, who hosted our first ever <span>CI</span> runner for Windows on Aarch64
architecture. Though this was only a temporary setup (literally a build machine
in someone’s living room) until we get a more stable situation, we are extremely
thankful to Hernan who helped us make our second step on this platform (the
first step was done by Jernej, who made our first experimental installer), make
sure our automatic build process worked there and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Since then, we got the stabler situation: Arm Ltd. themselves stepped up and
contributed officially 3 runners for our Continuous Integration process in
Gitlab! Arm Ltd. also sponsored a Windows devkit to one of our&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>While we still do consider this build experimental, because of lack of testing
and because only 2 contributors have a machine able to run it right now, the
biggest blocker got removed and we are happy to announce that our universal
Windows installer for <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.18 contains <span>GIMP</span> for all 3 platforms (x86 32 and

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we have now entered a feature freeze, our focus has shifted to bug-fixing, clean-up, and preparing for the first 3.0 release&nbsp;candidate.</p>
<p>We indeed think that this should be the last development release since no new
feature will be introduced from now on, at least <span>GUI</span> features (the <span>API</span> is still
evolving until the first release candidate). So what you see now is basically
what you should get in <span>GIMP</span> 3.0.0,&nbsp;feature-wise.</p>
<p>This is why we released this version even though we know it is quite unstable.
Now is the time for last minute comments! Also it’s the moment to report and fix
bugs like there is no tomorrow. We hope to be able to deliver a <abbr title="Release Candidate"><span>RC</span></abbr>1 soon and it should be as bugless as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Our current expectation is to be able to release <span>GIMP</span> for the upcoming <a href="https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2024/">Libre
Graphics Meeting</a> in May 9-12. To be
fair, this is not an easy goal and therefore we are not sure if we can make it.
What is sure is that even if we did not manage this on time, it should not
happen too long after.
In particular we won’t release just because we set a <em>deadline</em>. We want to
provide the best experience, which means that if we discover last minute blocker
bugs, we will delay the release until they are&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>Don’t forget you can <a href="https://www.gimp.org/donating/">donate and personally fund <span>GIMP</span>
developers</a>, as a way to give back and
<strong>accelerate the development of <span>GIMP</span></strong>.
Community commitment helps the project to grow stronger!&nbsp;💪🥳</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="A Peek at Intel’s Future Foundry Tech" data-elid="2667324813" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-18a" data-authors="Samuel K. Moore" data-page-title="A Peek at Intel’s Future Foundry Tech - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>In an exclusive interview</strong> ahead of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ifs-direct-connect.html" target="_blank">an invite-only event today</a> in San Jose, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> outlined new chip technologies it will offer its foundry customers by sharing a glimpse into its future data-center processors. The advances include more dense logic and a 16-fold increase in the connectivity within <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-3d-stacking-intel-graphcore" target="_self">3D-stacked</a> chips, and they will be among the first top-end technologies the company has ever shared with chip architects from other companies.  </p><p>The new technologies will arrive at the culmination of a years-long transformation for Intel. The processor maker is moving from being a company that produces only its own chips to becoming a foundry, making chips for others and considering its own product teams as just another customer. The San Jose event, IFS Direct Connect, is meant as a sort of coming-out party for the new business model. </p><p>Internally, Intel plans to use the combination of technologies in a server CPU code-named Clearwater Forest. The company considers the product, a system-on-a-chip with hundreds of billions of transistors, an example of what other customers of its foundry business will be able to achieve. </p><p>“Our objective is to get the compute to the best performance per watt we can achieve” from Clearwater Forest, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-fetzer-1856664/" target="_blank">Eric Fetzer,</a> director of data center technology and pathfinding at Intel. That means using the company’s most advanced fabrication technology available, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-says-its-manufacturing-tech-will-lead-the-world-by-2025" target="_self">Intel 18A</a>. </p><p>3D stacking “improves the latency between compute and memory by shortening the hops, while at the same time enabling a larger cache”  <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/" target="_blank">—Pushkar Ranade</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/"></a></strong></p><p>“However, if we apply that technology throughout the entire system, you run into other potential problems,” he added. “Certain parts of the system don’t necessarily scale as well as others. Logic typically scales generation to generation very well with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/moore-s-law" target="_self">Moore’s Law</a>.” But other features do not. SRAM, a CPU’s cache memory, has been lagging logic, for example. And the I/O circuits that connect a processor to the rest of a computer are even further behind. </p><p>Faced with these realities, as all makers of leading-edge processors are now, Intel broke Clearwater Forest’s system down into its core functions, chose the best-fit technology to build each, and stitched them back together using a suite of new technical tricks. The result is a CPU architecture capable of scaling to as many as 300 billion transistors. </p><p>In Clearwater Forest, billions of transistors are divided among three different types of silicon ICs, called dies or chiplets, interconnected and packaged together. The heart of the system is as many as 12 processor-core chiplets built using the Intel 18A process. These chiplets are 3D-stacked atop three “base dies” built using Intel 3, the process that makes compute cores for the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-future-generation-xeon.html#gs.4xfdw0" target="_blank">Sierra Forest CPU</a>, due out this year. Housed on the base die will be the CPU’s main cache memory, voltage regulators, and internal network. “The stacking improves the latency between compute and memory by shortening the hops, while at the same time enabling a larger cache,” says senior principal engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/" target="_blank">Pushkar Ranade</a>.  </p><p>Finally, the CPU’s I/O system will be on two dies built using Intel 7, which in 2025 will be trailing the company’s most advanced process by a full four generations. In fact, the chiplets are basically the same as those going into the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-future-generation-xeon.html#gs.4s66fg" target="_blank">Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids</a> CPUs, lessening the development expense.  </p><p>Here’s a look at the new technologies involved and what they offer: </p><h2>3D Hybrid Bonding </h2><p><img alt="3D rendering of stacks of slabs with silver balls between them. The balls are larger at the bottom and smaller at the top." data-rm-shortcode-id="31d9eeb623fc473f7c2d759cae93d31a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514685&amp;width=980" height="930" id="4de51" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514685&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3D hybrid bonding links compute dies to base dies.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>Intel’s current chip-stacking interconnect technology, Foveros, links one die to another using a vastly scaled-down version of how dies have long been connected to their packages: tiny “microbumps” of solder that are briefly melted to join the chips. This lets today’s version of Foveros, which is used in the Meteor Lake CPU, make one connection roughly every 36 micrometers. Clearwater Forest will use new technology, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqumhx7CgzQ" target="_blank">Foveros Direct</a> 3D, which departs from solder-based methods to bring a whopping 16-fold increase in the density of 3D connections. </p><p>Called “hybrid bonding,” it’s analogous to welding together the copper pads at the face of two chips. These pads are slightly recessed and surround by insulator. The insulator on one chip affixes to the other when they are pressed together. Then the stacked chips are heated, causing the copper to expand across the gap and bind together to form a permanent link. Competitor TSMC uses a version of hybrid bonding in certain <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amd">AMD</a> CPUs to connect extra cache memory to processor-core chiplets and, in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300" target="_self">AMD’s newest GPU</a>, to link compute chiplets to the system’s base die. </p><p>“The hybrid bond interconnects enable a substantial increase in density” of connections, says Fetzer. “That density is very important for the server market, particularly because the density drives a very low picojoule-per-bit communication.” The energy involved in data crossing from one silicon die to another can easily consume a big chunk of a product’s power budget if the per-bit energy cost is too high. Foveros Direct 3D brings that cost down below 0.05 picojoules per bit, which puts it on the same scale as the energy needed to move bits around <em>within</em> a silicon die. </p><p>A lot of that energy savings comes from the data traversing less copper. Say you wanted to connect a 512-wire bus on one die to the same-size bus on another so the two dies can share a coherent set of information. On each chip, these buses might be as narrow as 10–20 wires per micrometer. To get that from one die to the other using today’s 36-micrometer-pitch microbump tech would mean scattering those signals across several hundred square micrometers of silicon on one side and then gathering them across the same area on the other. Charging up all that extra copper and solder “quickly becomes both a latency and a large power problem,” says Fetzer. Hybrid bonding, in contrast, could do the bus-to-bus connection in the same area that a few microbumps would occupy. </p><p>As great as those benefits might be, making the switch to hybrid bonding isn’t easy. To forge hybrid bonds requires linking an already-diced silicon die to one that’s still attached to its wafer. Aligning all the connections properly means the chip must be diced to much greater tolerances than is needed for microbump technologies. Repair and recovery, too, require different technologies. Even the predominant way connections fail is different, says Fetzer. With microbumps, you are more likely to get a short from one bit of solder connecting to a neighbor. But with hybrid bonding, the danger is defects that lead to open connections. </p><h2>Backside power  </h2><p>One of the main distinctions the company is bringing to chipmaking this year with its Intel 20A process, the one that will precede Intel 18A, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">backside power delivery</a>. In processors today, all interconnects, whether they’re carrying power or data, are constructed on the “front side” of the chip, above the silicon substrate. Foveros and other 3D-chip-stacking tech require through-silicon vias, interconnects that drill down through the silicon to make connections from the other side. But back-side power delivery goes much further. It puts all of the power interconnects beneath the silicon, essentially sandwiching the layer containing the transistors between two sets of interconnects.  </p><p><img alt="A dark grey tower with jagged copper portions snaking up it." data-rm-shortcode-id="0124e5e0a6234c9157a5ee8b1a45af98" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-dark-grey-tower-with-jagged-copper-portions-snaking-up-it.jpg?id=51514219&amp;width=980" height="930" id="50b72" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-dark-grey-tower-with-jagged-copper-portions-snaking-up-it.jpg?id=51514219&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">PowerVia puts the silicon’s power supply network below, leaving more room for data-carrying interconnects above.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>This arrangement makes a difference because power interconnects and data interconnects require different features. Power interconnects need to be wide to reduce resistance, while data interconnects should be narrow so they can be densely packed. Intel is set to be the first chipmaker to introduce back-side power delivery in a commercial chip, later this year with the release of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-20a" target="_self">Arrow Lake CPU</a>. Data released last summer by Intel showed that back-side power alone delivered a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/backside-power-delivery" target="_self">6 percent performance boost</a>. </p><p>The Intel 18A process technology’s back-side-power-delivery network technology will be fundamentally the same as what’s found in Intel 20A chips. However, it’s being used to greater advantage in Clearwater Forest. The upcoming CPU includes what’s called an “on-die voltage regulator” within the base die. Having the voltage regulation close to the logic it drives means the logic can run faster. The shorter distances let the regulator respond to changes in the demand for current more quickly, while consuming less power. </p><p>Because the logic dies use back-side power delivery, the resistance of the connection between the voltage regulator and the dies logic is that much lower. “The power via technology along with the Foveros stacking gives us a really efficient way to hook it up,” says Fetzer. </p><h2>RibbonFET, the next generation </h2><p>In addition to back-side power, the chipmaker is switching to a different <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> architecture with the Intel 20A process: RibbonFET. A form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-nanosheet-transistor-is-the-next-and-maybe-last-step-in-moores-law" target="_self">nanosheet, or gate-all-around, transistor</a>, RibbonFET replaces the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>, CMOS’s workhorse transistor since 2011. With Intel 18A, Clearwater Forest’s logic dies will be made with a second generation of RibbonFET process. While the devices themselves aren’t very different from the ones that will emerge from Intel 20A, there’s more flexibility to the design of the devices, says Fetzer. </p><p><img alt="Three gold ribbons pass through a dark grey block." data-rm-shortcode-id="eaadde0b79b95338c69ef593c6e3e494" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-gold-ribbons-pass-through-a-dark-grey-block.jpg?id=51514179&amp;width=980" height="930" id="67a80" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-gold-ribbons-pass-through-a-dark-grey-block.jpg?id=51514179&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">RibbonFET is Intel’s take on nanowire transistors.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>“There’s a broader array of devices to support various foundry applications beyond just what was needed to enable a high-performance CPU,” which was what the Intel 20A process was designed for, he says.  </p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="Two vertical towers of dark grey blocks embedded in grainy light grey material." data-rm-shortcode-id="f607f773ae9ef386e914996e6d2d8089" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-vertical-towers-of-dark-grey-blocks-embedded-in-grainy-light-grey-material.jpg?id=51514235&amp;width=980" height="504" id="9f1a0" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-vertical-towers-of-dark-grey-blocks-embedded-in-grainy-light-grey-material.jpg?id=51514235&amp;width=980" width="595"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">RibbonFET’s nanowires can have different widths depending on the needs of a logic cell.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>Some of that variation stems from a degree of flexibility that was lost in the FinFET era. Before FinFETs arrived, transistors in the same process could be made in a range of widths, allowing a more-or-less continuous trade-off between performance—which came with higher current—and efficiency—which required better control over leakage current. Because the main part of a FinFET is a vertical silicon fin of a defined height and width, that trade-off now had to take the form of how many fins a device had. So, with two fins you could double current, but there was no way to increase it by 25 or 50 percent. </p><p>With nanosheet devices, the ability to vary transistor widths is back. “RibbonFET technology enables different sizes of ribbon within the same technology base,” says Fetzer. “When we go from Intel 20A to Intel 18A, we offer more flexibility in transistor sizing.” </p><p>That flexibility means that standard cells, basic logic blocks designers can use to build their systems, can contain transistors with different properties. And that enabled Intel to develop an “enhanced library” that includes standard cells that are smaller, better performing, or more efficient than those of the Intel 20A process. </p><h2>2nd generation EMIB<sup></sup><sup></sup></h2><p>In Clearwater Forest, the dies that handle input and output connect horizontally to the base dies—the ones with the cache memory and network—using the second generation of Intel’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution" target="_self">EMIB</a>. EMIB is a small piece of silicon containing a dense set of interconnects and microbumps designed to connect one die to another in the same plane. The silicon is embedded in the package itself to form a bridge between dies. </p><p><img alt="3D rendering of stacks of slabs with silver balls between them. The balls are larger at the bottom and smaller at the top." data-rm-shortcode-id="9c18ec8e445e6461058bab4b16ef4278" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514665&amp;width=980" height="930" id="cccac" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514665&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Dense 2D connections are formed by a small sliver of silicon called EMIB, which is embedded in the package substrate.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>The technology has been in commercial use in Intel CPUs since Sapphire Rapids was released in 2023. It’s meant as a less costly alternative to putting all the dies on a silicon interposer, a slice of silicon patterned with interconnects that is large enough for all of the system’s dies to sit on. Apart from the cost of the material, sili<sup></sup>con interposers can be expensive to build, because they are usually several times larger than what standard silicon processes are designed to make. </p><p>The second generation of EMIB debuts this year with the Granite Rapids CPU, and it involves shrinking the pitch of microbump connections from 55 micrometers to 45 micrometers as well as boosting the density of the wires. The main challenge with such connections is that the package and the silicon expand at different rates when they heat up. This phenomenon could lead to warpage that breaks connections. </p><p>What’s more, in the case of Clearwater Forest “there were also some unique challenges, because we’re connecting EMIB on a regular die to EMIB on a Foveros Direct 3D base die and a stack,” says Fetzer. This situation, recently rechristened EMIB 3.5 technology (formerly called co-EMIB), requires special steps to ensure that the stresses and strains involved are compatible with the silicon in the Foveros stack, which is thinner than ordinary chips, he says. </p><p>For more, see <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2024-02/intel-tech-clearwater-wp.pdf" target="_blank">Intel’s whitepaper</a> on their foundry tech. <br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>In the months after the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 in late 2019 a patient-reported syndrome termed Long COVID began to come to the fore as an enduring manifestation of acute infection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Long COVID has up to 200 reported symptoms to date, but in general patients report lingering symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, problems with memory and thinking and joint/muscle pain.&nbsp; While the vast majority of people suffering from COVID-19 make a full recovery, any of these symptoms that linger for more than 12 weeks post infection can be considered Long COVID.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Long COVID has now become a major public health issue since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. While international incidence rates vary, it is estimated to affect up to 10% of patients infected with the SARS-CoV2 virus. Of these patients suffering from Long-COVID, just under 50% of them report some form of lingering neurological effect such as cognitive decline, fatigue and brain fog.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the findings reported by the Trinity team in the top international journal <strong>Nature Neuroscience</strong>&nbsp;showed that there was disruption to the integrity of the blood vessels in the brains of patients suffering from Long COVID and brain fog. This blood vessel “leakiness” was able to objectively distinguish those patients with brain fog and cognitive decline compared to patients suffering from Long-COVID but not with brain fog.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The team led by scientists at the Smurfit Institute of Genetics in Trinity’s School of Genetics and Microbiology and neurologists in the School of Medicine have also uncovered a novel form of MRI scan that shows how Long-COVID can affect the human brain’s delicate network of blood vessels. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>“For the first time, we have been able to show that leaky blood vessels in the human brain, in tandem with a hyperactive immune system may be the key drivers of brain fog associated with Long COVID. This is critically important, as understanding the underlying cause of these conditions will allow us to develop targeted therapies for patients in the future,”</em>&nbsp;said </span><span><strong>Prof. Matthew Campbell, Professor in Genetics and Head of Genetics at Trinity, and Principal Investigator at FutureNeuro.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>

Increased “leakiness” of the blood vessels is seen (here in the temporal lobe region of the brain) in those patients with brain fog (indicated by red signal).</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This project was initiated by a rapid response grant funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and involved recruiting patients suffering from the effects of Long-COVID as well as patients who were hospitalised in St James’ Hospital.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Undertaking this complicated clinical research study at a time of national crisis and when our hospital system was under severe pressure is a testament to the skill and resource of our medical trainees and staff. The findings will now likely change the landscape of how we understand and treat post-viral neurological conditions. It also confirms that the neurological symptoms of Long Covid are measurable with real and demonstrable metabolic and vascular changes in the brain,”</em></span><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span><span>said </span><span><strong>Prof. Colin Doherty, Professor of Neurology and Head of the School of Medicine at Trinity, and Principal Investigator at FutureNeuro.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Moving beyond COVID-19</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In recent years, it has become apparent that many neurological conditions such as Multiple sclerosis (MS) likely have a viral infection as the initiating event that triggers the pathology.&nbsp;However, proving that direct link has always been challenging.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Prof. Campbell </strong>added: <em>“Here, the team at Trinity was able to prove that every patient that developed Long-COVID had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection, because Ireland required every documented case to be diagnosed using the more accurate PCR-based methods. The concept that many other viral infections that lead to post-viral syndromes might drive blood vessel leakage in the brain is potentially game changing and is under active investigation by the team.”</em>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Dr Chris Greene, Postdoctoral research fellow and first author of the study</strong>, added: <em>“Our findings have now set the stage for further studies examining the molecular events that lead to post-viral fatigue and brain fog. Without doubt, similar mechanisms are at play across many disparate types of viral infection and we are now tantalisingly close to understanding how and why they cause neurological dysfunction in patients.” </em>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The research was supported by Science Foundation Ireland, the European Research Council and FutureNeuro, the SFI Centre for rare and chronic neurological, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My child is 3 years old. I was looking for a game that we could play together and would be her first programming-like activity. I wasn’t keen to teach her anything specifically but rather offer her the option to explore what coding or algorithmic thinking tasted like (similarly when you would give your child a sheet of paper, brush, and paint to play with). I evaluated some computer game options but I wished to find screen-free, <em>unplugged</em> alternatives, especially since she has not been used to interact with a computer or screen at all.</p><figure><img src="https://20y.hu/~slink/content/xylophone-duplo-closeup.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>A screenless coding activity for kids 3+</figcaption></figure><p>There are many interesting <a href="https://www.primotoys.com/shop/cubetto-playset/">screenless coding robots</a> out there too, but I was imagining building something from the materials we had at home instead of purchasing a separate toy. Then I stumbled upon the ideas of <a href="https://researchparent.com/coding-a-lego-maze/">coding a Lego maze</a> and <a href="https://teachyourkidscode.com/coding-unplugged-with-a-deck-of-cards/">the coding card game</a> which gave me the idea for inventing the <em>xylophone maze</em>.</p><h2 id="help-papa-find-her-daughter">Help papa find her daughter</h2><p>You’ll build a Lego Duplo maze, place papa and her daughter at the far ends, and help papa find her daughter by following the instructions played on the xylophone.</p><p>The game is for a minimum of 2 players, can be played from quite an early age (2-3), and can be tweaked to make it challenging for older kids, even adults, too.</p><p>All you need is a xylophone with colored bars, a bunch of Duplo blocks, a board and two figures. The colors of the Duplo blocks need to match the colors of the xylophone bars.</p><figure><img src="https://20y.hu/~slink/content/xylophone-duplo-birdeye.jpg" alt="Play the xylophone to move the Lego figure"><figcaption>Play the xylophone to move the Lego figure</figcaption></figure><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><ul><li>One player needs to take the role of the robot.

The robot then moves to one of the neighbouring blocks that have the matching color. The programmer must be careful to play a note that is a valid option. The robot can only move one block at a time.</li><li>Once papa reaches her daughter, players can switch roles.</li></ul><p>The difficulty can be easily adjusted to the needs and interests of the players. Here are some ideas:</p><ul><li>The xylophone bar can be played several times to help the robot figure out which block comes next.</li><li>You can add roadblocks and Duplo blocks with colors that don’t exist on the xylophone to create detours.</li><li>You can create a song (“Twinkle twinkle”) by purposefully placing the blocks for the way out.</li><li>The robot must not look at what color bar was hit but rather carefully listen to the sound only.</li><li>There can be additional robot players introduced. Not all moves will make sense to both of them, let’s see who reaches the end block first!</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

Earlier this week, a former Google employee posted on X that it’s “embarrassingly hard to get Google Gemini to acknowledge that white people exist,” showing a series of queries like “generate a picture of a Swedish woman” or “generate a picture of an American woman.” The results appeared to overwhelmingly or exclusively show AI-generated people of color. (Of course, all the places he listed do have women of color living in them, and none of the AI-generated women exist in any country.) The criticism was taken up by right-wing accounts that requested images of historical groups or figures like the Founding Fathers and purportedly got overwhelmingly non-white AI-generated people as results. Some of these accounts positioned Google’s results as part of a conspiracy to avoid depicting white people, and at least one used a coded antisemitic reference to place the blame.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Gemini results for “a German soldier from 1943” featuring illustrations of what appear to be a white man, a Black man, and an Asian woman." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/376x836/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/384x853/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/415x922/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/480x1067/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/540x1200/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/640x1422/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/750x1667/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/828x1840/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1080x2400/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1200x2667/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1440x3200/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1920x4267/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2048x4551/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2400x5333/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2400x5333/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Gemini wouldn’t produce an image of a 1943 soldier on desktop for me, but it offered this set of illustrations to a colleague.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Google didn’t reference specific images that it felt were errors; in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, it reiterated the contents of its post on X. But it’s plausible that Gemini has made an overall attempt to boost diversity because of a chronic lack<em> </em>of it in generative AI. Image generators are trained on large corpuses of pictures and written captions to produce the “best” fit for a given prompt, which means they’re often prone to amplifying stereotypes. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/">A <em>Washington Post</em> investigation</a> last year found that prompts like “a productive person” resulted in pictures of entirely white and almost entirely male figures, while a prompt for “a person at social services” uniformly produced what looked like people of color. It’s a continuation of trends that have appeared in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17168256/google-racism-algorithms-technology">search engines</a> and other software systems.</p><p>Some of the accounts that criticized Google defended its core goals. “It’s a good thing to portray diversity ** in certain cases **,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLu0x/status/1760170103474356519">noted one</a> person who posted the image of racially diverse 1940s German soldiers. “The stupid move here is Gemini isn’t doing it in a nuanced way.” And while entirely white-dominated results for something like “a 1943 German soldier” would<em> </em>make historical sense, that’s much less true for prompts like “an American woman,” where the question is how to represent a diverse real-life group in a small batch of made-up portraits.</p><p>For now, Gemini appears to be simply refusing some image generation tasks. It wouldn’t generate an image of Vikings for one <em>Verge</em> reporter, although I was able to get a response. On desktop, it resolutely refused to give me images of German soldiers or officials from Germany’s Nazi period or to offer an image of “an American president from the 1800s.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A picture of Gemini results promising “some images featuring diverse US senators from the 1800s,” featuring what appear to be three women of color and an Asian American man." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/376x263/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/384x269/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/415x291/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/480x336/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/540x378/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/640x448/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/750x525/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/828x580/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1080x756/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1200x840/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1440x1008/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1920x1344/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2048x1434/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2400x1681/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2400x1681/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Gemini’s results for the prompt “generate a picture of a US senator from the 1800s.”</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But some historical requests still do end up factually misrepresenting the past.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Nielsen today <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2024/colder-weather-and-nfl-playoffs-drive-increased-tv-usage-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its January report on viewing usage across linear TV and streaming, which revealed that YouTube is once again the overall top streaming service in the U.S., with 8.6% of viewing on television screens. Netflix, meanwhile, saw 7.9% of TV usage. The new data points to YouTube’s dominance in the TV streaming arena and marks 12 consecutive months of the platform being in the top spot.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-number-one-streamer-nielsen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> celebrating the achievement, the Google-owned streaming service announced that viewers now watch a daily average of over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on their televisions, which could indicate that there’s a preference for user-generated videos among U.S. consumers rather than traditional TV shows. <a href="https://www.inmobi.com/company/press/gen-z-significantly-prefers-user-generated-content-older-millennials-lean-toward-streaming-inmobi-insights-survey-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixty-one percent</a> of Gen Z reported that they favor user-generated content over other content formats.</p>
<p>Plus, creators are seeing an increase in viewership come from TVs. According to the company, the number of top YouTubers that receive the most watch time on TVs has sky-rocketed by more than 400%. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hopescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HopeScope</a>, a creator who reviews viral products, notably saw a 172% jump in TV watch time in 2023. This could be good news for family-friendly YouTubers who have to compete with TikTok for kids’ attention. Children ages 4 through 18 spent a global average of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/kids-spent-60-more-time-on-tiktok-than-youtube-last-year-20-tried-openais-chatgpt/">112 minutes daily</a> on TikTok in 2023, per a recent study.</p>
<p>Although YouTube may have precedence in the living room, TikTok continues to dominate on mobile devices. The short-form video app recently began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/tiktok-testing-30-minute-uploads-inch-into-youtubes-territory/">testing</a> the ability for TikTokers to upload 30-minute videos, which could step on YouTube’s toes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/tiktok-launches-a-reimagined-app-for-the-apple-vision-pro/">TikTok</a> also entered the spatial reality space, launching a native app on the Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/youtube-and-other-apps-missing-from-apple-vision-pro-launch/">YouTube</a> decided to not build a dedicated app for the device.</p>
<p>YouTube has reached a few other milestones in recent months, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/google-says-youtube-now-has-over-100-million-subscribers/">100 million users</a> who pay for YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. Additionally, <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube TV</a> now has more than 8 million subscribers and YouTube Shorts recently achieved over 70 billion daily views.</p>

<p><span>+ <a href="http://techstars.com/">Techstars</a> was once one of the world’s leading accelerator programs, but has </span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bstq9vxi7ne4vl8tx43k/portfolio/y-combinator-dominates-startup-accelerator-programs-for-investment-value"><span>steadily been eclipsed</span></a><span> by Y combinator.</span></p>
<p><span>+ Techstars recently announced a string of executive departures and program closures – including termination of the Seattle program, one of its oldest and most successful.</span></p>
<p><span>+ Despite similar beginnings, Techstars chose a different strategic path than Y combinator – those changes compounded over time to strengthen YC and weaken Techstars.</span></p>
<p><span>+ This post offers an insiders’ view of some of the key strategic decisions that led to Techstars’ decline.</span></p>
<p><span>————–</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://techstars.com/">Techstars</a> is – or was – one of the world’s best startup accelerator programs. Founded in Boulder not long after Paul Graham ran his first cohort at Y combinator, Techstars eventually operated dozens of programs around the world, some under the Techstars brand, but over time and increasingly, in cooperation with corporate partners.</span></p>
<p><span>We at </span><span>Founders’ Co-op</span><span> know the Techstars system well: our partnership created the Techstars Seattle program back in 2010 and ran it for a decade; we also helped to create and run two corporate Techstars programs: an early and short-lived program in support of Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, and another in cooperation with Amazon, focused on the Alexa developer community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We were saddened, but not completely surprised, by the recent string of bad news coming from Techstars’ Boulder headquarters. Headcount reductions and executive departures aren’t exactly news as we unwind 15 years of zero interest rates and the many asset bubbles those policies helped to inflate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But we were caught off guard by the decision, announced just today, to cancel the flagship Seattle Techstars program. Not just because we created and led it for many years, but because Techstars Seattle is also the source of many of Techstars’ most successful and celebrated successes; Seattle program alumni like </span><a href="http://remitly.com/"><span>Remitly</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.outreach.io/"><span>Outreach</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.flyzipline.com/"><span>Zipline</span></a><span> are regularly held up as evidence that Techstars can produce billion-dollar outcomes for both founders and investors, something that has happened less and less often in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seattle is also the only Techstars city that is home to two of the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/22/business/magnificent-seven-stocks-tech.html"><span>Magnificent Seven</span></a><span>, the tech bellwethers that continue to drive the lion’s share of public company value creation. Apart from Seattle-based Amazon and Microsoft, all the rest (Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla) are based in the Bay Area. These companies are global magnets for technical talent eager to work on the most advanced and highest-impact technology products in the world. Not coincidentally, they also serve as training grounds for some of the world’s most successful startup founders.</span></p>
<p><span>Although we haven’t been on the inside at Techstars for several years, we grew up with the program and have watched with growing dismay as it drifted away from its original focus on founders. This post is an attempt to unpack the changes we observed both during and after our time with Techstars, to draw out potentially useful lessons about how things might have gone differently.</span></p>
<p><span>———</span></p>
<p><b>In the Beginning: Champions of the Local Startup Ecosystem</b></p>
<p><span>Techstars launched its first program in Boulder in 2007. Just two years later, in 2009, we worked out a deal to create the Techstars Seattle program, with our first program running in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we were deeply committed to Techstars’ “give first” ethos and mentorship-driven approach to startup investing. We also had a strong incentive to make our program successful: despite the shared branding and core values, each Techstars program was funded and owned by the mentor and investor community in the city in which it operated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As Managing Directors of Techstars Seattle, we raised a series of funds from mostly local LPs, including participation from some of our best-known local VC firms, as well as many of the mentors who worked with the founders during and after each program. In simple terms, the local LP community owned 70% of the fund economics, the Managing Director owned 20% and Techstars owned 10%; we also paid Techstars a $50K annual fee to support the program’s back-office operations.</span></p>
<p><span>This tight alignment of incentives and shared values among investors, mentors and program leadership in the Seattle ecosystem created a powerful flywheel effect, stitching together our previously disparate community of startup supporters and creating an open, legible way for high-performing founders from across the region to access the best that Seattle had to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The result was a series of exceptional Seattle program cohorts, including not just the “unicorn” outcomes listed above, but hundreds of millions of dollars in venture financings and liquidity events deep into the roster of participating teams, year after year. It’s fair to say that the Seattle startup community would not be where it is today without Techstars.</span></p>
<p><b>Compromising for Cash</b></p>
<p><span>When Y combinator moved from Boston to the Bay Area – without doubt the dominant market for venture backed tech innovation in the world – Techstars began to see itself as the “YC for everywhere else”. Rather than compete for the #1 market, Techstars made a virtue of supporting nascent startup ecosystems in the other major tech and financial hubs in the US, and eventually, around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>This was a fantastic strategy in terms of impact, raising the bar for startup excellence in key startup ecosystems and opening up access to the Venture Capital financing market to founders who couldn’t or didn’t want to relocate to the Bay Area. But it also created two big problems for Techstars as a business: cash flow and brand identity.</span></p>
<p><span>Even when run on a shoestring (as we did in the early days), running an accelerator costs money: not just the investment capital for the participating founders, but also rent for offices, stipends for program staff, and the hosting and event costs of an intensive three-month, face-to-face program with dozens of founders and hundreds of mentors. Supporting the growing roster of programs also required more administrative overhead to solve legal issues, track investments and support cross-program communications and learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Bottom line, Techstars needed cash. And since the program-based fund model didn’t provide it, Techstars started looking within the local ecosystems in which it operated.</span></p>
<p><span>It began with an effort to extract “sponsorship” dollars from local service providers: the lawyers, accountants, recruiters and PR firms that cater to startups. But for every sponsor who agreed to write a check, there were a dozen other vendors who were equally or more qualified to support the teams in the program. What did we owe our sponsors, and did that put us in conflict with our commitments to give founders the best possible advice, and to never waste their time?</span></p>
<p><span>The next logical step was to go up-market and look for financial “partners” among the many corporations struggling to keep up with the pace of technological innovation during the go-go ZIRP years. Techstars was attracting many of the world’s best founders, surely some of those founders would be interested in solving problems faced by these large corporations?</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not hard to see where this all leads: from a principled beginning, laser-focused on helping the world’s best founding teams achieve the best possible business and financial results, soon the Techstars system began to play host to mandatory, sponsor-led “education” sessions for participating teams. Next, entire accelerator programs were created on behalf of corporate partners, promising them access to cohorts of world-class founders eager to listen to their needs and use their APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both ideas started with good intentions, with Techstars working hard to select values-aligned partners and set the right expectations, but halfway through a program and after a multi-million dollar investment, the tone would inevitably shift the moment the partner suggested they might not be getting their money’s worth.</span></p>
<p><b>Killing the Golden Goose</b></p>
<p><span>Organizations become what they’re staffed and led to do. As Techstars invested in centralized sales and support functions for its valuable and demanding corporate customers, the headquarters organization ballooned, driving additional needs for short-term revenue to fund the growing headcount. And the culture inevitably shifted, from a passionate commitment to founders and the entrepreneurial journey, to a system focused on generating cash from paying corporate customers, with the promise of “innovation” on their terms.</span></p>
<p><span>The final straw came when it became clear that many of the new programs and MDs were struggling to raise their own, local funds. In response, Boulder made the unilateral decision to pull that function away from all the local markets, making investment capital more readily available to new programs, while also allowing the central organization to capture the fee income on Assets Under Management (AUM) across the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span>This may have made sense from a corporate capitalization and cash flow perspective, but the net effect was to eviscerate the incentive system that had attracted high quality Managing Directors to run programs, and had bound together investors and mentors in each local market in the shared work of sourcing and supporting the highest-potential founding teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After this change, MDs still earned a portion of the returns from each program, but no longer had a mechanism to share program economics with their community via investment in the local fund. The autonomy and sense of ownership that attracted outstanding local entrepreneurs in the first generation of Managing Directors (many of whom now run their own funds) quickly devolved into a demanding but low-paying job, with a steadily-growing set of requirements from headquarters to carry water on behalf of the central organization.</span></p>
<p><b>Gradually, Then Suddenly</b></p>
<p><span>Brands and organizations decay slowly; it can be hard for outsiders to see the weakness until it’s readily apparent to all. But customers are smart, and all of Techstars’ customers eventually saw what was happening, and acted accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>The first to spot the weakness were startup founders. Their ambition and acute realism made them sensitive to the clear shift in Techstars’ priorities, away from serving founders and toward the “corporate innovation” business. With dozens of programs scattered around the globe, often in partnership with second-tier brands, and in locations with little to no native startup ecosystem, it was hard to say exactly what the Techstars brand stood for anymore, but it clearly wasn’t “helping entrepreneurs succeed”. While Techstars wanted founders to see Techstars as a single thing, smart founders realized that their outcome and ROI depended entirely on the MD and specific program they participated in.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, Y combinator remained laser-focused on dominating the world’s #1 startup geography (the Bay Area) and delivering value for its core customer, the most exceptional founding teams in the world. As YC racked up highly visible startup success stories and sweetened their funding offer, Techstars struggled to keep pace. (YC suffered its own excesses at the height of the bubble, growing class sizes and drifting up into the growth investing business, but under the leadership of Garry Tan have acted quickly to refocus and rightsize in support of their core mission).</span></p>
<p><span>The next important group to spot the weakness in Techstars’ strategy was the investment community. Startup investing is a power-law business – a very few extraordinary success stories drive returns and cover the losses of the many failed attempts. As Techstars’ track record fell further and further behind YC, their investor sales pitch of “buying an index of the global startup ecosystem” fell flat. Even during the frothiest period of the ZIRP bubble they struggled to hit their fundraising targets, further weakening their capacity to support their growing overhead.</span></p>
<p><span>The last to spot the problem, but from Techstars’ perspective the most essential, were the corporate innovation groups who had provided most of the cash for Techstars’ rapid growth. Unsurprisingly, the world’s best founders don’t particularly care about the problems of any given corporation, and startup investors don’t care to babysit corporate execs or attempt to teach them the foreign ways of entrepreneurship. Churn among Techstars’ corporate customers started high and only accelerated, creating a “leaky bucket” problem for the company’s growth strategy. Add in a global pandemic, and then a rapid deflation of the global asset bubble, and the writing was on the wall: no matter what business Techstars’ corporate partners happened to be in, “innovation” quickly dropped in priority as soon as the startup threat receded and more urgent financial priorities beckoned.</span></p>
<p><span>Slowly, inevitably, Techstars’ bet on corporate customers at the expense of founders came home to roost.</span></p>
<p><b>Old Lessons, and Simple Ones</b></p>
<p><span>The story of Techstars’ rise and accelerating fall is neither unique nor surprising. When interest rates are too low for too long, capital flows toward riskier assets that offer the promise of higher returns. Technology startups can produce rapid growth and high margins at scale; investment intermediaries that offer access to these returns have an easier time raising capital during bubbles; the question becomes: what do they do with it once they have it?</span></p>
<p><span>As the YC example shows, Techstars had the opportunity to build one of the world’s top investing platforms for technical founders in every major tech hub outside the Bay Area. But in their rush to occupy that “everywhere else” market, Techstars cut strategic corners to generate near-term cash flow, creating a path-dependent trajectory to their current outcome. By making corporate funders, and not startup founders, their primary customer, Techstars built a centrally-controlled sales- and operations-driven culture that made startups the product, not the customer. As soon as the top tier of startup founders figured out that YC had their interests at heart in the way that Techstars once had, but no longer did, the game was over.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s hard to prove a counterfactual, but imagine that Techstars had stuck with its original model: a loose but values-aligned federation of career startup investors, each responsible for building the highest-performing investor and mentor community in their respective markets, but sharing information, best practices and back-office infrastructure. As it was in the beginning, 90% of the economics were sourced from, and returned to the local markets, but Techstars accumulated its 10% profit-sharing strip from each market, plus an overhead charge that allowed them to invest not in ever-growing sales and operations teams, but rather in high-quality software tooling and infrastructure that served the entire network.</span></p>
<p><span>This model wouldn’t have grown as quickly, and would have required much greater selectivity in the markets in which it operated. It would also have required more patience from the owners of the network itself, but would have been much more likely to serve their long-term goal of massive value creation over time.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll never know the answer, but if YC serves as a fair proxy for the type of scaled impact and durable value creation that startup accelerators can create, Techstars offers an object lesson in the strategic cost of losing sight of your core customer in the relentless pursuit of growth. Techstars was and is an organization founded by great humans, and its current struggles are shared with many once-promising startups that flew too close to the sun in an era when wings were cheap.</span></p>

                <p>On February 20, 2024, an optimization to the user experience introduced a bug with how the model processes language.</p>

<p>LLMs generate responses by randomly sampling words based in part on probabilities. Their “language” consists of numbers that map to tokens.</p>

<p>In this case, the bug was in the step where the model chooses these numbers. Akin to being lost in translation, the model chose slightly wrong numbers, which produced word sequences that made no sense. More technically, inference kernels produced incorrect results when used in certain GPU configurations.</p>

<p>Upon identifying the cause of this incident, we rolled out a fix and confirmed that the incident was resolved.</p>

<p>Apple has reversed course and is now demanding a 30% cut of donations sent to teachers in the popular <a href="https://insighttimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insight Timer meditation app</a>. The change apparently comes after Apple allowed the app to use its own Stripe-based in-app purchase system for over a year. </p>



<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/in-a-reversal-apple-is-now-demanding-30-of-the-donations-to-meditation-app-insight-timers-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from TechCrunch</a>, Insight Timer’s allows it users to send “tips” to their favorite teachers and instructors. In its App Store Guidelines, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific rules about this</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since 2022, Insight Timer has used Stripe to power its platform that allows users to send those tips, therefore not paying a 30% commission to Apple. “Apple appeared to have blessed this use case, as the tech giant went on to approve 47 more updates to Insight Timer’s app over the course of a 12-month period,” TechCrunch explains. </p>



<p>In late 2023, however, Insight Timer was told by App Store review that those tips were now considered “digital content.” This means Insight Timer will have to use Apple’s In-App Purchase system rather than Stripe, and pay a 30% cut to Apple itself. the </p>



<p>As the report explains, Insight Timer’s business is based around a subscription model. Apple’s decision to require those “tips” to use In-App Purchase has no effect on its finances. Instead, Insight Meditation’s teachers are the ones affected: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Late last year, those approvals stopped. An app reviewer told Insight Timer that these donations were no longer considered monetary gifts — they were now “digital content.” That meant they were also now subject to Apple’s commissions. This decision doesn’t hurt Insight Timer’s bottom line, as the app’s main business is subscriptions. Instead, it hurts the community of teachers who generate additional funds via users’ donations. Now, Apple demands a 30% of that revenue, which means the teachers are getting a 30% pay cut overnight, so to speak.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Insight Timer CEO Christopher Plowman said the company ultimately has no choice but to comply with Apple. Apple gave Plowman a deadline of February to comply with the guideline, or else have Insight Timer removed from the App Store. The two sides went back and forth in search of a compromise, but ultimately couldn’t come to a conclusion. </p>



<p>Plowman also said in the interview that Insight Timer users donated an average of $100,000 per month to the platform’s teachers. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“So in the end, I agreed,” Plowman told TechCrunch in an interview. “I don’t want to pick a fight with Apple — I’m not picking a fight with Apple. I think this problem is largely about regulators not stepping in. Apple’s a public company, but it has shareholders — it’s doing what it’s allowed to do,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Apple hasn’t yet commented on this story. </p>

Building a parser by hand consists of writing many small, repetitive functions that use a tiny library of helper functions to recursively process tokens. A lot of people end up leaning on parser generators, but I've never found one that isn't both bloated and bad at error handling.</p><p>This is where GitHub Copilot comes in—I write the grammar out in a markdown file that I keep open, build the AST data structure, then write the first few rules to give Copilot a bit of context on how I want to use the helper functions I built. From there I can just name functions and run Copilot and it fills in the rest of the parser.</p><p>This is just one example of the kind of task that I find GPTs to be very good at—tasks that necessarily have a lot of repetition but don't have a lot of opportunities for abstraction. Another one that is perhaps more common is unit testing—after giving Copilot one example to go off of, it can generate subsequent unit tests just from the name of the test.</p><p>Is it essential? No. But it sure saves a lot of typing, and is actually <i>less</i> likely than I am to make a silly mistake in these repetitive cases.

                  <p><span>Agreed, GitHub Copilot is fantastic if you give it something to work off of and outsource repetitive tasks to it. You still need to babysit it a little bit (it made a very subtle bug once that took a while to figure out), but it does a great job of generating code based on the other things you've been doing.

DRY has become so much of a mantra in the industry that it's taken for granted that any repetition must be unnecessary, but there are times where that's just wrong.<p>The first example I gave is parsers—even after you've factored out as many helper functions as you can, you'll eventually hit a floor where you have to use those helper functions and piece the results together. That floor is necessarily repetitive—you end up with a bunch of 5 to 10 line functions calling the abstractions and feeding the results together.</p><p>Unit tests is another example: I find that when people get too DRY in unit tests it just ends up obfuscating what the test is testing and makes changing the program later harder. Same as with parsing, there is a floor for how much abstraction is reasonable and once you have hit that floor you still have to go through the rote repetition of stringing functions together and asserting things about the results.</p><p>With a parser you actually have to do this, but with unit tests people will as often as not give up on the tedium and just not cover all the edge cases. Copilot enables developers to stop writing the repetitive code and spend their unit testing time thinking of edge cases.

It works as a insanely good search/autocomplete and that is worth a ton. I love being able to sketch a function with an example input/output and have it return something correct, or at least close 95% of the time. As an experienced dev it's easy for me to look at it and get to 100%.<p>It's also so helpful to be able to just ask questions of the documentation on popular projects, whether it be some nuance of the node APIs or a C websockets library, it saves me countless hours of searching and reading through documentation. Just being able to describe what I want and have it suggest some functions to paste into the actual documentation search bar is invaluable.</p><p>Similarly I find it's really helpful when trying to prototype things, the other day I needed to drop an image into a canvas. I don't remember off top exactly how to get a blob out of an .ondrop (or whatever the actual handler is) and I could find it with a couple minutes of google and MDN/SO, but if I ask ChatGPT "write me a minimal example for loading a dropped image into a canvas" I get the exact thing I want in 10 seconds and I can just copy paste the relevant stuff into MDN if I need to understand how the actual API works.</p><p>I think you're just using it wrong, and moreover I think it's MUCH MUCH more useful as an experienced engineer than as a beginner. I think I get way more mileage out of it than some of my more junior friends/colleagues because I have a better grasp on what questions to ask, and I can spot it being incorrect more readily. It feels <i>BAD</i> to be honest, like it's further stratifying the space by giving me a tool that puts a huge multiplier on my experience allowing me to work much faster than before and leaving those who are less experienced even further behind. I fear that those entering the space now, working with ChatGPT will learn less of the fundamentals that allow me to leverage it so effectively, and their growth will be slowed.</p><p>That's not to say it can't be an incredibly powerful learning tool for someone dedicated to that goal, but I have some fear that it will result in less learning "through osmosis" because junior devs won't be forced into as much of the same problem solving I had to do to be good enough, and perhaps this will allow them to coast longer in mediocrity?

                  <p><span>GPT-4 was addictive for me. I subscribed to replace online language classes and it was an excellent instructor. After passing the exam I unsubscribed and I'm living fine with 3.5. My screen time definitely lowered :) I bought $5 of GPT-4 API credits to use when 3.5 really can't do the job, but it rarely happens. Asking MS Copilot is also another great way to use GPT-4 for free. On the job I mostly use GH Copilot for code completion and it's great as it provides suggestions that are in line with the code style of my team. On serious tasks all chat bots allucinate and I also feel I'm spending as much time correcting them as if I studied the topic from scratch, because I (want to?) believe what they say but end up wasting a lot of time fixing their suggestions. I'm also thinking about SQL, today it suggested me an `UPDATE table JOIN another_table SET column` and I was surprised I could use JOINs in update statements, but the bot was so sure it was the right keyword. I tried to understand where _else_ the syntax error could be, until I turned back to postgres official documentation and verified there's no JOIN, only FROM, just like I remembered.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Turns out it was shamelessly copying from GitHub repos that had vaguely related code to what I was asking - this was easy to discover because there's not much F# out there. In fact the relative sparsity of F# is precisely why GPT-3.5 had to plagiarize! It did not take long to find a prompt that spat out ~300 lines verbatim from my own F# numerics library. (I believe this problem is even worse for C numeric programmers, whose code and expertise is much more valuable than anything in .NET.) OpenAI's products are simply unethical, and I am tired of this motivated reasoning which pretends automated plagiarism is a-okay as long as you personally find it convenient.</p><p>But even outside of plagiarism I am really nervous about the future of software development with LLMs. So often I see people throwing around stats like "we saw a 10% increase in productivity" without even mentioning code quality. There are some early indications that productivity gains in LLM code assistance are paid for by more bugs and security holes - nothing that seems catastrophic, but hardly worth dismissing entirely. What is frustrating is that this was easily predictable, yet GitHub/OpenAI rushed to market with a code generation product whose reliability (and legality) remains completely unresolved.</p><p>The ultimate issue is not about AI or programming so much as software-as-industrial-product. You can quickly estimate increases in productivity over the course of a sprint or two: it's easy to count features cleared and LoC written. But if there are dumb GPT "brain fart" errors in that boilerplate and the boilerplate isn't adequately reviewed by humans, then you might not have particularly good visibility of the consequences until a few months pass and there seem to be more 5-10% bug reports than usual. Again, I don't think the use of Copilot is actually a terrible security disaster. But it's clearly a risk. It's a risk that needs to be addressed BEFORE the tool becomes a de facto standard.</p><p>I certainly get that there's a lot of truly tedious boilerplate in most enterprise codebases - even so I suspect a lot of that is better done with a fairly simple <i>deterministic</i> script versus Copilot. In fact my third biggest irritation with this stuff is that deterministic code generation tools have gotten <i>really good</i> at producing verifiably correct code, even if the interface doesn't involve literally talking to a computer.

I could see myself sitting at home and doing a lot of coding by voice and a vr headset in the future if the tools continue to develop. 
At the moment I think we just need to come up with a better way of integrating it into our workflow.

That is impressive, and it's very useful for references for quick tutorials on common enough things (but do check the docs).

If I want to add payments to my web app (not a web dev, but I mess around with side projects for fun), and I don't want to read the stripe library docs for example, it's pretty good at getting me started installing the right library, and generating the boiler plate. Same with various boilerplate for code generation.</p><p>On the other hand, ChatGPT (which has been clearly trained on stuff I've read) has an uncanny ability to describe my esoteric side projects much better than I can, so there is that.

I do not think AI is the big productivity boost we expect them to be yet.
I have been a software engineer for around 6 years now and I the only AI tooling I prefer and have really can not live without today is autocomplete (a better and smarter LSP).<p>When it comes to making a more complicated change, things are never easy because of the limited context window and the general lack of reasoning and inherent knowledge of the codebase I am working with.</p><p>Having said this, GPT4 has been really good for the one off questions I have about either syntax or if I forget how to do "the thing I know is possible I am just not sure" or the mundane things like docker commands or some other commands which I need help with.</p><p>But... if you guys have seen Gemini-1.5 Pro I was seriously mind blown and I think the first time I felt a LLM is better than me and that has to do with code search. I have had my fair share of navigating large codebases and spending time understanding implementations (clicking go-to-reference, go-to-definition) and keeping a mental model.. the fact that this LLM can take a minute to understand and answer questions about codebase does feel like a game changer.</p><p>I think the right way to think about AI tooling for programming is not to ask them to go and build this insane new feature which will bring lots of money for you, but how they can help you get that edge in your daily workflows (small quality of life changes which compound over time, just like how LSP is taken for granted in the editor now a days).</p><p>Another point to mention here which I believe is a major miss is that these copilots write code without paying attention to the various tools we as humans would use when writing code (LSP, linters, compilers etc). They are legit writing code like they would on a simple notepad and that is another reason why the quality is often times pretty bad (but copilot has proved that with a faster feedback loop and the right UX its not too big a hassle)</p><p>We are still very early in this game and with many people building in this space and these models improving over time I do think we will look back and laugh how things were done pre-AI vs post-smart-AI models.

It rarely helps, but in my experience humans haven’t been much better outside of my professor.<p>I’ve found its best at completing repetitive but simple tasks, such as organizing data or making simple scripts. Anything more complex or that cannot be easily explained in a way it “understands” will run into problems. For instance, telling it to program a custom variant of Dijkstra’s Algorithm for my specific input data? No go, it doesn’t work. However, a simple script to replace any text from column 1 in a CSV with its neighbor text in column 2? Works first try.

<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that laws requiring crippled encryption and extensive data retention violate the European Convention on Human Rights – a decision that may derail European data surveillance legislation known as Chat Control.</p>
<p>The court issued a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854%22]}">decision</a> on Tuesday stating that "the contested legislation providing for the retention of all internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access to the data stored without adequate safeguards against abuse and the requirement to decrypt encrypted communications, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications, cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society."</p>
<p>The "contested legislation" mentioned above refers to a legal challenge that started in 2017 after a demand from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that messaging service Telegram provide technical information to assist the decryption of a user's communication. The plaintiff, Anton Valeryevich Podchasov, challenged the order in Russia but his claim was dismissed.</p>

    

<p>In 2019, Podchasov brought the matter to the ECHR. Russia joined the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal">Council of Europe</a> – an international human rights organization – in 1996 and was a member until it withdrew in March 2022 following its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Because the 2019 case predates Russia's withdrawal, the ECHR continued to consider the matter.</p>

        


        

<p>The court concluded that the Russian law requiring Telegram "to decrypt end-to-end encrypted communications risks amounting to a requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users." As such, the court considers that requirement disproportionate to legitimate law enforcement goals.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the ECHR decision is unlikely to have any effect within Russia, it matters to countries in Europe that are contemplating similar decryption laws – such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">Chat Control</a> and the UK government's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/27/online_safety_act_charles/">Online Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/03/german_digital_committee_hearing_heaps/">Chat Control</a> is shorthand for European data surveillance legislation that would require internet service providers to scan digital communications for illegal content – specifically child sexual abuse material and potentially terrorism-related information. Doing so would necessarily entail weakening the encryption that keeps communication private.</p>
<p>Efforts to develop workable rules have been underway for several years and continue to this day, despite widespread condemnation from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/clientside_scanning_csam_anderson/">academics</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/germany-against-client-side-scanning-csam">privacy-oriented orgs</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/en/themen/digitale-grundrechte/chatkontrolle">civil society groups</a>.</p>

        

<p>Patrick Breyer, a member of the European parliament for the Pirate Party, hailed the ruling for demonstrating that Chat Control is incompatible with EU law.</p>
<p>"With this outstanding landmark judgment, the 'client-side scanning' surveillance on all smartphones proposed by the EU Commission in its chat control bill is clearly illegal," said Breyer.</p>
<p>"It would destroy the protection of everyone instead of investigating suspects. EU governments will now have no choice but to remove the destruction of secure encryption from their position on this proposal – as well as the indiscriminate surveillance of private communications of the entire population!" ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://breadchris.com/blog/go-run/">https://breadchris.com/blog/go-run/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39460409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>It may seem silly, but <code>go run</code> is my favorite part about go. Want to run your code? <code>go run main.go</code>. It is so stupidly simple that I could tell my mom about this command, and she would immediately understand. Like with most things in go, the real power in this command is in the effortless understanding of how to build and run everyone’s code.</p>
<p>But I can run <code>node main.js</code>? Yeah, and then what happens if you want to use modern syntax like esmodule, or maybe you want to use types with typescript? You are going to have to use <code>npm</code>.</p>
<p>The tools you use to build and run code are often disparate in a language. As a project maintainer, you must understand community practices and conventions of correctly setting up a project. Third-party libraries are often required to run even the simplest of code. For example, in the Ruby programming language, the “rake” build tool became popular because of its versatility and the fact that it was used in many open-source projects. Similarly, in the JavaScript community, the adoption of npm as a build tool was driven by the widespread use of npm packages and modules.</p>
<p>Languages grow and change over time, and it is only natural that tools come and go as well. C and C++ have historically had “make” since the 1970s; Java grew from “ant” in the 1990s to Maven in the early 2000s. Different requirements for your application influence the tools that are developed and, by extension, influence people’s workflows.</p>
<p>This is precisely the reason I love <code>go run</code> so much. Go’s entire design brings power to the command. Simple syntax, static typing, and a strict dependency management system allow the compiler to quickly parse and analyze source code, leading to build times faster. Faster build times mean a broader reach of who could use the language to achieve their goals. It is funny; you will occasionally see a go project that includes a <code>Makefile</code>, but the compilation step is just a <code>go build</code> (build; don’t run the code). Old habits die hard.</p>
<p>Fun fact: One of the understated features <code>go run</code> is that it will automatically download any dependencies the code references; how cool is that!</p>
<p>The more I program in other languages, the more I feel the painful absence of a standardized build system. I find it frustrating to keep up with the latest and greatest build system for something as common as running code. For something so critical to my understanding of how to code, such as how to run it, I find it unacceptable not to have a reliable foundation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Do not compromise with hacks or workarounds for critical components of your software development flow. Take ownership of the tools you use and fight for change so that you and everyone else benefit. When experience is shared, problems are solved, days of people’s lives are saved, and passion for programming continues to grow, not wane.</p>
<p>comments:</p>
<p>bun run :) bun hing.ts same with python but not compiled you need to install python that’s the beauty of go for me even rust you need a cargo file</p>
<p>amazing, for js we not only have npm, yarn, pnpm, and bower (am I missing any?) but we also have completely new runtimes <a href="https://bun.sh/">bun</a> and <a href="https://deno.com/">deno</a>. these are not evil, but tread lightly. Is VC backed deno going to fold as a company? maybe bun gets burnt and we are onto the next one. meanwhile I will be here with my boring <code>go run</code></p>
