<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#cc0000"><b>update</b></span> <b>A day after developers at America Online's Nullsoft unit quietly released file-sharing software, AOL pulled the link to the product from the subsidiary's Web site.</b>
<p>

The software, called Waste, lets groups set up private, secure file-sharing networks. The product became available on <newslink url="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/">Nullsoft's Web site on Wednesday, just days shy of the four-year anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-226540.html" title="AOL buys Spinner, Nullsoft for $400 million -- Tuesday, Jun 1, 1999">of being acquired by AOL</a>. Waste is a software application that combines peer-to-peer file sharing with instant messaging, chat and file searches. Users can set up their own network of friends and share files between each other.
</newslink></p><p>


The features of Waste are similar to those of file-swapping services such as Kazaa and the defunct Napster, but the difference is that only small networks of people (up to 50, according to the Web site) can use it. The software also offers encryption and authentication to prevent non-invitees from accessing the private networks.
</p><p><div><!-- Mad/MAC ad --><div><p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502im_/http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/Ads/common/advertisement.gif" width="120" height="10"></p></div><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502im_/http://adlog.com.com/adlog/i/r=5279&amp;s=533360&amp;t=2003.08.10.19.45.02&amp;o=12:1023:1032:&amp;h=cn&amp;p=2&amp;b=5&amp;l=en_US&amp;&amp;site=3/http://image.com.com/adverts/imp/dotclear.gif" height="1" width="1"><!-- Mad/MAC [QA-20030710-150000-v1-3-8-L2DOMAIN] c10-xw4.cnet.com:7318:32773 2003.08.10.19.45.02 --><!-- Mad/MAC ad --><!-- NO AD TEXT: _QUERY_STRING="USESAVED=UNION_5" _REQ_NUM="0"  --><!-- MAC-AD STATUS: empty USESAVED buffer: UNION_5 --><!-- Mad/MAC [QA-20030710-150000-v1-3-8-L2DOMAIN] c10-xw4.cnet.com:7318:32773 2003.08.10.19.45.02 --></div><span></span></p><p>
The quiet launch of Waste was the work of Nullsoft's principal developer, Justin Frankel, a soft-spoken 20-something known for his tech savvy and his streak of rebelliousness.
</p><p>
Waste had been used internally to share files between AOL's San Francisco office, where Nullsoft is based, and its Dulles, Va., headquarters, according to Ian Rogers, a former founding member of Nullsoft.
</p><p>
"The real play is when you've got small networks of co-workers or friends who can share whatever they want securely," Rogers said in an interview. "It could be a group of government officials sharing secure documents or it could be Justin sharing video files with AOL Dulles."
</p><p>
An AOL representative did not return requests for comment.
</p><p>
Nullsoft has had its conflicts with AOL in the past, such as in 2000 when Frankel developed a music file-swapping technology called Gnutella. AOL quickly pulled it off the Web fearing legal ramifications, but not before developers downloaded it and began creating services based on its software code.
</p><p>
AOL also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-244303.html" title="AOL pulls MP3 search engine -- Thursday, Aug 10, 2000">forced Nullsoft to shut down an MP3 search engine</a>, fearing the legal consequences of the software. Then, Frankel and his cohorts caused a stir when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-246057.html" title="Under AOL's nose: geniuses or guerrillas? -- Thursday, Sep 21, 2000">developed software called AIMazing</a>, which replaced banner advertisements on AOL Instant Messenger into wiggling sound waves accompanied by music.
</p><p>
That's not to say all of Nullsoft's products have been a thorn in AOL's side. AOL acquired Nullsoft in 1999 for its Winamp MP3 player and now uses the technology in its flagship online service. AOL also has been revamping its streaming-media delivery system by using another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-966239.html" title="AOL debuts its own streaming tech -- Monday, Nov 18, 2002">Nullsoft creation called Ultravox</a>, which AOL claims can stream media more efficiently than other products on the market. AOL uses Ultravox to stream songs on its narrowband and broadband radio services.

Why SQLite Does Not Use Git
</p>


</div>




<h2 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>
SQLite does not use the
<a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a> version control system.
SQLite uses
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a> instead, which is a
version control system that was specifically designed
and written to support SQLite.

</p><p>
People often wonder why SQLite does not use the
<a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a> version control system like everybody
else.
This article attempts to answer that question.  Also,
in <a href="#getthecode">section 3</a>, 
this article provides hints to Git users
about how they can easily access the SQLite source code.

</p><p>
This article is <u>not</u> a comparison between Fossil
and Git.  See
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki</a>
for one comparison of the two systems.  Other third-party 
comparisons are available as well - use a search engine to find them.

This article is <u>not</u> advocating that you switch your projects
away from Git.  You can use whatever version control system you want.
If you are perfectly happy with Git, then by all means keep using
Git.  But, if Git is not working well for you or you are wondering 
if it can be improved or if there is something better,
then maybe try to understand the perspectives presented below.
Use the insights thus obtained to find or write a different and
better version control system, or to just make
improvements to Git itself.

<h2 id="git_does_not_provide_good_situational_awareness"><span>2.1. </span>Git does not provide good situational awareness</h2>

<p>
When I want to see what has been happening on SQLite, I visit the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">timeline</a> and in a single
screen I see a summary of the latest changes, on all branches.
In a few clicks, I can drill down as much detail as I
want.  I can even do this from a phone.

</p><p>
GitHub and GitLab offer nothing comparable.  The closest I have
found is the <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/network">network</a>,
which is slow to render (unless it is already cached), does not 
offer nearly as much details, and scarcely works at all on mobile.
The <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/master">commits</a> view
of GitHub provides more detail, renders quickly,
and works on mobile, but only shows a single branch at a time,
so I cannot easily know if I've seen all of the recent changes.
And even if GitHub/GitLab did offer better interfaces, both are
third-party services.  They are not a core part of Git.  Hence,
using them introduces yet another dependency into the project.

</p><p>
I am told that Git users commonly install third-party graphical
viewers for Git, many of which do a better job of showing recent 
activity on the project.  That is great, but these are still
more third-party applications that must be installed and
managed separately.  Many are platform-specific.  (One of the
better ones, <a href="https://gitup.co/">GitUp</a>, only works on Mac, for
example.)  All require that you first sync your local repository
then bring up their graphical interface on your desktop.  And
even with all that, I still cannot see what I typically want to 
see without multiple clicks.  Checking on project status from
a phone while away from the office is not an option.

</p><h2 id="git_makes_it_difficult_to_find_successors_descendents_of_a_check_in"><span>2.2. </span>Git makes it difficult to find successors (descendents)
of a check-in</h2>

<p>
Git lets you look backwards in time, but not forwards.
Given some historical check-in, you can see what came before,
but it is challenging see what came next.

</p><p>
In contrast, Fossil offers helpful displays such as
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release</a>
to show all check-ins that are derived from the most
recent major release.

</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release">
All SQLite check-ins derived from the most recent major release</a>
</li></ul>


<p>It is not impossible to find the descendents of a check-in
in Git.  It is merely difficult.  For example,
there is a 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27960605/find-all-the-direct-descendants-of-a-given-commit#27962018">stackoverflow page</a>
showing the command sequence for finding the descendents of a check-in
in unix:

</p><div><pre>git rev-list --all --parents | grep "<a name="R-20568-61871-33672-25407-24732-44471-23157-56477"></a><span color="blue"><b>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/draft/matrix/matrix_dwhynotgit.html#R-20568-61871-33672-25407-24732-44471-23157-56477">R-20568-61871</a>:[</b></span><span color="red">.</span>
<span color="blue"><b>]</b></span>
\{40\}.*<parent_sha1>.*" | awk '{print $1}'
</parent_sha1>
</pre></div>

<p>
But this is not the same thing.  The command above gives
a list of descendents without showing the branching structure, which
is important for understanding what happened.  And the command only works
if you have a local clone of the repository; finding the descendents of
a check-in is not something you can do with web interfaces such
as GitHub or GitLab.

</p><p>
This is not really about just finding the descendents of a check-in
from time to time.  The fact that descendents are readily available in
Fossil means that the information pervades the web pages provided by
Fossil.  One example: Every Fossil check-in information page
(<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ec7addc87f97bcff">example</a>) shows
a small "Context" graph of the immediate predecessor and successors 
to that check-in.  This helps the user maintain better situational
awareness, and it provides useful capabilities, such as the ability
click forward to the next check-in in sequence.  Another example:
Fossil easily shows the context around a specific check-in
(<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=2018-03-16&amp;n=10">example</a>)
which again helps to promote situational awareness and a deeper
understanding of what is happening in the code.  There is a
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/webpage-ex.md">whole page of additional examples</a>
in the <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil documentation</a>.

</p><p>
All of the above is theoretically possible with Git, given the right extensions
and tools and using the right commands.  But it is not easy to do,
and so it rarely gets done.  Consequently, developers have less awareness
of what is happening in the code.

</p><h2 id="the_mental_model_for_git_is_needlessly_complex"><span>2.3. </span>The mental model for Git is needlessly complex</h2>

<p>
The complexity of Git
distracts attention from the software under development.  A user of Git
needs to keep all of the following in mind:
</p><ol type="a">
<li> The working directory
</li><li> The "index" or staging area
</li><li> The local head
</li><li> The local copy of the remote head
</li><li> The actual remote head
</li></ol>
<p>
Git has commands (and/or options on commands) for moving and
comparing content between all of these locations. 

</p><p>In contrast,
Fossil users only need to think about their working directory and
the check-in they are working on.  That is 60% less distraction.
Every developer has a finite number of brain-cycles.  Fossil
requires fewer brain-cycles to operate, thus freeing up 
intellectual resources to focus on the software under development.

</p><p>One user of both Git and Fossil
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16806955">writes in HN</a>:

</p><blockquote><i>
Fossil gives me peace of mind that I have everything ... synced to 
the server with a single command....
I never get this peace of mind with git.
</i></blockquote>

<h2 id="git_does_not_track_historical_branch_names"><span>2.4. </span>Git does not track historical branch names</h2>

<p>
Git keeps the complete DAG of the check-in sequence.  But branch
tags are local information that is not synced and not retained
once a branch closes.
This makes review of historical
branches tedious.

</p><p>
As an example, suppose a customer asks you:
"What ever became of that 'prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery' branch
from two years ago?"
You might try to answer by consulting the history in
your version control system, thusly:

</p><ul>
<li><b>GitHub:</b> <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery">https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery</a>
</li><li><b>Fossil:</b> <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
The Fossil view clearly shows that the branch was eventually merged back into
trunk.  It shows where the branch started, and it shows two occasions where changes
on trunk were merged into the branch.  GitHub shows none of this.  In fact, the
GitHub display is mostly useless in trying to figure out what happened.

</p><p>
Many readers have recommended various third-party GUIs for Git that
might do a better job of showing historical development activity.  Maybe
some of them do work better than native Git and/or GitHub, though they
will all be hampered by the fact that Git does not preserve historical
branch names across syncs.  And even if those other tools are better,
the fact that it is necessary to go to a third-party tool to get the information
desired does not speak well of the core system.

</p><h2 id="git_requires_more_administrative_support"><span>2.5. </span>Git requires more administrative support</h2>

<p>
Git is complex software.
One needs an installer of some kind to put Git on a developer
workstation, or to upgrade to a newer version of Git.
Standing up a Git server is non-trivial, and so most developers
use a third-party service such as GitHub or GitLab,
and thus introduce additional dependencies.

</p><p>
In contrast, Fossil is a single standalone binary which is
installed by putting it on $PATH.  That one binary contains all
the functionality of core Git and also GitHub and/or GitLab.  It
manages a community server with wiki, bug tracking, and forums, 
provides packaged downloads for consumers, login managements, 
and so forth, with no extra software required.  Standing up a
community server for Fossil takes minutes.  And Fossil is efficient.
A Fossil server will run fine on a $5/month VPS or a Raspberry Pi,
whereas GitLab and similar require beefier hardware.

</p><p>
Less administration means that programmers spend more time working
on the software (SQLite in this case) and less time fussing with
the version control system.

</p><h2 id="git_provides_a_poor_user_experience"><span>2.6. </span>Git provides a poor user experience</h2>

<p>The following <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">https://xkcd.com/1597/</a> cartoon is an
exaggeration, yet hits close to home:

</p><p>
<img src="https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/xkcd-git.gif">

</p><p>Let's be real.  Few people dispute that Git provides
a suboptimal user experience.  A lot of 
the underlying implementation shows through into the user
interface.  The interface is so bad that there is even a
parody site that generates
<a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">fake git man pages</a>.

</p><p>Designing software is hard.  It takes a lot of focus.
A good version control system should provide the developer with
assistance, not frustration.  Git has gotten better in this
regard over the past decade, but it still has a long way to go.

</p><h2 id="a_git_user_s_guide_to_accessing_sqlite_source_code"><span>3. </span>A Git-User's Guide To Accessing SQLite Source Code</h2>

<p>
If you are a devoted Git user, you can still easily access SQLite.  
This section gives some hints on how to do so.

</p><h2 id="the_official_github_mirror"><span>3.1. </span>The Official GitHub Mirror</h2>

<p>
As of 2019-03-20, there is now an 
<a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite">official Git mirror</a> of the
SQLite sources on GitHub.

</p><p>The mirror is an incremental export of the 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">canonical Fossil repository</a> for
SQLite.  A cron-job updates the GitHub repository once an hour.
This is a one-way, read-only code mirror.  No pull requests or 
changes are accepted via GitHub.  The GitHub repository merely copies
the content from the Fossil repository.  All changes are input via
Fossil.

</p><p>
The hashes that identify check-ins and files on the Git mirror are
different from the hashes in Fossil.  There are many reasons for
this, chief among them that Fossil uses a SHA3-256 hash whereas
Git uses a SHA1 hash.  During export, the original Fossil hash for
each check-in is added as a footer to check-in comments.  To avoid
confusion, always use the original Fossil hash, not the Git hash,
when referring to SQLite check-ins.

</p><h2 id="web_access"><span>3.2. </span>Web Access</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">SQLite Fossil Repository</a> contains links
for downloading  a Tarball, ZIP Archive, or <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/draft/matrix/sqlar.html">SQLite Archive</a> for any
historical version of SQLite.  The URLs for these downloads are
simple and can be incorporated easily into automated tools.  The format is:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/</tt><i>VERSION</i><tt>/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simply replace <i>VERSION</i> with some description of the version to be
downloaded.  The <i>VERSION</i> can be a prefix of the cryptographic hash
name of a specific check-in, or the name of a branch (in which case the
most recent version of the branch is fetched) or a tag for a specific
check-in like "version-3.23.1":

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/version-3.23.1/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>


<p>To get the latest release, use "release"
for <i>VERSION</i>, like this:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/release/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
To get the latest trunk check-in, us "trunk" for <i>VERSION</i>:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/trunk/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
And so forth.
For ZIP archives and SQLite Archives, simply change the "/tarball/" element
into either "/zip/" or "/sqlar/", and maybe also change the name of the
download file to have a ".zip" or ".sqlar" suffix.

</p><h2 id="fossil_access"><span>3.3. </span>Fossil Access</h2>

<p>
Fossil is easy to install and use.  Here are the steps for unix.
(Windows is similar.)

</p><ol>
<li>
Download the self-contained Fossil executable from
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html</a> and put the executable
somewhere on your $PATH.
</li><li><tt>mkdir ~/fossils</tt>
</li><li><tt>fossil clone https://sqlite.org/src ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil</tt>
</li><li><tt>mkdir ~/sqlite; cd ~/sqlite</tt>
</li><li><tt>fossil open ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil</tt>
</li></ol>

<p>
At this point you are ready to type "<tt>./configure; make</tt>"
(or on Windows with MSVC, "<tt>nmake /f Makefile.msc</tt>").

</p><p>
To change your checkout to a different version of Fossil use
the "update" command:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>fossil update </tt><i>VERSION</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
Use "trunk" for <i>VERSION</i> to get the latest trunk version of SQLite.
Or use a prefix of a cryptographic hash name, or the name of some branch
or tag.  See
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki</a> for more
suggestions on what names can be used for <i>VERSION</i>.

</p><p>
Use the "<tt>fossil ui</tt>" command from within the ~/sqlite checkout to
bring up a local copy of the website.

</p><p>
Additional documentation on Fossil can be found at
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/permutedindex.html">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/permutedindex.html</a>

</p><p>
Do not be afraid to explore and experiment.
Without a log-in you won't be able to
push back any changes you make, so you cannot damage the project.

</p><h2 id="verifying_source_code_integrity"><span>3.4. </span>Verifying Source Code Integrity</h2>

<p>
If you need to verify that the SQLite source code that you have is
authentic and has not been modified in any way (perhaps by an adversary)
that can be done using a few simple command-line tools.  At the root 
of the SQLite source tree is a file named "manifest".  The manifest 
file contains the name of every other file in the source tree together 
with either a SHA1 or SHA3-256 hash for that file.  (SHA1 is used for
older files and SHA3-256 for newer files.)  You can write a
script to extract these hashes and verify them against the source code 
files.  The hash name for the check-in is just the SHA3-256 hash of the
"manifest" file itself, possibly with the last line omitted if the
last line begins with "# Remove this line..."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When Kim Mitlyng was in college, one of her family members began to experience a mental-health crisis that lasted for years. Whenever Mitlyng’s phone rang, she feared that she was about to learn that her loved one had died by suicide. She and her family sought help, but they were overwhelmed by the fragmented and disorganized mental-health-care system. “I felt like we were set up for failure,” she told me. “People would just throw a bunch of numbers at us and say, ‘Call these and find out what your insurance covers.’&nbsp;” Mitlyng decided to study psychology and, after graduation, trained as a family and marriage counsellor. But she found herself drawn to psychiatric emergencies. “There’s something about being with people in the darkest time,” Mitlyng said. “Being able to hold that space and give them just a glimmer of hope.”</p><p>In 2014, Mitlyng took a job as a therapist at an emergency department in the Twin Cities. During Minnesota’s icy, gray winters, she would brace herself against the morning cold, hustle through the chaos of the emergency department, and swipe into the “mental-health suite,” a locked unit with five spartan rooms, each designed for a single patient. She often found fifteen patients in and around the suite, all of them in urgent need of care. Mitlyng usually had only fifteen minutes with each patient, to conduct a rapid crisis assessment. Then she would decide who could safely leave and who needed to stay. “It was just churning through one patient after another,” she said. Some patients ended up boarding in the emergency department for days until a bed opened up at a psychiatric facility. They were generally required to stay inside their rooms, without their belongings and with little to do except stare at a television behind plexiglass. If they had to use the bathroom or wanted food, water, or a pillow, they had to ask a nurse. “They were completely stripped of autonomy,” Mitlyng said. “Many patients said it felt like a jail.”</p><p>One afternoon, Mitlyng was in the mental-health suite when a woman grabbed her by the hair and flung her to the ground. The woman climbed on top of her and struck her before a throng of hospital staff and security guards descended. “I think all of us who worked that job were assaulted or nearly assaulted at some point,” Mitlyng told me. It wasn’t unusual for a patient’s symptoms to escalate during their stay; staff grew accustomed to patients slamming doors, throwing food, and making threats. Mitlyng wondered if she was just shifting unwanted people from place to place. “Everyone was doing the best they could under the circumstances,” Mitlyng told me. “I was doing the best I could. But, I thought, It’s time to try something new.” In the spring of 2021, she decided to change jobs.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a less therapeutic environment for a person in crisis than an emergency department: crowded and windowless rooms; harsh fluorescent lights; the ceaseless ping of alarms; this patient retching, that one screaming. And yet, for every eight patients who present at an emergency department, one is there for a behavioral crisis such as psychosis, suicidality, mania, aggression, or substance use. Often these conditions have a years-long history and can’t be treated quickly or straightforwardly, in the way that a broken bone or a knife wound might be. In some cases, showing up at an E.R. can make things worse; patients who pose a danger to themselves or others may be sedated or kept in isolation, even tethered to bedside rails so that they cannot move. When I worked in an emergency department, I often despaired for my own mental health. I would rush from a patient with crushing chest pressure to one with a fractured foot, neglecting those who were in less visible kinds of pain. After my shift, the memory of patients I had never got to—people who had asked for a sandwich or a blanket or a conversation—would gnaw at me. I wanted to give them more time, to show them more empathy, but the circumstances seemed to make it impossible.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In May, I travelled to a suburb of Minneapolis in search of a different approach to mental-health crises. Around 8 <em>A.M.</em>, Mitlyng, who has shoulder-length brown hair and a warm smile, met me in the lobby of her new workplace, M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is a ten-minute drive from the Mall of America and houses three hundred and ninety beds in a cream-colored complex. Mitlyng led me through the emergency department, which, even at that hour, had a frenzied energy. A stretcher rolled past; monitors flashed vital signs and heart rhythms. A patient moaned, and a nurse called for help. Then we walked down a long hallway to the area where Mitlyng now treats psychiatric emergencies, as a clinical supervisor.</p><p>On the other side of a door was a spacious, mellow room that reminded me of an airport’s business-class lounge. Floor-to-ceiling windows, which were partially frosted to protect patient privacy, let in the morning sun; an arc of blue light lit up the ceiling. Murals of tree branches, green leaves, and blue skies decorated the walls. A dozen or so patients rested on flatbed recliners. The unit’s nurses sat behind a curved wooden desk.</p><p>A middle-aged woman in a red T-shirt walked up. “I wanted to tell you about something,” she said to one of the nurses. “Of course,” the nurse replied. “I’ll be over in a minute.” The woman shuffled away, pausing at another patient’s recliner before plopping into her own. Their exchange was the kind of ordinary human interaction that would seem unusual only in a hospital, where patients often have to fight for attention.</p><p>Mitlyng led me to one of the unit’s four “sensory rooms.” A rocking chair stood next to a beanbag and a yoga mat. “Patients can go in there and listen to music, and change the color and intensity of the lighting,” Mitlyng told me. “Just kind of chill out, you know?” Outside, a man helped himself to tea, pudding, and a hard-boiled egg from a snack bar. A warming cabinet offered fresh blankets, and around the corner stood an exercise bike. “When someone’s really manic, it helps to externalize that nervous energy,” a nurse explained. “We have a shower, too.” On a nearby bookshelf, titles on yoga, wellness, and philosophy sat next to Scrabble, Uno, and a “Star Wars” jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>The mental-health unit where Mitlyng works is one of only a few dozen Em<em>PATH</em> units, short for Emergency Psychiatry Assessment, Treatment, and Healing. Such units, which were invented about a decade ago, vary in size, staffing, and design, but the core concept is that, instead of leaving patients to languish in an emergency room, caregivers offer them a calm communal environment where they can receive a comprehensive evaluation, start therapy, and, if needed, receive medication. Most patients stay for a day or two; the vast majority are discharged back home, instead of going on to a psychiatric facility. In its two years of existence, M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit has cared for five thousand people. I turned to survey the room: patients sat placidly near one another, blankets pulled to their chins, munching on chips and watching TV. I thought back to my own experiences in the chaos of emergency departments. Was this what an E.R. for mental illness should look like?</p><inline-embed name="feature-default" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="image" contenttype="callout:feature-default"><figure><p><span>Frosted privacy glass surrounds the mental-health unit.</span></p></figure></inline-embed><p>Until the nineteen-sixties, American hospitals did not have emergency departments as we think of them today. Physicians made house calls to provide urgent care, and, in hospitals, nurses and medical trainees staffed “accident rooms” where they treated physical traumas that resulted from falls, fights, car crashes, and other mishaps. If a senior doctor was required, one had to be summoned from elsewhere. Meanwhile, most ambulance services were operated by morticians, because hearses were roomy enough for people to lie flat. In 1961, however, James Mills, a general practitioner in Virginia, persuaded three fellow-physicians to join him in running a twenty-four-hour emergency room at Alexandria Hospital, where he’d recently been elected medical-staff president; when things got really busy, military doctors from a local Army base would help out. The new model insured that acutely ill patients could receive timely care from experienced practitioners. Soon, hospitals in other states were piloting their own versions of what came to be known as the Alexandria Plan. But public demand for emergency services of all kinds continued to swell. A few years later, a National Academy of Sciences report called the U.S. “insensitive to the magnitude of the problem of accidental death and injury,” noting that accidents had become the country’s fourth leading cause of mortality. In the early seventies, Congress passed legislation to develop regional ambulance systems, and the American Medical Association recognized emergency medicine as a specialty of its own. It is now the fifth largest, based on the number of trainees who choose it.</p><p>Over the years, small emergency rooms have grown into comprehensive departments capable of treating a wide range of conditions and saving countless lives. Since the nineties, mortality in emergency departments has fallen by half. Their focus on things like accidents, infections, and heart problems, however, remains ill-suited for psychiatric crises. For more than a decade, mental-health and substance-use emergencies have been surging, especially among <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide">young people</a>. Between 2007 and 2020, the share of emergency-department visits for mental-health reasons in the U.S. nearly doubled, and the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus">pandemic</a> has only worsened this trend.</p><p>Few emergency physicians are trained to provide <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/can-ai-treat-mental-illness">mental-health treatment</a>, and their workplaces are not physically designed for it. In a typical E.R., a person experiencing hallucinations, aggression, or psychosis might be evaluated by clinicians looking for a medical cause for his symptoms. Maybe he has an infection, an overactive thyroid, or a medication with psychoactive side effects. Only once these potential causes have been ruled out might the patient see a mental-health practitioner, if one is available. He might then be deemed safe for discharge—or, if doctors think he presents an immediate danger to himself or others, he might be forced to stay. Sometimes, he might wait for days, even weeks, until a bed opens up in a nearby psychiatric facility.</p><p>In 2012, Scott Zeller, who was then the head of psychiatric emergency services at the Alameda Health System, in Oakland, California, was growing frustrated with the status quo. Many observers blamed long wait times for psychiatric patients on a sharp decline in the number of psychiatric beds in public hospitals. Zeller thought they were missing a more fundamental point. “Why is mental illness the only emergency where the treatment plan is, Let’s find them a bed somewhere?” Zeller asked. “If someone comes in with an asthma attack, we don’t say, ‘We’ve got a gurney here in the back for you. We’re going to try to find you an asthma hospital in a day or two, so sit tight.’&nbsp;” For psychiatric patients, this transitional time was therapeutic dead space—a missed opportunity. Could it be transformed into a period of healing?</p><p>Zeller converted an unused hospital lobby into a large waiting room. He supplied the space with snacks and recliners and organized group activities. A nurse or therapist provided counselling, and a psychiatrist tried to see patients and prescribe medications within an hour. “People said, ‘These patients will never be able to be in the same room together—they’ll just rile each other up!’&nbsp;” Zeller told me. “Actually, no—not if you create an environment that’s less like prison and more like a place of healing.”</p><p>This approach came to be known as the Alameda Model. After it was implemented, the number of psychiatric patients who stayed overnight in the area’s emergency departments fell almost to zero. In a traditional emergency department, as many as twenty per cent of patients experiencing a mental-health crisis might end up being restrained in some way; in Zeller’s unit, the number was 0.1 per cent, a difference that he attributes to the calmer environment and specialized staff. The average wait time in the emergency department for people with acute mental-health conditions dropped from more than ten hours to less than two, and, because patients received immediate attention once they got to Zeller’s unit, three-quarters were able to go home, where they tend to have better long-term outcomes, instead of being hospitalized. In 2016, Zeller renamed the model “Em<em>PATH</em>.” He was advised to copyright the term, but decided not to, so other providers could more easily adopt it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Soon, Zeller was fielding calls from hospitals around the country interested in creating their own Em<em>PATH</em> units. There are now dozens of them planned or in operation—in Pittsburgh and Sacramento, Lynchburg and Lexington, Billings and Bemidji. Each day, around the country, hundreds of patients in crisis are now quickly evaluated by emergency-department staff, then directed to one of these units for specialized psychiatric care.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The Em<em>PATH</em> unit at Fairview Southdale Hospital, where I met Mitlyng, is modest in size, with fifteen recliners, but it is still one of the largest in the country. It is led by Lewis Zeidner, a clinical psychologist who’s worked in emergency psychiatry for more than four decades. A soft-spoken man with silver hair, a neat mustache, and clear-frame glasses, Zeidner told me that, before the unit opened, nearly half of psychiatric patients at Fairview Southdale were hospitalized; now, only around one-tenth are. Most people are discharged home with a care plan and follow-up. “Psychiatric hospitalization carries its own kind of trauma, even when it’s voluntary,” he told me. “We try to avoid it whenever possible.” He had told me that I could observe the unit if I agreed not to talk to patients, and if I promised to omit identifying details, to protect their privacy.</p><p>Around 9 <em>A.M.</em>, the unit’s staff gathered in a private workroom to discuss how each patient was doing. On one wall, “emergency ligature cut-down shears” dangled next to a red button, which would summon help if a patient tried to harm himself; another wall was covered with letters from former patients. “Looking forward to brighter days in recovery and you are part of it,” one read. Kevan Andish, a serene psychiatrist whose waft of dark hair was graying at the temples, listened as a therapist told him about a patient who had stopped taking her mood-stabilizing drugs, convinced that they were abortion pills; her child’s school had reported her erratic behavior. The team decided to keep her overnight for monitoring and treatment.</p><p>Another patient, a young man with depression, had been brought in by friends who were alarmed when he’d started talking about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/16/finding-a-way-back-from-suicide">suicide</a>. Ordinarily, school provided him with a sense of structure and community; it was now on break. During the course of a couple of days, the team had adjusted his medications and he’d improved. Today was his birthday, and he was asking the staff to let him go to a soccer game with his family.</p><p>Next, the therapist told Andish about a woman who was manic, and might benefit from another day of observation, but was determined to leave. I tried to imagine the frustrations of a patient who wasn’t here by choice; for her, the relative comfort of the unit might not make much difference. “She told me that there are people like her walking around out there all day, every day,” the therapist said. A gentle laughter filled the room.</p><p>“She’s not wrong,” someone said.</p><p>“Shows good insight,” Mitlyng chimed in. After reviewing her chart, they decided that the woman was safe to discharge.</p><p>After the huddle, I wandered back into the unit. A young woman with ginger hair, looking despondent in burnt-orange scrubs provided by the hospital, slowly approached the nursing station and asked for a mask. A nurse smiled and handed her one. The woman, whom I’ll call Emma, shuffled back to her recliner. (The Em<em>PATH</em> unit sometimes allows patients to wear their own clothes, but only after a search for potential dangers to themselves or others, like weapons, drugs, belts, and shoelaces. Patients must give up their cell phones.)</p><p>Emma had come in two days before with spiralling anxiety, depression, and paranoia. She’d been eating less than usual, sleeping little, and hearing voices. Her partner had grown concerned and urged her to get help. She’d hardly spoken to anyone at the unit.</p><p>Mitlyng walked Emma to a private consultation room with soft lighting. Emma climbed onto a chair, pulled her knees to her chest, and stared at the floor.</p><p>“Sounds like yesterday was tough,” Mitlyng said.</p><p>Emma wrung her hands. Finally, she said, “Yesterday was hard. I kept hearing names, voices.”</p><p>“What were the voices telling you?” Mitlyng asked. “Did you recognize them?”</p><p>“They sounded like people I know,” she said, barely audible. “But I couldn’t tell who they were.”</p><p>“Are you hearing something right now that maybe I wouldn’t hear?” Mitlyng asked.</p><p>Emma fidgeted. For a long while, she didn’t respond. Mitlyng put down her yellow notepad and placed a hand under her chin.</p><p>“I can’t think right now,” Emma said. “I’m scared.”</p><p>“Have you been scared like this before?” Mitlyng asked. She paused and leaned in. “Have you had any thoughts of suicide?”</p><p>“I’ve thought about hanging myself or walking into traffic,” Emma said, tears in her eyes. “But I’m scared about how it would feel.”</p><p>“It’s hard to talk about, isn’t it?” Mitlyng said. “You’re safe here. I promise.” Emma removed her yellow mask and took a sip of water.</p><p>“Do you need a break?” Mitlyng asked. Emma nodded.</p><p>“What can we do for you today to make you more comfortable?” Mitlyng said.</p><p>For the first time, Emma looked up. Her partner had dropped off a letter for her and some clothes, she said. “Let’s see if we can get them to you,” Mitlyng said, standing up. “If you want to talk to me, just let your nurse know. I’m here to talk anytime.”</p><p>Recently, I spoke with a woman named Allison, whose husband spent time in the Em<em>PATH</em> unit where Mitlyng works. Allison first heard of the unit because she works as a nurse at an affiliated hospital. Still, when her husband’s depression suddenly worsened, a few months ago, “I had no idea how to get him help,” she told me. She secured an appointment with a therapist, but it was five weeks away. “I knew we couldn’t wait that long,” she said. Eventually, she took him to the emergency department at Fairview Southdale Hospital; half an hour later, he was in the Em<em>PATH</em> unit. “I felt so sad leaving him,” Allison told me. “The emergency room can be so traumatic, in and of itself, and now he’s going to this psychiatric unit?” Within a few hours, though, a therapist called her to say that Em<em>PATH</em> staff had helped her husband to schedule two appointments for that same week: one with a therapist, and another with a nurse practitioner, who’d be able to prescribe him medication. He was starting to feel better; if they both felt ready, he could come home. “More than anything, it gave me confidence that we could handle this,” she told me.</p><p>For patients who are not immediately discharged, the unit offers forms of therapy that I’ve never encountered in an emergency department. Patients can discuss their goals in the morning, create art in the afternoons, and learn to meditate in the evenings. Sam Atkins, a clinical coördinator who often leads the art groups, told me that, in one exercise, each patient decorates the exterior of a mask with glitter, representing the face they present to the world, and, on the interior, writes about how they really feel. On the day that I visited, they would paint what Atkins called worry stones.</p><p>As a clinical manager walked through the unit, asking patients if they’d like to join, I wondered how people in crisis would respond to something so earnest. Some ignored the invitation, but two men and two women—including Emma, now in a hoodie—gathered around a table that was covered with markers, crayons, paintbrushes, and flat gray stones. “Has anyone made worry stones before?” Atkins asked the group. “They’re fun to decorate and nice to rub if you’re feeling anxious.”</p><p>A tall, bearded man sat down, squirted some black paint onto a stone, and then stood and walked away. Atkins stuck with it: “Does anyone like making art in their spare time?”</p><p>After a long silence, Emma nodded. “Pottery,” she said. She looked around tentatively, then asked, “What about you guys?”</p><p>One of the others, a dark-haired man, looked up. “Sometimes I like painting,” he said. He carefully painted a bird with green feathers, a white breast, and an orange beak onto his stone. “My bird died,” he explained. Across the table, a woman sat with her forehead in her left hand. She half-heartedly dotted a stone with purple paint.</p><p>After half an hour, I helped Atkins put away the art supplies. When I looked back, Emma remained at the table alone. Sunlight poured in through a window, casting her shadow on the mural behind her. She picked up her stone, which she had painted with pink and blue circles, and smiled. Then she got up and walked back to her recliner.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>For the foreseeable future, M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit is likely to lose money. Zeidner wouldn’t tell me exactly how much, but the amount is in the hundreds of thousands each year; he said in an e-mail that the hospital administration “tolerates some of our losses because they appreciate the clinical and human value that Em<em>PATH</em> creates,” and because the unit reduces the need for psychiatric beds, clearing space for a surgical ward. His unit depends in part on donations; elsewhere, Em<em>PATH</em> units have relied on grants from local governments. One unit I contacted had shut down, owing to a shortage of staff.</p><p>Even as the model gains momentum, there is reason to worry that a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/05/how-hospice-became-a-for-profit-hustle?page=8">profit-based medical system</a> can sustain only so much experimentation. For hospitals, an averted admission often means lost revenue; although insurance companies theoretically stand to gain from lower expenditures, they tend to reimburse for discrete one-time assessments, not the kind of holistic care that Em<em>PATH</em> units offer. “Insurers still don’t really understand what this is,” Zeller told me. “They say, ‘O.K., we’ll give you a few hundred dollars to see this patient.’ I’m, like, ‘That doesn’t even cover the security guard.’&nbsp;” Each year, in the United States alone, there are an estimated three-quarters of a million emergency-department visits for mental-health crises; to address the need, hundreds of Em<em>PATH</em> units, each one treating thousands of patients per year, would be required. Zeller is convinced that this can happen. “Every few weeks, I hear from someone wanting to start an Em<em>PATH</em> unit,” he said. “People see that the need is just enormous and the way we do things right now is completely broken.”</p><p>A few weeks after my visit, I reconnected with Mitlyng. I was happy to learn that Emma had improved enough to be discharged shortly after I left, but I was also reminded that, even in the best of circumstances, mental illness can seem intractable. Normally, warmer weather brings an easing of psychiatric emergencies, but for some reason this year the unit was “bursting at the seams,” she told me. “The need feels endless.” In one case, a patient became agitated in the unit and had to be transferred back to the emergency room. In another, a patient with serious substance-use problems refused treatment after his initial symptoms had subsided. “Their families are so desperate to help them,” Mitlyng told me. “We have to say, ‘I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do until they’re ready.’&nbsp;” But, she went on, “then you’ll get one really great experience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it just fills your cup for months.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Mitlyng told me about a young woman who’d come to the unit with intensifying alcohol use and thoughts of suicide. She’d often considered rehab, but needed a special evaluation before insurance would pay for it, and didn’t know how to get one on her own. When she finally came to Em<em>PATH</em>, she told Mitlyng, “If I don’t get this under control, I know I’m going to die.” Mitlyng helped her get the evaluation, but the woman started having second thoughts: she felt better and was anxious about what rehab would be like. Hoping to persuade her, Mitlyng called several facilities to make sure that they had a spot open. Then she brought over a laptop, and, together, she and the patient looked at photos of the centers. If she wanted, Mitlyng told her, she could go straight from the Em<em>PATH</em> unit to whichever facility she preferred. She called the woman’s father and asked him to bring a suitcase with some clothing. Eventually, the woman decided to do it. In moments like those, Mitlyng told me, “I’m caring for people the way I always wanted to.”</p><p>When I first heard about Em<em>PATH</em> units, I assumed that their main contribution to mental-health care was empathy. This isn’t wrong, but it is incomplete. In my experience, nearly every caregiver aims to show empathy; the question is whether, in an emergency, we have the space and time to do so. In Minnesota, I started to think that the Em<em>PATH</em> unit’s real innovation is a structural shift in how we think about space and time. We usually consider drugs, devices, and procedures the kinds of medical care that make a difference, but <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/what-should-hang-on-the-walls-of-a-hospital">physical spaces can be therapeutic</a>, too. It’s also easy to forget that, in a crisis, every minute matters. Once a patient reaches an Em<em>PATH</em> unit, there are no waiting rooms: even if a patient is in line for a transfer to a longer-term facility, she is receiving care while she waits. “You have to capitalize on the moments when someone is motivated to change,” Mitlyng said. “You never know if you’ll get another chance.” What had appeared unusual about M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit started to seem intuitive, even obvious: beautify bare walls, maximize natural light, strike a balance between privacy and company. A patient with choices—even small ones, like which snack to take from a snack bar—may wind up feeling a little better.</p><p>The hospital where I work doesn’t have an Em<em>PATH</em> unit. Even so, many of the model’s underlying principles seem within reach, if only health systems broaden their definition of care. Not long ago, I treated a man who needed urgent mental-health care. He spent several moody, agitated days in a windowless room in the emergency department. He slept in the afternoons and tried to roam the halls at night; on my morning rounds, I would orient him to the date and time as he worked on breakfast, much of it landing on his hospital gown. But, a few days into his stay, a bed opened up in a sunlit room with a large window, a view of the East River, and a friendly roommate. On opposite sides of a blue curtain, the two patients synched their televisions, and, when I entered the room after that, I often found myself interrupting lively conversations. He improved quickly. On the morning that I told him I thought he was ready to leave the hospital, he seemed excited but apprehensive. As I left the room, I heard his roommate say, “You got this—I’ll be rooting for you.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>A kind stranger (Igor Iranto) wrote up a <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/debugging-in-vim-with-vimspector-4n0m">really nice tutorial</a> which is well worth a read.</p>

<p>In order to follow along at home, have a read of
<a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/demo-setup.html">these instructions</a>. They cover installing Vimspector and
overview configuring it to debug Vim, as an example of a C program.</p>

<p>See also the detailed <a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector/">configuration documentation</a> and the
<a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector/schema/">JSON schema</a> covering the <code>.vimspector.json</code> and <code>.gadgets.json</code>
formats.</p>

<h2 id="ui-overview">UI Overview</h2>

<p>When starting debugging, vimspector creates a new tab page with 5 main sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code window</li>
  <li>The scopes window</li>
  <li>The watch window</li>
  <li>The call stack window.</li>
  <li>The output window</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-overview.png" alt="Overview"></p>

<h2 id="the-code-window">The code window</h2>

<p>This window has 2 elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The debug toolbar (WinBar), and</li>
  <li>The code buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the code buffer, the current line is highlighted with a sign. When selecting a stack frame in the call stack, the code window is updated to display the current line in that stack frame:</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-code-window.png" alt="Code Window"></p>

<p>You can even get a pop up with the vaue of the expression under the cursor.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-variable-eval-hover.png" alt="Hover"></p>

<h2 id="the-scopes-window">The scopes window</h2>

<p>Displays the variables in different visible scopes. Entries can be expanded by
putting the cursor on the line and pressing <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-locals-window.png" alt="Scopes Window"></p>

<h2 id="the-watch-window">The watch window</h2>

<p>Allows execution and display of arbitrary expressions. This window contains a
prompt buffer. When you enter insert mode (e.g. with <code>i</code>) you can type an
expression. When hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>, the expression is evaluated and the result is
displayed. If the result is has structure, it can be expanded like in the scoped
window by hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>. The little <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> icons show what is
expandable.</p>

<p>Watches are recomputed regularly so update as you’re stepping through code, for
example.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-watch-window.png" alt="Watch Window"></p>

<h2 id="the-call-stack-window">The call stack window</h2>

<p>This shows the call stack for all of the threads in the program.</p>

<p>As with variables, stacks can be expanded and collapsed with <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> and have
little <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> icons where appropriate. In addition, hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> on a
particular stack frame will open the file in the code window and place the
cursor there.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-callstack-window.png" alt="Call Stack"></p>

<h2 id="the-output-window">The output window</h2>

<p>This contains a number of buffers for both monitoring debugger state an interracting with the debugger itself.</p>

<p>The most interesting buffers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Console, which allows for an interactive REPL with most debug adapters,</li>
  <li>The debugee standard error stream, and</li>
  <li>The vimspector log, which allows for debugging when vimspector breaks</li>
</ul>

<p>These windows typically scroll automatically as new content is added asyncronously.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-output-window.png" alt="Code Window"></p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>For most debugging actions, I prefer the keyboard shortcuts, but if you are more
mouse-inclined, the WinBar is quite useful.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of common actions in the code windows. See the <a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector">Vimspector</a>
readme for full details.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The generative AI revolution has been recently expanded
            to videos. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art video models are still lagging behind image models in terms of visual
            quality and user control over the generated content. In this
            work, we present a framework that harnesses the power of
            a text-to-image diffusion model for the task of text-driven
            video editing. Specifically, given a source video and a target
            text-prompt, our method generates a high-quality video that
            adheres to the target text, while preserving the spatial layout and dynamics of the input video. Our method is based
            on our key observation that consistency in the edited video
            can be obtained by enforcing consistency in the diffusion
            feature space. We achieve this by explicitly propagating
            diffusion features based on inter-frame correspondences,
            readily available in the model. Thus, our framework does
            not require any training or fine-tuning, and can work in conjunction with any off-the-shelf text-to-image editing method.
            We demonstrate state-of-the-art editing results on a variety
            of real-world videos.

                We observe that the level of temporal consistency of a video is tightly related to the temporal consistency of its feature representation, as can be seen in the feature visualization below.
                The features of a natural video have a shared, temporally consistent representation. When editing the video per frame, this consistency breaks. Our method ensures the same level of feature consistency as in the original video features.

                Our key finding is that a temporally-consistent edit can be achieved by enforcing consistency on the internal diffusion features across frames during the editing process.
                We achieve this by propagating a small set of edited features across frames, using the correspondences between the original video features.
                Given an input video I, we invert each frame, extract its tokens (i.e., output features from the self-attention modules), and extract inter-frame feature correspondences using a nearest-neighbor (NN) search. At each denoising step:
              </p>
              <ol>
                (I) We sample keyframes from the noisy video J_t and jointly edit them using an extended-attention block. The set of resulting edited tokens is T_base.
                <br>
                (II) We propagate the edited tokens across the video according to the pre-computed correspondences of the original video features.
              </ol>
              To denoise J_t, we feed each frame to the network and replace the generated tokens with the tokens obtained from the propagation step (II).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="E">
		<p>Even if you don’t sign into your Mac using an Apple ID, it still connects to iCloud so long as it has an open internet connection. For many of us, though, iCloud and iCloud Drive are essential features of using Macs and Apple’s devices. They make it easy to share passwords, photos, documents we’re working on, and much more. This article explains the basics of how iCloud and particularly iCloud Drive now work, and provides a new version of my free utility Cirrus to help you investigate them.</p>
<p>iCloud is descended from a long series of features in older versions of Mac OS, going back to iTools in January 2000. It’s currently divided into two main functional services: <strong>CloudKit</strong> to handle databases, and <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> for storage of files. These appear to be implemented in the same vast distributed databases served by Apple’s own data centres and those of third-parties including Amazon’s AWS. macOS also includes some specialist tasks relying on iCloud such as the Find My service, and App Store apps are able to synchronise small shared dictionaries of key-value pairs such as preferences in an Ubiquitous Key-Value store.</p>
<h4>CloudKit</h4>
<p>This supports structured cloud-based databases, including the synchronisation of Core Data containers through Persistent CloudKit Container private databases. This is exceedingly complex, and uses the com.apple.cloudkit sub-system and the <code>cloudd</code> service in macOS.</p>
<p>When used to synchronise a Core Data container for an app’s database, changes to a local container are scheduled to be synchronised up to iCloud by the DAS-CTS dispatch system, and that’s performed in the background when conditions allow. Because of the time elapsed between the app making a change and it being synchronised up by CloudKit, tracing entries in the log can be difficult.</p>
<p>CloudKit is used extensively by bundled apps like Notes, by many third-party apps that keep their data in iCloud so it can be shared between different Macs and devices, and more. It also hosts some important system services for macOS, including the online app notarization database, one of the most important iCloud services to work without an Apple ID.</p>
<p>CloudKit services are controlled for macOS features in iCloud settings, in System Settings &gt; [Apple ID] &gt; iCloud. Third-party apps may place their control in the app’s settings, but they’re also combined with iCloud Drive access in the iCloud Drive settings: open those and click on the <strong>Apps syncing to iCloud Drive</strong> item at the foot of that dialog to see a full list and control their access to iCloud as a whole.</p>

<h4>iCloud Drive</h4>
<p>In contrast to CloudKit, iCloud Drive is far easier to deal with, and to understand, as it’s largely in the control of the user, and its actions are readily observable. When you copy or move a file to your Mac’s iCloud Drive, the com.apple.clouddocs sub-system and <code>bird</code> service upload that file to your iCloud Drive, then synchronise the information held in iCloud with that on each connected Mac and device.</p>
<p>Another sub-system in macOS is responsible for dividing blobs of data into the chunks used in iCloud storage: com.apple.mmcs reveals its ancient origins in its name of MobileMe Chunk Storage, or MMCS.</p>
<h4>iCloud Drive local paths</h4>
<p>If you’re using iCloud Drive <em>without</em> putting Desktop &amp; Documents Folders into iCloud, your own iCloud Drive folders will be found in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. This roughly corresponds to the top level of iCloud Drive as seen in the Finder. However, macOS adds other folders that are actually located in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/.</p>
<p>If you have enabled Desktop &amp; Documents Folders with iCloud Drive, those folders don’t include your Documents and Desktop folders. There are several ways to locate them, including following the symlink placed in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs (useful for Documents only, as no symlink is created for the Desktop), or by opening those folders from the top level of your Home folder. This can become extremely confusing because of discrepancies between what’s shown in the Finder, and what can be seen elsewhere. This is all part of the illusion created by macOS with iCloud Drive.</p>
<h4>iCloud Drive controls</h4>
<p>There are four controls available for iCloud Drive, in addition to that giving access to third-party apps (above):</p>
<ul>
<li>iCloud Drive switch, in iCloud &gt; iCloud Drive;</li>
<li>Desktop &amp; Documents Folders switch, immediately below that;</li>
<li>Optimise Mac Storage switch, at the top of the main iCloud settings;</li>
<li>the Finder’s contextual menu for the contents of iCloud Drive, allowing you to Download Now or Remove Download.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storing the whole of the contents of the Desktop &amp; Documents folders is an attractive solution for those with limited space for their Home folders, particularly when used in combination with Optimise Mac Storage. It has two potential drawbacks, though. It’s easy for the total stored in the two folders to exceed available free space, which prevents the contents from being properly backed up and can cause a crisis should you need to download most or all of what’s stored in iCloud Drive. Should you want to turn off Desktop &amp; Documents Folders, you must plan that carefully to cope with the resulting removal of local files.</p>
<p>Enabling Optimise Mac Storage lets macOS determine which files in iCloud Drive will be stored locally as well <em>(downloaded),</em> and which will be removed from local storage and only kept in iCloud <em>(evicted).</em> While the wording displayed might suggest that eviction is only performed when local free space becomes low, that isn’t accurate, and macOS may decide to evict files that haven’t been accessed for a long while, and others seemingly at random.</p>
<p>Immediately after a file is added to iCloud Drive, it’s both stored locally and kept in sync with the copy uploaded to iCloud storage. When that file is evicted, a stub file is kept in its local place, whose name is identical with the addition of a prefix of a stop/period. The stub file is very small by comparison, and because its name starts with a stop/period, the stub file itself is hidden, although the Finder shows the original file name with an evicted icon next to it. Stub files also retain the extended attributes of the original file, together with the special extended attribute of type com.apple.icloud.itemName containing the name of the original file. Evicted files behave differently, as they can’t be searched by Spotlight, and can’t be backed up by Time Machine, as I’ll discuss in future articles. They also lack a QuickLook preview.</p>
<h4>Logs</h4>
<p>Custom log browsers for iCloud are available in Cirrus and <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/mints-a-multifunction-utility/">Mints</a>. These distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>com.apple.clouddocs reporting transactions for iCloud Drive,</li>
<li>com.apple.cloudkit reporting transactions for CloudKit,</li>
<li>com.apple.mmcs chunking data for iCloud storage,</li>
<li><code>cloudd</code> and <code>bird</code>, as the services for CloudKit and iCloud Drive respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obtain a similar extract using the predicate<br>
<code>subsystem == "com.apple.clouddocs" OR subsystem == "com.apple.cloudkit" OR subsystem == "com.apple.mmcs" OR processImagePath CONTAINS[c] "cloudd" OR processImagePath CONTAINS[c] "bird" OR processID = 0</code><br>
with <code>log show</code>.</p>
<h4>Cirrus</h4>
<p>One of the problems with using the Finder to try to understand what’s going on with iCloud Drive is that it has a habit of changing the status of documents there. If you open a folder of evicted documents in the Finder, macOS starts downloading some or all of them if it can. One way to work around this is to use the custom browser built into my free utility Cirrus, which also features a simple test of uploading a 1 MB file to iCloud Drive.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to provide a new version of Cirrus, 1.13, which is now fully updated to work with recent versions of macOS including Sonoma. It’s available from here: <a title="cirrus113" href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/cirrus113.zip">cirrus113</a><br>
from <strong>Downloads</strong> above, from <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/cirrus-bailiff/">its Product Page</a>, and via its auto-update mechanism.</p>
<p>Its menu bar companion Bailiff is no longer as useful as it has been in the past, now that you can evict items in the Finder. I will be assessing it further to see if there is any value in updating it as well.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Egregoria</h2>
<p dir="auto">Egregoria is an indie city builder, mostly inspired by Cities:Skylines.<br>
Each individual has its own thought model, meaning every action has its importance and influences the environment.<br>
Egregoria is focused on the socio-economical aspect of a city, with a logistics element.
The game is still in early development, but you can already play it and give some feedback through
<a href="https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria/issues">issues</a> or on <a href="https://discord.gg/CAaZhUJ" rel="nofollow">discord</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By being open source, the hope is to get more people involved in the development of the game.<br>
Mod support is wanted but the design has not been found yet.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to play</h2>
<p dir="auto">A small tutorial is available on the github wiki to get you started.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Devblog</h2>
<p dir="auto">I keep a blog about Egregoria's development <a href="http://douady.paris/blog/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the project</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git LFS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This project uses Git LFS to track assets, therefore if you want to build your own copy you will need to install <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, you should be able to clone the repo and fetch the assets:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria
cd Egregoria
git lfs pull"><pre>git clone https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria
<span>cd</span> Egregoria
git lfs pull</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows/Mac</h3>
<p dir="auto">I personally use Windows 10 and Mac OS 10.11, and it compiles fine once the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">rust toolchain is installed</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Don't forget to add the <code>--release</code> flag, otherwise the game will be very slow.<br>
Don't forget to pull the lfs files, otherwise the game will crash with a file not found error.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ubuntu/Debian on x11</h3>
<p dir="auto">There are a few libraries to install that some of my dependencies need:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libx11-dev
cargo run --release"><pre><code>sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libx11-dev
cargo run --release
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Don't forget to add the <code>--release</code> flag, otherwise the game will be very slow.<br>
Don't forget to pull the lfs files, otherwise the game will crash with a file not found error.</p>
<p dir="auto">A GitHub Action tests the builds on Ubuntu.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Egregoria ?</h2>
<p dir="auto">An Egregor is an autonomous psychic entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people.<br>
It represents emergence at its purest form, where individuals come together to become a collective force.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2>

His mother in particular instilled a love of learning, in part motivated by the fact that her own family lacked the money to continue her education beyond grade school.</p><p>“She told me that when I was a baby and she used to wheel me in a carriage around McGill, she told me that I would go there,” he said in an <a href="https://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/139/1/Marcus_OHO.pdf" target="_blank"><u>oral history</u></a> collected by Caltech in 1993. (She was right: he earned both his bachelor’s degree and doctorate at the prestigious Montreal university.)</p><p>He was drawn to puzzles as a child, and has often described his approach to science as a decades-long continuation of the childlike pleasure of teasing a solution from once-scattered parts.</p><p>“The main thing is finding something that you enjoy doing, that preferably doesn’t harm others, and that tests whatever aptitude one has, that tests one’s ingenuity,” he said. “It’s almost like a kind of a game. You against nature.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>In a Twitter thread, a <strong><em>Shopify (TSX: SHOP)</em></strong> employee has broken their non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to shed light on the company’s controversial actions and strategic direction. The thread exposed a series of events starting from the first quarter of 2022 when Shopify promised job security to its staff, only to carry out massive layoffs in July of the same year. </p>



<p>These job cuts, according to the employee, were driven not merely by a CEO’s misguided “bet,” but rather a shift towards replacing full-time employees with cheaper contract labor and an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) support.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WOW: A <a href="https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shopify</a> employee is violating their NDA to tell us that <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tobi</a>:</p><p>-has been quietly firing their global customer service team across US, Canada and Ireland<br>-is about to replace them with AI chatbots</p><p>Good luck to all Shopify shop owners out there — shit’s about to SUCK. <a href="https://t.co/TwizyV0waP">https://t.co/TwizyV0waP</a></p></div>— Nandini Jammi (@nandoodles) <a href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1681694042256449536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Last week, Shopify announced its upcoming launch of an artificial intelligence assistant called “Sidekick” for merchants using its platform, joining the ranks of other tech companies introducing similar features. In a video shared on Twitter, Lutke demonstrated how the “Sidekick” assistant, accessible through a button on Shopify, will be capable of responding to merchant inquiries, providing information on sales trends, and more.</p>



<p>The tweet series further detailed how Shopify has been aggressively embracing AI technology, using it for various purposes, from generating product descriptions to creating virtual sidekicks and developing a new help center AI agent still in beta testing. CEO Tobi Lutke’s public statements on Twitter illustrated his belief that companies can achieve higher revenues with fewer employees, signaling a desire to cut costs and please shareholders.</p>



<p>However, the consequences of this cost-cutting strategy have negatively impacted customer satisfaction. The reduction in staff and the rise of outsourced, cheap contract labor have led to significant delays in customer support, leaving frustrated merchants waiting for hours or even struggling to receive clear answers. Additionally, teams responsible for monitoring fraudulent stores have been overwhelmed, leading to a potential increase in the number of scam businesses on the platform.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5. Tobi has hardly been discreet about his plans, sharing a graph on Twitter that illustrated how, over the years, companies required fewer workers to make $1 million in revenue: <a href="https://t.co/WHc8tu3ufx">https://t.co/WHc8tu3ufx</a></p>— Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) <a href="https://twitter.com/sh0p1fyj03/status/1681673992476717057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The employee’s Twitter thread also raised concerns about the well-being of Shopify’s workforce. Since the layoffs, remaining staff members have reportedly faced increased workloads without proportional compensation or benefits, leading to burnout, anxiety, and stress leave. Despite these issues being brought to leadership’s attention, they were dismissed as “system” problems, and the company’s focus on AI-based solutions appeared to supersede the value once placed on human-driven customer service.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the thread highlighted Shopify’s apparent shift in target market focus. Previously known for supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, Shopify now seems to prioritize larger players, as its revenue model relies heavily on payment transactions rather than subscription software.</p>



<p>The drastic changes in Shopify’s approach have led both employees and customers to question the company’s integrity and commitment to its original mission of empowering small businesses. Many see the company as straying from its roots, becoming more akin to the corporate giants it once aimed to oppose.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">16. “Once we know how to fix the system, we will invest heavily in tooling, including tooling to help Support folks do their jobs better and tooling to help our merchants get answers to questions more quickly without having to talk to a human being”.</p>— Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) <a href="https://twitter.com/sh0p1fyj03/status/1681674028681920514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shopify’s leadership, including President Harley Finkelstein, has assured employees there will be no further layoffs. However, the company’s actions and secretive handling of layoffs under the veil of NDAs have caused employees to doubt these promises.</p>



<p>Despite multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year, management compensation at Shopify appears to have been largely unaffected.</p>



<p>In a regulatory filing made in May, Shopify revealed that Lutke collected just over $20.0 million in total compensation in 2022, on par with the $20.0 million he collected in 2021, and an increase over the $15.1 million he made in 2020.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With public scrutiny growing and concerns over its corporate values and business model mounting, Shopify faces a significant challenge in restoring trust and addressing the impact of its decisions on both employees and customers. </p>



<p>Shopify last traded at $89.91 on the TSX.</p>

						<p>Alex Tabarrok <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html">writes about how</a> “when the FDA fails to approve a good drug, people die but the bodies are buried in an invisible graveyard.” I’d like to make that graveyard a little bit more visible because I’m going to be buried in it, in a few weeks or months. A squamous cell carcinoma tumor appeared on my tongue last September; the surgery for it occurred in October, followed by radiation in December – January, but the tumor reappeared at the base of my tongue in April. A massive surgery on May 25 appeared to produce “clean margins” (that is, no tumor cells remained where the surgeon operated), albeit at huge cost: I have no tongue any more, just a “flap” of muscle where it used to be, and no ability to swallow solid foods ever again. Monday I’m starting chemotherapy, but that’s almost certainly going to fail, because a CT scan shows four to six new gross tumors, four in my neck and two, possibly, in my lungs.</p>
<p>So what <em>might</em> help me? MRNA tumor vaccines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are notoriously treatment resistant, and mRNA vaccines have shown huge promise. Why aren’t they happening faster? Because the FDA is slow. There are some trials underway (<a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-4359-P101">here is one</a> from Moderna; <a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-2752-P101">here is another</a>), and, although I’m trying to enroll, I may be too late, since my cancer moves so aggressively. The FDA was loathe to approve initial mRNA human trials, even when those trials would have been full of people like me: those who are facing death sentences anyway.</p>
<p>Here is one story, from “<a href="https://www.fdareview.org/issues/why-the-fda-has-an-incentive-to-delay-the-introduction-of-new-drugs/">Why the FDA Has an Incentive to Delay the Introduction of New Drugs</a>:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1980s, when I headed the team at the FDA that was reviewing the NDA for recombinant human insulin, . . . we were ready to recommend approval a mere four months after the application was submitted (at a time when the average time for NDA review was more than two and a half years). With quintessential bureaucratic reasoning, my supervisor refused to sign off on the approval—even though he agreed that the data provided compelling evidence of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. “If anything goes wrong,” he argued, “think how bad it will look that we approved the drug so quickly.” (41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that delaying mRNA cancer vaccines kills people like me.</p>
<p>We need to have a much stronger “right to try” presumption: “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/relyvrio-als-fda-approval">When Dying Patients Want Unproven Drugs</a>,” we should let those patients try. I have weeks to months left; let’s try whatever there is to try, and advance medicine along the way. The “right to try” is part of fundamental freedom—and this is particularly true for palliative-stage patients without a route to a cure anyway. They are risking essentially nothing.</p>
<p>When I am dead and buried at least those who I love and who love me will know the FDA protected me and millions of others like me from ourselves. Thanks, FDA. But the dead do not vote and do not agitate for change, so the system is likely to grind on.</p>
<p>In computer science there is a convention in which one’s first program prints “Hello, world.” Now it is my turn to write “Goodbye, world.” I’m crying as I write this and am sorry to have to go so soon. I have to give back the gift, though with great sadness.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve just learnt the hard way that the most important coding habits are not readability, consistency, organisation or <a href="https://hackernoon.com/few-simple-rules-for-good-coding-my-15-years-experience-96cb29d4acd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any of the things that make our code better</a>. No, the most important habits are those that enable us to enjoy this craft for years and decades to come.</p>



<p>I’m writing this lying down, recovering from a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation" target="_blank">slipped disc (spinal disc herniation</a>) that’s a result of far too long hunched over a keyboard. I’ve tried to take steps to improve my posture over the last few years but alas, I let good habits slip and I’ve been taught a lesson.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" data-attachment-id="200" data-permalink="https://puppycoding.com/2023/07/22/healthy-coding-habits/back_mri/" data-orig-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp" data-orig-size="1200,675" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="back_mri" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=300" data-large-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=1024" src="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=1024" alt="MRI scan of the spine showing a spinal disc hernia, bulging out and pushing against the spinal nerve." srcset="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=1024 1024w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=150 150w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=300 300w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp?w=768 768w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/back_mri.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>A slipped disc doesn’t actually mean a spinal disc has been dislodged. It’s actually when a disc, usually near the base of the spine, develops a bulge which sticks out and presses against the spinal nerve. It’s as painful as it sounds (and then some!), and also causes tingling and pain in the legs too. At times it’s made me unable to move and unable to sleep. Recovery takes weeks or months, although surgery is also an option.</p>



<p>It could happen to any of us if we develop unhealthy habits when programming, with the strain on our backs building up over time. And so, fellow keyboard warrior, here are some steps I encourage you to take to avoid this pain.</p>



<h2>Daily stretches</h2>



<p>According to my chiropractor, sitting for long periods of time had led to my stomach and thigh muscles being relatively unused, and therefore unable to assist my back in supporting my body, putting it under extra strain. Although strength-building exercises would be best, just doing daily central and lower body stretches would have a positive effect. The muscles would be more supple and more able to help support the body.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="689" data-attachment-id="206" data-permalink="https://puppycoding.com/2023/07/22/healthy-coding-habits/yoga-stretching/" data-orig-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp" data-orig-size="1200,689" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="yoga-stretching" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=300" data-large-file="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=1024" src="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=1024" alt="Photo of a man outside on a terrace, stretching forward in a yoga pose." srcset="https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=1024 1024w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=150 150w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=300 300w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp?w=768 768w, https://puppycodingcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/yoga-stretching.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You don’t have to suddenly become a yoga fanatic (although you can if you want!). Just regular stretches in the morning or after a hot bath in the evening, when the body is relaxed, should make a big difference.</p>



<h2>Take regular breaks</h2>



<p>This is so simple but so important –&nbsp;at least once an hour get up and take a short walk or some other non-screen activity. Not only is this an easy way to look after your body, I’ve often found that it helps with coding too. So many times I’ve been stuck on a problem, done something completely different, and then come back to the problem with an idea of something new to try.</p>



<p>I feel like this is something we all know we should do, but often hard to put into practice. Time to make it a habit!</p>



<h2>Don’t code late at night</h2>



<p>I think we’re all guilty of this, sometimes even turning it into a boast – “I pulled an all-nighter!” Surely it’s time we change this attitude. Our code is worse, even harmful, when we’re really tired, and we naturally concentrate less on our posture leading to being hunched over the keyboard for hours. Please set a time past which you will switch off, mentally and physically, and be strict with it.</p>



<h2>Improve your coding environment</h2>



<p>I have a laptop stand and ergonomic chair, both of which make sitting at my desk much more comfortable, but even with those I still ending up suffering with back pain. I’ve heard so many recommendations for a standing desk that at last, I’m making the switch.</p>



<p>Currently I just have a temporary setup of a small table on top of my desk, but already I can feel I move around more than when I sit, without really feeling more tired. It also naturally leads to taking more breaks so it’s a 2-in-1 habit!</p>



<p>I don’t know why it took me so long to realise the importance of this and all the other habits, and I wish I’d fixed my ways earlier. Now I’ve paid the price but hopefully it’s not too late for you, especially if you’re in the early stages of your career. </p>



<p>Please learn from my mistakes and enjoy many happy years of healthy coding!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="nh">
          <main>
            <article><p>Today we seem to be living through a war on passwords. This is manifested in
various ways; in its most passive form, it takes the form of people blogging
about how passwords are bad. The more material changes are the general trend
towards no longer treating passwords as a sufficient condition for access in
favour of either mandatory “2FA” or, where 2FA is not used, <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/logindenial">risk-based
authentication</a>, in which some extra authentication step is
non-deterministically and randomly demanded.</p>
<p>This step is commonly something like “enter the code in an email we just sent”
when trying to login. Since this process is literally the same as most password
recovery processes, it raises the question of what the point of a password is
in the first place if you always have to go through this process when trying to
login.</p>
<p>Often this will be combined with fallacious notions such as “remember this
device”, the idea being you only have to go through all this the first time when
logging in from a particular device. This idea is fallacious because the web
has no notion of a “device”, and this is a <em>very intentional design choice</em>
made for privacy purposes. We are literally living through the gradual
phase-out of third-party cookies, amongst other functionality, specifically to
try and prevent this sort of thing, so why do web developers persist in
believing in this fiction of a “device”? My own browser erases all cookies from
an origin immediately after the last tab from that origin is closed, so these
sites are convinced I am logging in from a new “device” every single time, and
then demand I respond to one of these challenge emails.</p>
<p>Essentially these sites consider passwords so worthless as a form of security
that they essentially don't meaningfully allow people to have one anymore. The
login flow and the password recovery flow are essentially the same, the UI just
pretends otherwise. Other examples include PayPal, where you can literally
enter a credit card number to prove your identity and reset your password(!).
In other words, knowing your credit card number is considered a stronger or
equal proof of identity than either knowing your password or being able to
receive an email.<a href="#fn1" id="fn1b"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>While at the same time every website for the masses now seems to be designed
around the assumption that everyone is going to set their password to
“password1”, web-based HTTP APIs are also widely popular nowadays. These
services almost invariably perform authentication via use of a token or “API
key”.</p>
<p>An API key is basically a password, except that it is randomly generated by a
website with a large amount of entropy and thus assumed to be secure. A given
website might obnoxiously refuse to trust in my ability to set a secure
password, assume the 24-character randomly generated password I keep in my
password safe is insecure, and demand I complete an email challenge every time
I login because I actually bother to exercise control over browser privacy and
persistent cookies, yet that same website is happy to let me authenticate using
an API key for API access as a single authentication step. No “2FA” here.</p>
<p>API keys are used to secure the highest-stakes APIs that exist today — all of
AWS's services, for example. Yet while API keys seem to be considered an
entirely reasonable and industry standard design approach, passwords are now
considered the unwelcome black sheep whose role as a sufficient criterion for
authentication is viewed with increasing dubiousness. (Moreover, all website
login schemes ultimately rely on some kind of session cookie, which is similar
to an API key in the sense that it is a high-entropy site-issued bearer token.
In other words, all website authentication schemes, “2FA” or not, ultimately
rely on the ability of a client to be enrolled in and use high-entropy
site-issued bearer authentication tokens as the sole criterion of access.<a href="#fn2" id="fn2b"><sup>2</sup></a>)</p>
<p>The fundamental premise is the same: provide token, gain access. It seems to me
that the basic problem here with passwords is that passwords are assumed to
have been chosen by users and users are assumed to be bad at choosing good
passwords.</p>
<p>There are agreed best practices for the handling of passwords, namely, to not
reuse passwords between accounts, use randomly generated passwords, and keep
those unique passwords for each account in a password safe. This raises the
question: if the industry agrees this is the (more or less only) correct way to
handle passwords, why actually allow users to set their own passwords?</p>
<p>Rather than allowing a user to set their own password, passwords can be issued
in exactly the same way as API keys are now: a high-entropy password is
randomly generated by the issuing website, and the user is shown the password
once only and asked to record it. If the password is lost, a new password must
be generated using the same process. The user cannot choose their password, but
can get a new randomly generated one in the event of compromise. The password
essentially becomes indistinguishable from an API key.</p>
<p>If we consider the password safe usage model to be the only reasonable way to
use passwords properly, there doesn't really seem to be any reason to allow any
other usage model than this. There's not really a good reason for a user to be
able to set their own password unless they want to set their password to
something lower in entropy to make it memorable, or reuse it between sites,
both of which are deviations from the “best practice” password safe usage
model.</p>
<p>With this model of password issuance, there is less need to constantly
second-guess the user's security with hazardous approaches like risk-based
authentication. Interestingly, however, it can be argued that this model is in
effect already widely deployed: namely in the form of TOTP “2FA” support.</p>
<p>In enrolling in TOTP-based 2FA with a website, you are given a high-entropy
randomly-generated secret and, for subsequent logins, are required to prove
possession of this secret. In other words, it's a site-generated
non-customisable “password” in much the same vein as I propose above. Moreover,
sites which support TOTP usually use a user's enablement of it as a “not an
idiot” flag and disable any non-deterministic risk-based authentication
mechanisms they may use for people without TOTP enabled. This is congruent
with my premise above that guaranteed use of a high-entropy secret obviates
the need for additional authentication.</p>
<p>Since the user-specified password functionality is now seemingly so distrusted
as a widespread industry practice, it raises the question of why not just
either use only TOTP for login, or issue a password in the same way that TOTP
secrets are issued: randomly and non-customisably.</p>
<p>The only discernible difference between TOTP and a site-generated password is
in how knowledge of the secret is proven. With TOTP, knowledge of the secret is
proven without sending it to the website. With a site-generated password,
knowledge of the secret is proven by sending that secret to the website. This
is a slight security benefit to TOTP. It doesn't seem to provide any useful
security against a compromised or impersonating website (an impersonating
website can just forward the TOTP challenge value to the real website and use
it to login as the user), so its main benefit seems to be to avoid having the
device the user is logging in as be able to glean the secret, in the event that
device is compromised. This is a potential upside, though since on successful
login the compromised client device has access to anything gated by that login
anyway, the benefit seems dubious.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that TOTP ultimately can be viewed as just another
secret authentication token, like a password, yet is widely referred to as
“2FA”. Having two passwords isn't “2FA”; 2FA about having authenticators from
two different categories of {what you have, what you know, what you are}.</p>
<p>If TOTP is used “correctly”, meaning that the TOTP secret is enrolled onto a
different device than the one that contains your password safe, 2FA is more or
less realised — arguably. (You could also argue it's two copies of “what you
know” but with data partitioned between two devices which are unlikely to be
simultaneously compromised. This demonstrates that the {what you have, what you
know, what you are} triad is not necessarily the be all and end all of
authentication scheme security level classification.)</p>
<p>Of course, you don't necessarily know if someone is using TOTP “correctly”. For
example, whenever I register on some random site which offers TOTP, I enable it
and then put the TOTP secret in the same password safe that contains the
equally high-entropy password I chose. This seemingly pointless act is
obviously not 2FA. The reason I do this is for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>it seems to increasingly serve as an “I'm not an idiot” flag and disable
stochastic risk-based authentication based around an assumption people
can't choose secure passwords, in which I might randomly be asked to
an additional challenge the potential necessity of which was not
documented at registration time, and which I may or may not be able to
complete, potentially resulting in account lockout;</p>
</li>
<li><p>it often seems to effectively disable password recovery flows, or at
least render them moot, making account recovery more difficult. Since
I don't lose my secrets I'm happy to assume responsibility for the
possibility of permanently locking myself out in exchange for higher
account security and disabling email as the “master key to all accounts”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While my own usage patterns are probably somewhat esoteric, in general it's
expected people will store TOTP secrets on a smartphone. However this again
raises questions about whether it really is “2FA” when you consider many people
may be accessing a website from their smartphone in the first place. In fact,
it's likely that a lot of TOTP-based “2FA” is not really 2FA at all because the
user's browser and password safe (e.g. the browser's built in saved password
functionality) and TOTP secret are on the same device and both instances of
“what you know”.</p>
<p>This isn't the only case of websites demanding “2FA”-that-isn't. Many supposed
cases of “2FA” are really 1FA where the single factor required for
authentication is considered to lie in a better category than “what you know”,
or where there are two factors at first glance, but one factor can be used to
reset the other factor.</p>
<p>For example, a site which requires a password and email verification for each
login is not 2FA if access to the same email account can be used to reset the
password; this scheme is no more secure than just requiring email verification
per login. Another example is if a site tries to insist on verifying logins
using SMS messages sent to a user's phone number. Since this (particularly bad)
design is based on the false premise that a user's phone number is more secure
than an email account or any password, such sites will often allow a reset of
all the other factors (like a password) by access to this phone number alone.
This is quite literally 1FA, just with a different single factor.</p>


<p>This again seems to reinforce that the major benefit of pushing people to
enable TOTP is to actually have them adopt a secure “password” and not actually
“2FA”, which is often not actually realised.</p>
<hr>
<p>1. Fun fact: Effectively only 5
digits of your credit card number are secret. PCI standards consider the last
four digits of your credit card number as non-secret — which is why every
e-commerce website is allowed to constantly quote those last four digits back
to you so you know what card they're talking about. What is less known is that
the same standard also specifies that the first 6 digits are also not
sensitive. This means that PCI compliance is fundamentally about protecting the
remaining 6 digits of a 16-digit credit card number. However, the last digit of
a credit card number is of course a check digit, which means of the possible 6
digit values, only 10% can be conceivably valid, meaning that effectively only
5 digits are really secret. This means PayPal allows your password to be reset
given knowledge of a 5 decimal digit secret. <a href="#fn1b">⏎</a></p>

<p>2. After being locked out of one account
by risk-based authentication, while still having access from another, I have
sometimes idly contemplated copying persistent cookies between machines. This
kind of lockout situation in which a password is not enough is particularly
ironic if I happen to have chosen a password which actually has higher entropy
than a site's session cookie. <a href="#fn2b">⏎</a></p>
