The policy also goes beyond the general communications gag order that already prevents any CDC scientist from submitting any new scientific findings to the public. </span></p><p><span>The edict applies to both any previously submitted manuscript under consideration and those accepted but not yet published. For example, if CDC scientists previously submitted a manuscript to </span><em>The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association, </em><span>or any other publication, the article must be stopped and reviewed. (These are hypothetical, but are examples of major journals where CDC officials often publish.)</span></p><p><span>How many manuscripts are affected is unclear, but it could be many. Most manuscripts include simple demographic information about the populations or patients studied, which typically includes gender (and which is frequently used interchangeably with sex). That means just about any major study would fall under the censorship regime of the new policy, including studies on Covid-19, cancer, heart disease, </span><em>or anything else,</em><span> let alone anything that the administration considers to be “woke ideology.” </span></p><p>Meanwhile, chaos and fear are already guiding decisions. While the policy is only meant to apply to work that might be seen as conflicting with President Trump’s executive orders, CDC experts don’t know how to interpret that. Do papers that describe disparities in health outcomes fall into “woke ideology” or not? Nobody knows, and everyone is scared that they’ll be fired. This is leading to what Germans call “vorauseilender Gehorsam,” or “preemptive obedience,” as one non-CDC scientist commented. </p><p>“I’ve got colleagues pulling papers over Table 1 concerns,” an official told me. (Table 1 refers to basic demographic information about the study populations included in research papers, rather than actual results.) Indeed, many studies include demographic information about sexual orientation. For example, a study describing mpox outcomes would likely include basic statistics in tables summarizing the percentage of patients who were vaccinated and were lesbian, gay, transgender, or otherwise. This information can be highly impactful during an outbreak, as it helps clinicians develop policies on who to vaccinate (given limited doses, as is the case with mpox), and even to whom scarce and limited supplies of tests and treatments should be offered to maximize benefits. </p><p>It is not necessarily the case that researchers who have submitted articles but who have not yet received an official decision from a journal need to actively recall them, however. But if a journal sends an article back for revisions, the authors would at that point have to cleanse the document of any “problematic language.” Of course, at that point, the gag order already in place would halt any resubmission. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>What can and cannot go forward appears to require approval by a Trump political appointee, an explicit requirement for any public health communications under the Trump Administration’s gag order. That’s slowing many things down. At present, there is only one political appointee in the entire CDC, acting Director Susan Monarez (plus her personal assistant, who is not a scientist). It’s unclear if some decisions may be devolved to lower officials. For example, if a paper is pulled because it simply mentions gender, it is unknown if anyone other than Monarez possesses the authority to approve its resubmission. </p><p>“How can one person vet all of this?” another official asked, “especially one who, [like Monarez], came from an agency of, what, 130 people?”</p><p>And yet, that seems to be the theme of the new administration: a few privileged individuals have been handed enormous authority, creating a backlog of decisions that may end up being fairly arbitrarily determined.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>On December 17, 1962,&nbsp; <em>Life International</em> published <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341189675_Is_Einstein's_Puzzle_Over-Specified">a logic puzzle</a> consisting of 15 sentences describing five houses on a street. Each sentence was a clue, such as “The Englishman lives in the red house” or “Milk is drunk in the middle house.” Each house was a different color, with inhabitants of different nationalities, who owned different pets, and so on. The story’s headline asked: “Who Owns the Zebra?” Problems like this one have proved to be a measure of the abilities — limitations, actually — of today’s machine learning models.</p>
<p>Also known as Einstein’s puzzle or riddle (likely an apocryphal attribution), the problem tests a certain kind of multistep reasoning. <a href="https://nouhadziri.github.io/">Nouha Dziri</a>, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and her colleagues recently set transformer-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to work on such tasks — and largely found them wanting. “They might not be able to reason beyond what they have seen during the training data for hard tasks,” Dziri said. “Or at least they do an approximation, and that approximation can be wrong.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s riddle requires composing a larger solution from solutions to subproblems, which researchers call a compositional task. Dziri’s team showed that LLMs that have only been trained to predict the next word in a sequence — which is most of them — are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18654">fundamentally limited</a> in their ability to solve compositional reasoning tasks. Other researchers have shown that transformers, the neural network architecture used by most LLMs, have hard mathematical bounds when it comes to solving such problems. Scientists have had some successes pushing transformers past these limits, but those increasingly look like short-term fixes. If so, it means there are fundamental computational caps on the abilities of these forms of artificial intelligence — which may mean it’s time to consider other approaches.</p>
<p>“The work is really motivated to help the community make this decision about whether transformers are really the architecture we want to embrace for universal learning,” said <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/">Andrew Wilson</a>, a machine learning expert at New York University who was not involved with this study.</p>
<h2><strong>Success Begets Scrutiny</strong></h2>

<p>Ironically, LLMs have only themselves to blame for this discovery of one of their limits. “The reason why we all got curious about whether they do real reasoning is because of their amazing capabilities,” Dziri said. They dazzled on tasks involving natural language, despite the seeming simplicity of their training. During the training phase, an LLM is shown a fragment of a sentence with the last word obscured (though technically it isn’t always a single word). The model predicts the missing information and then “learns” from its mistakes.</p>
<p>The largest LLMs — OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude — train on almost all the available data on the internet. As a result, the LLMs end up learning the syntax of, and much of the semantic knowledge in, written language. Such “pre-trained” models can be further trained, or fine-tuned, to complete sophisticated tasks <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/">far beyond</a> simple sentence completion, such as summarizing a complex document or generating code to play a computer game. The results were so powerful that the models seemed, at times, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-suggests-chatbots-can-understand-text-20240122/">capable of reasoning</a>. Yet they also failed in ways both obvious and surprising.</p>
<p>“On certain tasks, they perform amazingly well,” Dziri said. “On others, they’re shockingly stupid.”</p>

<p>Take basic multiplication. Standard LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, fail badly at it. In early 2023 when Dziri’s team asked GPT-4 to multiply two three-digit numbers, it initially succeeded only 59% of the time. When it multiplied two four-digit numbers, accuracy fell to just 4%.</p>
<p>The team also tested the LLMs on tasks like Einstein’s riddle, where it also had limited success. GPT-4 always got the right answer when the puzzle involved two houses with two attributes per house. But the accuracy fell to 10% when the complexity of the puzzle increased to four houses with four attributes per house. For the original version in <em>Life International</em> — five houses, each with five attributes — the success rate was 0%.</p>
<p>Dziri’s team thought that maybe the LLMs simply hadn’t seen enough examples in their training data, so they fine-tuned GPT-3 on 1.8 million examples of multiplying two numbers. Then, when they showed it new problems, the LLM aced them — but only if they were sufficiently similar to what it had seen during training. For example, the training data included the multiplication of two three-digit numbers, and of a two-digit number with a four-digit number, but when the model was asked to multiply a four-digit number with a three-digit number, it succeeded only 2% of the time. “If they are truly reasoning and understanding certain tasks, they should get the implicit algorithm,” Dziri said. That’s not what her team saw. “That raises a lot of questions about how LLMs perform tasks and whether they’re doing true reasoning.”</p>
<p>The team observed the same pattern when it came to solving Einstein’s riddle: GPT-3 failed when asked to answer bigger versions of the puzzle compared to the ones it was fine-tuned on. “It’s mimicking something that it has seen, but it doesn’t have full understanding of it,” Dziri said.</p>
<h2><strong>Hard Limits</strong></h2>

<p>As Dziri and her co-authors were finalizing their results, a different team was taking another approach to understanding why LLMs struggled with compositional tasks. <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~binghuip/">Binghui Peng</a>, at the time a doctoral student at Columbia University, was working with one of his advisers, Christos Papadimitriou, and colleagues to understand why LLMs “hallucinate,” or generate factually incorrect information. Peng, now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, suspected it was because transformers seem to lack the “capability of composition.”</p>
<p>To understand why, imagine we feed an LLM two pieces of information: The father of Frédéric Chopin was Nicolas Chopin, and Nicolas Chopin was born on April 15, 1771. If we then ask it, “What is the birth date of Frédéric Chopin’s father?” the LLM would have to answer by composing, or putting together, the different facts. In effect, it would need to answer the following nested question: “What is the birth date of (Who is the father of (Frédéric Chopin)?)?” If the LLM predicts the wrong words as an answer, it’s said to have hallucinated — in this case, possibly as a result of failing to solve the compositional task.</p>
<p>Peng wanted to test this hunch. His team started by studying the properties of a simple transformer, one with only a single layer, which learns to “pay attention” to the ordering and position of a sentence’s words when trying to predict the next word. (Modern LLMs have scores of such layers.) The team <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08164">established a link</a> between the complexity of the transformer layer and the “domain size,” or the number of bits required to represent the questions. By focusing on this simple model, they proved a mathematical bound. “If the total number of parameters in this one-layer transformer is less than the size of a domain, then transformers provably cannot solve the compositional task,” Peng said. In other words, an LLM with only one transformer layer was clearly and mathematically limited.</p>
<p>While this was a strong theoretical result, its practical implications weren’t clear, because modern LLMs are so much more complex. “It’s not easy to extend our proof,” Peng said. So his team used a different approach to study the abilities of more complicated transformers: They turned to computational complexity theory, which studies problems in terms of the resources, such as time and memory, needed to solve them.</p>

<p>They ended up using a well-known conjecture to show that the computational power of even multilayer transformers is limited when it comes to solving complicated compositional problems. Then, in December 2024, Peng and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02975">posted a proof</a> — without relying on computational complexity conjectures — showing that multilayer transformers indeed cannot solve certain complicated compositional tasks. Basically, some compositional problems will always be beyond the ability of transformer-based LLMs.</p>
<p>“If your model gets larger, you can solve much harder problems,” Peng said. “But if, at the same time, you also scale up your problems, it again becomes harder for larger models.” This suggests that the transformer architecture has inherent limitations.</p>
<h2><strong>Pushing the Boundaries</strong></h2>

<p>To be clear, this is not the end of LLMs. Wilson of NYU points out that despite such limitations, researchers are beginning to augment transformers to help them better deal with, among other problems, arithmetic. For example, <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/">Tom Goldstein</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, and his colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17399">added a twist</a> to how they presented numbers to a transformer that was being trained to add, by embedding extra “positional” information in each digit. As a result, the model could be trained on 20-digit numbers and still reliably (with 98% accuracy) add 100-digit numbers, whereas a model trained without the extra positional embedding was only about 3% accurate. “This suggests that maybe there are some basic interventions that you could do,” Wilson said. “That could really make a lot of progress on these problems without needing to rethink the whole architecture.”</p>
<p>Another way to overcome an LLM’s limitations, beyond just increasing the size of the model, is to provide a step-by-step solution of a problem within the prompt, a technique known as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-chain-of-thought-reasoning-helps-neural-networks-compute-20240321/">chain-of-thought</a> prompting. Empirical studies have shown that this approach can give an LLM such as GPT-4 a newfound ability to solve more varieties of related tasks. It’s not exactly clear why, which has led many researchers to study the phenomenon. “We were curious about why it’s so powerful and why you can do so many things,” said <a href="https://haotianye.com/">Haotian Ye</a>, &nbsp;a doctoral student at Stanford University.</p>
<p>When Ye was still an undergraduate at Peking University, he and his colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408">modeled the behavior of transformers</a> with and without chain-of-thought prompting. Their proof, using another branch of computer science called circuit complexity theory, established how chain-of-thought prompting essentially turns a large problem into a sequence of smaller problems, making it possible for transformers to tackle more complex compositional tasks. “That means … it can solve some problems that lie in a wider or more difficult computational class,” Ye said.</p>
        
        
<p>But, Ye cautions, their result does not imply that real-world models will actually solve such difficult problems, even with chain-of-thought. The work focused on what a model is theoretically capable of; the specifics of how models are trained dictate how they can come to achieve this upper bound.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as impressive as these results are, they don’t contradict the findings from Dziri’s and Peng’s teams. LLMs are fundamentally matching the patterns they’ve seen, and their abilities are constrained by mathematical boundaries. Embedding tricks and chain-of-thought prompting simply extends their ability to do more sophisticated pattern matching. The mathematical results imply that you can always find compositional tasks whose complexity lies beyond a given system’s abilities. Even some newer “state-space models,” which have been touted as more powerful alternatives to transformers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16674">show similar limitations</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, these results don’t change anything for most people using these tools. “The general public doesn’t care whether it’s doing reasoning or not,” Dziri said. But for the people who build these models and try to understand their capabilities, it matters. “We have to really understand what’s going on under the hood,” she said. “If we crack how they perform a task and how they reason, we can probably fix them. But if we don’t know, that’s where it’s really hard to do anything.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://routersecurity.org/ISProuters.php">https://routersecurity.org/ISProuters.php</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42903576">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>&nbsp; 

<p>In my opinion, you are <b>safest</b> using <i>both</i> a modem and a router that <i>you purchased</i> on your own. That is, <b>avoid  
  equipment from your ISP</b>. I say this for a number of reasons:   </p><ul>
  
<li> The devices shipped by ISPs suffer from a general level of incompetence both in their initial configuration and ongoing maintenance. 
	  If nothing else, just the fact that an ISP would install a device with the default password, tells you everything you need to know about 
	  their  interest in your security.</li>
<li>Security and convenience are always at odds with each other. Most likely an ISP will configure a router for maximum convenience to cut down on tech support calls, which cost them money. </li>
<li>Spying: We have seen that ISPs, at times, co-operate with spy agencies and governments. Even without outside influence, an ISP may well put a 
	        backdoor in the devices they give to their customers, if for no other reason than to make their life easier in some way. In this article, <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/your-isp-is-spying-on-you/">Your ISP is Probably Spying On You</a> (Feb. 2018) Harrison Sand found his router 
			was collecting information about LAN side devices and sending it the ISP.</li>		
<li>Don't be a prime target. Any router provided by an ISP to millions of customers is a prime target for bad guys and spies. More 
	     bang for the hacking buck. You are safer using a less popular device.</li>

		 <li>Many ISPs want to implement public WiFi networks in your home and there is no reason to assume these are done securely.  For my 
	    take on Comcast see <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476444/mobile-security/comcast-xfinity-wifi--just-say-no.html">Comcast XFINITY WiFi: 
		  Just say no</a>.    Cablevision is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150721/10254131714/cablevision-follows-comcast-down-compulsory-wifi-hotspot-rabbit-hole.shtml">doing
		   the same thing</a>, which prompted Timothy Geigner to write: "This sort of news should serve to do nothing other than compel anyone who wishes
		   to remain a Cablevision customer to buy their own router and modem". See also <a href="http://betanews.com/2016/01/27/one-in-three-home-routers-will-double-as-a-public-hotspot-by-2017/">One in three home routers will double as a public
		   hotspot by 2017</a>.  According to <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/1-in-3-home-wi-fi-routers-to-double-as-public-hots">Juniper  Research</a> the term for this is a "homespot router".</li>		   
<li>Sometimes equipment from an ISP is locked down. I have heard of cases where customers could not change a password  and where the DNS servers could not be 	 changed. I am told that in England, BT Business Hub and Sky Broadband prevent you from modifying the DNS servers and that much of France is also prevented from changing them. I ran into a Comcast-provided Arris TG1682G gateway where I could not <a href="http://m.setuprouter.com/router/arris/tg1682g/ip-address.htm">change the LAN IP address</a> of the box. I could change the subnet, but the router was always device number one which makes it a sitting duck for assorted router attacks.</li>	  
	<li>The ability to update the firmware may also be locked down. You should have full control over firmware updates.</li>	 
	<li>Backup: an ISP will give one device. Should it fail at an inopportune time, you will be off-line until you get them to issue a replacement. When you own your own 
	      hardware, you can buy a second modem and/or a router for emergency backup.</li> 
	<li>It may well be cheaper in the long run to buy your own hardware</li></ul>  

<p>As to the last point,  some ISPs charge a rental fee for the box they provide, be it just a modem or a full fledged gateway.  
     Buying your own will pay for itself soon enough. Time Warner customers looking to buy their own modem can purchase one from <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/internet/topics/buy-your-modem.html">this list</a> or <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/enjoy/better-twc/internet/internet-modems.html">this one</a>. Comcast users should 
   review <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/">mydeviceinfo.comcast.net</a>. </p> 
   
<p>October 11, 2024: My opinion is that of someone in the US and thus it may only be valid in the US. As a country, we are trending to very big companies in many different areas.  Internet Service Providers are part of this trend. Many (very likely most) people in the US are served by a single ISP. Different areas of the US have virtual monopolies when it comes to high speed Internet access. An ISP with a virtual monopoly has no motivation to do a good job. Their customers are captives. Their only goal is making money, so it is to be expected that they would provide the cheapest hardware that does the job. And, since added security will always result in more tech support calls, and these calls cost the ISP money, it is reasonable to expect that security is not a priority. If you live in a country with real competition for high speed Internet access, things might be better. </p> 
   
<p>In June 2022, on a financial Forum, someone asked <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6722588">Which is the best (most secure) home internet router for the money?</a>. One response hit home: 
 <i>"I've been on the vendor side selling networking equipment to carriers and cable companies. Their priorities for customer premises equipment (consumer) are cost, remote management and cost. Not to say their routers are bad, but you can do better."</i> To re-phrase that, ISPs want cheap routers that they can control.</p> 
 
   
<h3>ISPs SCREWING UP</h3>

<p>May 2, 2023: This is not about security, but it does show how little Spectrum cares about the boxes they give out to customers<br>
<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/spectrum-router-filled-with-roaches/">'Somebody had to see that before they shipped it out': Spectrum customer receives router with a live roach colony inside</a> by Jack Alban for Daily Dot. About a posting by TikToker user Fleur who was sent a router infested with cockroaches.</p>  

 <p>In November 2021, we learned of a DNS rebinding flaw in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59332840">six million</a> Sky routers (they are a large ISP in the U.K.). Adding insult to injury, Sky took 18 months to fix the problem and often ignored the company that found and reported the flaw, Pen Test Partners. See <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/skyfail-6-million-routers-left-exposed/">SkyFail. 6 million routers left exposed</a>. </p> 
 
<p>In September 2021 we learned that  Virgin Media failed to fix a reported flaw in their routers for over two years. See: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/virgin-media-routers-left-vpn-users-vulnerable-since-at-least-2019">Virgin Media Routers Left VPN Users Vulnerable Since at Least 2019</a> by   Nathaniel Mott for PC Magazine. </p>
	
<p>A privacy issue with IP Version 6 (IPv6) was disclosed at a <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#ipvseeyou-exploiting-leaked-identifiers-in-ipv-for-street-level-geolocation-22889">BlackHat presentation</a> in August 2021. It is not a flaw in IPv6, instead it is lazy, stupid, ignorant choices made by assorted ISPs that continue to include a MAC address as part of the public IPv6 address. We have known for 20 years that this is a bad idea. Yet, ISPs continue to do it. For the details see <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/home-gateway-geolocation-bh21">Your Wi-Fi router could tell everyone where you live - here's what you can do about it</a> by Paul Wagenseil of Toms Guide. Researchers found over 12 million routers/gateways that included a MAC address (which should be private) in the public IPv6 address. In the US they found more than 1 million Comcast Xfinity gateway routers with this design flaw. </p>
 
<p>  In May 2019, British ISP Sky Broadband updated their broadband hubs and knocked some customers off-line. Specifically, if the customer had configured the device to use DNS servers not from Sky Broadband. It seems the latest update also removed the ability to change DNS servers altogether. See <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/29/sky_bricks_broadband_hubs/">Sky customers moan: Our broadband hubs are bricking it</a> and read the many comments.</p>

<p>In December 2018, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-17">Tenable found three bugs</a> in a Verizon FIOS router/gateway. Reading the Disclosure Timeline tells you all you need to know - not to use hardware provided by Verizon. For one thing, Verizon did not write the firmware, so they have to farm out the bug fix. Then, two bugs are dealt with by one group, while the third bug is dealt with by another group. Two bugs were already known but had not been fixed. Verizon's response was slow and bureaucratic and they have no plans to say anything publicly about the bugs.</p>
 
<p>In May 2018, we learned that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/comcast-bug-leaks-xfinity-home-addresses-wireless-passwords/">Comcast website bug leaks Xfinity customer data</a>. The Comcast website (register.be.xfinity.com/activate), which was/is used by customers to set up their home services, could be hacked to display a customers home address, Wi-Fi network name and Wi-Fi password. And, not just display, an attacker could also change the SSID and/or Wi-Fi password. But, the issue was only for customers using equipment from Comcast. Those with their own routers were safe. An attacker only need to provide the  customer account number and their house or apartment number. If you lived at 123 Main Street, all the attacker needed to know was 123. Comcast claimed they fixed the problem, but we have no idea how long this vulnerability has existed.</p> 

<p>Then, in June 2018, we learned of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/comcast-fixes-another-xfinity-website-data-leak/">another data leak by Comcast</a>. Any device on the network of a Comcast customer, could call an API and learn the account number, the customer's home address, the account type, and any services enabled on the line. </p>

<p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbkgn8/dont-rent-a-modem-from-comcast">For the Love of God, Stop Renting Routers From Comcast</a> by 
Karl Bode May 24 2018. On the one hand, this article brings up many different and valid points, both financial and technical. On the other hand, the author seems clueless about the difference between a router a modem and a gateway.</p>

<p>Talk Talk is a British ISP and telco. In May 2018, their routers were <a href="https://www.indigofuzz.com/article.php?docid=talktalk1430">confirmed vulnerable</a>    to the classic WPS pin code attack, first seen back in 2011. You can't make this stuff up. The flaw was discovered by a company called IndigoFuzz using a Windows program called Dumpper.</p>


<p>Another British ISP, EE, distributes gateways (combination modem and router) with a backdoor account. This came to light in October 2018, see  <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/26/ee_4gee_hh70_ssh_backdoor/">this article</a> from The Register. The backdoor account in their 4GEE HH70 gateways was accessible via SSH from the LAN (inside) side of the router. Worse, when the problem was reported to EE they blew it off, until The Register got involved. Even after the bad publicity, it was still not clear whether a patch had been rolled out or not. Eventually, The Register learned that EE had issued a patch, but customers have to install the new firmware themselves.</p> 
   
<p>In November 2017, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/internet-paralyzing-mirai-botnet-comes-roaring-back-with-new-strain/">new botnet was discovered</a> that abused flaws in ZyXEL devices. Bad guys could remotely login to the routers/gateways using a default userid/password because a port was left open. In addition, the devices also had a hard coded superuser password, which gave attackers root privileges. Roughly 100,000 infected devices were detected, almost all of them in Argentina, specifically in the network of Telefonica de Argentina. Obviously, the ISP is at fault for giving so many of their customers devices with the same passwords.</p> 

<p>In September 2017, ESET reported that some ISPs (in two countries they refused to name) appear to be co-operating in the distribution of spyware. 
 <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/new-finfisher-surveillance-campaigns/">New FinFisher surveillance campaigns: Internet providers involved?</a> by Filip Kafka Sept. 21,  2017. Quoting: <i>"New surveillance campaigns utilizing FinFisher, infamous spyware known also as FinSpy and sold to governments and their agencies worldwide, are in the wild ... some of these variants have been using a cunning, previously-unseen infection vector with strong indicators of major internet service provider (ISP) involvement ...  FinFisher is marketed as a law enforcement tool and is believed to have been used also by oppressive regimes ... What’s new ... in terms of distribution is the attackers' use of a man-in-the-middle attack with the "man" in the middle most likely operating at the ISP level ... When the ...  target of surveillance is about to download one of several popular (and legitimate) applications, they are redirected to a version of that application infected with FinFisher. The applications we have seen being misused to spread FinFisher are WhatsApp, Skype, Avast, WinRAR, VLC Player and some others ...  the legitimate download link [is] being replaced by a malicious one ... "</i></p>
   
<p><img src="https://routersecurity.org/pix/isp.box.hacking.sm.jpg">At the DEF CON 25 conference in the summer of 2017  Marc Newlin, Logan Lamb and Chris Grayson spoke about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxfsT4wLAfU">Wirelessly Tapping Home Networks</a>. They found 26 bugs in ISP provided hardware, both gateways and set-top boxes. Bugs were found in devices from Cisco, Arris, Technicolor, Motorola and Xfinity.  They found multiple un-authenticated remote code execution flaws, the worst of all possible bugs. Software maintenance of the devices was also poor: patches take months to deploy, official bug reports are not filed and, of course, customers (victims?) are told nothing about the problems.<br clear="all"></p>

<p>"Securing home routers is not an easy task and may require some technical knowledge. A good start is properly selecting a home router - this means avoiding free routers included in internet plans... " from <a href="https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-securing-your-home-routers.pdf">Securing 
  Your Home Routers</a> by Trend Micro sometime in 2017.</p>   
   
 <p>In December 2016, Scott Helme wrote <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/my-ubiquiti-home-network/">My Ubiquiti Home Network</a> about upgrading from consumer routers to Ubiquiti. But, he lead with his thoughts about ISP provided equipment. </p>
 <p> <i>"I've never used the equipment provided by my ISP and have always used my own ... I've always been a bit of a tech geek and I like having things with extra features ... but there are some other more genuine needs. ISP (Internet Service Provider) provided equipment usually has one main factor driving the choice of hardware, <b>cost</b>. They want it to be as cheap as possible because purchasing the device and giving it to you is eating into their profits ... low cost usually means low quality in other areas than hardware too, like security. My previous ISP, EE, sent me a BrightBox router when I signed up that [had] several <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/ee-brightbox-router-hacked/">serious security vulnerabilities</a> ... Following their (very late) patching efforts there were <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/ee-brightbox-router-patched-still-vulnerable/">yet more vulnerabilities</a>. 
 I could go on and on listing the issues with ISP kit, a story even popped up on The Register about 1 million German routers being compromised whilst writing this blog, but I think you get the idea. This isn't to say other hardware will be perfect, of course it won't be, but I'd seen enough and wanted rid."</i></p> 
   
<p>In Australia in <b>October 2016</b> an ISP gave out <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/27/good_luck_securing_things_when_users_assume_stuff_just_works/">routers with default userid/passwords</a>  and "remarkably similar SSIDs." The article argues that: "It isn't terribly difficult to load up factory firmware that generates a random password, assigns it to a device, then prints a label with that information to go into the box with the gadget. It's more work than just slapping a default username and password into the software - but not much. And the cost, amortised against tens of thousands of units, can't be more than a penny or two."</p>  
 
 <p>Lucian Constantin, of IDG News Service, has been covering routers for Computerworld, PC World and others for a few years. On June 2, 2015, <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2930295/security/new-soho-router-security-audit-uncovers-over-60-flaws-in-22-models.html">writing in ITworld</a>,  about a bunch of router flaws he said:</p>
<p> <i>"Past research has shown that the security of ISP-provided routers is often worse than that  of off-the-shelf  ones. Many such devices are configured for remote administration to allow ISPs to remotely update their settings or troubleshoot connection problems.  This exposes the routers' management interfaces along with any vulnerabilities in them to the Internet, increasing the risk of exploitation. Even though  ISPs have the ability to remotely update the firmware on the routers they distribute to customers, they often don't and in some cases the users can't  do it either because they only have restricted access on the devices."</i></p> 

<p>In Nov. 2015 Bernardo Rodrigues wrote <a href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com.au/2015/11/arris-cable-modem-has-backdoor-in.html">ARRIS Cable Modem has a Backdoor in the Backdoor</a>. The buggy devices are the Arris TG862A, TG860A, and DG860A. To be clear, these are not modems, they are gateways (combination modem and router). They suffer from XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities, hard-coded passwords, and a backdoor in a backdoor.  The backdoor can be used to enable Telnet and SSH remotely via a hidden HTTP interface or with custom SNMP MIBs. Estimates are that more than 600,000 externally accessible devices are vulnerable. Initially, Arris blew this off. Eventually CERT/CC was able to get their attention. For more, see the <a href="https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php">Router Bugs</a> page under November 2015.</p>  
 
<p>Verizon was giving new customers routers configured to use WEP years and years and years after WEP was known to be insecure. It's nice to be a monopoly. In November 2014 the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/verizon-communications-inc./141112verizonclosingletter.pdf">wrote a letter</a> to a Verizon rep saying "<i>... the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection has conducted an investigation into possible violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by ...   Verizon Communications.  The investigation considered whether Verizon engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by failing to secure, in a reasonable and appropriate manner, the routers it provided to its High Speed Internet (DSL) and FiOS customers ...  Verizon regularly shipped routers to consumers with the default security set to an outdated encryption standard known as WEP. Due to certain weaknesses in WEP, the IEEE deprecated this standard in 2004 in favor of a new
standard known as WPA and later, WPA2. However, until recently, Verizon continued to ship some router models with the WEP encryption standard. As a result, many Verizon customers ... [are] vulnerable to hackers.</i>" Writing the letter was all the FTC did.  Clearly you can't trust Verizon with your router security.</p>

 
<h3>TR-069</h3>

<p>Another big security issue involves remote configuration of the router/modem provided by an ISP. Assorted mechanisms used by ISPs to update their devices in your home or office have been abused by bad guys to hack the devices. One remote update mechanism is a protocol with two names: TR-069 and CWMP. More than once, bugs in this protocol have been abused. </p>

<p>In November 2016, about 900,000 customers of Deutsche Telekom were knocked off-line by router problems. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3145003/internet/blame-the-isps-rather-than-the-routers.html">My blog on this attack</a>, which started with a new variant of the Mirai malware, detailed the mistakes ISPs made to get to the point where Mirai could cause so much damage. They left an open TCP/IP port undefended, and then quickly blocked it once the s..t hit the fan. Some ISP-supplied routers were running a TR-064 server that was open to the public, a huge configuration mistake. And, some routers locked up when the had to deal with the many incoming connection attempts created by the malware.</p> 
 
<p>Another example of TR-069 incompetence came to light in April 2017. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/">Wordfence wrote</a> that "Your ISP should not allow someone from the public internet to connect to your router's port 7547." Well, duh. They wrote that Shoden reports over 41 million home routers with port 7547 open to the public internet. They also found over 10,000 infected home routers in Algeria and over 11,000 hacked home routers in India that they attribute to port 7547 being open.</p> 
   
<p>TR-069 was also abused in 2014. A story, by Lucian Constantin back in August  2014 is frightening. See <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2491042/malware-vulnerabilities/home-routers-supplied-by-isps-can-be-compromised-en-masse.html">Home routers supplied by ISPs can be compromised en masse</a>. As of 2011, there are 147 million TR-069-enabled devices online listening on TCP port 7547.  These devices communicate with Auto Configuration Servers (ACS) operated by ISPs for assorted network management tasks. Many times a router can not close the port. If an attacker hacks into an ACS server then lots of bad stuff can happen. According to Shahar Tal, a security researcher at Check Point Software, ACS servers can be easily taken over by bad guys. The TR-069 specification recommends the use of HTTPS  but he found that insecure HTTP is used about 80 percent of the time, opening routers up to man-in-the-middle attacks. TR-069 requires authentication from the device to the ACS, but the username and password is typically shared and easily extracted. Check Point also tested several ACS servers and found critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in them. </p> 
  
<p>Open ports on ISP provided hardware are not limited to the TR-069 protocol. In September 2017, security firm Nomotion blogged about AT&amp;T U-Verse gateway devices with two open ports. One was for SSH, the other (TCP port 49152) allowed WAN side attackers to bypass the firewall. This was in addition to three hard coded backdoor accounts they discovered. The blog has a great title: <a href="https://www.nomotion.net/blog/sharknatto/">SharknAT&amp;To</a>. Adding insult to injury, was the reaction from AT&amp;T. Despite being publicly shamed, they said nothing about these security problems for two weeks (as of Sept 13, 2017). They have no shame and are doing their best to keep their customers ignorant of this. Arris, said they are looking into it and then went silent. For more see the <a href="https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php">Router Bugs</a> page under September 2017.</p>   

<p>HD Moore, chief security architect at Rapid7, and the creator of Metasploit, also <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/no-end-in-sight-for-exposed-internet-of-things-other-devices/d/d-id/1320913">weighed  in on this</a>  on June 17, 2015. Rapid7 runs  Project Sonar, which scans the Internet for vulnerable devices. They find that things are getting worse.   On reason, cited by Moore is   <i>"that a few dozen Internet service providers are rolling out broadband devices such as home routers without  properly vetting or properly configuring the security..."</i></p>
  
  <p> ------------------ </p>

<p>Besides security, there is the issue of <b>honesty</b>. Time Warner Cable, a.k.a Spectrum and Charter was <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint.pdf">sued in New York State</a> in early 2017 for lying about the download speeds their customers were getting. In <a href="https://backchannel.com/the-alternate-facts-of-cable-companies-f0cd1e10e66">The Alternate Facts of Cable Companies</a> Harvard professor Susan Crawford writes:</p>
<p><i>"Based on the company's own documents and statements, it appears that just about everything it has been saying since 2012 to New York State residents about their internet access and data services is untrue. And not untrue in some grey, shadowy way - just untrue. The company's 2.5 million New York subscribers (of its 22 million nationwide) have been told they are getting X (in terms of download and upload speeds) when actually they are getting a lot less than X."</i></p>
<p>How was Charter/Spectrum/Time Warner Cable cheating? Three ways: <i>" ... squeezing more households into an inadequate number of narrow, shared neighborhood data connections; squeezing connections between Spectrum's network and other networks; and squeezing consumers who should have gotten upgraded household equipment."</i></p><p> 

The lawsuit was settled in December 2018 with Charter/Spectrum coughing up $176 Million. In an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181218/07445741254/nys-record-176-million-settlement-with-charter-crap-broadband-highlights-cables-growing-monopoly.shtml">article about this</a>, Karl Bode, of Techdirt wrote: <i>"The suit also highlights how Charter at least considered gaming the results of a program the FCC has traditionally used to measure real-world broadband speeds using custom-firmware embedded routers in consumer volunteer homes."</i>. 


</p><p>In the U.S., high speed broadband is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180314/09251639423/cable-industry-is-quietly-securing-massive-monopoly-over-american-broadband.shtml">pretty much a monopoly</a> everywhere. An ISP without competition has no motivation to do a good job, they are only motivated by profit. Yet another reason not to use their hardware, when possible.</p>

<p>One advantage of the new consumer focused mesh routers,  like eero, AmpliFi and Google Wifi, is that the routers themselves can run speed tests. Eero seems to do one every day. AmpliFi and Google Wifi keep a history of the speed tests, so trends are easily spotted. Eero does not keep a history. </p>
   
<p>Finally, there is a big difference between routers so don't expect to buy the perfect router for your needs right out of the box. If possible, buy a 
  router from a place that will take it back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A short introduction to RLHF and post-training
focused on language models.</p><div>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an
  important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine
  learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction
  to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative
  background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF – both in recent
  literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in
  economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with
  definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common
  math used in the literature. We detail the detail the popular
  algorithms and future frontiers of RLHF.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
  

  <article>
    <header>
      
    </header>

    <p>There is currently a trend for using sticky headers on websites. There's even <a href="http://www.hellobar.com/">a sticky header web startup</a>.</p>
<p>I hate sticky headers. <em>I want to kill sticky headers.</em></p>
<p>So I made this bookmarklet. Drag the link to your bookmarks bar:</p>
<p>Kill Sticky</p>


<p>I use an 11" MacBook Air, which means that I don't have much vertical screen space. The 50 pixels taken up by the sticky header could have been three lines of text.</p>
<p>I also normally scroll down using the space key, which scrolls just less than one full viewport at a time. When you cover up part of your content with a sticky element, that means that the space key scrolls too far down. Then I lose my position and have to scroll back up.</p>
<p>Finally, I just don't care right now about navigating your website, or following you on Twitter. I'm trying to read. Let me focus on that for now, please.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-bookmarklet-works">How the bookmarklet works</h2>
<p>It's really simple, because <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/#examples"><code>querySelectorAll</code></a> is awesome. <a href="https://gist.github.com/alisdair/5670341">Here's the source</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>function</span> (<span></span>) </span>{ 
  <span>var</span> i, elements = <span>document</span>.querySelectorAll(<span>'body *'</span>);

  <span>for</span> (i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; elements.length; i++) {
    <span>if</span> (getComputedStyle(elements[i]).position === <span>'fixed'</span>) {
      elements[i].parentNode.removeChild(elements[i]);
    }
  }
})();
</code></pre>
<p>The bookmarklet just finds all fixed-position elements on the page, and removes them. This might remove the navigation, but if you need it back, just hit refresh. That's why I created a bookmarklet and not a custom user-stylesheet or browser plugin: this is the simplest way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>What if I told you you can get a full Linux computer with WiFi and a GPU in a
small, pocket form factor for about <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x_PmVHiQNHyw5t05peEDG1DcCKDCvH_UPd3p7yCw4xg/edit">$30 USD on AliExpress</a>? You might say “but what about the new tariffs?” and I’d say “oof, oh right, okay who knows, but it’s probably still pretty cheap!” (Edit: looks like you can get one for about $40 now).</p>

<p>It wasn’t a big hit with the
retro handheld gaming community, but the
<a href="https://retrocatalog.com/retro-handhelds/miyoo-a30">Miyoo A30</a> has a 4 core
Cortex A7 with a Mali-400 MP GPU, 512 MB of RAM, WiFi, and an incredible little
640x480 IPS screen. It has enough power to emulate many
Nintendo 64 games, but that’s not what I bought it for.
In fact, I bought two so my son and I could make networked multiplayer games
together.</p>

<p>I already have a <a href="https://github.com/jtolio/viricide">game I made in Pygame</a> back in
college, so naturally, I wanted to first get modern Python 3 and Pygame working on
it.</p>

<p>If you want to ignore my work log and just skip to the files, at the bottom
I have premade files for you so you can install Python programs on your Miyoo
A30 by just copying some things onto your SD card.</p>

<h2 id="game-plan:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">Game plan</h2>

<ul>
<li>Install the latest software and software drivers on the Miyoo A30</li>
<li>Get Debian running in a chroot</li>
<li>Override drivers so the hardware works</li>
<li>Tell spruceOS how to start the programs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upgrading-the-miyoo-a30:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">Upgrading the Miyoo A30</h3>

<p>First step, the software that comes on this little device is garbage, so you want to
replace that.</p>

<p>The internet
seems to think that <a href="https://spruceui.github.io/">spruceOS</a> is currently the best
custom image you can get for the A30, and it is quite nice. It doesn’t come with
Python or Pygame, but it does come with firmware upgrade software (so that your WiFi
drivers are the latest), and also comes with all of the latest and greatest
emulators optimally configured if that’s your thing.</p>

<p>The only downside with running spruceOS is it still uses a Linux 3.x kernel. Using
the provided kernel is a good call since it has the best driver support for the
hardware, but Linux 3.x is missing some syscalls some Debian Bookworm software now
takes for granted. This means that Debian Bookworm’s <code>apt-get</code> won’t work, but
that’s okay, many other things still work, including <code>venv</code> and <code>pip</code>.</p>

<h3 id="debian-in-a-chroot:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">Debian in a chroot</h3>

<p>On my laptop, I used <code>debootstrap</code> to create a folder with a Debian system ready to
be configured.</p>

<pre><code>sudo debootstrap --arch=armhf --foreign --variant=minbase --include python3,python3-venv,python3-pip,python3-requests,python3-pygame,nano bookworm ~/miyoo-bookworm/
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>apt-get</code> doesn’t work, if you’re doing this yourself, make sure to include
any packages you want in your Debian installation in the list above.</p>

<p>Then, on the Miyoo A30, in spruceOS’s advanced configuration, I enabled SSH,
SSHed to the device, then created an ext4 filesystem on the SD card and mounted
it:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=bookworm-python3.img bs=4096 count=$((1024*256))
mkfs.ext4 bookworm-python3.img
mkdir bookworm-python3
mount -o loop bookworm-python3.img bookworm-python3
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I <code>scp</code>ed all of the contents of my laptop’s <code>miyoo-bookworm</code> folder into
that new loopback mountpoint.</p>

<p>Finally, I ran this on the Miyoo to finish the Debian installation:</p>

<pre><code>chroot bookworm-python3
/debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
</code></pre>

<p>Tada! Debian works! Python works!</p>

<h3 id="graphics-and-input-drivers:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">Graphics and input drivers</h3>

<p>Okay, so Pygame doesn’t really work yet, since the Debian installation doesn’t
have the right SDL drivers or GPU drivers. The spruceOS installation does
though.</p>

<p>Inside the Debian filesystem, I made <code>/usr/local/lib/miyoo-overrides</code>. Then I
copied the following libraries from the spruceOS parent filesystem’s
<code>/usr/lib/miyoo</code> folder into the Debian filesystem’s <code>miyoo-overrides</code> folder
that I just made: <code>libEGL.so*</code>, <code>libGLESv1_CM.so*</code>, <code>libGLESv2.so*</code>, <code>libMali.so</code>, <code>libSDL2-2.0.so*</code>, and <code>libudev.so*</code>. Note that all of the <code>libEGL</code> and <code>libGLES</code> libraries are actually just symlinks to <code>libMali.so</code>.</p>

<p>I reentered the chroot and ran:</p>

<pre><code>echo /usr/local/lib/miyoo-overrides/ &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/00-miyoo-overrides.conf
ldconfig
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it so all programs inside the chroot can find the spruceOS provided
video and input libraries.</p>

<h3 id="get-the-python-apps-to-show-up-in-spruceos:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">Get the Python apps to show up in spruceOS</h3>

<p>First we need a tool for safely entering the chroot while still having all of
the kernel devices and filesystems show up appropriately. Here is
<code>run-inside.sh</code> which will start a program inside the chroot, making sure it
is set up right.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=/mnt/SDCARD/bookworm-python3.img
ROOT=/mnt/SDCARD/bookworm-python3

mount &gt; /tmp/current-mounts
if ! grep -q $ROOT /tmp/current-mounts; then
  mkdir -p $ROOT
  mount -o loop $BASE $ROOT
  for dir in /dev /proc /sys /tmp /dev/pts /mnt/SDCARD; do
    mkdir -p $ROOT$dir
    mount -o loop $dir $ROOT$dir
  done
  mkdir -p $ROOT/mnt/root
  mount -o loop / $ROOT/mnt/root
fi

rm /tmp/current-mounts

command="$1"
shift
if [ "x$command" == "x" ]; then
  command="/bin/bash"
fi

exec chroot $ROOT/ /usr/bin/env \
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH= \
  PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin \
  SHELL=/bin/bash \
  "$command" "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we need a sample Pygame app. I used <a href="https://github.com/pcorbel/hello-miyoo/blob/main/app/app.py">this one</a> for testing. I put this project’s <code>app.py</code>
on my SD card.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to make a script on the SD card inside <code>Roms/PORTS</code>. Here
is <code>hello-miyoo.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

exec /mnt/SDCARD/run-inside.sh python3 /mnt/SDCARD/app.py
</code></pre>

<p>When you next open your Miyoo spruceOS UI, There will be an entry named after
this script (<code>hello-miyoo</code>) in the “Ports” section of the “Games” category!</p>

<h2 id="what-doesn-t-work:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">What doesn’t work</h2>

<p>Mostly, this works great! All of the buttons are recognized by Pygame,
Pygame gets GPU acceleration, sound works, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the screen is rotated 90 degrees. With some other spruceOS
provided builds of libSDL2, the screen isn’t rotated, but GPU acceleration is
disabled and many other things are broken.</p>

<p>If anyone has an idea of how to fix this, please <a href="https://www.jtolio.com/contact/">let me know!</a></p>

<p>For now, I am simply using Pygame to rotate my screen another 90 degrees.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-files:8d57e4422a6e5ed1f965c5d347001476">All the files</h2>

<p>YouTube Audio Quality - How Good Does it Get?</p>
<hr>
<p>
You Tube is clearly used by a very large number of people. In general, they will be interested in watching videos of various types of content. One specific purpose is that it gets used to distribute, and make people aware of, audio recordings. A conversation on the “Pink Fish” webforum devoted to music and audio set me wondering about the technical quality of the audio that is on offer from You Tube (YT) videos. The specific comment which drew my attention was a claim that the ‘opus’ audio codec gives better results than the ’aac / mp4’ alternative. So I decided to investigate...</p>

<p>
Ideally to assess this requires a copy of what was uploaded to YT as a ‘source’ version which can then be compared with what YT then make available as output. By coincidence I had also quite recently joined the Ralph Vaughan-Williams Society (RVWSoc). They have been putting videos up onto YT which provide excerpts of the recordings they sell on Audio CDs. These proved excellent ‘tasters’ for anyone who wants to know what they are recording and releasing. And when I asked, they kindly provided me with some examples to help me investigate this issue of YT audio quality and codec choice.</p>

<p>
For the sake of simplicity I’ll ignore the video aspect of this entirely and only discuss the audio side. The RVWSoc kindly let me have ‘source uploaded’ copies of two examples. The choice of audio formats that YT offered for these videos are as follows:</p>
<br>

<p>
The ‘ID’ numbers refer to the audio streams. Other ID values would produce a video of a user-chosen resolution, etc., normally accompanied by one of the above types of audio stream. </p>

<p>
One aspect of this stands out immediately. This is the variety of audio sample rate  (ASR)  options on offer. However in each case only <span>one</span> version of a RVWSoc video was uploaded, at a sample rate chosen by the RVWSoc. I had expected to see a choice of  YT output audio codecs (compression systems), but was quite surprised, in particular, to see ASRs as low as 22·05k on offer as that means the YT audio would then have a frequency range that only extends to about 10kHz!</p>

<p>
Given the main interest here is in determining what choice may deliver highest YT output audio quality I decided that analysis should focus on the higher, more conventional rates – 48k and 44k1. In addition, the above shows that – since in each case only one source file (and hence only one sample rate) was uploaded – some of the above YT output versions at 48k or 44k1 have also been thorough a sample rate conversion in addition to a codec conversion. That introduces another factor that may degrade sound quality! In this case I had copies of what had been uploaded, so could determine which of the YT output versions had been though such a rate conversion.  For the present examination, I will therefore limit investigation to the YT output that maintains the same ASR as the source that was uploaded, so as to dodge this added conversion. Unfortunately, in general YT <span>users</span> probably won’t know which output version may have dodged this particular potential bullet! Choosing the least-tampered-with output therefore may be a challenge in practice for YT users.</p>

<p>
Pan’s Anniversary  [48k ASR 194 kb/s aac(LC) source audio]</p>
<p>
I’ll begin the detailed comparisons with the video of an excerpt from the CD titled,“Pan’s Anniversary”. The version uploaded contains the audio in the form encoded in the aac(LC) codec at a bitrate of 194 kb/s and using a sample rate of 48k. The audio lasts 4 mins 54·88 sec. The table below compares this with the same aspects of the high ABR versions offered by YT.</p>

<p>
We can see that YT-140 uses the same codec as the source, but alters the information bitrate, and the ASR. YT-251 transcodes the input aac(LC) into the opus codec, but doesn’t alter the sample rate. <span>Both</span> of the YT versions are of longer duration than the source uploaded. By loading the files into Audacity and examining the waveforms by eye it became clear that the YT versions were not time-aligned with each other, or with the source.</p>

<p>
To avoid any changes caused by alteration of the ABR I decided to concentrate on comparing the source version with YT-251 – i.e. where the output uses the opus codec, not aac, but maintain’s the source sample rate. Having chosen matching sample rates the simplest and easiest was to check how similar two versions are is to time-align them and then subtract, sample by sample, each sample in a sequence in one version from the nominally ‘same instant’ matching one in the other. If the patterns are the same, the result is a series of zero-valued samples. If they don’t match we get a ‘difference’ pattern. However, before we can do this we have to determine the correct time-offset to align the sample sequences of the two versions.</p>

<p>
In some cases that can be fairly obvious from looking at the sample patterns using a program like Audacity. But in other cases this is hard to see with enough clarity to determine with complete precision. Fortunately, we can use a mathematical method known as <span>cross-correlation</span> to show us the time alignment of similar waveform patterns. (See  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation </a>  if you want to know more about cross correlation.) This also can show us where the best alignment may occur in terms of any offset between the two patterns of samples being cross correlated.</p>
<p><br>

</p>

<p>
The above graph shows the result of cross correlating a section of the source and YT-251 versions of the audio. (The red and blue lines show the Left and Right channels of the stereo.) The results cover offsets over a range of +/- 800 samples. The process used 180,000 successive sample pairs from each set of samples. i.e. about 3·75 sec of audio from each. The best alignment is indicated by the location of the largest peak. If the sample sequences were already aligned this would happen at an offset = 0. However here we can see that the YT-251 version is ‘late’ by just over 300 samples.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig2.png" alt="Fig2.png - 40Kb" width="1000" height="542">
</p><p><br>
Zooming in, we can see that the peak is at an offset of -312 samples. Which at 48k sample rate corresponds to YT-251 being 6·5 milliseconds late. Having determined this I could trim 312 samples from the start of each channel of YT-251 and this aligned the two series of samples. (I also then had to trim the end to make them of equal length.) Once this was done it becomes possible to run though the samples and take a sample-by-sample difference between the source version and YT-251. This different set then details how the YT-251 output differs from the source version.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig3.png" alt="Fig3.png - 105Kb" width="1000" height="560"></p></div><p>
The graph above shows how the rms audio power level of the audio varies with time. The red and blue lines show the levels in the Pan’s Anniversary source file. The grey and purple lines show the power levels versus time obtained from subtracting the source file sample values from the audio samples from YT-251. Ideally, we’d wish to find a subtraction like this producing a series of zeros as the difference samples. This is because such a result would tell us that the output was identical to the input and going via YT had not changed the audio at all! However in practice the above results show this clearly is <span>not</span> the case! There is a residual ‘error’ which is typically somewhere around 20dB below the input (and output) musical level. </p>

<p>
In traditional terms for audio, 20dB would be regarded as a <span>very</span> poor signal/noise ratio. And if the change was considered as being equivalent to conventional distortion it would be assumed to indicate a level of around 10% distortion! So it represents a rather underwhelming result. However a more benign interpretation may be that it arises as a result of the process applied by YT slightly altering the overall amplitudes of the waveforms so they don’t quite match in size – hence leave a non-zero difference when the input and output are subtracted. With this in mind we can compare the input and output samples using other methods that aren’t sensitive to an overall change in signal pattern levels.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig4.png" alt="Fig4.png - 51Kb" width="1000" height="569"></p></div><p>
The above graph compares the input and output files in terms of Crest Factor. This measures the peak-rms power level difference of the waveform shapes defined by the series of samples. The red/blue lines show the Left and Right channel results for the source file sent to YT. The orange/green lines the equivalent results for YT-251. To obtain these results each set of samples was divided up into a series 0·1 Sec sections. The peak and rms power level of each was calculated, and the above shows how often a given value was obtained, grouped into 1dB wide statistical ‘bins’. For a pure sinewave the peak/rms crest factor is 3dB. i.e. the peak levels of a sinewave are 3dB larger than the rms power. For well recorded music from acoustic instruments the Crest Factor tends to be in the range from a few dB up to well over 10dB for the most ‘spiky’ waveforms.</p>

<p>
The result is interesting as we can see that the YT-251 output clearly exhibits a <span>different</span> Crest Factor distribution to the source file. It seems doubtful this could be produced by a simple change in the overall signal pattern level. (e.g. a volume control does change the overall level, but it should not change the <span>shape</span> of the audio waveform, and hence should leave the Crest Factor unaltered. (If it <span>did</span> alter this, you’d be advised to replace the control with one that worked properly!) It is particularly curious that the Crest factor seems to be increased by having the audio pass though the YT processing. Although possibly this may arise due to an input which is aac(LC) coded being transcoded into ‘opus’ codec form. OTOH perhaps YT apply some form of ‘tarting up’ to make audio ‘sound better’...</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig5.png" alt="Fig5.png - 85Kb" width="1000" height="556">
</p><p><br>
A more familiar way to show the character of an audio recording is to plot its spectrum. The above graph shows the spectrum of the Pan ‘source’ file and of the series of samples obtained by subtracting the YT-251 output sample series. We can then say that - at any given frequency - the bigger the gap between these plotted line, the closer the YT-251 output is to the source supplied to YT. Looking at the graph we can then see that the results indicate that the faithfulness of the YT-251 result to the input is at its best at low frequencies where the gap is widest and the contributions to the overall signal level are greatest. However at higher frequencies the level of the error becomes a larger fraction of the input. And above about 16kHz the error level quite similar to the input level. The implication being that the original details in the source above about have essentially been lost. They may have been replaced by something generated to ‘fake’ this lost information in a plausible manner.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig6.png" alt="Fig6.png - 72Kb" width="1000" height="556"></p></div><p>
In fact, if we compare the spectra of the input with that of the output we can see that  the YT-251 output using the opus codec has essentially removed anything from the source that was above 20 kHz. This is replaced by an HF ‘noise floor’ produced via a process like dithering, probably employed to suppress quantisation distortion, etc. We can also see that the source, although at a 48k sample rate, has a sharp cutoff at just over 22 kHz. This indicates that that although what was submitted to YT was at 48k sample rate it was actually generated from a 44k1 (i.e. audio CD rate) version. The behaviour of the above spectra may well be another sign of changes that also produced the change in the typical Crest Factor distribution.</p>

<p>
Having applied the above analysis to an example that produced a YT output using the opus codec we can now examine another example which uses aac for the output to compare that with the use of opus.</p>
<p>
Vaughan-Williams on Brass [44k1 ABR 127 kb/s aac(LC)]</p>
<p>
In this case the choice of source file had an aac audio content at an ASR of 44k1. This was chosen to match the sample rate of YT-140 and thus avoid any sample rate resampling effects. As with the previous “Pan’s Anniversary” example the YT-140 output was of a different duration to the source file, and not sample-aligned. So as before, I edited the output samples to trim them to a sample-aligned series that matched the timing of the source version.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig7.png" alt="Fig7.png - 86Kb" width="1000" height="556"></p></div><p>
The graph above shows the time-averaged spectra of the source file and the difference between this and the YT-140 output.  This represents the residual error level </p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig8.png" alt="Fig8.png - 102Kb" width="1000" height="560"></p></div><p>
As with the earlier YT-251 example, the above shows the source signal level versus time, and the level versus of time of the sample-by-sample difference between the source and the YT output (now YT-140) level. In this case the error level seems to be around -30 to -35dB compared with the source which is an improvement on the earlier YT-251 example. Viewed as distortion it would be equivalent to a level of around 3% or less.</p>

<p>
More broadly speaking, the results look similar to the previous example. However...</p>

<p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig9.png" alt="Fig9.png - 78Kb" width="1000" height="556"><br>
</p><p>
...when we compare the actual spectra of the input and output we find that the output now has its high-frequency range cropped off at just under 16kHz! This is distinctly lower than the range present in the 44k1 sample rate aac <span>input</span> submitted to YT. </p>

<p>
It is also worth noting that although the YT-251 example’s output spectrum seems to extend to around 20kHz we found that the part above about 15kHz looked like being ‘all error’! i.e. not the source HF details but some sort of facsimile!</p>

<p>
Overall therefore, we might judge the YT-140 example to be, technically, more accurate than the YT-251 example. But to tell if this result was a general one we’d need to examine more examples. And given the changes in the applied high-frequency cut-off, we might also find that allowing the sample rate to altered might, overall, yield a different outcome! So the above results are interesting, but raise further questions which deserve future investigations.</p>

<p>
BBC iPlayer as a comparison [48k ASR 320 kb/s aac]</p>
<p>
In 2017 the BBC experimented with streaming BBC Radio 3 using flac in parallel with their standard iPlayer output formats. They did this for two reasons. One was to assess the practical requirements they would need to support if it became a standard. The other was to investigate if it produced audibly ‘better’ results. Some programmes were parallel streamed in days leading up to the Proms of that year. And almost all of the Proms were also streamed in flac format as well as their usual 320k aac format. As it wasn’t a formal service some special arrangements were needed for someone to receive the flac stream version. However given some advance notice I was able to use a modified version of the ffmpeg utility to capture examples of the flac stream for comparison with the aac. Having looked at the above YT examples it may be useful to compare them with the results from a BBC example.</p>

<p>
Since the flac stream essentially represents the LPCM input to the BBC’s aac encoder they can serve as an example of what is possible if we compare and and contrast them with the above results of examining the YT output. For the sake of illustration I’ve chosen a section of a “Record Review” programme on R3.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig10.png" alt="Fig10.png - 83Kb" width="1000" height="556"></p></div><p>
The above shows the time averaged spectra for a 5-min section of the program whilst music was being played. Here the source is taken from the flac data, and the output is taken from the 320k aac. These were then sample time-aligned so it was also possible to generate a sample-by-sample difference set of values and plot the spectrum of the residual ‘error’ pattern. i.e. the above can now be compared with the previous spectra for the YT examples. When this is done we can see that the error residual is somewhat lower relative to the source and output than in the YT examples – particularly at and above a few kHz. The output also effectively extends to higher frequencies than the YT examples. In addition we can see that the error level remains low over a wider range of frequencies than the YT examples.</p>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://www.audiomisc.co.uk/YouTube/Fig11.png" alt="Fig11.png - 103Kb" width="1000" height="560"></p></div><p>
The above plots the audio levels of the source versus time, and also the residual level of the difference (error) between the source and output for the same section of programme. Again, this is better than the results for YT. In this BBC example the difference error level is around 40dB below the signal level. Again, this is nominally poor if it were a standard noise level or distortion result where it would look like a distortion level of around 1%. But it is better than the YT examples – as, of course, we’d hope given the higher bitrate (320k) employed by the BBC! (The BBC eventually decided that flac streaming wasn’t required, although some audiophiles have disagreed with them and regret the decision to stay with 320k aac.)</p>

<p>
More evidence would be needed to be confident in drawing reliable general conclusions. It is also worth adding that the BBC now limit the audio for the video streams to a maximum of just 128k aac as they judge that to be fine for video, even of musical events. Despite streaming Proms via R3 at 320k, their TV video streams of the same events are limited to 128k aac. So there does seem to be an assumption that video somehow reduces the need for more accurate audio. That may be so, but the above examination does perhaps serve as a pointer to the possibility that the audio quality of YT’s output is being limited  from an audiophile’s POV by their offered choice of birates/codecs. So this general area may be worth further examination...</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Dell Technologies intends to end its hybrid work arrangement in March, requiring those previously allowed to toil from home part-time to spend their entire five-day work week within corporate walls.</p>
<p>The IT biz also expects those who work remotely but within an hour's drive of a Dell office to commute in every working day henceforth. Remote workers further away will be allowed to continue their long-distance employment relationship.</p>
<p>Word of the policy change comes from founder and CEO Michael Dell, who sent an email to staff announcing the changes on Friday morning. <em>The Register</em> has seen a copy of his staff memo from an individual familiar with the matter.</p>

    

<p>Dell justified the policy change by asserting a thirty-second in-person conversation can replace an email discussion that goes on for hours or days and by noting that specific groups within the company – sales, manufacturing, and engineering – have already adjusted to being in the office five days per week.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Starting March 3, all hybrid and remote team members who live near a Dell office will work in the office five days a week," the memo reads. "We are retiring the hybrid policy effective that day. We remain committed to flexibility within your workday, and you should continue to work with your manager to meet your needs. But for the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week."</p>
<p>Dell declined to share a copy of the letter while also stating that it is not challenging reports about the memo.</p>

        


        

<p>Dell's about-face on working from home belies chief operating officer Jeff Clarke's mid-pandemic assertion that "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/28/dell_q2_2021_work_from_home/">we will never go back to the way things were before</a>."</p>
<p>"Here at Dell, we expect, on an ongoing basis, that 60 per cent of our workforce will stay remote or have a hybrid schedule where they work from home mostly and come into the office one or two days a week," said Clarke during the corporation's Q2 2020 earnings conference call.</p>

        

<p>Many companies, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/amazon_staff_return_office/">Amazon</a>, have trimmed back or ended remote work arrangements over the past year. These return to office (RTO) mandates, however, have failed to improve corporate financial performance, according to a study last year by University of Pittsburgh business school associate professor Mark Ma and Yuye Ding, a doctoral student.</p>
<p>"Overall, our results do not support the argument that managers impose these mandates to increase firm values," the authors state in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401">their paper</a>. "Instead, these findings are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance."</p>

<p>As of its Q3 FY 2025 financial <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/097c4a05-1573-4a78-b63c-ea3c3981ff29">report</a> [PDF] last November, Dell's shares were up 86 percent in 2024, an increase <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/dell-earnings-report-q3-2025.html">attributed</a> largely to sales of servers for AI workloads.</p>
<p>Asked whether Dell has any financial data that suggests working from the office leads to better productivity or results, a spokesperson said, "We continually evolve our business so we're set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners. That includes more in-person connections to drive market leadership."</p>
<p>We're told that a follow-on message went out on Friday from Doug Schmitt, CIO and president of Dell Technologies Services, instructing Services directors and above within an hour’s commute of a Dell office to begin making the trip to the office starting Monday, February 3, 2025.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As leaders, we are expected to set the tone for rebuilding in-person collaboration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"As leaders, we are expected to set the tone for rebuilding in-person collaboration and fostering innovation," Schmitt's memo said.</p>
<p>Dell has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/03/dell_return_to_work/">rolling back remote work policies</a> that have been in place at least since the COVID-19 pandemic, when concerns about contagion made telecommuting necessary for many organizations. In March 2024, the biz informed salespeople that they would be expected to be in the office at least three days per week. In June, half of Dell staff in the US had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/20/half_of_dell_us_staff_wfh/">declined</a> to RTO. By September 2024, the corporate attendance requirement for sales <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/dell_sales_staff_full_rto/">increased</a> to five days per week.</p>

        

<p>Our source reports that there's been a trickle of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/06/dell_layoffs/">layoffs</a> all year and that it's unclear whether the requirement to spend more time in the office has encouraged staff to leave – one of the common claims about return to office (RTO) mandates is that they <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/dell_rto_mandate/">increase</a> voluntary headcount attrition, thereby avoiding the severance obligation entailed by layoffs.</p>
<p>"I did have coworkers who jumped ship months ago, partly as a result of RTO and partly for greener pastures with more companies on the buzzword hype train," our contact told us. "All in all though I've seen more grumbling than action." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>This was the most profound realization I had after my diagnosis. It was crucial because, without it, I wouldn't have known how to live with myself.</p><p>When I discovered that the intense emotions I felt and behavioral patterns I exhibited had a name, my first instinct was to eliminate them. The word "disorder" pushed me in that direction. I barely graduated college, bounced from one job to another (still do), avoided socializing—surely this was some kind of neurosis, I thought, and neuroses needed fixing. I convinced myself ADHD was a decayed tooth waiting to be pulled.</p><p>I spent the first few months after my diagnosis in crippling frustration, clinging to this disgusting clinical definition: </p><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by chronic patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that are inconsistent with developmental norms, leading to significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.</p><p>Looking at it now, that description is dehumanizing—but I followed it as if it were gospel.</p><p><span>The reality was that I suffered greatly not because of my ADHD, but because of my parents. The words they spoke and the decisions they made rendered me estranged. It was never their intention to cause harm, but their approach to raising me was the exact opposite of what I needed: they took certain constructs for granted, and whenever I faced challenges—in school, in socializing, in daily tasks—they never stopped to ask: </span><strong>what if this wasn't an issue of attention, but one of incompatibility?</strong></p><p><span>Instead, they relied on discipline as the only solution: withholding rights, denying privileges, banning books outside the curriculum because they "caused inattention," cutting off the internet, locking TV channels with passwords, and limiting socialization during study time. John Taylor Gatto's </span><em>Dumbing Us Down</em><span> perfectly captured this when he noticed that schools, another place where authority figures hang out, ruthlessly disciplined any child who tried to assert individuality. And my individuality, even to my parents, was weird.</span></p><p>The whole experience was abusive. Yet I forgave: I have other things to attend to if I truly want to get over what happened. What I wish they’d understood, however, is that I wasn’t inherently dysfunctional. It was the assumptions of authority figures that made me appear—and believe—I was. Their well-meaning but oblivious actions, combined with their preaching about the prizes of productivity, turned my strengths into weaknesses. Worse, it left me with a debilitating emotional and intellectual dependency on their approval.</p><p><span>The older I became, the more complicated and invasive this upbringing manifested. I can't remember how many times I doubted my instinct because it didn't align with what they called normal. The problem wasn't in my brain; it was in a childhood spent learning to apologize for how I experienced the world. And so I had to rebuild my understanding: </span><strong>I wasn't suffering from ADHD; I was suffering from forced assimilation</strong><span>. My ADHD, and yours, is not an isolated "deficit." It's a cognitive variation that cracks in environments designed for a narrowly-defined norm: in school and later at work.</span></p><p>As a child, my time was split between home and school, two places with the highest concentration of authority figures. And like all authority figures, mine had a plan for me. Follow it, and you'll arrive at the destination all humans strive for. They had an answer for every question, and the system had been in place for so long that it seemed ridiculous to even ask for clarification. But the system built within those walls, and the language they used to explain how it worked, ignored one simple fact: my brain desired nothing of their world.</p><p>In this system, I was neither good nor bad. I simply existed. You wouldn't blame a tree because its nature is incompatible with a factory. And trying to integrate it into machinery is absurd. Sure, you could cut it down and force 5% of its essence into the production line. The factory operators would congratulate themselves, maybe even give talks about successfully 'integrating nature into industry.' But the tree would no longer be a tree. When your environment treats your natural patterns as problems, no amount of self-improvement can make you feel whole.</p><p><span>As I read more and reflected on the dependent stages of my life, I realized my focus needed to shift. Instead of trying to fix myself, I needed to examine an upbringing incompatible with my ADHD. I had to let go of the instinct to rely on the ideas I was taught—about what makes a person fulfilled—as the foundation for every decision. The question was never, "How do I fix myself?" but rather, </span><strong>"What exactly did they do to the young, oblivious, dependent version of me?”</strong></p><p>I'm not alone. This is a story I’ve seen repeated in other males. If you’re an independent, working man struggling with initiation, consistency, or emotional regulation, it’s likely because something went wrong in your upbringing—something deeply unsettling happened to your brain as it developed. This was never a matter of insufficiently firing neurons: your natural patterns of thinking and being were systematically suppressed. The dissatisfaction and incompleteness you feel stem from what happened—and what could have been—during your formative years. And a simple proof is that even when you become clinically organized or productive by society’s standards, you’re still miserable, perhaps even more so.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://claimingattention.substack.com/p/adhd-did-not-break-me-my-parents-did?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://claimingattention.substack.com/p/adhd-did-not-break-me-my-parents-did?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The good news is, it can get better. It won’t be easy, but creating an education for yourself—one managed and tailored by you—is one of the most rewarding things you can do. Here’s what I did (and continue to do) to fully embrace the brain I was born with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Challenge every presupposed, planted conviction</strong><span>. But tread carefully: of course, there will be choices that require humility on your part. Still, take a closer look at the ideas you were fed—when you wore your school uniform, sat down to eat at the dinner table, or defended your actions to a repressive figure. What were the ideas you were taught about the definition of "normal" or "functional," and how many of those ideas are you still carrying with you?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Question your reflexive guilt when you can't maintain a routine others consider basic</strong><span>. Examine your shame about being drawn to what they called distractions. Notice how often you internally apologize for passing thoughts. Look closely at your definition of productivity, of time well spent. Who taught you this? Watch for moments when you judge yourself using their measures of progress. Watch how you hide your rhythms because they don't look professional enough, your reactions because they don't seem normal enough, your unique ways of arriving at truth because they don't fit their narrow path of what's proper and right.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Instead of feeling bad, examine the gap between your current life and the one you yearn for.</strong><span> Every time you call yourself lazy for not starting a task, disorganized for not having a system, or unreliable for missing social cues - you're speaking in a language you were taught by people who didn't understand how your mind works. Ask yourself: am I feeling unfulfilled because I’m building on foundations that were never compatible with my mind? That dissatisfaction might not be a sign of personal failure—it might be proof that you’re still measuring success by standards you inherited rather than ones that align with how you naturally operate.</span></p></li></ul><p>Here are more focused questions I asked (and continue to ask) myself to examine the effects of an incompatible upbringing. The answer might not present itself immediately, so take your time.</p><ul><li><p><strong>What activities or behaviors were you constantly told to stop, though they felt natural to you?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What childhood interests did the current version of you abandon?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Which of your self-criticisms sound exactly like your authority figures?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remember a really good day in your childhood during which no shame or anxiety were present. What did this day look like?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Whose definition of success are you still trying to live up to?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Look at your core beliefs, especially the ones that leave you disappointed for not being able to stick with them: how many of these did you choose, and how many were chosen for you?</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this landscape, you can feel broken. But the most important truth is that your mind is not. It is a vibrant ecosystem with its own patterns, its own seasons, and its own hard-won beauty. It may never fit self-referential systems, but it was never meant to. Instead, it offers an unconventional, exciting path—one lined with subtle possibilities forming as you read this. And even if no one else can see them, remember that your world is your own. And that's enough.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">A better, faster and stronger spiritual successor to BZip2.

  <p>Swift continues to grow in popularity as a cross-platform language supporting a wide variety of use cases, with support on a <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/embedded-swift-examples/">variety of embedded devices</a>, form factors that encompass <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-apps/building_a_watchos_app">wearables</a> to <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/server/">server</a>, and a wide variety of <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html">operating systems</a>. As Swift expands, there’s value in investing in matching cross-platform build tools that provide a powerful, consistent, and flexible experience across the ecosystem.</p>

<p>As a foundational step in this new chapter of Swift build technologies, today Apple is open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build">Swift Build</a>, a powerful and extensible build engine that provides a set of build rules for building Swift projects. Swift Build is the engine used by Xcode, which supports millions of apps in the App Store as well as the internal build process for Apple’s own operating systems. The open source repository also includes support for targeting Linux and Windows.</p>



<p>The primary responsibility of the build system is to transform user-authored inputs (such as a project description and source code) into output artifacts like command line tools, libraries, and applications. Build systems play an important role in providing a great developer experience, enabling higher level features which determine how users architect and work with their projects. Furthermore, the performance and reliability of a build system has a direct impact on developer productivity.</p>

<p>Swift Build is an infrastructural component designed to plan and execute builds requested by a higher-level client like Swift Package Manager or Xcode. It builds on top of the existing <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-llbuild">llbuild</a> project to add capabilities including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robust integration with the Swift compiler to reliably and efficiently coordinate the build of Swift projects</li>
  <li>Support for a wide variety of product types including libraries, command line tools, and GUI applications with advanced build configuration options</li>
  <li>Build graph optimizations that maximize parallelism when building Swift and C code</li>
</ul>



<p>Compared to the build engine in Xcode, the build engine in Swift Package Manager is fairly simple. On Apple platforms, having two different ways to build packages has also led to user confusion when the two implementations’ behavior didn’t match. Contributing Xcode’s build engine to the Swift project and developing it in open source alongside the Swift compiler provides the tools necessary to address these problems and deliver a great builds experience to all Swift users. With this release, SwiftPM now has the opportunity to offer a unified build execution engine across all platforms. This change should be transparent to users and maintain full compatibility with all existing packages while delivering a consistent cross-platform experience. At the same time, it lays the foundation to enable new features and improvements across all platforms and tools, and unlocks new performance optimizations and developer-facing features. As a small first step towards this vision, today the team is submitting a pull request to begin the process of integrating support for Swift Build in SwiftPM as an alternate build engine. In the coming months, we’d like to collaborate with the community to complete the work of unifying build system integrations so users can benefit from future tooling improvements across all platforms and project models.</p>

<p>We believe this is an important step in continuing to enable a healthy package ecosystem where developers can rely on a consistent, polished development experience — no matter what IDE they’re using or platform they’re targeting. We’ll be sharing more details about this work on the Swift forums, and we’re looking forward to hearing others’ feedback!</p>



<p>We look forward to working with the community to continue evolving how we build Swift code. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build"><code>swift-build</code> repository</a> in the Swift organization on GitHub, including a README and documentation describing how to build and contribute. Contributions via pull requests and issues are welcome, and we’d also love to solicit feedback and ideas for improvements on <a href="https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swift-build/">the Swift forum</a>.</p>

<p>This is an exciting new chapter for Swift’s build system, and we’re looking forward to all the potential it opens for Swift!</p>

Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.</p><p>Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude "en route" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.</p>

    

<p>The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.</p><p>Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds "in training" are counted.</p><p>In the report, the FAA cites the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it has struggled to meet staff expansion goals at air traffic control facilities across the country.</p><p>"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA," the agency said in its report. "At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/620x414/bce5979038c9c785067fcae8d4cd0dc6/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8#" alt="Reagan National Airport air control tower " height="414" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/620x414/bce5979038c9c785067fcae8d4cd0dc6/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/1240x828/11a5501402c7b165a3880f7ae4207c83/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20414'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>The staffing targets in the report are goals based on an analysis by a group that included FAA's Air Traffic Organization as well as the controllers' labor union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</p><p>The FAA also included in the report its own internal staffing standards for each facility. Using that standard, which is lower for many facilities than the working group's targets, 45% of the airport towers met the standard, counting only fully-trained controllers. If all controllers in training are included, 59% of the airports met the lower FAA standard.</p><p>"If we hired 2,000 people today, in two, three years from now, we'd see only about 1,000 of them become a certified air traffic controller," National Air Traffic Controllers Association president Nick Daniels told CBS News.</p>

<p>The outlet spoke with digital archivists who are working to identify what was deleted and why. But the answer is more complex than straight up propagandist data scrubbing. "While some of the deletions are surely malicious information scrubbing, some are likely routine artifacts of an administration change, and they are working to determine which is which," said the investigation.  </p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

<p>The reason for why datasets have disappeared could be link rot, i.e. links that no longer work because the URL has been changed, or data has been migrated somewhere else. There isn't a regulated system for how federal agencies archive their data in the repository, and some agencies might have simply archived datasets on their own sites instead. </p><p>Changes in presidential administrations have led to datasets being deleted in the past, either on purpose or by accident. When Biden took office, 1,000 datasets were deleted according to the Wayback Machine, via <a href="https://www.404media.co/archivists-work-to-identify-and-save-the-thousands-of-datasets-disappearing-from-data-gov/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body" title="(opens in a new window)">404 Media's reporting</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Greetings from Read Max HQ! Today’s newsletter is a ~4,700-word missive on the “Zizians,” the transcontinental Rationalist cult implicated in at least six murders since 2022. In the piece, I try to explain “Rationalism,” cover the Ziz lore in a fairly straightforward fashion, and understand why Rationalism has been a breeding ground for so many cult-like objects.</p><p>A reminder! I’m able to write big slabs of in-depth newsletter like this because roughly 3,000 people out of 50,000 total subscribers currently pay to keep this newsletter afloat. I spent this week browsing some of the craziest forums online, reading some of the most tediously knotty prose imaginable, untangling the multi-state journey of this group to present in at least semi-comprehensible fashion--I was able to do it because I can treat this newsletter as a full-time job. If you’re one of the 47,000 people who’s been reading this newsletter for free, consider upgrading to a paid subscription. If you value this kind of thing (5,000 words about technocults), I’m only asking for about the price of one beer a week or ten beers a year.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png" width="1456" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>On the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration last week, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-agent-killed-d99eb6157af85255fa23eea4b2658869" rel="">a Customs and Border Patrol agent was killed in a shootout with two unidentified people following an apparently immigration-related traffic stop miles from the Canadian border in Vermont</a><span>. You could almost hear the right-wing social-news machine salivating with desire at such an easily metabolizable story: “Border Patrol agent killed during traffic stop with migrant suspect in Vermont,” </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/20/us-news/border-patrol-agent-killed-during-traffic-stop-with-migrant-suspect-in-vermont/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="">reported the</a><em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/20/us-news/border-patrol-agent-killed-during-traffic-stop-with-migrant-suspect-in-vermont/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social" rel=""> New York Post</a></em><span> almost immediately. </span><a href="https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1881458400376320137" rel="">Blue-check accounts surfing right-wing outrage for clicks were even less restrained, insisting that the killer was an “illegal immigrant</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>But as it turns out, the story was not quite so easily to instrumentalize. Neither of the suspects was a “migrant,” and both were in the country legally: The surviving occupant of the stopped Honda Prius, a young woman name Teresa Youngblut, was an American citizen and computer-science student. The other, who’d been killed during the gunfight, was a German national with</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gun-allegedly-used-woman-us-border-agent-shoot-was-bought-person-linke-rcna189480" rel=""> a valid visa</a><span> and a history of employment </span><a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1882104649668530586" rel="">as a quant and software developer for well-known hedge funds like Jane Street and Radix</a><span>. Law-enforcement agents had put the pair under surveillance following a tip from an employee of their Vermont hotel, </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69573795/5/1/united-states-v-youngblut/" rel="">who reported that they</a><span> “appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with [Youngblut] carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster.”</span></p><p>None of the right-wing accounts that had initially been pushing the story seemed to know what to make of this development. Who were these armed programmers, and how did they get into a gun battle with the C.B.P.? Elsewhere on Twitter, however, the new information was clarifying, rather than confusing. “Oh no,” tweeted the blogger Jessica Taylor, once she learned the identity of the dead suspect. “I know this person. Went by ‘Ophelia’ (transfeminine). Was involved with rationalist discourse. Was somewhat of a Ziz fan. Oh no.”</p><p>Our alleged shooters--it has become clear over the past week--weren’t the thuggish murderers and rapists of fevered reactionary imagination, but Rationalists: Members of a large and loose community of autodidact and amateur philosophers and activists focused on self-described rationalist inquiry and self-improvement that’s become influential in A.I. research and philanthropy.</p><p>“Rationalism,” in and of itself, doesn’t necessarily lead its adherents into violent confrontations with the state. But it’s also been a breeding ground for a number of--at best--cult-like social formations. For their part, Youngblut and Ophelia, as well as suspects and persons of interest in at least three other murders around the country, seem to have fallen in with the infamous Rationalist blogger “Ziz,” who espouses a hardline philosophy of justice and an eccentric theory of cognition, and whose charisma and rhetorical technique is notable enough among Rationalists to have inspired a number of websites and posts “warning” about her influence.</p><p><span>Within six months I feel confident we’ll get at least two, and possibly as many as four long-form reported pieces written about the Zizians--</span><em>someone </em><span>has to create the I.P. that can be bought and repackaged for the true-crime streaming docudrama!--not to mention a number of podcasts. (It’s unlikely that anyone trying to explain and understand this story, including your humble newsletter proprietor, will outdo the homies at TrueAnon, </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-434-evil-121111568" rel="">whose episode on the Zizians and Rationalists dropped while I was writing this</a><span>.) For now, I can do my best to cobble together a kind of explainer based on the copious but often impenetrable documentation of the Zizian world assembled by Rationalists and fellow travelers.</span></p><p>To best understand Zizians, it helps to have at least a small grounding in the world of Rationalism, which I’m using here as an umbrella term to cover a capacious number of people and groups with overlapping jobs, hobbies, institutions, and interests. (I’m capitalizing the “R” to specify that I mean a very specific contemporary community and school of thought, and not referring to the Enlightenment epistemology, or to any use of reason to pursue or arrive at truth.)</p><p><span>The main idea behind the “Rationalist Movement,” </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-movement#fn8" rel="">as the community sometimes calls itself</a><span>, is that human beings can and should develop their reasoning skills to better purse good (personal, political, economic) outcomes. In practice this tends to mean (1) coming up and experimenting with “cognitive hacks” and “de-bugging” tricks to think more rationally and (2) pursuing </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/timeless-decision-theory" rel="">abstract but meticulously thought-through philosophical games and experiments</a><span> and then attempting to live in compliance with the (often seemingly ridiculous) consequences of that reasoning.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-1-156012376" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> The most famous version of this Rationalist impulse is reasoning yourself into a belief that a godlike computer-based super-intelligence is inevitably coming, and therefore the best use of your time in the present is to devote yourself to ensuring its compliance with human morality.</span></p><p><span>This is, more or less, what the godfather of the Rationalist Movement, a man named Eliezer Yudkowsky, believes. Yudkowsky is the founder of the LessWrong forums--the main online gathering place for Rationalists--as well as the author of </span><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em><span>, a series-length fanfic in which Harry Potter applies Yudkowsky’s reasoning principles to the magic world. (</span><em>HPMoR</em><span>, as it’s known, is many budding Rationalists’ gateway to the community.) Yudkowsky is also the founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (M.I.R.I.), a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that “smarter-than-human A.I.” is safe.</span></p><p><span>Yudkowsky’s long history of banging on about A.I. has helped make both his anxiety about the singularity, and his style of thinking, prominent in the A.I. industry. (OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and </span><a href="http://maxread.substack.com/p/the-interested-normies-guide-to-openai" rel="">nearly broke apart in 2023</a><span>, in part over Yudkowsky-type concerns over “alignment.”) But not everyone under the broad Rationalist umbrella is so intently focused on A.I.: “Effective Altruism,” the utilitarian school of philanthropy that famously lay behind Sam Bankman-Fried’s desire to amass wealth, owes a huge debt to the Rationalist movement (seen in, e.g., the idea of “longtermism”).</span></p><p>And the other key Rationalist institution, the Center for Applied Rationality (C.F.A.R.)--which was founded by a number of prominent LessWrong posters--avoids much A.I. talk and focuses on holding workshops for businesses or interested would-be Rationalists “where we teach and train techniques for forming accurate beliefs, navigating intellectual disagreement, making better use of our internal advisors, developing non-self-deceptive motivation, and building the habit of getting things done.” </p><p><span>Anyway, this should cover enough to follow the rise of the Zizians. If you want a somewhat deeper dive into the world and culture of the Rational movement, I recommend Ellen Huet’s Bloomberg article “</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-03-07/effective-altruism-s-problems-go-beyond-sam-bankman-fried" rel="">The Real-Life Consequences of Silicon Valley’s AI Obsession</a><span>,” Cade Metz’s </span><em>New York Times </em><span>piece “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html" rel="">Silicon Valley’s Safe Space</a><span>,” and Timni Gebru and Émile P. Torres’ paper “</span><a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13636" rel="">The TESCREAL Bundle</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>The story of the Zizians, such as it is, begins in 2019. Ziz, a computer engineer, </span><a href="https://www.uaf.edu/commence/files/2013/degrees/CEM.pdf" rel="">graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013</a><span> and moved to the Bay Area in 2016 </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329011601/https://sinceriously.fyi/rationalist-fleet/" rel="">with the intent of finding a job</a><span> and becoming more involved in A.I. safety and alignment initiatives. She </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328111256/https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative/" rel="">seems to have become well-known around M.I.R.I. and C.F.A.R.</a><span>, attending workshops and lecture, but by 2019, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328111256/https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative/" rel="">after being told by a C.F.A.R. higher-up that she was likely “net negative”</a><span> to the cause of “doing something about A.I.,” Ziz had become disillusioned with the institutions of Rationalism. She </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328164559/https://sinceriously.fyi/intersex-brains-and-conceptual-warfare/" rel="">began writing</a><span> that she’d been convinced of the truth of a former employee’s accusation (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/UZsp2#selection-47.16-55.55" rel="">made on a now-defunct website located at “miricult.com”</a><span>) that “numerous MIRI employees, board members, and donors have all had sex with minors below the age of consent,” and that money donated to the nonprofit was being used to cover up these crimes.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-2-156012376" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>As she became further alienated from the Rationalist scene, Ziz was elaborating on her blog a far-out cognitive model and moral philosophy. As complex and jargon-heavy as much of the writing is outwardly, the gist of what Ziz beleieves is relatively straightforward; </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210718152834/https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2021/05/06/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/" rel="">here’s an excerpt from a good 2021 gloss by a semi-sympathetic interlocutor who goes by the name Slimepriestess</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ziz adheres to a moral principle which classifies all life which has even the potential to be sentient as people and believes that all beings with enough of a mind to possess some semblance of selfhood should have the same rights that are afforded to humans. To her, carnism is a literal holocaust, on ongoing and perpetual nightmare of torture, rape, and murder being conducted on a horrifyingly vast scale by a race of flesh eating monsters.</p></blockquote><p><span>This kind of radical veganism isn’t, in the grand scheme of things, all that strange, especially not among the utilitarians of LessWrong and its associated evirons.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-3-156012376" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> Nor, for that matter, is Ziz’s well-documented identification with all kinds of fictional characters and dynamics--in particular the evil Sith order of the Star Wars universe.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-4-156012376" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> (Hence the frequent headline description of Zizians as “Vegan Sith.”) More distinctive </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2019/12/02/hemisphere-theory-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/" rel="">is what Slimepriestess calls Ziz’s “hemisphere theory”</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ziz states… that most of humanity is neutral or evil, a combined category she calls nongood. They have let evil social norms siphon off their agency and turn them into puppets of an evil system. They have no free will and are okay being puppets of that evil system because they themselves are either actively evil or just don’t care. […] Ziz believes that good is a property of a person’s core. In her earlier posts… this is defined as a sort of nebulous thing that exists at the bottom of a stack of mental structures. Later posts go on to describe this as the specific property of a hemisphere, as in the kind you have two of sitting in your head. You have a left brain and a right brain, and Ziz claims these hemispheres are each a separate person.</p><p><span>[…] In 1 out of 20 people, one hemisphere will have this </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://sinceriously.fyi/spectral-sight-and-good/" rel="">defect</a><span> that causes them to see all creatures the way an average person might see a human child. This makes them Single Good. In 1 out of every 400 people, both of these hemispheres will have this glitch, and the person will be Double Good.</span></p><p><span>Separately from this, one or both of these hemispheres can be the opposite sex to the body, an “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://sinceriously.fyi/intersex-brains-and-conceptual-warfare/" rel="">intersex brain condition</a><span>” which leads one to end up trans or nonbinary. If someone has one hemisphere of one sex, and the other hemisphere another sex, they’re bigender. The Left hemisphere tends to be the male one in bigender humans and the right hemisphere tends to be the female one.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>According to Ziz, these two separate hemispheres can be “debucketed” and given independent awareness, not unlike the controversial dissociative identity disorder diagnosis. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202165812/https://sinceriously.fyi/good-group-and-paseks-doom/" rel="">In 2018, Ziz and some friends experimented with “unihemispheric sleep”</a><span> i.e., an attempt to put one half of your brain to sleep, as a means of “debucketing.” One friend, Maia Pasek--who, Ziz writes, later “changed ‘Maia’ to just the name of their right hemisphere. And ‘Shine’ to be the name of the left hemisphere”--</span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQGFeKvjydztpgnsY/occupational-infohazards" rel="">allegedly died by suicide in the midst of these experiments</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But Pasek’s death didn’t seem to have much effect on Ziz’s developing radical practice. In November 2019, Ziz, then 28, and three associates--“Zizians,” though they probably wouldn’t have described themselves as such--</span><a href="https://www.sonomanews.com/article/news/authorities-id-four-arrested-in-westminster-woods-protest/?artslide=3" rel="">donned Guy Fawkes masks and barricaded the entrance to a C.F.A.R. reunion celebration</a><span>, refusing to let participants leave. The police were called, a S.W.A.T. team was sent in, and the four protestors were arrested. A transcript of the two-page pamphlet the protestors were said to be handing out </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200905172318/https://archive.nova.noblejury.com/ziz/ziz-pamphlet-transcript.txt" rel="">is still available online</a><span>; here’s a selection from the second page:</span></p><blockquote><div><p><span>Eliezer offered us heaven</span><br><span>Ill considered-solace in hopes of heaven worships hell</span></p><p><span>Two futures only?

For their part, Ziz and the Zizians were, based on their own blog posts, further radicalized by the aggressive and violent tactics of the police who were called to break up the barricade. They eventually filed a lawsuit against Sonoma County over civil-rights violations.</span></p><p><span>The Zizians laid low for the next few years, continuing to blog and elaborate their theories of the mind as the pandemic spread across the country. In 2021, another Ziz associate, Jay Winterford, died by suicide; </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303031310/https://www.mentalengineering.info/containment-causes-suicidality/" rel="">his final blog post</a><span> refers obliquely to some of Ziz’s philosophical concepts. That same year, Ziz and another C.F.A.R. protest arrestee, Gwen Danielson, skipped bail and failed to show up to their court dates. In November, the group’s lawyer </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.387955/gov.uscourts.cand.387955.47.0.pdf" rel="">attested in a filing</a><span> that </span><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsminer/name/jack-lasota-obituary?id=36432272" rel="">Ziz had apparently died in a boating accident</a><span>, and that Danielson </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/61432586/43/danielson-v-sonoma-county/" rel="">had disappeared and was rumored to have killed herself</a><span> at the age of 28.</span></p><p>Around the same time, the other two Zizian arrestees--Emma Borhanian, 31, and a 27-year-old who goes by “Somni”--were, along with someone called Suri Dao, involved in an altercation with their landlord, an 80-year-old man named Carl Lind who’d opened up some property to RVs and container housing. Lind had been attempting to evict the Zizians, who were supposedly in arrears; in November 2022, a few days before law enforcement was scheduled to undertake the eviction, Somni stabbed Lind through the chest with a samurai sword. Lind in turn shot Somni and Borhanian; Borhanian later died of her wounds, while Lind and Somni survived.</p><p><span>And who else was at the scene? None other than Ziz and Danielson, still quite alive. (Danielson’s name was apparently on the lease.) </span><a href="https://medium.com/@sefashapiro/a-community-warning-about-ziz-76c100180509" rel="">According to SefaShapiro’s meticulous writeup of Zizian activities over the last few years</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Someone I know contacted the police to learn more, and was told that Solano County law enforcement encountered Ziz at the scene, and were aware that Ziz had skipped bail and had a warrant out for her arrest. Bizarrely, however, they didn’t arrest Ziz. Allegedly Ziz said she was in pain and that she needed to go to the hospital, and the police didn’t want the extra trouble of waiting for Ziz to be discharged.</p></blockquote><p><span>Bizarre, indeed. Just a few weeks later, Ziz was arrested in Pennsylvania </span><a href="https://x.com/DracoGlass/status/1883011592826364054/photo/1" rel="">for obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct</a><span> in connection with </span><a href="https://6abc.com/chester-heights-murder-investigation-richard-zajko-rita-delaware-county-homicide/12757224/" rel="">the double homicide of Richard Zajko, 72, and Rita Zajko, 69</a><span>. The Zajkos’ daughter, Michelle, who went by “plum” online, is a friend of Ziz who </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220217023845/https://www.plumofdiscord.com/post/675855867193769984/i-became-a-full-time-internet-pest-and-may-not" rel="">once wrote a blog post describing Ziz’s attempts to convince her to murder Ziz’s mentor Alice</a><span>; according to SefaShapiro, Pennsylvania police have said that Ziz, Michelle, and a third person named Daniel Blank were “very plausibly involved in the double homicide.”</span></p><p>Ziz was released by Pennsylvania authorities in mid-2023, and the Zizians were largely unheard from for the next 18 months. Then, on January 17, three days before the Vermont shootout, Carl Lind, the Zizians’ former landlord, was stabbed to death in Vallejo. A week later, cops arrested a 22-year-old data scientist named Maximilian Snyder--who had previously applied for a marriage license with Teresa Youngblut in Washington state in November. </p><p><span>Meanwhile, Michelle Zajko, who owns property in Vermont not far from the location of the shootout, is back in the news--because she appears to have purchased the guns that Ophelia and Youngblut were carrying last Monday and </span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/28/federal-officials-link-third-person-of-interest-to-vermont-border-patrol-agents-shooting/" rel="">has been named a person of interest in the shooting</a><span>. In a court filing from earlier this week, the prosecutor on Youngblut’s case obliquely referenced Ziz, </span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/27/prosecutor-says-woman-charged-in-fatal-border-agent-shooting-had-ties-to-people-of-interest-in-other-homicides/" rel="">who’s clearly of interest to law enforcement now</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Both Youngblut and the person who allegedly purchased the firearms used in the Vermont shooting, Lasher wrote, were “acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with an individual who was detained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during that homicide investigation; that individual is also a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California.”</p></blockquote><p>Ziz, as far as I know, as still at large.</p><p><span>The Zizians, believe it or not, are not the only cult-like groupuscule to have emerged from the heady stew of the Rationalist community. In 2021, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@zoecurzi/my-experience-with-leverage-research-17e96a8e540b#c778" rel="">Zoe Curzi wrote a long Medium post about her time at the Rationalism-adjacent nonprofit Leverage Research</a><span>, which held “2–6hr long group debugging sessions in which we as a sub-faction (Alignment Group) would attempt to articulate a ‘demon’ which had infiltrated our psyches from one of the rival groups, its nature and effects, and get it out of our systems using debugging tools,” and whose employees “genuinely thought we were going to take over the US government.”  </span></p><p><span>That essay </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe#Strange_psycho_social_metaphysical_hypotheses_in_a_group_setting" rel="">inspired a LessWrong post from Jessica Taylor</a><span> about her experiences at M.I.R.I. and C.F.A.R., where “there were also psychotic breaks involving demonic subprocess narratives,” and where people in positions of power would “debug” underlings. “I experienced myself and others being distanced from old family and friends, who didn't understand how high-impact the work we were doing was,” she writes. </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=4j2GS4yWu6stGvZWs" rel="">In the comments at the time</a><span>, Scott Alexander, maybe the most prominent Rationalist besides Yudkowsky, suggested that the problem was not really M.I.R.I. or C.F.A.R. so much as that Taylor was in a cult-like group centered around a former M.I.R.I. head named Michael Vassar</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-6-156012376" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Jessica was (I don't know if she still is) part of a group centered around a person named Vassar, informally dubbed "the Vassarites". Their philosophy is complicated, but they basically have a kind of gnostic stance where regular society is infinitely corrupt and conformist and traumatizing and you need to "jailbreak" yourself from it (I'm using a term I found on Ziz's discussion of her conversations with Vassar; I don't know if Vassar uses it himself). Jailbreaking involves a lot of tough conversations, breaking down of self, and (at least sometimes) lots of psychedelic drugs.</p><p>Vassar ran MIRI a very long time ago, but either quit or got fired […] Since then, he's tried to "jailbreak" a lot of people associated with MIRI and CFAR - again, this involves making them paranoid about MIRI/CFAR and convincing them to take lots of drugs. The combination of drugs and paranoia caused a lot of borderline psychosis, which the Vassarites mostly interpreted as success ("these people have been jailbroken out of the complacent/conformist world, and are now correctly paranoid and weird"). Occasionally it would also cause full-blown psychosis, which they would discourage people from seeking treatment for, because they thought psychiatrists were especially evil and corrupt and traumatizing and unable to understand that psychosis is just breaking mental shackles. </p></blockquote><p><span>Taylor </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQGFeKvjydztpgnsY/occupational-infohazards" rel="">wrote a follow-up post disputing Alexander’s account</a><span> of the situation; I don’t know that I have the patience or energy to really get to the bottom of it all except to say: </span><em>It all kinda sounds pretty culty to me!</em><span> And I haven’t even gotten into </span><a href="https://x.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1464742982943264768" rel="">the Burning Man camp Black Lotus</a><span> or </span><a href="https://medium.com/@shekinahalegra/dear-monastic-academy-and-community-members-49c25d9646a4" rel="">the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth</a><span>!</span></p><p><span>Why does Rationalism have a tendency to produce cults, or at least cult-like clusters? The basic answer, I think, is that the whole Rationalist program effectively generates potential cult subjects. Here, to give an example, is </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LbbrnRvc9QwjJeics/new-user-s-guide-to-lesswrong#What_LessWrong_is_about___Rationality_" rel="">an excerpted list of personal qualities that make for a likely Rationalist</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>LessWrong is a good place for someone who:</p><ul><li><p><span>values curiosity, learning, self-improvement, figuring out what's actually true (rather than just what you </span><em>want </em><span>to be true or just winning arguments)</span></p></li><li><p>will change their mind or admit they're wrong in response to compelling evidence or argument</p></li><li><p>wants to work collaboratively with others to figure out what's true […] </p></li><li><p><span>is nerdy and interested in all questions of </span><em>how the world works</em><span> and who is not afraid to reach weird conclusions if the arguments seem valid</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p>These are all good qualities individually. But as a whole package what you have is a person convinced of their own inadequacy, eager for social connection and personal development, and endlessly persuadable by sophistry. Feeling comfortable with your own epistemological position, even if you know it’s flawed, is not the preferred mode for Rationalist development, but it’s pretty foundational to building a stable sense of self. By the same token, the ability to dismiss an argument with a “that sounds nuts,” without needing recourse to a point-by-point rebuttal, is anathema to the rationalist project. But it’s a pretty important skill to have if you want to avoid joining cults.</p><p>Just based on its name and its most prominent interests, it’s easy to imagine the Rationalist Movement as a kind of empirically grounded alliance of engineers promoting the scientific method. And there are certainly groups underneath the big Rationalist umbrella for whom that is a fair description. But when you poke around a little bit--when you read about how “Rationalism” plays out in its communities in practice--the “movement” starts to feel a little less STEM and a lot more New Age: A suspect program for self-improvement, with existential stakes, a strong emphasis on self-experimentation, and a deleterious commitment to openness. In this sense its predecessors are not really the original enlightenment rationalists, but the dubious touchstones of ‘60s-hangover California--Scientology and Dianetics, Werner Erhard and est, the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Manson Family.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

She archived whatever she could.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What they feared quickly came to pass. Already, content from the CDC’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System</a>, which includes data from a national survey, has disappeared; so have parts of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s Social Vulnerability Index</a> and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/eji/index.html">Environmental Justice Index</a>. The CDC’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/index.html">landing page for HIV data</a> has also vanished. And the agency’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/about/atlasplus.html">AtlasPlus tool</a>, which contains nearly 20 years of CDC surveillance data on HIV, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis, is down. Several scientists I talked with told me they had heard directly from contacts at the CDC that the agency has directed employees to scrub any mention of “gender” from its site and the data that it shares there, replacing it with “sex.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by <em>The Atlantic</em> indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [<em>sic</em>], non-binary [<em>sic</em>], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-stis-and-gay-men.html">higher rates of STIs</a>, but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067055/">lower rates of obesity</a>; transgender women have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/transgender-women-hiv-socioeconomic-risks-cdc/">higher rates of HIV</a>, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/health/syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia-cdc.html">plateau</a> in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>
