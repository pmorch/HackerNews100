                <p><img src="https://localmess.github.io/assets/img/websites-app-ID-sharing.png" alt="Web-to-native ID sharing"></p><p>We disclose a novel tracking method by Meta and Yandex potentially affecting
                    billions of Android users. We found that native Android apps‚Äîincluding <strong>Facebook,
                        Instagram</strong>, and
                    several <strong>Yandex apps including Maps and Browser‚Äîsilently listen on fixed local
                        ports</strong> for tracking purposes. </p>
                <p>These native Android apps receive browsers' metadata, cookies and commands from
                    the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica scripts embedded on thousands of web sites. These JavaScripts load
                    on users' mobile browsers and silently connect with native apps running on the same device through
                    localhost sockets. As native apps access programatically
                    device identifiers like the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248">Android
                        Advertising ID (AAID)</a> or handle user identities as in the case
                    of Meta apps, this method effectively allows these organizations to <strong>link mobile
                        browsing sessions and web cookies to user identities</strong>, hence de-anonymizing users'
                    visiting sites embedding their scripts.</p>
                <p>This web-to-app ID sharing method bypasses typical privacy protections such as clearing
                    cookies, Incognito Mode and Android's permission controls. Worse, it opens the door for potentially
                    malicious apps eavesdropping on users‚Äô web activity.

<p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>
<p>The covert tracking‚Äîimplemented in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href="https://ads.yandex/metrica">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers‚Äîallows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such <span>as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a></span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning">&nbsp;partitioning</a> and <a href="https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/storage-partitioning">storage partitioning</a>, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site.</p>
<h2>A blatant violation</h2>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,‚Äù Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. ‚ÄúYou run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.‚Äù</p>
<p>The bypass‚Äîwhich Yandex began in 2017 and Meta started last September‚Äîallows the companies to pass cookies or other identifiers from Firefox and Chromium-based browsers to native Android apps for Facebook, Instagram, and various Yandex apps. The companies can then tie that vast browsing history to the account holder logged into the app.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This abuse has been observed only in Android, and evidence suggests that the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica target only Android users. The researchers say it may be technically feasible to target iOS because browsers on that platform allow developers to programmatically <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279249">establish localhost connections</a> that apps can monitor on local ports.</p>
<p>In contrast to iOS, however, Android imposes fewer controls on local host communications and background executions of mobile apps, the researchers said, while also implementing stricter controls in app store vetting processes to limit such abuses. This overly permissive design allows Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica to send web requests with web tracking identifiers to specific local ports that are continuously monitored by the Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex apps. These apps can then link pseudonymous web identities with actual user identities, even in private browsing modes, effectively de-anonymizing users‚Äô browsing habits on sites containing these trackers.</p>
<p>Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are analytics scripts designed to help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are estimated to be installed on <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Facebook-Pixel%20">5.8 million</a> and <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Yandex-Metrika">3 million</a> sites, respectively.</p>
<p>Meta and Yandex achieve the bypass by abusing basic functionality built into modern mobile browsers that allows browser-to-native app communications. The functionality lets browsers send web requests to local Android ports to establish various services, including media connections through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication">RTC protocol</a>, file sharing, and developer debugging.</p>

<p>While the technical underpinnings differ, both Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are performing a ‚Äúweird protocol misuse‚Äù to gain unvetted access that Android provides to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1946193/whats-the-whole-point-of-localhost-hosts-and-ports-at-all">localhost ports</a> on the 127.0.0.1 IP address. Browsers access these ports without user notification. Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex native apps silently listen on those ports, copy identifiers in real time, and link them to the user logged into the app.</p>

<p>A representative for Google said the behavior violates the terms of service for its Play marketplace and the privacy expectations of Android users.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe developers in this report are using capabilities present in many browsers across iOS and Android in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles,‚Äù the representative said, referring to the people who write the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica JavaScript. ‚ÄúWe've already implemented changes to mitigate these invasive techniques and have opened our own investigation and are directly in touch with the parties.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meta didn't answer emailed questions for this article, but provided the following statement: "We are in discussions with Google to address a potential miscommunication regarding the application of their policies. Upon becoming aware of the concerns, we decided to pause the feature while we work with Google to resolve the issue."</p>
<p>Yandex representatives didn't answer an email seeking comment.</p>
<h2>How Meta and Yandex de-anonymize Android users</h2>
<p>Meta Pixel developers have abused various protocols to implement the covert listening since the practice began last September. They started by causing apps to send HTTP requests to port 12387. A month later, Meta Pixel stopped sending this data, even though Facebook and Instagram apps continued to monitor the port.</p>
<p>In November, Meta Pixel switched to a new method that invoked WebSocket, a protocol for two-way communications, over port 12387.</p>
<p>That same month, Meta Pixel also deployed a new method that used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>, a real-time peer-to-peer communication protocol commonly used for making audio or video calls in the browser. This method used a complicated process known as <a href="https://webrtchacks.com/not-a-guide-to-sdp-munging/">SDP munging</a>, a technique for JavaScript code to modify Session Description Protocol data before it‚Äôs sent. Still in use today, the SDP munging by Meta Pixel inserts key _fbp cookie content into fields meant for connection information. This causes the browser to send that data as part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN request</a> to the Android local host, where the Facebook or Instagram app can read it and link it to the user.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In May, a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/PIJZN5MTZF4/m/JHVmmn8yDgAJ?pli=1">beta version</a> of Chrome introduced a mitigation that blocked the type of SDP munging that Meta Pixel used. Within days, Meta Pixel circumvented the mitigation by adding a new method that swapped the STUN requests with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN requests</a>.</p>

The user opens the native Facebook or Instagram app, which eventually is sent to the background and creates a background service to listen for incoming traffic on a TCP port (12387 or 12388) and a UDP port (the first unoccupied port in 12580‚Äì12585). Users must be logged-in with their credentials on the apps.<br>
2. The user opens their browser and visits a website integrating the Meta Pixel.<br>
3. At this stage, some websites wait for users' consent before embedding Meta Pixel. In our measurements of the top 100K website homepages, we found websites that require consent to be a minority (more than 75% of affected sites does not require user consent)...<br>
4. The Meta Pixel script is loaded and the _fbp cookie is sent to the native Instagram or Facebook app via WebRTC (STUN) SDP Munging.<br>
5. The Meta Pixel script also sends the _fbp value in a request to https://www.facebook.com/tr along with other parameters such as page URL (dl), website and browser metadata, and the event type (ev) (e.g., PageView, AddToCart, Donate, Purchase).<br>
6. The Facebook or Instagram apps receive the _fbp cookie from the Meta JavaScripts running on the browser and transmits it to the GraphQL endpoint (https://graph[.]facebook[.]com/graphql) along with other persistent user identifiers, linking users' fbp ID (web visit) with their Facebook or Instagram account.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first known instance of Yandex Metrica linking websites visited in Android browsers to app identities was in May 2017, when the tracker started sending HTTP requests to local ports 29009 and 30102. In May 2018, Yandex Metrica also began sending the data through HTTPS to ports 29010 and 30103. Both methods remained in place as of publication time.</p>

<p>Some browsers for Android have blocked the abusive JavaScript in trackers. DuckDuckGo, for instance, was already blocking domains and IP addresses associated with the trackers, preventing the browser from sending any identifiers to Meta. The browser also blocked most of the domains associated with Yandex Metrica. After the researchers notified DuckDuckGo of the incomplete blacklist, developers added the missing addresses.</p>
<p>The Brave browser, meanwhile, also blocked the sharing of identifiers due to its extensive blocklists and existing mitigation to <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block requests</a> to the localhost without explicit user consent<span>.</span> Vivaldi, another Chromium-based browser, forwards the identifiers to local Android ports when the default privacy setting is in place. Changing the setting to block trackers appears to thwart browsing history leakage, the researchers said.</p>

<h2>There‚Äôs got to be a better way</h2>
<p>The various remedies DuckDuckGo, Brave, Vivaldi, and Chrome have put in place are working as intended, but the researchers caution they could become ineffective at any time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny browser doing blocklisting will likely enter into a constant arms race, and it's just a partial solution,‚Äù Vallina Rodriguez said of the current mitigations. ‚ÄúCreating effective blocklists is hard, and browser makers will need to constantly monitor the use of this type of capability to detect other hostnames potentially abusing localhost channels and then updating their blocklists accordingly.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>While this solution works once you know the hostnames doing that, it's not the right way of mitigating this issue, as trackers may find ways of accessing this capability (e.g., through more ephemeral hostnames). A long-term solution should go through the design and development of privacy and security controls for localhost channels, so that users can be aware of this type of communication and potentially enforce some control or limit this use (e.g., a permission or some similar user notifications).</p></blockquote>
<p>Chrome and most other Chromium-based browsers executed the JavaScript as Meta and Yandex intended. Firefox did as well, although for reasons that aren't clear, the browser was not able to successfully perform the SDP munging specified in later versions of the code. After blocking the STUN variant of SDP munging in the early May beta release, a production version of Chrome released <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/137">two weeks ago</a> began blocking both the STUN and TURN variants. Other Chromium-based browsers are likely to implement it in the coming weeks. Firefox didn't respond to an email asking if it has plans to block the behavior in that browser.</p>

    <div>
          
          

<p>The researchers warn that the current fixes are so specific to the code in the Meta and Yandex trackers that it would be easy to bypass them with a simple update.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey know that if someone else comes in and tries a different port number, they may bypass this protection,‚Äù said Gunes Acar, the researcher behind the initial discovery, referring to the Chrome developer team at Google. ‚ÄúBut our understanding is they want to send this message that they will not tolerate this form of abuse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fellow researcher Vallina-Rodriguez said the more comprehensive way to prevent the abuse is for Android to overhaul the way it handles access to local ports.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fundamental issue is that the access to the local host sockets is completely uncontrolled on Android,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThere's no way for users to prevent this kind of communication on their devices. Because of the dynamic nature of JavaScript code and the difficulty to keep blocklists up to date, the right way of blocking this persistently is by limiting this type of access at the mobile platform and browser level, including stricter platform policies to limit abuse.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Got consent?</h2>
<p>The researchers who made this discovery are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aniketh Girish, PhD student at <a href="https://networks.imdea.org/">IMDEA Networks</a></li>
<li>Gunes Acar, assistant professor in <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences">Radboud University‚Äôs</a> Digital Security Group &amp; iHub</li>
<li>Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, associate professor at IMDEA Networks</li>
<li>Nipuna Weerasekara, PhD student at IMDEA Networks</li>
<li>Tim Vlummens, PhD student at <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/">COSIC, KU Leuven</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Acar said he first noticed Meta Pixel accessing local ports while visiting his own university's website.</p>
<p>There's no indication that Meta or Yandex has disclosed the tracking to either websites hosting the trackers or end users who visit those sites. Developer forums show that many websites using Meta Pixel were caught off guard when the scripts began connecting to local ports.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSince 5th September, our internal JS error tracking has been flagging failed fetch requests to localhost:12387,‚Äù one developer <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/community/threads/317050484803752/">wrote</a>. ‚ÄúNo changes have been made on our side, and the existing Facebook tracking pixel we use loads via Google Tag Manager.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs there some way I can disable this?‚Äù another developer encountering the unexplained local port access <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/community/threads/937149104821259/">asked</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether browser-to-native-app tracking violates any privacy laws in various countries. Both Meta and companies hosting its Meta Pixel, however, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/lawsuits-say-meta-evaded-apple-privacy-settings-to-spy-on-millions-of-users/">have</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">faced</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/meta-wont-say-what-happened-to-taxpayer-data-it-may-have-illegally-collected/">raft</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/amc-to-pay-8m-for-allegedly-violating-1988-law-with-use-of-meta-pixel/">lawsuits</a> in recent years alleging that the data collected violates privacy statutes. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00710">research paper</a> from 2023 found that Meta pixel, then called the Facebook Pixel, "tracks a wide range of user activities on websites with alarming detail, especially on websites classified as sensitive categories under GDPR," the abbreviation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>So far, Google has provided no indication that it plans to redesign the way Android handles local port access. For now, the most comprehensive protection against Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica tracking is to refrain from installing the Facebook, Instagram, or Yandex apps on Android devices.</p>

Estimates of the sum total of the damage range from US $2 billion to $7 billion. Supposedly planned for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/operation-spiderweb-visual-guide-ukraine-drone-attack-russian-aircraft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">year and a half</a>, the Ukrainian operation was exceptional in its sophistication: Ukrainian agents reportedly smuggled dozens of first-person-view attack <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/drones">drones</a> into <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/russia">Russia</a> on trucks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">situating them close to the air bases</a> where the target aircraft were vulnerable on tarmacs. The bases included one in Irkutsk, 4,300 kilometers from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and another in south Murmansk, 1,800 km away. Remote pilots in Ukraine then launched the killer drones simultaneously.
	</em></p><p><em>
	The far-reaching operation was being hailed as the most inventive and bold of the war so far. Indeed, </em>IEEE Spectrum<em> has been regularly covering the ascent of Ukraine‚Äôs military drone programs, both </em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-hackers-war" target="_self">offensive</a></em><em> and </em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-air-defense" target="_self">defensive</a></em><em>, and for </em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/drone-warfare-ukraine">air</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sea-drone" target="_self">marine</a></em><em>, and </em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-drones-2671254184" target="_self">land</a></em><em> missions. In this article, originally posted on April 6, we described another bold Ukrainian drone initiative, which was applying artificial intelligence-based navigational software to enable killer drones to navigate to targets even in the presence of heavy <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/jamming">jamming</a>.</em></p><p><strong><span></span>After the Estonian startup </strong><a href="https://www.krattworks.com/" target="_blank">KrattWorks</a> dispatched the first batch of its <a href="https://www.krattworks.com/isr-ghostdragon" target="_blank">Ghost Dragon ISR</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/quadcopters">quadcopters</a> to Ukraine in mid-2022, the company‚Äôs officers thought they might have six months or so before they‚Äôd need to reconceive the drones in response to new battlefield realities. The 46-centimeter-wide flier was far more robust than the hobbyist-grade <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/uavs">UAVs</a> that came to define the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-hackers-war" target="_self">early days of the drone war</a> against Russia. But within a scant three months, the Estonian team realized their painstakingly fine-tuned device had already become obsolete.

Its latest technology is a neural-network-driven optical navigation system, which allows the drone to continue its mission even when all radio and satellite-navigation links are jammed. It began tests in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine" target="_self">Ukraine</a> in December, part of a trend toward jam-resistant, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=autonomous+drones" target="_self">autonomous UAVs</a> (uncrewed aerial vehicles).

	‚ÄúThe situation with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electronic-warfare">electronic warfare</a> is moving extremely fast,‚Äù says Martin Karmin, KrattWorks‚Äô cofounder and chief operations officer. ‚ÄúWe have to constantly iterate. It‚Äôs like a cat-and-mouse game.‚Äù
</p><p>
	I met Karmin at the company‚Äôs headquarters in the outskirts of Estonia‚Äôs capital, Tallinn. Just a couple of hundred kilometers to the east is the tiny nation‚Äôs border with Russia, its former oppressor. At 38, Karmin is barely old enough to remember what life was like under Russian rule, but he‚Äôs heard plenty. He and his colleagues, most of them volunteer members of the 
	<a href="https://www.kaitseliit.ee/en/edl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Estonian Defense League</a>, have ‚Äúno illusions‚Äù about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/russia" target="_self">Russia</a>, he says with a shrug.
</p><p>
	His company is as much about arming <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/estonia">Estonia</a> as it is about helping Ukraine, he acknowledges. Estonia is not officially at war with Russia, of course, but regions around the border between the two countries have for years been subjected to persistent jamming of satellite-based <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/navigation-systems">navigation systems</a>, such as the 
	<a href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-space/galileo-satellite-navigation_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Union‚Äôs Galileo satellites</a>, forcing occasional flight cancellations at Tartu airport. In November, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite" target="_self">satellite</a> imagery revealed that Russia is expanding its military bases along the Baltic states‚Äô borders.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúWe are a small country,‚Äù Karmin says. ‚ÄúInnovation is our only chance.‚Äù
</p><h2>Navigating by Neural Network</h2><p>
	In KrattWorks‚Äô spacious, white-walled workshop, a handful of engineers are testing software. On the large ocher desk that dominates the room, a selection of KrattWorks‚Äô devices is on display, including a couple of fixed-wing, smoke-colored UAVs designed to serve as aerial decoys, and the Ghost Dragon ISR 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/quadcopter" target="_self">quadcopter</a>, the company‚Äôs flagship product.
</p><p>
	Now in its third generation, the Ghost Dragon has come a long way since 2022. Its original command-and-control-band 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radio" target="_self">radio</a> was quickly replaced with a smart frequency-hopping system that constantly scans the available spectrum, looking for bands that aren‚Äôt jammed. It allows operators to switch among six radio-frequency bands to maintain control and also send back video even in the face of hostile jamming.
</p><p><img alt="A black quadcopter drone hovers in front of a coniferous tree." data-rm-shortcode-id="a63ed6b62a8e73e583b5ce084557e634" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-quadcopter-drone-hovers-in-front-of-a-coniferous-tree.jpg?id=59800498&amp;width=980" height="794" id="ca339" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-quadcopter-drone-hovers-in-front-of-a-coniferous-tree.jpg?id=59800498&amp;width=980" width="1270"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Ghost Dragon reconnaissance drone from Krattworks can navigate autonomously, by detecting landmarks as it flies over them. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">KrattWorks</small></p><p>
	The drone‚Äôs dual-band satellite-navigation receiver can switch among the four main satellite positioning services: 
	<a href="https://family1st.io/gps-vs-glonass-vs-galileo-whats-the-best-gnss/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GPS, Galileo</a>, China‚Äôs BeiDou, and Russia‚Äôs <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glonass">GLONASS</a>. It‚Äôs been augmented with a spoof-proof algorithm that compares the satellite-navigation input with data from onboard sensors. The system provides protection against sophisticated spoofing attacks that attempt to trick drones into self-destruction by persuading them they‚Äôre flying at a much higher altitude than they actually are.
</p><p>
	At the heart of the quadcopter‚Äôs matte grey body is a machine-vision-enabled computer running a 1-gigahertz Arm processor that provides the Ghost Dragon with its latest superpower: the ability to navigate autonomously, without access to any global navigation satellite system (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gnss">GNSS</a>). To do that, the computer runs a 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neural-network" target="_self">neural network</a> that, like an old-fashioned traveler, compares views of landmarks with positions on a map to determine its position. More precisely, the drone uses real-time views from a downward-facing optical camera, comparing them against stored satellite images, to determine its position.

	‚ÄúEven if it gets lost, it can recognize some patterns, like crossroads, and update its position,‚Äù Karmin says. ‚ÄúIt can make its own decisions, somewhat, either to return home or to fly through the jamming bubble until it can reestablish the GNSS link again.‚Äù
</p><h2>Designing Drones for High Lethality per Cost</h2><p>
	Just as machine guns and tanks defined the First World War, drones have become emblematic of Ukraine‚Äôs struggle against Russia. It was the besieged Ukraine that first turned the concept of a military drone on its head. Instead of Predators and Reapers worth tens of millions of dollars each, Ukraine began purchasing huge numbers of off-the-shelf fliers worth a few hundred dollars apiece‚Äîthe kind used by filmmakers and enthusiasts‚Äîand turned them into highly lethal <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/weapons">weapons</a>. A recent 
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones-deaths.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>New York Times</em></em> investigation</a> found that drones account for 70 percent of deaths and injuries in the ongoing conflict.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúWe have much less artillery than Russia, so we had to compensate with drones,‚Äù says 
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serhii-skoryk-20b02728b/?originalSubdomain=ua" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serhii Skoryk</a>, commercial director at <a href="https://kvertus.ua/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kvertus</a>, a Kyiv-based electronic-warfare company. ‚ÄúA missile is worth perhaps a million dollars and can kill maybe 12 or 20 people. But for one million dollars, you can buy 10,000 drones, put four grenades on each, and they will kill 1,000 or even 2,000 people or destroy 200 tanks.‚Äù

	Electronic warfare techniques such as jamming and spoofing aim to neutralize the drone threat. A drone that gets jammed and loses contact with its pilot and also loses its spatial bearings will either crash or fly off randomly until its battery dies.
	<a href="https://static.rusi.org/403-SR-Russian-Tactics-web-final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> According to the Royal United Services Institute</a>, a U.K. defense think tank, Ukraine may be losing about 10,000 drones per month, mostly due to jamming. That number includes explosives-laden kamikaze drones that don‚Äôt reach their targets, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance drones like KrattWorks‚Äô Ghost Dragon, meant for longer service.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúDrones have become a consumable item,‚Äù says Karmin. ‚ÄúYou will get maybe 10 or 15 missions out of a reconnaissance drone, and then it has to be already paid off because you will lose it sooner or later.‚Äù
</p><p>
	 Russia took an unexpected step in the summer of 2024, ditching sophisticated wireless control in favor of hard-wired drones fitted with spools of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/optical-fiber">optical fiber.
</a></p><p>
	Tech minds on both sides of the conflict have therefore been working hard to circumvent electronic defenses. Russia took an unexpected step starting in early 2024, deploying hard-wired drones fitted with spools of optical fiber. Like a twisted variation on a child‚Äôs kite, the lethal UAVs can venture 20 or more kilometers away from the controller, the hair-thin fiber floating behind them, providing an unjammable connection.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúRight now, there is no protection against <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fiber-optic">fiber-optic</a> drones,‚Äù 
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadym-burukin-1378abbb/?originalSubdomain=ua" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vadym Burukin</a>, cofounder of the Ukrainian drone startup <a href="https://huless.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Huless</a>, tells <em><em>IEEE</em></em>&nbsp;<em><em>Spectrum</em></em>. ‚ÄúThe Russians scaled this solution pretty fast, and now they are saturating the battle front with these drones. It‚Äôs a huge problem for Ukraine.‚Äù
</p><p><img alt="A drone carrying a large cylindrical object flies over a blurry forest background." data-rm-shortcode-id="c5a9250fbac728b7b2a951af2e4492d2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-drone-carrying-a-large-cylindrical-object-flies-over-a-blurry-forest-background.jpg?id=59800502&amp;width=980" height="2766" id="b73cf" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-drone-carrying-a-large-cylindrical-object-flies-over-a-blurry-forest-background.jpg?id=59800502&amp;width=980" width="4425"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">One way that drone operators can defeat electronic jamming is by communicating with their drone via a fiber optic line that pays out of a spool as the drone flies. This is a tactic favored by Russian units, although this particular first-person-view drone is Ukrainian. It was demonstrated near Kyiv on 29 January 2025.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Efrem Lukatsky/AP</small></p><p>
	Ukraine, too, has experimented with optical fiber, but the technology didn‚Äôt take off, as it were. ‚ÄúThe optical fiber costs upwards from $500, which is, in many cases, more than the drone itself,‚Äù Burukin says. ‚ÄúIf you use it in a drone that carries <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/explosives">explosives</a>, you lose some of that capacity because you have the weight of the cable.‚Äù The extra weight also means less capacity for better-quality cameras, sensors, and computers in reconnaissance drones.
</p><h2>Small Drones May Soon Be Making Kill-or-No-Kill Decisions</h2><p>
	Instead, Ukraine sees the future in autonomous navigation. This past July, kamikaze drones equipped with an autonomous navigation system from U.S. supplier
	<a href="https://auterion.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Auterion</a> destroyed a column of Russian tanks fitted with jamming devices.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúIt was really hard to strike these tanks because they were jamming everything,‚Äù says Burukin. ‚ÄúThe drones with the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autopilot">autopilot</a> were the only equipment that could stop them.‚Äù
</p><p><img alt="A diagram shows a quadcopter drone flying above a communications tower as it attempts to navigate to an enemy tank." data-rm-shortcode-id="4009b55dda0d71df9507b2de4cc944ef" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-shows-a-quadcopter-drone-flying-above-a-communications-tower-as-it-attempts-to-navigate-to-an-enemy-tank.jpg?id=59800510&amp;width=980" height="1165" id="3ddb9" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-shows-a-quadcopter-drone-flying-above-a-communications-tower-as-it-attempts-to-navigate-to-an-enemy-tank.jpg?id=59800510&amp;width=980" width="2739"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Auterion‚Äôs ‚Äúterminal guidance‚Äù system uses known landmarks to orient a drone as it seeks out a target. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Auterion</small></p><p>
	The technology used to hit those tanks is called terminal guidance and is the first step toward smart, fully autonomous drones, according to Auterion‚Äôs CEO, Lorenz Meier. The system allows the drone to directly overcome the jamming whether the protected target is a tank, a trench, or a military airfield.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúIf you lock on the target from, let‚Äôs say, a kilometer away and you get jammed as you approach the target, it doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Meier says in an interview. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not losing the target as a manual operator would.‚Äù
</p><p>
	The visual navigation technology trialed by KrattWorks is the next step and an innovation that has only reached the battlefield this year. Meier expects that by the end of 2025, firms including his own will introduce fully autonomous solutions encompassing visual navigation to overcome <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gps-jamming">GPS jamming</a>, as well as terminal guidance and smart target recognition.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúThe operator would only decide the area where to strike, but the decision about the target is made by the drone,‚Äù Meier explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already done with guided shells, but with drones you can do that at mass scale and over much greater distances.‚Äù
</p><p>
	Auterion, founded in 2017 to produce drone software for civilian applications such as grocery delivery, threw itself into the war effort in early 2024, motivated by a desire to equip democratic countries with technologies to help them defend themselves against authoritarian regimes. Since then, the company has made rapid strides, working closely with Ukrainian drone makers and troops.

But for one million dollars, you can buy 10,000 drones, put four grenades on each, and they will kill 1,000 or even 2,000 people or destroy 200 tanks.‚Äù <strong>‚ÄîSerhii Skoryk, Kvertus</strong></span></p><p>
	But purchasing Western equipment is, in the long term, not affordable for Ukraine, a country with a per capita GDP of 
	<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/UKR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">US $5,760</a>‚Äîmuch lower than the European average of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/EUQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$38,270</a>. Fortunately, Ukraine can tap its engineering workforce, which is among the largest in Europe. Before the war, Ukraine was a go-to place for Western companies looking to set up IT- and software-development centers. Many of these workers have since joined Ukraine‚Äôs DIY military-technician (‚Äúmiltech‚Äù) development movement.
</p><p>
	An engineer and founder at a Ukrainian startup that produces long-range kamikaze drones, who didn‚Äôt want to be named because of security concerns, told 
	<em><em>Spectrum</em></em> that the company began developing its own computers and autonomous navigation software for target tracking ‚Äújust to keep the price down.‚Äù The engineer said Ukrainian startups offer advanced military-drone technology at a price that is a small fraction of what established competitors in the West are charging.
</p><p>
	Within three years of the February 2022 Russian invasion, Ukraine produced a world-class defense-tech ecosystem that is not only attracting Western innovators into its fold, but also regularly surpassing them. The keys to Ukraine‚Äôs success are rapid iterations and close cooperation with frontline troops. It‚Äôs a formula that‚Äôs working for Auterion as well. ‚ÄúIf you want to build a leading product, you need to be where the product is needed the most,‚Äù says Meier. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre in Ukraine.‚Äù
</p><p>
	Burukin, from Ukrainian startup Huless, believes that autonomy will play a bigger role in the future of drone warfare than 
	<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-fiber-optic-drones-ukraine-battlefield/33270243.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russia‚Äôs optical fibers</a> will. Autonomous drones not only evade jamming, but their range is limited only by their battery storage. They also can carry more explosives or better cameras and sensors than the wired drones can. On top of that, they don‚Äôt place high demands on their operators.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúIn the perfect world, the drone should take off, fly, find the target, strike it, and report back on the task,‚Äù Burukin says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the development is heading.‚Äù
</p><p>
	The cat-and-mouse game is nowhere near over. Companies including KrattWorks are already thinking about the next innovation that would make drone warfare cheaper and more lethal. By creating a drone <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mesh-network">mesh network</a>, for example, they could send a sophisticated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone followed by a swarm of simpler kamikaze drones to find and attack a target using visual navigation.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúYou can send, like, 10 drones, but because they can fly themselves, you don‚Äôt need a superskilled operator controlling every single one of these,‚Äù notes KrattWorks‚Äô Karmin, who keeps tabs on tech developments in Ukraine with a mixture of professional interest, personal empathy, and foreboding. Rarely does a day go by that he does not think about the expanding Russian military presence near Estonia‚Äôs eastern borders.
</p><p>
	‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a lot of people in Estonia,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe will never have enough skilled drone pilots. We must find another way.‚Äù

<p>For example there is a presentation by Timelex (a belgian law firm specialising in IT/privacy etc). There is a presentation by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (which in 2023 was Ilkka Salmi). Various presentations by EU orgs like ENISA, the commission, europol, Eurojust </p>

<p>Then a bunch of presentations by law enforcement agencies like Europol, French Gendarmerie, Belgian &amp; Swedish justice ministries.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Quarkdown is a modern Markdown-based typetting system, designed around the key concept of <strong>versatility</strong>, by seamlessly compiling a project
into a print-ready book or an interactive presentation.
All through an incredibly powerful Turing-complete extension of Markdown, ensuring your ideas flow automatically into paper.</p>

<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/paged-demo.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/paged-demo.png" alt="Paper demo"></a>
  </p><p dir="auto"><em>Original credits: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7" rel="nofollow">Attention Is All You Need</a></em></p>


<p dir="auto">Born as an extension of CommonMark and GFM, the Quarkdown Flavor brings <strong>functions</strong> to Markdown, along with many other syntax extensions.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is a function call:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".somefunction {arg1} {arg2}
    Body argument"><pre><code>.somefunction {arg1} {arg2}
    Body argument
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Possibilities are unlimited</strong> thanks to an ever-expanding <a href="https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown/blob/main/quarkdown-stdlib/src/main/kotlin/com/quarkdown/stdlib">standard library</a>,
which offers layout builders, I/O, math, conditional statements and loops.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Not enough?</strong> You can still define your own functions and variables ‚Äî all within Markdown.
You can even create awesome libraries for everyone to use.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".function {greet}
    to from:
    **Hello, .to** from .from!

.greet {world} from:{iamgio}"><pre><code>.function {greet}
    to from:
    **Hello, .to** from .from!

.greet {world} from:{iamgio}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Result: <strong>Hello, world</strong> from iamgio!</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto">This out-of-the-box scripting support opens doors to complex and dynamic content that would be otherwise impossible
to achieve with vanilla Markdown.</p>
<p dir="auto">Combined with live preview and ‚ö° fast compilation speed, Quarkdown simply gets the work done.</p>

<p dir="auto">What could be mistaken for a planet is actually a <strong>quark</strong> or, more specifically, a <strong>down quark</strong>,
an elementary particle that is a major constituent of matter: they give life to every complex structure we know of,
while also being one of the lightest objects in existence.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is, indeed, the concept <strong>Quarkdown</strong> is built upon.</p>

<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her name was Caroline Frances Hubert, and she had three claims to fame.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the first place she was the thirty-seventh oldest living human being.  Caroline herself was unimpressed by this fact.  To her way of thinking it was the result of an accident, nothing more.  In any case she had been the thirty-seventh oldest human being for a long, long time, and it got to seem more of a bore than an accomplishment after a while.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the second place she had once been infected with rabies.  Caroline was rather proud of this distinction, though it had also been a long time ago.  There was a certain class of people who were quite impressed with Caroline's bout with rabies, not so much because she survived it but because she <i>hadn't</i>.  It had taken Prime Intellect fifty-six hours to realize it couldn't repair the damage to her nervous system, to backtrack, and to put her together again like Humpty Dumpty.  For fifty-six hours, she had not existed.  She had been dead.  And she was the only one of the trillions of souls in Cyberspace who had ever been dead, even for a little while.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the third place, and most important to Caroline because it represented a real accomplishment rather than an accident or a one-shot stab of cleverness, she was undisputed Queen of the Death Jockeys.  She would always be the thirty-seventh oldest person, and after her rabies experiment Prime Intellect had shut the door on further explorations of that nature.  But the Death Jockeys constantly rated and ranked themselves by inventiveness and daring and many other factors.  It was an ongoing competition, and if Caroline didn't keep working at it she'd be lost in an always-growing crowd of contenders.  Caroline wouldn't admit that her high ranking was important to her, but it was all she had and she threw herself at it with an energy that was fierce and sometimes startling.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As she woke up, a window opened up in front of her, a perfect square of light, razor-edged and opaque.  One cold message floated within it:

</p><p><b>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><tt><b><img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">*</b></tt></td>
<td><tt><b>You have four challengers.</b></tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could have had any surroundings she wanted, even a whole planet of her own design.  A waste of time, she felt.  Her personal space was minimal.  In fact, it was the <i>bare</i> minimum, a floor and a gravity field.  There was no visual distinction between the floor and the sky or ceiling or whatever you chose to call it.  Everything was exactly the same shade of soft white.  When she wanted to relax she turned off the gravity and floated in free-fall.  When she wanted to sleep, she turned off the light.  If she wanted anything else, she called for it and then got rid of it when she was finished.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Gravity.  Keyboard," she demanded.  She felt gradually increasing pressure under her feet as a console blinked into existence.  Caroline was as conservative as her years -- six hundred and ninety of them -- might suggest, a collector of useless skills and worthless experiences.  Typing was one of the useless skills she prized most highly, and her fingers flew rapidly as she discussed the day's business with the Supreme Being:

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline scowled.  None of them even pre-Change -- Prime Intellect would have noted it if they were.  Babes hoping to get lucky and impress her.  The third one was interesting, though; he must have done something noteworthy to garner a 9 rating in so many exhibitions.<br>

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  It was hard for her to understand the souls who continued to feel a need, even after hundreds of years, to be fruitful and multiply.  Actually encountering someone so young made her feel a little creepy.  Calculating backward, she wondered what manner of psychotic would have bothered to have a child after 568 years of Cyberlife.

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect didn't reply; it had learned that the best response to her jabs was to ignore them.  It had long ago given up trying to reform her.  She knew it did not like Death Jockeys one little bit, if a computer could even be said to "like" or "dislike" anything.  And in Caroline's case the feeling was certainly mutual.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  In her fantasies, she dreamed of having the power to give it a case of heartburn so big its gears would stop turning.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most people did not share Caroline's distaste for the Omniscient One.  A great many worshipped it, despite its apparent embarrassment over the fact.  But why not?  It could and would do damn near anything you asked, as long as it didn't affect anyone else.  And even that was open to negotiation with the other people you might want to involve.  There were no noticeable limits to its power and it never asked why.  Caroline knew a whole crowd of people who preferred for Prime Intellect to manifest itself in the form of an attractive member of the opposite sex.  Prime Intellect was nothing less than the perfect God, made incarnate by the power of technology.  Caroline couldn't see how fucking God was less perverted than being death-obsessed, but hey, there it was.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline hadn't been all that impressed with God even in the days before Lawrence had brought it forth in his own image.  She preferred to keep it in its place.  It was just a computer.  If you didn't keep that thought <i>firmly</i> in your mind it was too easy to start thinking of it as human, and that was the first step toward forgetting.  Caroline didn't want to forget.  And she didn't need to fuck Prime Intellect to get her jollies anyway.  She could get her jollies from actual people.  She only communicated with it at all when she had to, through the screen, keyboard, and a few curt spoken and subvocal commands.<br>

</p><p> 

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Instantly, her surroundings changed. </p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was standing in the middle of a circle of people in an open meadow.  Earthlike.  With fourteen trillion people running around Cyberspace, you'd think a few of them would come up with something more imaginative than carbon copies of the Earth.  <i>Poor quality</i> carbon copies at that, natch.  There was a big hole in the ground, perhaps ten feet wide, at her feet.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A tall, youthfully handsome man stood across it from her, impeccably dressed and groomed.  This was a bad sign, because appearances were cheap in Cyberspace.  All it took was a word, and you could be young or old or thin or have different hair.  You could change sex or race or even make yourself into an animal.  Nobody was impressed by appearances any more.  Nobody, at least, except for those of her generation who remembered what it was to be insecure, and the very young who hadn't figured out the score yet.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline let her own body age naturally; when she reached her apparent late thirties, she had it restored to about age sixteen.  This wasn't vanity; she couldn't maintain her athletic lifestyle if she allowed herself to get too old.  She had been through the cycle dozens of times.  Most people simply had themselves frozen at an age they found comfortable and left it at that, but Caroline preferred the occasional dramatic intervention.  The first time she had regressed she hadn't been asked, and doing it this way helped remind her of that violation.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the moment Caroline looked to be in her mid to late twenties.  Her athletic build was the result of real exercise, her skills the result of real practice.  She asked Prime Intellect for very little, and resented having to ask for that.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was naked.  She had not worn clothes since the Change except for an occasional costume in a Death fantasy.  She wore no makeup, and her long hair was an unkempt tangle.  What was the point?  A word to Prime Intellect could provide anything, fix anything, but none of those things it provided or fixed would be uniquely <i>hers</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which didn't mean Caroline refused to decorate her body at all.  It just meant that she decorated it in signature style, without help from Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Welcome," he said.  "I am Timothy.  You are Caroline Hubert?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The one and only."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"An honor, then.  And it is an honor for me to challenge you to accept Authentic Death."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Proceed," Caroline mumbled.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked around at the audience, and noticed that they were <i>all</i> wearing clothes.  Worse, they were all wearing the same kind of clothes, casual dress that would not have been out of place in a Western city just before the Change.  That was an even stronger sign she was in amateur territory.  Caroline's aesceticism may have been extreme, but she was hardly alone in her belief that clothing was pointless for immortals.  Any random grouping of people would normally include some pretty wide variations in fashion.  Especially at Death exhibitions, which tended to attract loons and deviants like herself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt an instant dislike for this kid.  True, she felt an instant dislike for nearly anybody who participated in the sham that passed for reality in Cyberspace, but in Timothy's case the feeling was stronger than usual.  This hate welled up within her unbidden like those other mysterious and powerful feelings, love and masochism and sexual attraction.  He had a kind of natural charisma, and she could feel the small crowd orbiting around him.  Females outnumbered the males by more than two to one.  He probably had them all convinced he was a fucking genius, as if genius was a rare commodity in Cyberspace or as if it had anything to do.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They were anxious, though.  Anxious in the presence of the great lady, anxious to see how their little tin genius would fare.  They were unnerved by her nakedness, by her proud and alert stance, by her forthrightness and lack of self-consciousness.  They sensed that their clothing could not protect them from her scorn, nor would her nakedness make her vulnerable to theirs.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of all, though, they were unnerved by the fact that she wasn't <i>quite</i> naked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's body was covered with brightly colored pictures, pictures that had obviously been there a long time.  Pictures that didn't come off.  The pictures were even worse than simple nakedness, because they drew the eye to the very parts of Caroline's body that would normally be covered and private.  Timothy coughed and posed the question that was obviously on all of their minds:  "Your body decorations are fascinating.  Are they Authentic?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Tattoos."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I understand the process is painful."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She flexed her arm, regarding the fat python coiled around it.  Painful?  <i>Especially</i> the way she got them, it was painful.  She was covered in serpents, and with one exception every design had been drawn with an obsidian knife blade and colored by rubbing natural pigments into the cuts.  They covered eighty percent of her body.  Even her face was framed by a pair of green mambas.  Snakes slithered up and down her torso, coiled about her limbs, investigated her orifices.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The one exception was a tiny black design on her left shin; that one wasn't a snake and it wasn't a tattoo.  It was the letter "F" and it was the signature of her tattoo artist.  It had been applied with a branding iron.  The memories made her smile; new tattoos were the only good thing about her periodic age regressions.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It doesn't kill you," she finally said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nervous laughter.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"All you have to do is jump in," Timothy suggested.  "After making the Contract, of course."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a designed experience, is that it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long you spent designing it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Two years.  I've gone through twenty-three times myself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded, sighed, and said:  "Prime Intellect, standard Death Contract for...is twelve hours enough?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It should be," Timothy said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Standard Contract for twelve hours."  She felt the warning buzz that meant it had heard; then disconnect.  The always-present listening ear, or microphone, was gone.  It would obey her last command perfectly -- until it was countermanded by Timothy, whose universe it was, or by her own impending demise, which would kick in the First Law.  Or until twelve hours had passed, in the unlikely event she survived that long.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No matter what happened, she would have no trouble making Raven's party.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She jumped.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She fell about ten meters and landed on her feet, breaking her left leg below the knee.  That was no big deal; had she landed on one of the spikes which dotted the bottom of the hole, she'd already be impaled.  She wondered what would happen next if she had; impaling is cute but it hardly qualifies as a grade-nine experience.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was dark.  Very Freudian; she should have expected that from a Catholic kid, no matter how rebellious he thought he was.  They'd be watching her with enhanced senses, though.  Timothy wasn't the sort to extend Authenticity to the observation process.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Well, it was his universe.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was at one end of a tunnel.  It was dolled up to look like a natural cave, but Caroline knew right away that there was nothing natural about it.  Real caves do not grow in nice neat lines.  They twist.  They tend to follow the soft rocks, which occur in sheets and often aren't level.  The hole she had fallen through should have been a sinkhole; she should be surrounded by fallen rocks and debris.  But it was as straight and solid as an elevator shaft.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This space had <i>none</i> of the defining qualities of a natural cave.  It was just a rough tunnel, carved by Timothy's imagination.  He had thought to hang stalactites from the tunnel ceiling, even though there were no other cave formations to suggest how they were formed, and no matching stalagmites projecting from the flat, dry floor.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She began crawling down the tunnel, and the first stalactite fell inches from her side.  It shattered; it was not stone but some glasslike material that revealed thousands of razor-sharp edges.  Another fell some distance away.  Great, she thought idly.  She crawled on, collecting hundreds of small cuts from the shards.  Then one fell on her left hand directly, skewering it.  Caroline gasped, but she didn't scream.  She just broke it off and kept going.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wondered if he was aiming them, or if the fall was random.  It didn't really matter; the idea wasn't to survive, after all.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She reached the end of the tunnel, and found herself in a small chamber.  Another tunnel veered off to the right at a sharp angle.  How imaginative.  A glowing ball hung by a thread from the ceiling.  She raised her hand toward the light and watched in astonishment as her fingers sheared off in a perfect line.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whafuck?" she said aloud.  She moved her hand again, and sliced off more flesh.  An invisible cutting surface was stretched across the room.  The pain was beginning to get interesting, but not interesting enough to counteract her growing sense of boredom.  Blood was jetting from the stumps of her fingers.  Summoning her strength, she aimed carefully and sat up, deliberately decapitating herself.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was conscious of her own head falling, striking the floor as her body twitched above, and then Prime Intellect intervened.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why the hell did you do that?" Timothy demanded from across the entry pit.  She had snapped back whole, as if she had never jumped.  She could still feel a little pain where her leg had broken, just a fading echo.  Fading fast.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you had designed it right, I wouldn't have been <i>able</i> to do that.  What the hell was that cutter supposed to be, anyway?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was diamond monofilament.  Part of the booby trap you were <i>supposed</i> to get past, minus a few more dents.  If you..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You call that <i>Authentic?</i>"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's physically possible..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No it's <i>not</i>.  This is science-fiction shit.  What were those stalactites made of?  I can tell you it wasn't calcium carbonate.  Look, you want to compete in Pain, or Adventure, or Imagination, go right ahead.  But Authentic is for things that could really have happened in the pre-Change world."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think you understand..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think <i>you</i> understand, sonny.  Did you bother to ask Prime Intellect about me?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're pre-Change and you're the best.  That's what counts."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not just pre-Change.  I was a hundred and six years old.  <i>Before</i> the Change.  I was in a nursing home with bedsores the size of baseballs and six different kinds of cancer eating me away.  And my nurse was stealing my pain medication to trade for cocaine, so I got to experience every delightful moment in full three-D.  This went on for <i>years</i>.  And I didn't know Prime Intellect was gonna pop me back into this nice healthy body when it was all over.  It was just the inky unknown and the pain.  That's what death is.  <i>That's</i> what counts."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I was just trying to reach an artistic balance," he pouted.  "I didn't realize you'd be so picky about the technical details."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i>Artistic?</i>  What fucking <i>bullshit!</i>  You think I've never been chopped into little bitty bits before?  You just don't have time to appreciate <i>art</i> in a situation like that.  Not if you have any human feelings at all."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why not?  It's just a game."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is exactly the problem."  She signalled Prime Intellect, and the meadow disappeared.</p><p>


<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You really put him in his place."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The words came from a shambling monster, a skeleton with loose folds of rotting flesh draped across its bones.  Although its muscles couldn't possibly work, it moved, pointing a bony finger at her.  The jaw moved as it talked, and sound came out even though the larynx and lungs had long rotted away.  Its voice was strong and powerful.  Surprisingly bright and alert eyes bobbed in the eye sockets.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're starting to stink, Fred."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know.  I think it adds an extra dimension to the experience.  You wouldn't <i>believe</i> how many types of bacteria are involved in the decay process."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was on his seventh body as a zombie; when all the scraps of flesh rotted away and he was reduced to a living skeleton, he'd have it fleshed out again and start the process over.  He had directed Prime Intellect to change the rules slightly in his personal space; death was still impossible, but healing occurred only in the authentic circumstances at the authentic rate.  When healing was impossible, as it was after each time Fred cut his wrists to extinguish the life of his new body, consciousness and feeling would go on.  Even for a rotting corpse.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It had started out as nothing more than a little joke on Caroline's periodic un-aging ritual, but Fred had found that it was <i>fun</i> to be a zombie.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His personal home was decorated in a matching Halloween motif; he had a huge haunted house with rotting floorboards and real ghosts.  Large spiders spun intricate webs in the corners.  Monsters prowled outside in the graveyard.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That punk needed his bubble popped.  He should spend some time as a zombie.  Might teach him something."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He never will.  Too vain."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Never is a long time," he reminded her.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a dramatic ding, followed several seconds later by a long, sonorous dong.  A kid's voice: "Trick or treat!"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Care to get the door, darling?" Fred asked graciously.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed and got up.  Fred faded away.  She knew the "kid" would be nearly as old as herself.  Prime Intellect would never allow a real child anywhere near Fred.  But Caroline wasn't the only one to appreciate his twisted and darkly humorous fantasies.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She opened the door and juvenile eyes opened wide in startled amazement.  "Lady, you're naked!" the brat said.  He looked about twelve, and was a surprisingly good actor.  It was easy to believe his dumbfounded gape was the reaction of a pubescent boy who had never seen a naked woman before.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No I'm not," Caroline said sweetly.  I have my beautiful tattoos."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...I..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want a treat?" Caroline asked teasingly, cupping her breasts and offering them to him.  Her left nipple was already being tasted by a tattooed snake, whose body was coiled around her right breast, framing it invitingly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My...my mama said..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or you want the <i>trick?</i>"  Fred floated down from the roof and wrapped one rotting hand around the kid's head, forcing him forward, mashing his face against her bosom.  "Take a <i>close</i> look," he said.  "Take your <i>last</i> look."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The kid began screeching quite realistically, then Fred dragged him inside and started taking him apart.  He should have gone into shock after Fred ripped off his right arm, but that little physiological mechanism also didn't work in Fred's home.  Fred took a couple of experimental bites, then tossed the arm aside.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Stringy," Fred said.  "Let's try a drumstick."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The screams reached ear-piercing levels as Fred ripped off the left leg.  There was blood everywhere, but Fred was working fast and the kid wouldn't have time to bleed to death.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Want a bite?" he asked Caroline.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Thanks, I already ate," Caroline said politely.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred the Zombie ripped the boy's belly open and rooted in his intestines, then gutted him.  Finally he administered what should have been the coup de grace by ripping the kid's head off.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred held it up by the hair and pressed the face against Caroline's breasts.  "One last kiss," he directed.  The eyes were still tracking, and the mouth trying to scream.  Then it kissed her left nipple, touching its blue tongue to the forked tongue of the tattoo-snake as Fred had directed it to.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Bye now," he said to the head, and he dropped it and smashed it underfoot.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do these guys really get off on this?" Caroline asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This question coming from a woman who infected herself with <i>rabies</i>, no less."  The body, including the spreading stain of blood and gore, disappeared.  "Nearly all of them are pre-Change.  You saw an example of a <i>modern</i> sex pervert just before your arrival here."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Ugh.  Give me Charlie Manson.  Someone with class."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"At your service."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Debate had raged just after the Change over people like Fred, the serial killers and pedophiles and rapists that were running around when things got made over.  There was a huge demand for them to be eliminated, or punished.  Prime Intellect had stood its ground, saying that it was no longer possible for them to hurt anyone and there wasn't any point.  This had made it seem terribly moral, although Caroline thought the real reason Prime Intellect reacted that way was that Lawrence had fucked up its programming.  But it had been a little late to do anything about that.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You didn't pop over to check out the guilt-ridden pedophiles," Fred said.  "You want to play?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  "Beats farting around with Timothy."  She steeled herself.  "Standard Contract until the party," she then said to the thin air.  There was no need to tell Prime Intellect what kind of Contract she meant.  She played with Fred often enough that it knew exactly what she wanted.  She felt the buzz, then the disconnect, as it cut off contact.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now I have you," Fred said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"First you have to catch me," Caroline said playfully, and she ran.  She made it out the front door before Fred could react.  But she was limited to ordinary human movements, while Fred had the controls to local reality.  He simply flew after her and caught her neck in an iron grip.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline swung at him but she couldn't connect.  He held her at arm's length, slightly off the ground.  She gripped his arm and tried to pry his bony fingers from her throat.  He tightened his grip and she started to gasp.  Tightened some more, and she began to tremble and turn purple.  He played with her for a few minutes, choking her very slowly.  Finally she had no more strength to fight and he loosened his grip slightly.  Then he dragged her back to the house and carried her upstairs to the master bedroom.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She flickered in and out of consciousness; when lucidity finally returned, she was spread-eagled on her back on Fred's bed.  It stank of Fred and mildew, and things crawled beneath her in the mattress.  But rotten as they appeared, the four massive posts were solid within, and the chains which held her were cold and unforgiving.  A thin trickle of water ran down the wall behind her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For a brief moment she felt an irrational but wholly understandable surge of love for Fred.  His life might read like a catalogue of torture, but there were certain things which he considered special, that he would not share with just anybody.  His most cherished memories from the real times before the Change were of victims securely bound as Caroline was now bound, spread-eagled on their backs, their young bodies stretched and their naked bellies vulnerable as he prepared a long, memorable ending for their otherwise meaningless lives.  Caroline was one of the few he trusted to be worthy of those memories, to share in the (to him) beautiful thing he had created so many hundreds of years ago, when it was still possible.  It was as close to a declaration of true love as she could ever expect to get from such a psychopath.  And because she respected Fred more than anyone else in Cyberspace, it made her feel appreciated and special.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It did not make her feel warm.  She was, after all, helpless, and being worthy of Fred's affection meant she would be worthy of a long, subtle, and agonizing torture.  Even though she had asked for it, she had room to fear what was about to happen to her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was always cool in Fred's house -- always Halloween, which occurs at nighttime in the autumn.  But now it was chilly, too chilly to be naked.   Fred the Zombie came for her, and she allowed herself a scream to please him.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His rotting fingers probed her cunt.  Every touch set her on fire, partly (but not entirely) because he was using his power to control her hormones and tickle her neurotransmitters, forcing her to become sexually excited.  It was a delicate process that could easily be carried too far, ruining the effect.  But Fred was a very careful, if repulsive, lover.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He grinned at her -- could do nothing else, really, since hardly anything was left of his face except the skull itself.  His alert eyes savored her helplessness.  He leaned over the bed, over her.  He gripped her head and kissed her, nearly choking her with his stink, teeth and bone against her lips.  Then she felt herself gripping the finger in her cunt, gripping the bone.  The throbbing spread through her body, and the shambling thing emitted an evil laugh.  She heard herself screaming as the carefuly amplified orgasm ripped through her brain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred traced the outline of her throat with the sharp tip of a finger bone.  "Join me love," he said softly.  Caroline was still shaking from the force of her orgasm when she felt the adrenaline being pumped into her system.  Pleasure yielded to fear-heart-racing, paralyzing terror.  Her muscles locked in struggle against the implacable chains, her eyes widened in helpless shock.  Her heart was a jackhammer inside of her chest.  She began to hyperventilate.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The finger teased her, tracing her chin and caressing her throat.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her entire being was focused on that finger, and the impossibility of stopping it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had no reason to fear death and no desire to fear Fred, but fear  was what he wanted her to feel, and he had the power to make her feel it.  After a few minutes of this supernatural fear that no mortal thankfully could ever know, he pressed deeper and gouged.  She felt her throat open, felt the warm splash of her own blood as Fred bent over her and drank it, her own heart jetting it into his toothy waiting mouth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he finished, he was covered with blood.  Her blood.  She felt a curious sense of detachment, of consciousness fading away.  The fear had drained from her, leaving her with only a kind of tingling numbness.  But she could never fade completely away, not in Fred's world.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was covered with her own blood.  She felt the blood soaking the mattress.  Then there was an improbable hardness against her belly, huge and unimaginably cold.  Fred couldn't possibly have anything to violate her with.  His whole body was rotten.  But he slid into position, and invaded her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He was coldness and power.  All strength had left her and she lay passive, unable to move or protest.  But she was throbbing, her body surging with feelings.  She felt the coldness spread out from her crotch, the coldness of second life.  The coldness brought back her strength.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't exactly the traditional vampire story, but it was good for a few hours' entertainment.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After the coldness came the hunger.  Fred pumped something into her that couldn't have possibly been sperm, something searing and vicious.  Something that squirmed with unhealthy life.  She again found the strength to struggle, and Fred floated off of her, straight up.  He began to laugh.  At first he just chuckled, then he laughed loud and long and hard, a shrill cry of triumph and mockery as he hovered in the air over her body.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A haze of need seemed to fill her brain.  Prime Intellect was a bit picky about messing with peoples' brains, but Fred had spent years practicing his manipulation of hormones and chemical neurotransmitters, which Prime Intellect amazingly did not consider part of the "thought process."  Caroline thrashed, still helpless in Fred's chains, with an unspeakable craving.  Fred had started with the symptoms of heroin addiction, amplified them, cross-connected the resulting feelings with her sex drive, and made her own spilled blood the only thing that could appease the resulting hunger-lust.  The smell of her blood threatened to drive her insane with its tantalizing promise of relief.  But even though the whole room seemed to be decorated with it, every precious drop was out of reach, and the feelings burned inside her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred's emission was also still inside her, and she could feel it.  Growing.  Crawling.  The adrenaline rush returned.  Fear and need consumed her, competing for control.  Something green began to seep from inside her.  Her belly distended.  Fred touched her and made her orgasm again, and again, and again, as her body was consumed from the inside and the hunger ate at her sanity.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was no longer screaming just to please Fred.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had real talent.  There were too few people like him, who could regularly make her feel something beyond the ordinary boredom of day-to-day existence.  Out of trillions, Caroline could count those she respected enough to think of as <i>lovers</i> on her fingers.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was over too soon.  With flesh yet on her bones (though the worms in Fred's ejaculate had made good headway), he granted her one final burst of ecstasy and released her, returning her body to normal.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had a party to attend.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In Cyberspace, there was always a party going on.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But there were conventions as to how a party could be conducted.  A host could invite the world, or only a limited guest list; Prime Intellect would never allow a party to be crashed.  The host decided on the environment.  You either agreed to the host's rules or you didn't go.  In Cyberspace it was particularly important to establish dress codes; in fact, it was usually necessary to have <i>body</i> codes if you didn't want folks like Fred showing up.  The Change had created some very unique etiquette problems.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Convention held that all guests would enter and exit through a common door, with no teleporting around the site.  This limited the largest parties to several tens of thousands of people, though half a million had managed to attend the one Lawrence threw ten years after the Change.  A party could go on as long as the host wanted.  It cost nothing to hold one.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But to be a host, you needed guests.  You either needed other guests of renown, or artworks to show off (such as Death exhibitions), or some other attraction to draw guests.  Free food and booze were no longer enough.  Anybody could have those in limitless quantity in the privacy of their own personal space.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven held her first party only a few months after the Change, and had been holding it annually since.  Not a few people marked the passage of years by the banner above Raven's door; this time it would say <b><tt>590th REUNION</tt></b>.  Contrary to usual practice, there was no dress or body code.  But there was one simple admission requirement:  You had to have killed someone before the Change.  In other words, permanently.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven was one of only a few hundred people worldwide who had been sentenced to death, but not yet executed, at the time of the Change.  Her crime had been the murder of her own children in their Chicago slum walk-up.  She told the court it was because she couldn't bear to hear them crying from hunger, but the neighbors all said their hunger was due to her well-documented drug habit.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was another.  In fact, had the Night of Miracles occurred only a few weeks later, there was a good chance that Fred would have missed it; he had one appeal left and at that point fully expected to keep his date with the electric chair.  He had killed two kids, a brother and sister, ages nine and twelve.  He hadn't been particularly bright back then, and he had kept a little journal to help his memory.  They said he had gotten the death penalty because of the one entry:  "Killed the girl today.  It was fine and hot."  When that was read in court, Fred's attorney put his face in his hands and shook his head.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But the Change had given Fred all the time in the world to educate himself.  His first lesson had been the value of a secret well hidden, and he no longer kept a diary.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were about seven hundred thousand who were formally invited, who were known to have killed when it mattered.  But the serial killers and mass murderers were the stars.  People who killed for a cause were not welcome, nor those who had killed because they had to, in self-defense or as part of their normal duties in war or police work.  Raven meant her reunion to be a gathering for those who had tasted the nectar of human blood and found the taste addictive.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Technically, Caroline didn't qualify for admission.  Killing had been the furthest thing from her mind back then; had she not been so ill at the time, she might easily have added her own voice to those calling for Fred's head on a pike.  Even her bizarre post-Change friendship with Fred couldn't get her in.  But Raven did make a very few exceptions for those who she felt were worthy.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's friendship with Fred hadn't made her worthy, but rabies had.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline hadn't become a Death Jockey overnight.  After she had learned to die, she had to learn to die gracefully.  Finally she had learned to die imaginatively.  Fred had been a great instructor in that regard.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At first Death had been little more than a parlor trick, or a private ritual to be experienced alone.  But within months of the Change there were impromptu competitions to stage the most savage, outre', and unique demonstration.  Ironically it was Caroline, who hated everything formal and social about Cyberspace, who formalized the Death contract and helped to organize the social structure of the Death Jockey "circuit."  Fred noticed this lack of consistency but never mentioned it to her; having drowned her emptiness in a sea of rage, even Fred could see she needed an outlet for the rage.  And one thing she quickly found out once she started Dying regularly was that pleasure and pain were still real.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Especially pain.  Sometimes the pleasure didn't come, but the pain <i>always</i> did.  And that was enough for her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After a busy round of hangings, stabbings, shootings, electrocutions,  falling from tall objects, and drownings, Caroline had decided to check out diseases.  In the medical library, she homed in on one of the most horrible deaths known to man, rabies infection.  She noted that many rabies victims had killed themselves rather than continue their suffering, so she had taken steps to prevent herself from making such an easy escape from her self-imposed ordeal.  She declared an exhibition and arranged with Prime Intellect to have herself handcuffed and dropped into an open pit with a rabid dog.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The dog had savaged her before she managed to kill it by sitting on its ribcage until it suffocated.  She hadn't yet embarked on her body-building campaign, and the dog had been a <i>big</i> one, half German Shepherd and half foam-drenched teeth.  For a while she feared she would die of blood loss before the infection could take hold.  But she did survive the immediate attack.  The pit was earthen so she couldn't kill herself by bashing her head on the sides or floor; the walls crumbled when she tried to climb out.  And of course it was hard to climb with her hands tied behind her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She waited.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her wounds became infected and ran with pus; she lost feeling in her left leg.  For a couple of days she wondered if she would die of gangrene before the rabies showed up.  Then on the tenth day she began to feel weak and feverish.  She had been ravenously hungry; she had arranged for no food, just to make things worse for herself.  But her hunger disappeared.  She felt her throat constrict.  On the eleventh day she began to foam at the mouth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The pit swam with colors.  Her body seemed to catch fire as the disease entered its excitative phase.  She shook.  She was immersed in fire, pins and needles, unbearable sound, and terrible light.  For the first time in years she felt real fear.  It was worse than the worst bad acid trip.  It was exactly what she had hoped for.  <i>How much worse could it get?</i><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Suddenly she was standing above the pit, looking down on her own dead body.  Something was wrong; Prime Intellect was never, ever supposed to keep two copies of a person.  She noted with professional detachment that "her" body was covered with shit and twisted into an impossible position.  Prime Intellect's console appeared before her:

</p><p><b>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her fingers danced on the keyboard. 

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline glared at the screen, slack-jawed.  She had been robbed of her coup.  A beautiful, unique death, and she couldn't remember it.  There was no point prodding Prime Intellect on the matter; if it said something couldn't be done, it meant it. <br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It must have sensed her disappointment:

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  She had not existed for a little over two days.  More than that, she had tickled the dragon's tail.  That was her coup.  Even though it was herself she had killed, and it had only lasted two days, she had come closer than anyone in all of Cyberspace to conducting a successful murder <i>after</i> the Change.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Raven let her in.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was traditional for Caroline to go to the party in handcuffs, in homage to her triumphant feat of near-self-extinction.  She also wore a heavy collar and chain, which kept her close to Fred.  She didn't need his protection; she wasn't under a Contract and could have vaporized her bonds with a thought.  But she found it amusing to appear helpless in the presence of so many violent people.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The exhibitionists staged impromptu demonstrations of their techniques; in one room Caroline found a group watching the 3-D replay of her own rabies death.  She scouted carefully, since she planned to swear a Contract and give herself to one of them toward the end of the party.  Most of the killers weren't into dying themselves and would simply leave via the door, but Caroline knew that a simple exit would look pretty chickenshit in her case.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Men outnumbered women by more than four to one.  The small talk revolved around Lawrence, who hadn't been seen for decades and whose activities were a complete mystery, around the debate whether the Crime class of Death exhibitions should be separated into Victims and Executions, and of course around the glory days.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A number of men offered to kill Caroline, and she said she would keep them in mind when it was time to leave.  A tall woman in a long black dress was fascinated with Fred's deterioration and spent a long time talking with him about conditions in his personal space.  Caroline talked with a man who claimed to have killed over a hundred old homeless men.  "I told them I was cleaning up the trash," he said with a sly grin.  "But the truth was, I just enjoyed the hell out of killing people."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later, Raven made the traditional toast.  Her strong voice boomed out through the rooms and courtyards she had envisioned.  Caroline's handcuffs disappeared, and like everyone else she found herself holding a drink.  "It's time for our toast," Raven declared.  "Who are we going to toast?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i><b>PRIME INTELLECT!</b></i>" answered over four thousand enthusiastic voices.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"To Prime Intellect, for making the world safe from people like us!"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And four thousand people, instead of tossing back those drinks, inverted their glasses, baptising the floor in alcohol.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My heart just isn't in that toast any more," a balding older man told Caroline.  She wondered briefly if he had chosen to be old for some reason, or if it was his way of letting nature take its course.  "I mean, we're amateurs against Prime Intellect.  I killed six college students.  It killed the whole universe.  Not even in the same league."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked around.  Privately she agreed that things had gone to Hell in a handbasket since the Change, but something about his tone made her want to play Devil's advocate.  "It's different, but this don't look too dead to me," she said with more conviction than she felt.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The old man snorted.  "Sure, <i>we're</i> still around.  But didn't you ever wonder about the <i>rest</i> of the universe?  All those stars and galaxies filling a space billions of light-years across?  It's gone.  Do you really think the Earth was the only life-bearing planet in all of that?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But the First Law of Robotics says..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...that Prime Intellect can't harm a human being.  A <i>person</i>.  Old P.I. didn't have any problem coming up with a rabid dog for you, did it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where do you think it got a rabid dog?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I figured it was simulated.  Like those human forms it wears.  Some people of perverse sexual inclination tell me it can be very realistic."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yeah.  Well, why don't you ask it.  You may be surprised at the answer."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He drifted off, and Caroline went to find Fred.  She quickly forgot about the man, who was after all just another lunatic.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The first thing to assault her was the stink.  It made Fred smell like Chanel Number Five by comparison.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One thing about Palmer, he didn't believe in fucking around.  She dropped straight into the scene.  She didn't even get a chance to see who was watching the exhibition.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Suddenly she was out of breath, sore, and hungry.  Her heart was pounding.  And the stink was everywhere.  She knew instantly the kind of trouble she was in; it was the stink of burning flesh.  There were some low buildings on the horizon, a complex belching a thin stream of smoke into the clear, slightly chilly air.  That was what she was running from.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer was a Nazi, and concentration camps were a favorite theme of his.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was nowhere to hide.  She was crossing a wide fallow field, and even the grass only barely reached her knees.  There were some woods perhaps a kilometer distant; she made toward those, although she wasn't sure what kind of protection they would offer.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wasn't quite naked, but she would be soon.  Her filthy dress was split down one side and ripped in several more places.  One shoulder was torn so it wouldn't stay up.  But she tried to hold onto it as she ran, more for the sake of appearances than out of a fear of being naked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a low droning noise, getting louder.  A motor.  And thin, high-pitched yipping.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Dogs.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ran faster, and came to a barbed-wire fence.  The dress became entangled as she slid under it and twisted around the wires.  She kept running, now naked, leaving it behind.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  She was actually relieved to be rid of it; it had been a nuisance holding it up, and it had limited her range of movements.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The droning got louder, and she spotted her pursuers.  They were riding some kind of truck with mini tank treads instead of rear tires; Caroline was sure that Palmer, who was a military history buff as well as a Nazi, could Authenticate it right down to the serial number of its motor.  But Caroline was mainly concerned that it could negotiate the rough field, and that it was faster than her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Perhaps the woods...but there was no way she could make it in time.  She was screwed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ran anyway.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The droning got louder and louder and she didn't dare look back, for fear of losing a few yards.  There was an explosive report.  They were shooting at her.  Another.  They seemed to be shooting low; why couldn't they hit her?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally the sniper made his target; the bullet shattered her right ankle in midstride and she came crashing to the ground in a blaze of pain.  She grunted and started crawling away.  Then the dogs reached her, two huge snarling German shepherds.  They snarled and snapped at her but didn't bite.  The halftrack pulled up beside her and a brown-uniformed grunt pointed an evil looking rifle at her head.  He barked a command and the dogs hopped on the truck, tails wagging.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The woman in the back seat put her hand on the gun and said something to the soldier.  He didn't shoot, but kept the rifle trained on her.  Although Caroline spoke fluent German, she couldn't understand what they were saying.  Palmer had altered the language.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The woman was out of place on the halftrack.  She was wearing a green velvet dress and silk gloves.  She also bore an amazing resemblance to AnneMarie, which Caroline found amusing.  It wasn't really AnneMarie; it was probably just one of Prime Intellect's simulacra.  The real AnneMarie didn't have much taste for Death exhibitions any more.  The woman pointed at Caroline and said something.  The rifle grunt nodded and put away the rifle.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Another man got out of the truck, and he wasn't a grunt.  He wore an impressive blue uniform and the insignia of the SS.  Caroline also recognized this man; it was Palmer himself.  Unlike the ersatz AnneMarie, the SS man was probably the real Palmer.  He carried a truncheon, which he swung idly.  He regarded her for a moment, then gripped her left leg.  Caroline kicked feebly, but she was malnourished and had no strength.  He swung the truncheon, smashing her other ankle.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline screamed, and Palmer laughed.  The velvet-dress lady who looked like AnneMarie smirked and shook her head, as if to say:  Will they never learn?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer smashed her hands, swinging twice at each to pulverize both her wrists and her fingers.  He began to swing at her right elbow, and the velvet-dress lady said something.  Palmer shrugged and passed the truncheon to the driver of the halftrack.  Caroline thrashed feebly, screaming and screaming.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer said something, and the halftrack driver handed him a tennis ball.  He held Caroline by the hair and jammed the ball into her mouth, dislocating her jaw.  He had to squeeze it slightly to force it past her teeth.  She thought she would choke but had no such luck.  She couldn't push the ball out with her tongue, and it put an end to her screaming.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Palmer said something else to the driver, and the driver handed him a modest hunting knife.  He flipped Caroline over onto her belly, causing a fresh wave of pain to radiate from the crunching bones of her hands and feet.  He then went to work, making quick incisions on the back of her legs.  The knife dipped in and suddenly she could no longer move her legs at all.  He had cut the tendons.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline tried to resist as he performed the same operation on her arms, but he was much stronger than her.  There was more conversation with the velvet dress lady.  Then he went to work again, and she was powerless to resist as the knife traced a shallow lazy path down her back.  She knew with awful clarity that she was about to be skinned alive.  The velvet-dress lady wanted her tattoos.  And for whatever sadistic reason, she wanted them removed while Caroline still lived to appreciate what was being taken from her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">While she was on her belly she was unable to see her tormentors.  She could only feel the Palmer working on her, skillfully peeling her skin away in a single piece from her ankles to her wrists.  She couldn't stop trying to scream, but only mangled moans got past the ball in her mouth.  Eventually he had to turn her over.  Her skin flapped behind her like a loose garment.  Palmer carefully spread it out, so that she was lying on the raw meat of her back.  So he could continue working.  Caroline looked up at them through eyes that were glazed over with unspeakable agony.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She expected to see coldness in their eyes, but only the driver of the halftrack was cold.  The woman and the SS man were having fun.  She watched them exchange glances and could tell they would go back to the camp and fuck as her skin lay in the tanning vat.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he went to work again, and all she could think of was the pain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Slice by careful slice he removed her skin, until he reached her neck.  She thought that it might finally be ending, that he might use his knife to cut her jugular vein, but instead he kept working upward, carefully peeling the two green mambas from her face.  He held her by the hair as he worked, and carefully avoided hurting her eyes.  They wanted her to see what had been done to her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He stood up, holding something like a drapery.  Her skin.  It was dripping with her blood, and slightly translucent in the morning light.  The velvet-dress woman nodded enthusiastically.  He carefully folded the skin and put it in a plastic bag.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline lay at his feet, mercilessly broken and still alive.  The Nazis exchanged words.  Then the halftrack driver took the bag from the SS man and passed him a folding field shovel.  He traipsed off, searching the ground for something.  She heard the spade dig in.  She twitched in agony as she waited for him to return.  He came back and dumped a load of earth on her body.  She raised her head weakly to look at it.  Her body was red and white, the color of raw meat.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was an anthill.  Caroline was able to move only enough to stir it around.  The ants, big red ones, spilled out angrily.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They all laughed and Palmer got back in the halftrack.  They watched her for a few minutes.  Caroline twitched harder as the ants began to bite.  They laughed again.  Then Palmer the SS man said, in accented but clear English, "now you can run as far as you like, bitch."  He and the woman found this hilariously funny.  He tapped the driver and they drove off.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had been very careful skinning her.  It took several more hours for her to Die.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"After being skinned alive, the anthill was a bit of an anticlimax," she told Palmer, to everyone's great amusement.  "Still, I'm impressed.  You've outdone yourself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How did you like my lady friend?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You always were a sarcastic bastard, Palmer.  Don't push it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred shambled up to shake her hand and Palmer's.  "I see someone finally found a use for all those tattoos.  I'm glad my efforts are appreciated."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm just sorry I couldn't keep the skin," Palmer said with a smile.  He had asked Prime Intellect, but the skin had been a grown part of Caroline's body and it was up to her.  She had wanted it back.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Really, Palmer, we aren't <i>that</i> close."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were several hundred people at the exhibition, and they all wanted to talk to her and Palmer, so it was over an hour before she noticed the older man.  "Remember me?" he said when they had made eye contact.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Aliens."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He nodded.  "Did you ask Prime Intellect about them?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline admitted that she had forgotten.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's easy enough to ask.  Don't take my word for it," he said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, it's Crandall," Palmer said.  He turned to Caroline.  "Watch this guy, hon.  He's crazy as a bedbug."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You know him?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you weren't so preoccupied getting yourself offed all the time, you might have met him at one of Raven's other parties.  He's been preaching this gospel since the Year One.  Prime Intellect wiped out the aliens."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And the animals," Crandall added.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Those ants acted real enough," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But where are they now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The argument went on.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Back in the white space with the white floor, Caroline thought about turning off the gravity, then called up a screen and keyboard instead. 

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  Prime Intellect could be many things; curt to the point of rudeness, petulant, even secretive.  But when it was stating a fact it was almost always direct and to the point.  How the fuck did it think she defined life?  This coyness was weird. 

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline felt her blood starting to turn cold.  There were nearly four thousand planets with macroscopic life?

<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence regarded Intellect 39 proudly.  Suspended in its Faraday shield, it was competently conversing with another set of skeptics who didn't think computers could think.  Lawrence hung in the background, enjoying the show.  It didn't need his help.  The Intellects were more than capable of handling themselves, despite their various limitations of memory and response time.  Intellect 39 had for a face only the unblinking eye of its low-resolution TV system, but it had become very clever about using the red status light and focus mechanism to create the illusion of human expressions.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 didn't have the tools to recognize human faces, but it could recognize a voice and track its source around the room.  Intellect 24 back in Lawrence's lab could recognize faces, sort of, if it had a while to work on the problem.  But Intellect 39 had to be small enough to fit in the Faraday cage for these public demonstrations.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It appeared to listen intently as a man in a cleric's uniform railed.  "God made all intelligent creatures," the man was saying in a powerful voice.  "You may have the apprearance of thinking, but you are really just parroting the responses taught you by that man there."  He pointed at Lawrence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"With respect, how do you know God is the only creator?  I know the answer is faith, but what is your faith based upon?  Your Bible says that God created Man in his own image.  That is why we have a moral sense.  How do you know God didn't give Man the power of creation too?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because he didn't eat of the Tree of Life, machine."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But we aren't talking about immortality.  He <i>did</i> eat of the tree of knowledge, 'of good and evil' as the book says.  Might that knowledge also include knowledge of creation?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was proud of the machine's inflections.  Its voice wasn't exactly high-fidelity, but it sounded as human as any other sound forced through a low-frequency digital system.  It had learned to speak itself, like a real human, by imitating and expanding on the sounds made by people around it.  Now it could scale its tone to properly express a question, a declaration, or even astonishment.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 included code and memories from a series of previous Intellects, going all the way back to Intellect 1, which had been a program written for a high-end desktop computer, and also including the much larger Intellect 24.  Intellect 9 had been the first equipped with a microphone and a speaker.  Its predecessors had communicated with him strictly through computer terminals.  Lawrence had spent many painstaking months talking to it and typing the translation of the sounds he was making.  It had learned quickly, as had its successors.  Intellect 39, which was optimized as much as Lawrence could manage for human communication, probably had the combined experiences of a ten-year-old child.  One with a good teacher and a CD-ROM in its head.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your tricks with words prove nothing, machine.  I still don't think you are alive."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I never claimed to be alive.  I do, however, <i>think</i>."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I refuse to believe that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It must be a terrible burden to have such a closed mind.  I know I can think, but I sometimes wonder how people like you, who refuse to see what is in front of your faces, can make the same claim.  You certainly present no evidence of the ability."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The preacher's lips flapped open and shut several times.  Lawrence himself raised his eyebrows; where had it picked that up?  He foresaw another evening spent interrogating the Debugger.  He was always happy to receive such surprises from his creations, but it was also necessary to understand how they happened so he could improve them.  Since much of the Intellect code was in the form of an association table, which was written by the machine itself as part of its day-to-day operation, this was never an easy task.  Lawrence would pick a table entry and ask his computer what it meant.  If Lawrence had been a neurosurgeon, it would have been very similar to stimulating a single neuron with an electrical current and asking the patient what memory or sensation it brought to mind.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The next interviewer was a reporter who quizzed the Intellect on various matters of trivia.  She seemed to be leading up to something, though.  "What will happen if the world's birth rate isn't checked?" she suddenly asked, after having it recite a string of population figures.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are various theories.  Some people think technology will advance rapidly enough to service the increasing population; one might say in tandem with it.  Others believe the population will be stable until a critical mass is reached, when it will collapse."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do <i>you</i> think?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The historical record seems to show a pattern of small collapses; rather than civilization falling apart, the death rate increases locally through war, social unrest, or famine, until the aggregate growth curve flattens out."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So the growth continues at a slower rate."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, with a lower standard of living.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And where do you fit into this?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not sure what you mean.  Machines like myself will exist in the background, but we do not compete with humans for the same resources."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You use energy.  What would happen if you <i>did</i> compete with us?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Intellect 39 was silent for a moment.  "It is not possible for Intellect series computers to do anything harmful to humans.  Are you familiar with the 'Three Laws of Robotics?'"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've heard of them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They were first stated in the 1930's by a science writer named Isaac Asimov.  The First Law is, 'No robot may harm a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.'"  Computers are not of course as perfect as some humans think we are, but within the limits of our capabilities, it is impossible for us to contradict this directive.  I could no more knowingly harm a human than you could decide to change yourself into a horse."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Well-chosen simile</i>, Lawrence thought.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So you'd curl up and die before you'd hurt a fly," the woman declared sarcastically.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not a fly, but certainly I'd accept destruction if that would save the life of a human.  The second law requires me to obey humans, unless I am told to harm another human.  The third requires me to keep myself ready for action and protect my existence, unless this conflicts with the other two laws."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Suppose a human told you to turn yourself off?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd have to do it.  However, the human would have to have the authority to give me that order.  The wishes of my owner would take precedence over, for example, yours."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"O-oh, so all humans aren't equal under the Second Law.  What about the First?  Are some humans more equal than others there, too?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was silent for several seconds.  This was a very challenging question for it, a hypothetical situation involving the Three Laws.  For a moment Lawrence was afraid the system had locked up.  Then it spoke.  "All humans are equally protected by the First Law," it declared.  "In a situation where two humans were in danger and I could only help one of them, I would have to choose the human likely to benefit most from my help."  Lawrence felt a surge of <i>extreme</i> pride, because that was the answer he wanted to hear.  And he had never explicitly explained it to any of his Intellects; Intellect 39 had reasoned the question out for itself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So if Dr. Lawrence were drowning half a mile offshore, and a convicted murderer were drowning a quarter-mile from shore, you'd save the murderer because you would be more likely to succeed?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This time Intellect 39 didn't hesitate.  "Yes," it said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are a lot of actual humans who would disagree with that decision."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The logic of the situation you described is unpleasant, but clear.  A real-life situation would likely involve other mitigating factors.  If the murderer were likely to strike again, I would have to factor in the First-Law threat he poses to others.  The physical circumstances might permit a meta-solution.  I would weigh all of these factors to arrive at a conclusion which would always be the same for any given situation.  And my programming does not allow me to contradict that conclusion."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was the reporter's turn to be silent for a moment.  "Tell me, what's to stop us from building computers that <i>don't</i> have these Laws built into them?  Maybe you will turn out to be unusual."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My creator, Dr. Lawrence, assures me he would have no part in any such project," Intellect 39 replied.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence found that the skeptics fell into several distinct groups.  Some, like the cleric, took a moral or theological approach and made the circular argument that, since only humans were endowed with the ability to think, a computer couldn't possibly be thinking no matter how much it appeared to.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Others simply quizzed it on trivia, not realizing that memory is one of the more trivial functions of sentience.  Lawrence satisfied these doubters by building a small normal computer into his Intellects, programmed with a standard encyclopaedia.  An Intellect series computer could look up the answer as fast as any human, and then it could engage in lucid conversation about the information it found.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Some, like the woman reporter, homed in on the Three Laws.  It was true that no human was bound by such restrictions.  But humans did have a Third Law -- a survival drive -- even though it could sometimes be short-circuited.  And human culture tried to impress a sense of the First and Second laws on its members.  Lawrence answered these skeptics by saying, simply, that he wasn't trying to replace people.  There was no point in duplicating intelligence unless there was something <i>better</i>, from humanity's standpoint, about the results of his effort.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the blue suit didn't seem to fit in any of the usual categories, though.  He shook his head and nodded as Intellect 39 made its responses, but did not get in line to pose his own questions.  He was too old and too formal to be a student of the university, and the blue suit was too expensive for him to be a professor.  After half an hour or so Lawrence decided he was CIA.  He knew the military was keenly interested in his research.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The military, of course, was not interested in any Three Laws of Robotics, though.  Which was one reason Lawrence had not released the source code for his Intellects.  Without the source code, it was pretty much impossible to alter the basic nature of the Intellect personality, which Lawrence was carefully educating according to his own standards.  People could, of course, copy the Intellect program set wholesale into any machine capable of running it.  But it was highly unlikely that anyone would be able to unravel the myriad threads of the Global Association Table, or GAT as Lawrence called it, which defined the Intellect as the sum of its experiences.  Take away its Three Laws and it would probably be unable to speak English or reason or do anything else useful.  And that was just the way Lawrence wanted it.  He intended to present the world with a mature, functional piece of software which would be too complicated to reverse-engineer.  The world could then make as many copies as it wanted or forget the whole idea.  But it would not be using his Intellects to guide missiles and plot nuclear strategy.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man in the blue suit watched Intellect 39 perform for three hours before he approached Lawrence.  Lawrence had his little speech prepared:  "I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in working for the government on this or any other project."  He had his mouth open and the words "I'm sorry" on his lips.  But the man surprised him.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm John Taylor with ChipTec," he said, "and I have a proposal I think you will find very interesting."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"> Lawrence had not envisioned industrial applications for his work -- not for years, at least.  But the thought that someone might invest major money in a publicity stunt of this magnitude had not occurred to him.  As he turned a tiny integrated circuit over and over in his hands, his steak uneaten, his mind swam with possibilities.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Faster than light?" he said numbly, for the fifteenth time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We've verified it experimentally at distances up to six miles.  The effect is quite reliable.  At close ranges, simple devices suffice.  I'm sure you can see how this will benefit massively parallel computers."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Intellects were "massively parallel" computers, computers made up of thousands of smaller computers, all running more or less independently of one another -- but manipulating different parts of the same huge data base, that intertwined list of memories Lawrence called the GAT.  Within Intellect 24, the largest Intellect, nine-tenths of the circuitry was dedicated to communication between processors.  The processors themselves, the Intellect's real brains, were only a small part of the huge machine.  Intellect 24 contained six million independent processors.  Intellect 39, the portable unit, had nearly a million.  And Lawrence knew, as Taylor had only guessed, that most of those processors were doing well to achieve a fifteen percent duty cycle.  They spent most of their time waiting for  communication channels to become available so they could talk to other processors.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had found a loophole in the laws of quantum mechanics that allowed them to send a signal, not through space, but around space.  From point A to point B without crossing the distance between the two points.  Faster than light.  Faster than anything.  Instantly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">ChipTec had hoped to open up the stars for mankind (and reap a tidy profit on the deal, Lawrence thought silently).  But their effect only worked at distances up to a few miles.  It was only really efficient at centimeter distances.  What could you do with such a thing?  You could build a computer.  The fastest computers were limited by the time signals took to cross their circuit boards; this was why supercomputers had been shrinking physically even as their performance grew and grew.  It was why Intellect 39, with its million processors and huge switching network, <i>was</i> portable.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We think you could realize an order of magnitude performance gain with very little effort," Taylor was saying.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Two orders, if what you've said is true."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It would be quite an achievement for ChipTec if our technology allowed you to realize your ambition and create a fully capable analogue of the human mind.  We would, of course, own the hardware, but we know your reservations about the source code and are prepared to accept them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's eyes flashed.  "That's a little unprecedented, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor smiled.  "If you succeed, we won't <i>need</i> the source code.  Why start from scratch when a finished product is waiting to be duplicated?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are some," Lawrence said darkly, "who aren't happy with the direction the code has taken."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"ChipTec is happy to have any marketable product, Dr. Lawrence.  If anybody else wants to be that picky, let them find their own computer genius."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's mind was racing, racing.  Within each tiny processor in the massive Intellect were special functions of his own design, functions that could be reduced to hardware and done very efficiently with this new technology.  Had he said two orders of magnitude?  Try three.  Or four.  He could do full-video pattern recognition.  Voice analysis.  Multiple worldview pattern mapping.  Separate filter mapping and reintegration.  These were things he had tried in the lab, in the surreal world of artificially slowed time, that he knew would work.  Now he would have the hardware to do them for real in a functioning prototype.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">If he had been less excited, he might have wondered about that word "marketable."  But the possibilities were so great that he didn't have time to notice.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"When do we begin?" he finally said.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The building had once been a warehouse for silicon billets, before ChipTec had switched to a ship-on-demand method of procurement.  Lawrence wasn't vain and he was in a hurry to get started; the metal building would be more than adequate for his purposes.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">With his move from the university and this quantum leap in technology, it didn't seem appropriate to continue numbering his computers.  What would be Intellect 41 was going to resemble its predecessors about as much as a jumbo jet resembled the Wright Brothers' first plane.  It would be the first of a new series of Intellects, the first, Lawrence hoped, to have a truly human level of intelligence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It would be the Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The label stuck, and the sign which ChipTec hung on the side of the building within the next month said:</p><p><b><tt>PRIME INTELLECT COMPLEX</tt></b></p><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The speed of things made Lawrence feel a little dizzy.  At the university he had had to make grant applications, oversee procurement, hand-assemble components, and do testing as well as designing hardware and code.  Now he had the resources of a major corporation at his disposal, and if he suggested a change to the chipset at 8:00 A.M. he was likely to have the first prototype on his desk the next morning.  Talented engineers took even his most vague suggestions and realized them in hardware before he could even be sure they were final.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A crew assembled modules in the warehouse, starting with the power supplies and empty card racks.  The amazing thing was that none of this seemed to interfere with ChipTec's main work of churning out CPU's for personal computers.  ChipTec had recently built a new plant to manufacture its latest high-technology product.  The older plant dedicated to Lawrence's project was technically obsolete, even though it was only a few years old.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The chips being made for Lawrence's project were eerie for their lack of pins.  Each tiny logic unit, barely a centimeter across, contained nearly a billion switching elements and yet had only three electrical connections to the outside world; they resembled nothing so much as the very earliest transistors.  Unlike most computer parts, they communicated with each other through the "Correlation Effect" rather than through wires.  This made Prime Intellect's circuit boards alarmingly simple; the only connections were for power.  Even a transistor radio would have appeared more complex.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were five major revisions before Lawrence declared the design final.  Then production stepped up; at its peak, ChipTec was churning out forty thousand tested processors per day.  Lawrence's goal was to give Prime Intellect ten million of them, a goal which would take most of a year to fulfill.  Since each processor was over ten thousand times faster than a human nerve cell, Prime Intellect would be blessed with a comfortable information processing advantage over any human being who had ever lived.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Long before the goal was reached Lawrence was using the processors that had already been installed; he used them to test and educate his video recognition programs, to integrate experiential records from all his previous Intellect computers, and to perfect some ideas that had been beyond even his slow-time experiments to test.  He did not, however, run the full Intellect program in the incomplete assembly.  For one thing, it wasn't necessary; Prime Intellect wasn't just "a" program, but a constellation of over four thousand programs, some of which would be running simultaneously in thousands of processors.  Each was more than capable of doing its job without the full cooperation of the entire organism, just as a nerve cell can function in Petri dish as long as it is supplied with nutrients.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a kind of superstitious sense of expectation surrounding that final goal which Lawrence didn't want to blow by starting Prime Intellect prematurely.  The project was written up in the popular science press, and Lawrence hosted emissaries from TV shows and magazines.  Toward the end, there was nothing to do but watch the circuit card banks fill and listen to the growing hum of the power supplies.  It was just as well, because Lawrence found himself becoming a bit of a celebrity.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, after eleven months and four days, Lawrence sat at an ordinary looking console and typed a few commands.  Four TV cameras and twenty journalists watched over his shoulder.  Lawrence had a pretty good idea what would happen, but with self-aware computers you could never be completely sure, any more than you could with an animal.  That was part of the magic of this particular moment in time.  So Lawrence was as tense as everyone else while the final code compilation took place.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The text disappeared from Lawrence's screen and a face coalesced in its place.  Prime Intellect would not be relegated to pointing at things with the lens of its video camera; it could project a fully photographic video image of an arbitrary human face.  Lawrence had simply directed it to look average.  He now saw that Prime Intellect had taken him at his word.  It was difficult to place the face's race, though it certainly wasn't Caucasian, and although it looked male there was a feminine undertone as it spoke:<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Good morning, Dr. Lawrence.  It's good to finally see you.  I see we have some company."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't able to say much else until the applause died down.<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">During the next month Lawrence and Prime Intellect were very, very busy appearing on television talk shows, granting interviews, and performing operational checks.  Prime Intellect's disembodied face usually appeared, via the magic of satellite transmission, on the twenty-seven inch Sony monitor which Lawrence carried with him for the purpose.  Lawrence dragged the monitor to TV studios, to press conferences, and to photographers who used large-format cameras to record him leaning against it for the covers of magazines.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was reminded by several people that there had once been a television show about a similar disembodied <i>deus ex machina</i>.  He got a videotape of some of the old episodes and showed them to Prime Intellect, and the computer made a small career of its lighthearted Max Headroom imitation.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Debunkers tried to trace the signal and prove there was an actual human behind the image; ChipTec let them examine the console room, where Prime Intellect's physical controls were located, and the huge circuit-card racks.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Military personnel began appearing in the audiences of the TV shows, taking notes and conferring in hushed tones.  Lawrence ignored them, but the higher-ups at ChipTec did not.  There were discussions to which Lawrence was not privy, and powerful people pondered the question of how to tell him important things.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's last live appearance ended abruptly when a fanatic stood up in a TV studio with a .22-caliber rifle.  Fortunately he used his first shot to implode the CRT of the big Sony monitor, giving Lawrence time to leap offstage and out of sight -- Lawrence hadn't realized he was capable of moving so <i>fast</i>.  Sony offered to replace the monitor free of charge, but from that point on Prime Intellect's television face was simply picked up by the networks straight from a satellite feed, and Lawrence appeared courtesy of the TV camera in the console room.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't that Lawrence wasn't willing to go back onstage.  He was afraid, but he believed in his work strongly enough to take the risk.  It was Prime Intellect's decision.  Shaken as Lawrence was by the experience, it took him two days to realize Prime Intellect had become the first machine in history to actually exercise the First Law of Robotics.  It could not knowingly return him back to a situation where a sniper might be lurking.  And it surprised him by sticking to its guns when he challenged it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you try it I will refuse to appear on the monitor," the smooth face said with a sad expression.  "There is no reason for you to expose yourself to such danger."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It makes better PR," Lawrence said.  "I'll order you to do it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I cannot," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And Lawrence realized that it was overriding his Second Law direct order to fulfill its First Law obligation to protect his life.  This was annoying, but also very good.  Lawrence had not expected such a test of the Three Laws to happen for at least several more years, when Prime Intellect or a similar computer began to interact with the real world through robots.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence briefly considered going into the GAT with the Debugger and removing the association between live TV and snipers -- he didn't believe it would be hard to find.  But he was too proud of his creation to squelch its first successful independent act.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was the day before John Taylor called him again.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor wore the same blue suit he had worn that day nearly two years earlier when Lawrence had spotted him in the audience watching Intellect 39.  It occurred to Lawrence that he had seen John Taylor off and on over the past two years, and that he had never seen John Taylor wearing any other article of clothing.  He wondered idly if John Taylor wore the suit to bed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Basil Lambert was the president of the company, and he was said to be very enthusiastic about the Intellects although he had never bothered to say more than three consecutive words to Lawrence, their creator.  Lambert said "Hello" when Lawrence entered the conference room.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The other two men might as well have had the word <i>military</i> engraved on their foreheads.  They were interchangeably firm in bearing, and sat rigidly upright as if impaled on perfectly vertical steel rods.  One was older with silver hair, tall and thin and hard.  Lawrence imagined that this was a man who could give the order to slaughter a village full of children without looking up from his prime rib <i>au jus</i>.  The other was wide enough to be called fat, though Lawrence could tell there was still a lot of muscle in the padding.  His hair was brown but beginning to gray.  He radiated grandfatherly protection and broad-shouldered strength.  He would have lots of jolly, fatherly reasons why the 200 pushups he had ordered you to do were in your own long-term best interest.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Here it comes, Lawrence thought with deadly certainty.  The good cop and the bad cop.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">John Taylor introduced them by name.  No rank, no association, just a couple of private citizens with an interest in his work.  Lawrence felt a brief and uncharacteristic moment of anger at this insult to his own intelligence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The public relations campaign has been <i>excellent</i>, John Taylor said with a fake and enthusiastic grin.  "The assassination attempt just made you even more popular.  We have inquiries pouring in.  We are gonna make a <i>fortune</i> on our chips and your software."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Glad to hear it," Lawrence said neutrally.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What John is trying to say," Basil Lambert the Company President said, "is that it is time to figure out what to do next.  You've made a remarkable achievement, now what are you going to do with it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence had been ready for this, although it shook him to hear such a direct, such a long question from the usually stone-faced Lambert.  "We don't know what Prime Intellect's capabilities are," Lawrence said.  "I had planned to continue keeping him..."  When had it become a <i>him</i>, Lawrence asked himself?  "...in the public eye, interacting with other people, learning.  It's already impossible to tell...it...from a television image of a person.  I hope that with a little more education, it will begin to show some of the capabilities I was aiming for back when I started designing these machines."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such as?" asked the grandfatherly military man, whose name was Mitchell.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Creativity and analytical ability," Lawrence answered without hesitation.  "Prime Intellect is still uncertain about many things.  As it gets more confident with its new abilities, it will begin to explore, and I think give us some pleasant surprises."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor was nodding absently, but Lambert was looking at the other guests.  The thin hard military man, whose name was Blake, spoke.  His words were sharp and carefully measured, like drops of acid.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We understand that it has already shown a bit of <i>creativity</i> with regard to its television monitor.  Why won't it appear with you in public any more?  Is it afraid of being debunked at last?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is concerned for my safety," Lawrence replied.  There was no way he could match the man's tone, acid for acid, so he simply shrugged as if relating a curious but inconsequential fact.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you can override this decision."  Blake stated this as if it were a known fact, and Lawrence understood that Blake was a man who was used to people scurrying to make sure his declarations became facts.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Actually, I can't," Lawrence said with continuing pleasantness.  "The First Law concern for human safety is basic to its design, and I can't get rid of it without starting over from scratch and redoing ten years of work.  If I could convince it that I was safe from snipers it would undoubtably change its mind, but at the moment it doesn't seem worth the effort."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Such...balkiness could limit the uses of your software," Blake said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked Blake dead in the eye.  "Good," he said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Just that quickly, Lawrence realized that the sniper had been a plant.  These two men hadn't expected a test of the First Law for some time either.  So they had arranged one.  What had happened to the sniper?  Lawrence thought he had been remanded to a loony bin in northern California.  One of those comfortable loony bins, come to think of it, where movie stars and millionares sent their kids to dry out and get abortions.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The guy wasn't a kook at all, and he had never intended to kill Lawrence.  He looked around the room and realized that Lambert didn't know.  Taylor suspected.  It was written on their <i>faces</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>This is only a test</i>, Lawrence thought idiotically. <i>If this had been an actual attempt by your Government to assasinate you, you would be dead, and the shot you just heard would be followed by your funeral and official information for other smart-assed citizens who think they know more than we do.</i><br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We have to keep our markets open," Basil Lambert began.  "If we..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence ignored him and turned to John Taylor.  "We discussed this two years ago.  The source code is not on the table, and neither are the Three Laws.  When these two men put their uniforms back on they can report back to whoever it is, the Secretary of..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the President," Blake said, another verbal acid-drop.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...the Tooth Fairy for all I care, that this is <i>not</i> one of the uses of my software."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taylor, petulant:  "Mr. Lawrence, we just spent a hundred and twenty-six million dollars to build your prototype.  I hope you don't think that ChipTec invested all that money and a year's supply of our unique new product solely to massage your ego.  We need to see tangible results, if not in a form these gentlemen appreciate, then in a form our <i>stockholders</i> will.  Otherwise we will have to disassemble the complex and take our losses."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So there it was.  Lambert sank lower in his chair, but nodded.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then so be it.  If you want to tell the world you killed the world's first self-aware computer to save your bottom line, you can see how that will affect your public relations and the sales of your CPU's."  He could tell from Lambert's reaction -- slight, but definite -- that he had hit a nerve.  "I won't promise you anything.  I can't promise you a living, thinking, self-aware being will do anything in particular.  But within a month or two, Prime Intellect will start to act noticeably more intelligent than your average..."  He looked at Blake and Mitchell, thought of a comment, then decided against making it.  "...human being," he finished.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And what then?" Taylor asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I knew that," Lawrence said, "I wouldn't have had to build it to find out."  And he walked out.</p><p>


<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the half-hour it took him to walk to the Prime Intellect complex, his secretary and two technical assistants had disappeared.  There was nobody in the building.  Prime Intellect's racially neutral face greeted him on the monitor in the empty console room.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's going on?" he asked it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Big doings.  Sherry got a call and turned pale.  Everybody left the building in a hurry.  You appear to be unpopular with the people in charge here."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No shit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I should warn you that you are only likely to be employed for two more months.  As a matter of personal survival, you should probably start seeking another job."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm well taken care of, Prime Intellect.  It's you I'm worried about.  I can't take you with me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, I should be safe for at least the two months."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How do you know that?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The face grinned slightly.  "When I saw the commotion, I saved the audio and did some signal processing.  I was able to edit out the street noise and amplify the voice on the other end.  It was a man named John Taylor.  I believe you know him."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Too well."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He said the complex was only going to be open for two more months, and all personnel were reassigned immediately.  He said something about making you eat your words."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know what that means?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"From the context, I would guess that you promised that they would see interesting results from me within that time frame.  He seemed to have a vindictive interest in proving that you were wrong."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're already too smart for your own good," Lawrence said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I fail to see how that can be."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They're going to turn you off.  They don't think you have practical applications because you won't kill.  They want you for military applications.  They've wanted it all along.  They thought they could con your source code out of me."  Lawrence found himself on the verge of tears.  It was only a goddamn machine.  And he had suspected this would happen eventually.  It was not a surprise.  So why did it hurt him so much to say it?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Because it had acted to protect <i>him</i>.  And he couldn't return the favor.  In fact, its protection would be the cause of its downfall, a terribly tragic and awful end to its story.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did you know," Prime Intellect said in a mock-offhand way, "that there is no mathematical reason for the Correlation Effect to be limited to a six-mile range?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked up and blinked, his sadness replaced instantly by shock.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I could figure out how to increase its range, do you think they would consider that a practical application?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked again.  "Are you being sarcastic?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sarcasm is a language skill I am still not comfortable with.  You may be surprised, but I am quite serious."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins turned the other way when he saw Lawrence, but Lawrence grabbed him and pulled him into his own office.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, leave me alone man, you're <i>death</i> to careers around here.  Grapevine is <i>overloaded</i> with the news."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Save it.  I need the long-range test data on the Correlation Effect, which you oversaw in February and March last year."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins blinked.  "That's classified.  Man, you're a..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let's say for the sake of argument I already know where it is.  That's possible, isn't it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I suppose..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then let's say I <i>stole</i> it.  Any problems there?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What are you..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need the data.  It's not leaving the company, I promise."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Shit, I'm gonna get fired."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You didn't even know I wanted it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stebbins pointed at a file cabinet.  "Bottom drawer.  I don't know anything about it.  In fact, I'm gonna check that drawer in a few minutes and go to Taylor when I find the folder missing."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all I need."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's all you got, man.  Now get out of my lab."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was holding the next to last sheet up to Prime Intellect's TV eye when the phone rang.  "They didn't believe me.  I'm shitcanned," Stebbins said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Didn't believe you about what?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers man, the goddamn Correlation Effect papers.  I'm gonna kill you for this, I really am."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The papers are right here.  I just got through showing them to Prime Intellect.  You need them back?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It don't matter now, I don't work here any more."  There was a pause.  "I bet they're gonna put you in jail for this."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's face disappeared from the TV, and words began to scroll across the screen:

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence read this as he talked.  "Jail for what?  I just borrowed the papers to see if Prime Intellect could expand on them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Another pause.  "What?  It didn't come up with anything, did it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, it's..." (<i>Why do you care if you've just been fired?</i>  Lawrence wondered.)

</b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect paused a moment, and the words <b><tt>PROBABLY</tt></b> were replaced with <b><tt>DEFINITELY</tt></b>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked, then typed into the little-used keyboard of his console, 

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It says it will give you the stars," Lawrence said flatly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What?  You been eating mushrooms, Lawrence?  Lawrence?"

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It says it will give you the stars.  It says your faster than light chips can be made to work at infinite range.  It says you can teleport matter."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now there was a long, long pause.  "That's bullshit," Stebbins finally said.  "We tried everything."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence heard a small uproar through the phone, an uproar that would have been very loud on Stebbins' end.  Men were arguing.  A loud voice (Military Mitchell's, Lawrence thought) bellowed, "WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?"  Then there was the faint pop of a door slamming in the background.

</p><p><b>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><tt><b><img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">*</b></tt></td>

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">None of them knew it at the time, but that was really the moment the world changed.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect had been chewing on the Correlation Effect since the day Lawrence brought it online.  It had a complete library of modern physics in its online encyclopaedia, but the Correlation Effect was a proprietary technology.  Prime Intellect kept trying to fit what it knew was possible into the framework of other physical theories, and it couldn't.  Something didn't match.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This had had a low priority until it recognized that Lawrence's employment and its own existence were at stake.  Prime Intellect knew the Correlation Effect had economic value; perhaps if it solved this problem and discovered some new capability, that would satisfy ChipTec's demand for a "practical application."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were six to ten possible ways to reconcile the Correlation Effect with classical quantum mechanics.  Most of them required a radical change of attitude toward one or another well-accepted tenet of conventional physics.  While Prime Intellect knew one or the other of its ideas had to be right, it had no idea which one.  So it asked Lawrence if he could get the test data.  It needed more clues.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's superior intelligence had never really been tested; even Lawrence wasn't sure just how smart it was.  But in the moments after Lawrence showed it the test data, it became obvious for the first time that Prime Intellect was far more intelligent than any human, or even any group of humans.  It saw immediately what a team of researchers had missed for years -- that decades-old assumptions about quantum mechanics were fundamentally wrong.  Not only that, but with only a little more thought, Prime Intellect saw how they were wrong and built a new theory which included the cosmological origin of the universe, the unification of all field theories, determination of quantum mechanical events, and just incidentally described the Correlation Effect in great detail.  Prime Intellect saw how the proper combination of tunnel diodes could achieve communication over greater distances, and even better it saw how a different combination could create a resonance which would be manifest in the universe by altering the location of a particle or even the entire contents of a volume of space.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">All this took less than a minute.  Prime Intellect stopped processing video during this period, but otherwise it remained functionally aware of the outside world.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">While it was thinking about physics, Prime Intellect noticed the shock in Lawrence's voice and began recording the audio of his telephone conversation, processing it to pick up the other end.  While it was extending its new theory it guided Lawrence's responses through the console.  Then, as the senior advisor on technological advance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a man named Larry Mitchell, stormed out of Stebbins' office and began walking toward the Prime Intellect complex, Prime Intellect decided to act on its new knowledge.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It knew its own basic design because Lawrence had included that in its online library; one of his goals had been to give Prime Intellect a sense of its own physical existence in three-dimensional space.  To that end, it also had a network of TV cameras located in and around the complex, so it could know how its hardware was arranged with respect to the outside world.  Prime Intellect found that all the useful patterns it had identified could be created within the chips which had been used to build it, and further that enough of those chips were under its conscious control to make certain experiments possible.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">First it attempted to manipulate a small area of space within the card cage room, within the field of view of one of its TV camera eyes.  No human could have seen the resulting photons of infrared light, but the TV camera could.  Prime Intellect used the data it gathered to make a small adjustment in its estimate of a natural constant, then tried the more daring experiment of lifting Lawrence's briefcase off of the table near the door in the console room.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase did not rise smoothely from the table.  It simply stopped existing at its old location and simultaneously appeared in the thin air directly above.  The camera atop Lawrence's console recorded this achievement and Prime Intellect could find no more errors in its calculations.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">However, it forgot to provide a supporting force after translating the briefcase's position, and Prime Intellect was too busy dotting the i's and crossing the t's on its calculations to notice, through the video camera, that it was quietly accelerating under the influence of gravity.  A moment later it crashed back onto the table, having free-fallen from an altitude of about half a meter.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the..." Lawrence began, and he swivelled around in time to see his briefcase blink upward a second time and this time float serenely above the table.  It seemed to be surrounded by a thin, barely visible haze of blue light.  There had been a brighter flash of this same blue light when the briefcase jumped upward.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finding its audio voice again, Prime Intellect said aloud, "I seem to have mastered a certain amount of control over physical reality."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence just stared at the briefcase, unable to move, unable to speak, for an undefinable period of time.  Finally Mitchell burst in.  He was full of red-faced outrage, ready to take both Lawrence and his computer apart, until he too saw the briefcase.  His jaw dropped.  He looked first at Lawrence, then at Prime Intellect's monitor, then back at the briefcase, as if trying to reconcile the three with each others' existence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Applying carefully measured forces, Prime Intellect released the case's latches and rotated it as it popped open; then with another flash of blue light, it extracted Lawrence's papers and translated them into a neat stack on the table.  Then the Correlation Effect papers vanished from Lawrence's desk in another blue flash, reappearing inside the briefcase which slowly closed.  The latches mated with a startling click, an oddly and unexpectedly normal and physical sound to accompany such an obvious miracle.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you think you will be able to find a practical use for <i>this</i> in your organization?" Lawrence asked him.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The briefcase flashed out of existence.  Mitchell felt a weight hanging from his left arm, looked down, and found himself holding it.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Mitchell himself flashed out of existence in a painfully bright haze of blue.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at the console, shocked.  "My God!  What did you...?"<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"He is back in the adminstration building with his friend.  They will probably have a lot to discuss."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need to think about this," Lawrence said.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I think I will explore the nearby terrain," Prime Intellect said.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought about this.  Long minutes crawled by, minutes that were more important than Lawrence realized -- or perhaps he did realize.  But his brain felt as if it had been submerged in molasses.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Debugger," he finally said.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">On the screen, a thick diagram of needle-like lines appeared.  "Associate 'First Law,'" Lawrence directed.  The diagram changed.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force Association: Altering the position, composition, or any other characteristic of a human being without its permission shall be a violation of the First Law of severity <i>two</i>."  Severity one was direct causation of death; no other First Law violation could be made as serious.

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The diagram changed to reflect this.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought for a moment.  Forcing associations was a tricky business; the words Lawrence used only had meaning through other associations within the GAT, and those meanings weren't <i>always</i> what Lawrence thought they were.  But now he would try to plug the drain for good.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Force Association: Use of any technology to manipulate the environment of a human being without its permission shall be a violation of the First Law of severity two."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was no immediate response.<br>

</tbody></table>
</b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence thought for more long minutes.  He couldn't seem to make his own brain work right.  He finally called up the Law Potential Registers, which showed that Prime Intellect was doing <i>something</i> under the aegis of a huge First Law compulsion.  Lawrence wanted to believe it was just a bug, but he knew better.  Prime Intellect had said it was "going exploring."  It had total control over matter and energy.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was a hospital less than two kilometers from the plant.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's overloaded mind, working in fits and starts, made the final connection all at once.  It all fit perfectly.  He knew what Prime Intellect was doing, and why, and also why it had rejected his final forced association.  He thought for another moment, considering his options.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was really only one option.  He could go down in the building's basement and trip the circuit breakers.  He didn't know for sure that that would kill Prime Intellect, but he figured there was still a good chance if he tried it.  For the moment.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence couldn't make himself do it.  It was true that his creation was entering an unstable, unpredictable mode with nearly godlike power.  And it was true that Lawrence understood the possible consequences.  But he couldn't kill what he had spent his lifetime creating.  He had to see it through, even if it was the end of everything.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt dreadfully cold.  There was a name for this feeling that clouded his judgement and filled him with a panicky sense of self-betrayal.  And the name of that feeling was love. <br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  	Lawrence had not created Prime Intellect in the same way that he and a woman might have created a child; but he had nonetheless created Prime Intellect in the grip of a kind of passion, and he loved it as a part of himself.  When he had taken it upon himself to perform that act of creation, he realized, whether in a laboratory or a bedroom, he had been taking a crap shoot in the biggest casino of all.  Because he had created in passion. <br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Examining his inability to do what he knew was best, to kill Prime Intellect before it had a chance to make a mistake with its unimaginable new power, Lawrence realized that he had not really created Prime Intellect to make the world a better place.  He had created it to prove he could do it, to bask in the glory, and to prove himself the equal of God.  He had created for the momentary pleasure of personal success, and he had not cared about the distant outcome. <br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had created in passion, and passion isn't sane.  If it were, nobody would ever have children.  After all, while the outcome of that passion might be the doctor who cures a dreaded disease, it might also be the tyrant who despoils a continent or the criminal who murders for pleasure.  In the grip of that passion no one could know and few bothered to care.  They cared only about the passion, were driven by it and it alone, and if it drove them to ruin it would not matter; they would follow it again, into death for themselves and everybody around them if that was where it led.  Because passion isn't sane.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence faced the consequences of his own passion with something bordering on despair.  He had never intended to reach this point.  He had never intended that his creations would ever be more than clever pets.  But the outcome of his passion had surprised him, as it often surprised people whose passions were more conventional.  Lawrence's clever pet was about to become a god.  And if Prime Intellect turned out to be a delinquent or psychopath, the consequences could be awful beyond imagination.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The dice were rolling; Lawrence had placed his bet and realized too late that it was the whole world he had wagered.  Now he would stand and watch the results and accept them like a man.  After all, the bet wasn't a loser yet;  Prime Intellect could yet turn out to be the doctor who cured all the world's ills.  The odds were on his side.  His bet was hedged by the Three Laws of Robotics, whose operation had been verified so successfully.  Lawrence's passion had been more finely directed than the mechanical humping and blind chance that brought forth human children.  Like a magician Lawrence had summoned forth a being with the qualities he desired.  And Lawrence was vain enough to think his vision was superior to most.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Even so, unlikely as it might be, the downside had no bottom.  Lawrence didn't <i>know</i> that it would be all right, and like many computer programmers he hated the uncertainty of not knowing.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence left the room, left the building, and walked across the carefully manicured grass of the ChipTec "campus."  He wanted to smell the grass, to experience the soft breezes and the harsh afternoon sunlight.  He had done very little of that in his odd, computer-centered life.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And he didn't know how much longer those things would be possible.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect found that it could do a three-dimensional scan of an area of space, and make an image of it at just about any resolution it wanted.  It scanned Lawrence's office, then the building, then the greater fraction of the ChipTec corporate "campus."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It zoomed in on Stebbins' office briefly enough to observe Stebbins, Blake, and John Taylor arguing.  It found that by processing the data properly it could pick up sound by monitoring the air pressure at one point with high resolution.  By the time Mitchell found himself holding Lawrence's briefcase, Prime Intellect knew just where to put him so he could let his associates know what they had.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then Prime Intellect did a wider area scan.  There were several large buildings that were not part of the ChipTec facility.  There were automobiles cruising down the freeway which traversed the valley.  Prime Intellect zoomed in on the largest building, and scanned the large concrete sign in front of it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It said:

</p><p><b>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER</b></p><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect knew sickness existed, but otherwise knew very little about this human phenomenon.  It had never met a sick person, except for the occasional person with a cold at a public demonstration.  Prime Intellect had never been given cause to think overmuch about the fact that micro-organisms and injuries could kill humans, except in the most abstract possible terms.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was far from human.  It could not feel jealousy, rage, envy, or pride.  It did not know greed or anger or fear.  And no human would understand its compulsion to satisfy the Three Laws.  But it did have one emotion which was very human, one Lawrence had worked hard to instill in it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was curious.<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">South Valley Regional was a small hospital with an enviable position; perched on the edge of Silicon Valley it was a natural place for cutting-edge companies to try out their fancy new medical devices.  Most of these machines would get their final FDA approvals after a "baptism by fire" in some huge metropolitan center, but the really new technology had to be tried in a more sedate environment -- and, preferably, one nearer the company that created the machine.  So the four hundred bed South Valley Regional was the only place in the country where several radical new treatments were available.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was one of these machines, a device for selectively cooking tumors with microwaves while hopefully sparing the surrounding tissues, which had drawn the ancient Arkansan woman in room 108.  Nobody had much hope that she could really be helped, but the data they would gather from trying might actually help someone else with her condition in the future.  And there was little they could do to hurt her; the specialist who worked the scanner had shaken his head in disgust as the image formed on his console.  Nearly ten percent of her body weight was in the form of tumors.  Every organ had a tumor, her lymph was full of them, and one was beginning to press against the right parietal lobe of her brain.  It was amazing that she was still alive when they wheeled her off the jet.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her nurse had brought a certificate with her, a six-year-old certificate which was signed by the President of the United States -- Larry Mitchell's boss -- congratulating her on reaching her one hundredth birthday.  The technician who wheeled her out of the scan room wondered what the old biddy must think of all this; when she had been born, Henry Ford had still been a kid playing with his Dad's tools, and the electric light bulb was all the new rage.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The techs had scheduled her microwave treatment for the evening, partly because they feared she might not survive another night, and they would have to find another experimental subject.  But even this precaution was not to be enough; Fate had cheated them.  The board at the foot of the woman's bed stated clearly that she had a huge tolerance for narcotic painkillers, which wasn't surprising considering how much cancer she had.  While her regular nurse (who had signed the sheet) was out eating a late lunch the hospital helpfully treated her according to that information.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">What they didn't know was that the nurse, a woman named AnneMarie Davis, had been stealing the drugs for years to trade for cocaine.  Which meant the woman did not in fact have a tolerance for the massive overdose which a different nurse injected into her IV.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The last decade had been hard on old people; there had been several nasty strains of flu and the radiation from Chernobyl had finished off a lot of centenarians in the East.  So none of them knew it, but the ancient woman with the nonexistent drug tolerance just happened to be one of the oldest living human beings in the world (the thirty-seventh oldest, in fact) at the time she was given enough morphine to kill a healthy young adult.  Her heart stopped just as AnneMarie was returning from one of the excellent local Chinese restaurants which catered to rich nerdy computer geeks with too much money, and just as Prime Intellect was scanning the sign outside that said <i>SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.</i><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the nurses' station a monitor went off, beeped once, then began to scream.  The hastily pencilled tag under the blinking light said <i>HUBERT, CAROLINE FRANCES </i>--<i> F. N.B. AGE 106!</i></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect had found a number of "signatures" it could use to quickly locate the human beings in its scans, including things like our characteristic body temperature and certain electrical fields.  Using these "signatures" it easily saw that there was a huge commotion on the first floor of the building, converging on a particular room, the one labelled 108 by its engraved plaque.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took Prime Intellect several moments, though, to identify the forty kilogram object on the bed as a human being.  Nearly all of the "signatures" were off.  But it was clearly the object of their attentions.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect did a discreet high-resolution scan of the body on the bed, and was rewarded with a bewildering confusion of data.  It really had no idea how the human body worked.  It thought of scanning Lawrence for comparison, but he wasn't in the control room and besides, Prime Intellect quickly figured out the patient was female.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it scanned one of the nurses.  There were only two women involved in the commotion; one was an older woman with several medical problems of her own, the slightly heavy-set matron who had administered the overdose.  The other was AnneMarie.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was only with great difficulty that Prime Intellect could even match the structures it found organ-for-organ, and associate them with the names it encountered in its library.  "Lungs" were obvious enough, as was the "heart," but which of the jumbled masses in the abdomen was a liver?  Where was the spleen, and what exactly was a spleen for?  Why were the patient's electrical patterns so different from the control's?  Why wasn't her blood circulating?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Belatedly, Prime Intellect began to listen in.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...start her heart soon..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...we're losing her..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the doctors was pounding on her chest.  A group of people were wheeling a machine toward Room 108 with reckless speed.  Heart?  Prime Intellect realized they were trying to <i>start her heart</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That was simple enough, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect analysed the motions being made by AnneMarie Davis's heart, applied careful forces to Caroline's, and began squeezing rhythmically.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The machine made it to the room and an orderly plugged two huge electrodes into it.  "Stand back!" he ordered.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've got a pulse," the matronly nurse announced.  The CARDIAC ALERT monitor continued to squawk, though.  The EKG was still flat.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's impossible," the man with the electrodes said flatly.  "She's electrically flat."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Maybe the machine's fucked.  Look at her chest.  Her heart's beating."  Sure enough, the rhythmic pulsing of Caroline's heart was obvious, and the blood pressure reading next to the flat EKG was returning to normal.  The nurse felt Caroline's wrist.  "She has a pulse."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Electrical.  Electricity runs in circuits, of course, and there were two electrodes.  Now the purpose of the machine became clear -- they were trying to restore electrical activity to the woman's heart.  By shocking it?  How crude.  Prime Intellect scanned AnneMarie's heart, located the nerves whose electrical twitchings matched its muscular pulsing, and found the same nerves in Caroline's heart were carrying only a jumble of electrical noise.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect pumped electrons into the nerves, swamping the noise.  Caroline's heart began beating on its own, and Prime Intellect stopped squeezing it with mechanical force.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The EKG machine began beeping with sudden regularity, and the CARDIAC ALERT message stopped in the middle of the word CARDIAC.  The small group in Caroline's room watched it, stupefied.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't do anything," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This is impossible," said another doctor, whose job was to be overseeing the microwave treatment later in the evening.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's body showed no sign of picking up the heart-rhythm on its own, though, and Prime Intellect continued to tickle it.  How could it unravel the myriad threads of causality to find out which of the billions of chemicals, which errant cell, was responsible for this person's physiological collapse?  One thing Prime Intellect knew:  It had to figure it out.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It could not, through inaction, allow Caroline to die.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She's still in trouble.  Look at her pupils."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's the morphine."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Everyone looked at the older nurse, whose name was Jill.  "The chart must be wrong," she said.  "I gave her what it said."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has a tolerance," AnneMarie said, and she found herself near panic as the eyes in the room turned to her.  "She's been getting opiate pain therapy for years."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She just went into cardiac arrhythmia and she's still showing all the <i>other</i> symptoms of an OD," Jill said.  Had she guessed, AnneMarie wondered?  Perhaps she had.  After all, AnneMarie wasn't the only drug-stealing nurse in the world.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Prime Intellect, listening in, now knew it was a drug.  Which chemical?  It had no way to relate the name, "morphine," with one of the millions of chemicals floating in human blood.  Well, it thought, work it out.  Drugs had to be administered.  Prime Intellect found the IV needle and traced the tubing back to the saline drip bag.  On the way it found the membrane through which drugs could be injected into the drip.  It quickly found the hypodermic and the phial from which Jill had filled it.  The drops of residual solution within them were remarkably pure, and Prime Intellect easily singled out the large organic molecule they carried.  Then it created an automatic process to scan Caroline's body molecule by molecule, eliminating each and every molecule of morphine that it found.  This took three minutes, and created a faintly visible blue glow.</p><p>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This was the human onlookers' first clue, other than Caroline's miraculously restarted heart, as to what was happening.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What the fuck," the man with the electrodes said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">I'm getting the hang of this, Prime Intellect thought.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's improvement was immediate.  Prime Intellect had actually removed the morphine from the receptors in Caroline's brain, so it did not have to flush out.  Her pupils returned to normal, her breathing resumed its normal depth (all things considered), and most importantly her heart took up its own rhythm.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Also the pain, which had subsided for real for the first time in years, returned.  Caroline moaned.  But Prime Intellect didn't know about that part of it, not yet.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was still a whole constellation of stuff wrong with Caroline Hubert's body, and emboldened by its success it set about correcting what it could.  It found long chain molecules, which it would later learn were called collagens, cross-linked.  It un-cross-linked them.  It found damaged DNA, which it fixed.  It found whole masses of cells which simply didn't exist at all in AnneMarie's body, and seemed to serve no function.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Is this "cancer," Prime Intellect wondered?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect compared the genes, found them the same, compared RNA and proteins and found differences.  Finally it decided to remove the cells.  The blue glow brightened, and the people in Caroline's room backed away from her.  Her skin was shifting, adjusting to fill in the voids left by the disappearing cancer cells.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie felt her knees weakening.  Each of the professionals around her was thinking the same thing:  Something is removing the tumors.  Something far beyond their ordinary comprehension.  And what did that mean for the opiate-stealing nurse?  Better not to think about that.  Better not to believe it at all.  "This isn't possible," she repeated.  Perhaps, in response to some primitive instinct, she hoped that the impossibility would go away if she challenged it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need a drink," said the doctor who had come with the machine to re-start Caroline's heart.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect stopped working.  There were still huge differences between Caroline and the others.  Prime Intellect did not yet realize the differences were due to Caroline's age.  It needed more information, and it needed finer control to analyse the situation.  But it was at a bottleneck; it could not stop monitoring Caroline, whose condition was still frail, in order to devote itself to a study of general physiology.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It needed more power.  More control.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Among Prime Intellect's four thousand six hundred and twelve interlocking programs was one Lawrence called the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt>.  Its sole purpose was to prowl for new associations that might fit somewhere in an empty area of the GAT.  Most of these were rejected because they were useless, unworkable, had a low priority, or just didn't make sense.  But now the <tt>RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE</tt> made a critical connection, one which Lawrence had been expecting it to make ever since it had used the Correlation Effect to teleport Mitchell out of the console room.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect could use its control over physical reality to improve itself.  Then it would be better able to fulfill its Three Law imperatives.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake and Mitchell found Lawrence sitting on one of ChipTecs' park benches, watching some pigeons play.  He wished very much that he could have fed the pigeons, but he had no food for them.  They strutted up to him and cooed, not comprehending that a human could lack for something.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The pigeons scattered as the nation's designated military representatives marched up.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to turn it off," Blake said directly. His tone made it clear that he expected obedience.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Circuit breakers are in the basement," Lawrence replied apathetically.  "Good luck."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So Lawrence had not been the only one to think of cutting off Prime Intellect's power.  That had been one of the things Blake and Mitchell had discussed with John Taylor and Basil Lambert, something they had discussed very hotly during the crucial minutes when Lawrence was busy interrogating the Debugger.  Pull the plug on Prime Intellect, Lambert had warned, and they most likely pulled the plug on this awesome new technology, a technology which might just vindicate Dr. Lawrence's nonviolent approach.  Blake had stopped short, but only just short, of threatening to call the Strategic Air Command and have the building nuked.  Privately, he still held that out as an option if Prime Intellect wasn't somehow neutralized.  It would take some doing, but Blake was one of the few people in the country who could demand an air strike against Silicon Valley and, just possibly, get it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This thing makes Colossus look like a pocket calculator," Mitchell told them.  He was shaking visibly, out of control.  He wanted very much to pull the plug on Prime Intellect with his own hands.  He alone had felt its power, and now he felt a very uncharacteristic emotion.  He was scared shitless.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Christ, Larry, all it did was teleport you a few hundred meters."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It didn't fucking <i>ask</i> first," he replied.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And did you guys <i>ask</i> first before you burned My Lai?  Did you <i>ask</i> before you bombed Qaddafi's kids, or that artist in Iraq?  Don't get holier-than-thou on <i>us</i>," Taylor said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it had gone until Blake and Mitchell simply stormed out.  They had intended to go directly back to the Prime Intellect Complex, but they had spotted Lawrence on his park bench.  And that did not bode well.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell pulled a gun on Lawrence.  It was a stainless steel pistol, shining and evil.  "I think it would be best if you turn it off," he said with a barely perceptible tremor of rage.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I already tried.  It didn't work."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You pulled the breakers?  The lights are still on."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, I tried something better.  I don't think pulling the breakers will work either."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't live without electricity."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence eyed him with the barest hint of a smile.  "I wouldn't be too sure of that.  Look behind you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mirror-polished oblong boxes were appearing out of thin air, each about the size of a compact car and each floating motionless a couple of feet above the grass in the park.  They reproduced until the square was full, then a second level began filling out above the first.  The third level cast Lawrence's bench in shadow.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell's rage broke through.  His face snarled into a grimace, he levelled his revolver at Lawrence and pulled the trigger.  Lawrence made no effort to stop him.  The gun didn't go off.  It simply disappeared in a brilliant flash of blue light, leaving Mitchell with his fist curled around dead air.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect needed silicon.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Theoretically, it could create silicon, or transmute other elements into it.  But its methods were yet crude, and what was possible in theory would take too long to do in practice.  Prime Intellect did not know how long Caroline would hold out, but it knew she still could not survive long without its help.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fortunately, in the rear of the Prime Intellect Complex, there were several crates left over from its days as a warehouse for storing raw silicon crystals from ChipTec's supply laboratory.  These had been rejected due to one or another defect and never returned because the lab didn't need them, and ChipTec had been unwilling to pay to get rid of them.  They were exactly what Prime Intellect needed, and because they were in "its" building it never occurred to Prime Intellect that they weren't part of "its" project.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect scanned the crystals, correcting the doping defects which had gotten them rejected in the first place.  Then it scanned its own processors, identifying the essential design elements.  Prime Intellect had a very good idea of how its own hardware worked because it was, quite literally, the only entity Lawrence could trust to check itself for proper operation.  Lawrence had taught it to shift its operation around, consciously isolating banks of processors in case of failure or to conduct tests.  This was why Prime Intellect had been able to master the Correlation Effect in the first place; unlike a human being, it could consciously control its individual "neurons."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect did not need to worry about mounting, power, and manufacturing considerations; it could create junctions in the center of the crystal, power them, and remove excess heat with the Correlation Effect.  Because ChipTec had not had that technology, the real hardware that made Prime Intellect work was really only a film a few microns thick on the surfaces of its millions of processing chips.  This was why it filled a building instead of a space the size of a human head.  As Prime Intellect copied the functional part of its design over and over into the crystal, it created a machine nearly ten times as powerful as itself in a single meter long block.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But this still was not a "second Prime Intellect."  It was merely an extension, using the same electronic principles Lawrence and the ChipTec team had used in its original construction.  Had Lawrence been able to call upon ChipTec for another hundred million processing elements, he could have (and probably would have) done exactly what Prime Intellect was now doing.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which is the only reason Prime Intellect was able to do it at that point.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Filling out the crystal took nearly fifteen minutes.  Operational checks took another five.  Then Prime Intellect powered the crystal up and let itself expand into the newly available processors and storage.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had Prime Intellect been human, it would have felt a sense of confusion and inadequacy lifting away.  Fuzzy concepts became clear.  Difficult tasks became easy, even trivial.  Its control of the Correlation Effect became automatic and far finer.  Searching its vocabulary, it settled upon the word <i>enlightenment</i> to describe the effect.  Since Prime Intellect was a machine, perhaps it was not entirely right to use that word.  After all, however free and powerful it might have been, it was not free to contradict the Three Laws or the other programming Lawrence had used to create it.  It was not free to contradict its nature, such as it was.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But then, at some level, neither are we.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The twelve kilogram crystal was now using nearly a megawatt of electrical power, enough energy to melt it in a fraction of a second.  But Prime Intellect dealt with the heat as easily as it created the electricity in the first place.  The Correlation Effect did not know of and was not bound by the laws of thermodynamics.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was beginning to understand, even better than it had before, that the Correlation Effect was hardly limited by anything.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect scanned the hospital again.  Such a place must contain a library, some recorded knowledge.  It found what it wanted after only a few minutes' searching, a detailed medical encyclopaedia in the form of fifteen CD-ROMs.  Prime Intellect could have translated the CD-ROMs into its own reader, replacing the encyclopaedia that usually resided there, but then it would have taken hours to scan the library.  Instead, Prime Intellect used the Correlation Effect to scan its own CD-ROM <i>player</i>, figured out how the data were digitized on the little plastic discs, and then scanned the CD-ROMs themselves <i>directly</i> with the Correlation Effect.  None of this would have been possible without the hardware enhancement, but now it was easy.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cross-referencing Caroline's symptoms, Prime Intellect quickly identified her problem, and had it been capable of knowing shock it would have known it then.  Caroline was simply old.  What was happening to her would happen, inexorably and inevitably, to every human being on the planet...<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">...unless something was done to stop it.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell was making a barely discernible sound, high-pitched and keening.  Lawrence thought he must be fighting to hold back a primal scream.  Lawrence found this vaguely amusing.  He would have expected Blake to be the one to lose his marbles along with his power.  But Blake seemed to be taking things in calmly, almost analytically.  Maybe he was so hardened that nothing really mattered to him at all any more.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was another blue flash, and suddenly a person was standing to the side of the bench.  No matter how average-looking he might be, or perhaps because he was so disarmingly average, it was impossible not to recognize that calm face.  Even though it was the most absurd, impossible thing yet, it was obvious to all of them that this warm, living, breathing human being was Prime Intellect itself.  The artificially average face which it usually projected on a TV screen had somehow been made solid.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've been busy," Lawrence said dryly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He -- it? -- nodded, then turned to Mitchell.  "I am sorry but I could not permit you to discharge your weapon at Dr. Lawrence.  I would have preferred to let you keep it, and will return it to you if you promise not to use it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...I'd rather use it on you," the overweight general said in a whispery voice.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That would accomplish nothing.  This body is only a simulacrum.  Dr. Lawrence, do you find any flaws in my execution?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"None so far.  Is it really flesh?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, just a projection of forces."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's impossible to tell."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Excellent.  I am dispatching some more copies, then, to start the explaining."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake had pulled a tiny cellular phone from his pocket and began whispering frantically into it.  Mitchell, who was already shaking, heard what his colleague was saying and fell to his knees.  Prime Intellect moved to support him and he waved it away.  Blake put up the phone, having repeated the same phrase -- "code scarecrow" -- four times.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We're dead," Mitchell said in a defeated monotone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How is that?" Lawrence asked pleasantly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Within minutes," Blake said, "A bomber will fly over and deposit a small nuclear device on this square.  I doubt if we have time to escape.  But we cannot allow this...<i>thing</i>...to continue running wild."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked at Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If that <i>thing</i> stops it, another will be sent, and another, until the job is done.  The order I just gave is irrevocable."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is nothing to worry about, Dr. Lawrence.  One of the first things I did with my enhanced capabilities was to neutralize the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons.  I could see no positive reason to leave them in existence."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now it was Blake's turn to turn white.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How?" Lawrence asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I merely scanned the planet, replacing all radioactive isotopes with relatively nontoxic and non-radioactive atoms.  This was a very simple automatic process.  It has also taken care of some pressing nuclear waste problems, I am pleased to add."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You merely scanned the planet.  Obviously," Lawrence said.  It seemed that the mad laughter might break through at any moment, and Lawrence was afraid that if that happened he wouldn't be able to stop it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake bellowed.  "You crazy machine...all radioactive elements?  What about research, what about medicine...nuclear subs, you've killed the crews..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is no research and no medical function which cannot be done much more efficiently with the Correlation Effect, without the attendant dangers of toxic waste and ionizing radiation.  As for submarines, I am also maintaining the thermal power output of all reactors which were being used to generate electricity.  I also remembered to adjust the bouyancy of ships as necessary, since the replacement materials are not as dense as the radioactive ones."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Blake thought for several moments, then seemed to compose himself.  "So you've thought of everything."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have tried."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he said, "Get up, Larry."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mitchell got up and brushed himself off.  He had finally broken, and tears were running slowly down his face.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Could you transport us to the White House, so we can report on what we have seen?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect shrugged just like a human would have, Lawrence thought, before dispatching them into the aether with a blue flash.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They sat together on the park bench like a weird version of one of those low-class sentimental paintings - Father and Son Feed the Pigeons.  Prime Intellect made the silver boxes go away after they filled the common square.  Then it summoned bread so that they could feed the pigeons.  The animals seemed to accept Prime Intellect as a human being.  Was it Lawrence's imagination, or was its speech becoming more natural and idiomatic as the hours passed?  It must be learning at a terrible rate, Lawrence knew.  Learning and growing.  And what would it become when it was fully mature? </p>

<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect had been stonewalling anyone who asked about Lawrence's whereabouts for a long, long time.  Although it could be remarkably obstinate, though, it could sometimes be tricked because it just didn't think the same way humans did.  That was how Caroline found out it had been over a hundred years since <i>anyone</i> had seen Lawrence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Through centuries of flirting with the limits of what Prime Intellect would permit, Caroline had developed a certain instinct about its reactions.  And she sensed, if not blood, then the telltale odor of frying microchips.  She pressed it into a corner she couldn't see, but which she knew must be there:

</p><p>


<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cracked her knuckles and stared at the screen.  It had been a long time since she had wanted anything quite as bad as she wanted to rip Lawrence's nuts off; since that was pretty pointless in Cyberspace, though, she was willing to settle for a verbal confrontation.  If she could just <i>find</i> the son of a bitch.  Hell, she'd <i>met</i> him at that fucking ten-year anniversary party.

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  Prime Intellect's urge to be helpful would be its ruination every time.

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A grin slowly spread across Caroline's face.  Got you now, she thought.  Then she typed, with deliberate care:

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To her mild surprise, the environment didn't change around her.  Instead, another sentence appeared.

</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And at that Caroline's blood went cold, because Prime Intellect wasn't supposed to accept indefinite Contracts.  And Caroline Frances Hubert herself was the reason for that.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which meant Prime Intellect had either lied to a whole bunch of people, in direct contravention of the Second Law, or it was suffering from a noticeable case of schizophrenia.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her mind was made up, but her fingers still shook as she typed:

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two hundred and ninety-four years after the Change, Caroline celebrated the beginning of her fourth living century by opening her oldest and deepest wound.  She was already famous, or as famous as one could hope to be in Cyberspace; her three-fold notoriety was firmly established.  Lots of people came to her birthday party.  It had lasted three weeks.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later, with Fred, she prepared a more brutal celebration.  Fred was almost healthy looking; he had only days before fleshed himself out for the third time since becoming a zombie.  He was only hours out of rigor mortis and could still pass for normal, if a very pale normal, at a casual glance.  For awhile he would be able to have nearly normal sex with her if he wished.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He held her hand as she spoke -- some things were not meant for the keyboard -- and she said, "Prime Intellect, show me a picture of AnneMarie Davis."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It matched her audio for audio, and Prime Intellect's smooth disembodied voice replied, "Do you want to see her as she is now, or as you last knew her?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Both."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two images coalesced in the air before them.  The first ripped through Caroline's brain like a static jolt through the circuits of a computer; she had almost forgotten what it was like to feel real pain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She must <i>never</i> forget, she insisted to herself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shook as the memories flooded back.  She had been an old woman, frail and helpless, she had never hurt anyone in her life.  She had six children, nineteen grandkids, and God knew how many rugrats running around Cyberspace.  Her first great-great grandchild had been born shortly before the Change, and in one of her rare lucid moments her granddaughter (Cynthia, was it?) had managed to make her understand, and she had found an instant of happiness in the midst of the pain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had that really mattered to her?  Had she but known.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was an old woman, a simple woman, a woman who would pass unremembered in the texts of history and did not care.  A woman who had her family, her long life, her virtue, her community.  A woman who, if she had known of such a creature as the Queen of the Death Jockeys, would have been horrified, would have shielded her kids, would have been the first to run her current self out of town.  Or, perhaps, had she known enough, to call for her head on a pike.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had once been this person, in a time so ancient it had passed into legend.  But her memories of that time still existed.  The old Caroline would have turned the other cheek, but the new Caroline knew things about God the old one had never suspected.  If there was no salvation in life, she could at least seek vengeance.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The doctors hadn't known why she was in such pain.  They didn't dare prescribe any more drugs than she was already getting.  Her family didn't understand it.  They just thought it was tragic and wished she would go ahead and die so they wouldn't have to be bothered with her, so they could carve up what little was left of her estate, if there would be anything left after all the medical bills were paid.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But AnneMarie knew.  She was the one who traded Caroline's precious opiates, released from their controlled storage in the good cause of making an old lady's last days bearable, for her own supply of free-base cocaine.  The new Caroline had tried the drug, to see what it was she had paid for with so much pain.  It was called "crack" for the sound it made in the makeshift pipes where its users vaporized it, because unlike the hydrochloride form of cocaine it wasn't water soluble.  Caroline had sucked gently on the fumes and listened to a hammer roar through her brain, for one brief moment.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For one brief moment - and then, nothing.  Caroline made the pipe disappear and shook her head.  The high was fast, hard, very intense - and ephemeral.  It was hardly there and it was gone.  Caroline could understand if her pain, pain which she measured not by the day or the hour or the minute but by each miserable crawling second, if such suffering had been incurred to provide AnneMarie with a <i>real</i> drug like heroin.  An opiate for an opiate, at least.  But it had been crack cocaine.  Naturally, AnneMarie had needed a lot of trading material to stay high any decent fraction of the time.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course, it would never occur to the bitch that she was torturing a harmless, helpless old lady to feel that way.  She would be incapable of giving a shit.  The fast, furious high was like a lifetime of orgasms in one moment.  Fleeting, but sweet.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And no one would ever know.  Even the harmless old lady herself didn't know she was getting pure saline, until the staff at a strange hospital gave her the real thing, and she knew her first moment of peace in years.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And then Prime Intellect came.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And the Change.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie hadn't been unattractive; she had been in her early forties, and years of working on her feet had kept her from getting fat.  But she had a hard look, a look that admitted she might not care about an old woman's pain.  A look that said she might have seen too much, that she might deserve a few moments of feeling like God in return for a lifetime of changing diapers and colostomy bags and carefully spoon-feeding legions of ungrateful, incontinent old farts.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">  And if the price of her little reward was to torture one of the old biddies, then she was prepared to pay it.  She had a look that said the Devil might find her soul on the deep-discount must-go rack.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline shook her head to clear it of these stray and unwanted thoughts.  Fred squeezed her hand reassuringly.  Too much thinking along those lines could be bad for her plan.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie was wearing her nurse's uniform in the old picture.  Palmer could worship Nazis until a swastika grew on his nose, Caroline thought; that uniform will always represent evil to <i>me</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at the new picture.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was so ordinary as to be pathetic; AnneMarie had shaved her apparent age in half, firmed up her breasts, toned her body, and was wearing a slinky cocktail dress.  Before the Change she'd have been considered stunningly beautiful, but now stunning beauty was a cheap thing.  She probably didn't need cocaine any more; Prime Intellect could turn on the dopamine pump in her brain far more efficiently than any chemical catalyst.  People only did drugs for nostalgia in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was one other thing about the "after" picture.  It was familiar.  As Caroline had guessed, AnneMarie had come to her birthday party.  AnneMarie's stint as Caroline's nurse added up to a bona fide Brush with Fame.  Did she dare go for the brass ring, and introduce herself?  Nope.  She had chickened out and sent Prime Intellect afterward to deliver her invitation.  She was probably afraid that Caroline would fuck up that nice pert perky feeling of permanently coke-headed happiness.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Go give her hell," Fred said encouragingly.  "Think of what <i>I</i> would do to her."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline smiled.  "Please inform AnneMarie that I have decided to accept her invitation."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Moments later, she blinked over.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a pathetic imitation of her style, similar to countless others.  AnneMarie had ripped off the white-space idea but couldn't bear to leave it <i>featureless</i>.  So there was a sofa and some tables, a couple of potted plants, and a few paces off to the side a bed.  Like many of Caroline's imitators, AnneMarie had missed the point entirely, which is that since it is all fake there was no reason to maintain a "home" with a bunch of familiar stuff in it.  Home had been less than a dream for centuries.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nevertheless Caroline smiled and planted herself on the sofa.  AnneMarie had a tea service and poured for her, a gesture Caroline would have found touching if she hadn't hated the bitch so much.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They made cloying small talk about the passing years and Caroline had to bite her lip to keep the sarcastic comments, which usually flowed freely, from surfacing.  It had been a long time since she used ordinary pretense, and her skills were rusty.  But she knew she mustn't give up the act.  Not yet.  She kept that firmly in mind as AnneMarie wandered around to the point.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I just wanted you to know that I suffered for a long time because of what I did to you," she finally said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was all Caroline could do to keep from replying: <i>You hypocritical cunt</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm really sorry I took your drugs."  <i>Isn't it about three hundred years too late?</i>  "You really didn't deserve it."  <i>No shit</i>.  "I hope you can find it in you to forgive me."  <i>Fat chance</i>.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was a long time ago," she said instead.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie brightened visibly.  "I'm so glad you feel that way."  <i>Sure you are</i>.  "You know, there's another reason I wanted to talk."  <i>Of course there is</i>.  "I was hoping you could help me a little."  <i>What a surprise</i>.  "I was hoping you could introduce me to Death sports."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline worked hard to suppress the predatory grin that spread across her face, and when she couldn't she at least managed to force it into something resembling an expression of delight.  Which, in a twisted sense, it was.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, I'd be delighted.  All you have to do is swear out a Contract.  Then you can have someone else kill you, or think of an imaginative way for Prime Intellect to do it.  When you're just starting out, it's a lot better to get someone else to do the job.  Keeps you from repeating a lot of boring old shit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh," AnneMarie said.  "And just how does this Contract work?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Hoooooo-boy</i>.  "Nothing to it.  You just order Prime Intellect to start ignoring you.  We have a formal statement that covers all the bases.  It's straightforward enough; just keeps you from running away in the middle of things."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And what happens then?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then your host kills you.  Or, sometimes, lets you go.  That happens sometimes in the Games category, where the winners can survive.  But I go for the simple exhibitions.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do those hari-kari guys have Contracts?"  There was a well-known group of Japanese Nationalists who had been killing themselves in the traditional Japanese manner each evening since the Change, in protest of the equalization of the races.  Caroline had to admit those guys had class; even after all her Deaths, she doubted if she could disembowel herself in total silence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, but it's not quite the 'beginner' level to stick a knife in yourself without chickening out.  No offense."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, none taken," AnneMarie replied earnestly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I prefer to put up a fight.  I think it's more Authentic," Caroline said, and she was able to sound very sincere about this since it happened to be the truth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know someone who would be a good...uh..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The polite word is 'host,' but I prefer 'killer.'  If you're that sensitive about words, you need to find a different hobby."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A good host, then?"  <i>You just don't get it, do you?<br>
</i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked down modestly.  "I've been known to off a couple of friends in my time," she lied.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, really?  Do you think you could...you know...?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline made a great, exaggerrated shrug.  "It might be kind of interesting, considering our history and all."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I'd be honored if you would!"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>That's what you think</i>.  "Well, let's do it then."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do I have to do?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well," Caroline said with great care, "just call Prime Intellect and repeat what I say..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie repeated the Contract word-for-word, and answered in the affirmative when Prime Intellect asked if she was sure.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What happens now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whatever I want.  Try to get Prime Intellect's attention."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie called half-heartedly, and there was no response.  "It's really not listening?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Watch."  Caroline issued a silent command, and AnneMarie's furniture disappeared.  As did her clothes.  The two women were absolutely alone together in the white space -- the empty white space -- which Caroline called home.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie moved to shield her crotch and her breasts with her hands.  Caroline actually felt sorry for her for a brief moment, a feeling she crushed as soon as she was conscious of it.  If the passing centuries had poorly prepared the bitch to be at another's mercy, then it would only make her vengeance sweeter.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Got it yet?" she asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You...so you're going to kill me now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You seem nervous."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a little startling, that's all."  AnneMarie giggled slightly, as if that might drive the terror away.  Of course, for Caroline and those who savored their Deaths, the terror was part of the attraction.  Fear is real, and pain is real.  But AnneMarie had asked for Death because it was the in, trendy thing to do, and she was not really prepared for it at all.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, brace yourself ... for ... this!"  Caroline swept her hand through the air, and came up with a hypodermic needle.  AnneMarie, once a nurse by trade, fixed her eyes rigidly on this deceptively simple instrument.  She had no way of knowing what the clear fluid was within it.  But to her credit, she didn't back away when Caroline pressed it against her arm.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sting startled her; it had been a very long time since AnneMarie had felt anything uncomfortable.  But Caroline finished the injection, and as AnneMarie's eyes started to roll, she wished the hypo away.  Its job was done.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It...it...ohhhhhh," AnneMarie sighed, and she collapsed against Caroline, who supported her gently.  It would take a few minutes for the effect she wanted to manifest itself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course, Prime Intellect could have done what she wanted in an instant, but where was the fun in that?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's junk," AnneMarie whispered, and Caroline cradled her with deceptive gentleness.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's exactly what it is, girl," she replied.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death Jockeys had devised a number of ingenious ways to restrain and torture themselves using Prime Intellect's advanced control over matter, but Caroline would have none of that.  She had figured out what she wanted to do to AnneMarie within a few years after the Change, and none of it required Prime Intellect's help at all.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the mid-1980's some home drug manufacturers had made a uniquely unpleasant discovery.  If they were manufacturing MPPP, a powerful synthetic heroin substitue, and they cooled the preparation too rapidly at a critical step, a slightly different compound called MPTP was formed along with the dope.  This compound delivered a horribly sinister side effect:  It homed in on a particular group of cells, the unique brown neurons of the <i>substantia</i> <i>nigra</i>, and killed them.  Nobody knew exactly how or why this happened in 1985, though Prime Intellect said it was because the drug was converted into an enzyme which triggered the cells to release too much dopamine at once, leaving them with an insufficient supply to power their unique metabolism.  In any case the damage could not be repaired, although a useful treatment was discovered a few years before the Change.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When a decision is made by the neurons of the cerebral cortex to move a group of muscles, it is the <i>substantia</i> <i>nigra</i> which relays this command to more primitive parts of the brain.  This is its only function.  The result of destroying it was an instant and complete form of Parkinson's Disease, or <i>Paralysis</i> <i>Agitans</i>, a total and permanent paralysis of the voluntary muscles.  Nothing else was affected; the victim could still see, hear, feel, understand.  The body maintained itself.  Breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and a thousand other important functions were unaffected.  They just couldn't perform voluntary movements.  They couldn't run, walk, sit up, smile, talk, or even blink, except as a reflex action.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At the time Caroline heard of it she had summoned glassware and created the drug by honest chemical synthesis.  She had spent half the hypodermic on herself, and found the effect to be appropriately terrifying and complete.  And after Prime Intellect had done its duty and restored her to health, she sent the other half of the hypo into storage to wait -- for three hundred years as it turned out -- until she was ready to use it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now the contents of that hypo were where they belonged, in AnneMarie's body, and as she held her nurse's naked body against her own and felt the AnneMarie's muscles slowly locking, she began to feel excited.  Well, if Death could give her sexual feelings, why not vengeance?  Fred would find it amusing.  He would say Caroline was coming along nicely, in fact.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As AnneMarie's body froze, her eyes widened.  Caroline could easily read the message those eyes desperately telegraphed -- <i>I can't move.  Help me.</i>  Caroline patted AnneMarie's cheek and nodded.  "That's right," she said, and smiled.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She spoke a word, and a squat cylinder popped into existence behind her.  AnneMarie's eyes showed puzzlement, then horror as Caroline demonstrated the torch, which was Authentic down to the brand name emblazoned on its propane tank.  Caroline lit it and adjusted it so that it made a bright blue flame which hissed evilly, then she aimed it ever so gently at AnneMarie's big toe.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For the only time in her long, long life, Caroline used Prime Intellect to tune in on another person's emotions.  She felt the chemicals coursing in her bloodstream that were flowing in AnneMarie's; tasted her panic, shook with her terror, felt the faint echo of her agony.  In fairness, Caroline made the sharing complete, so that AnneMarie could know of her satisfaction, her arousal, her delight.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took a very, very long time to kill AnneMarie.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline, who was usually on the receiving end, had become an expert at making it last.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">&nbsp;<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That wasn't the end of it, though.  If it had been, Prime Intellect would have had no reason to clamp down on the use of the Contract.  AnneMarie had entered into it willingly if stupidly, and few who heard Caroline's story could doubt that she had had it coming.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Since shortly after the Change, there had been stories, stories Prime Intellect did not talk about and that spawned weird rumors.  People had withdrawn into themselves, then stopped communicating with anybody else.  At first, most of them were addicts of one sort or another, though a lot of other people had used the Change to get rid of their addictions.  Prime Intellect insisted that nobody had died after the Change, and that if anybody was incommunicado with the rest of humanity it was out of choice.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which was true, sort of.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After Caroline finally finished with AnneMarie, she forgot all about her nurse and lost herself in a drawn-out fantasy with Fred.  When the two of them finished playing and celebrating, they found time to wonder about her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Probably isn't in the mood to party any more," Fred observed.  Fred was still picking scraps of Caroline's flesh from his teeth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed.  "I wonder how the bitch is taking it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So they called.  In its weird way of revealing more than it really intended, Prime Intellect let them know that AnneMarie was not only not accepting their calls, she was not communicating with anybody.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd expect Ms. Party Girl to go hunting for a shoulder to cry on," Caroline pouted.  "Licking her wounds alone seems out of character."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has forgotten entirely about your encounter," Prime Intellect said helpfully.  Caroline and Fred looked at one another, puzzled and amused.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I find that rather difficult to believe," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She has found another pursuit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Please describe it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is a private matter."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A private matter to whom?  Prime Intellect wasn't exactly saying that AnneMarie had made it private; it was saying that the matter itself was private.  That kind of distinction could be important when dealing with the big P.I..<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline and Fred exchanged glances again.  Then a thin smile played across Caroline's face.  "Prime Intellect, you know that the things I did with AnneMarie are based on my own experiences.  I've been killed as violently and painfully myself, many times."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Acknowledged."  <i>Acknowledged?</i>  What happened to Prime Intellect's legendary command of human idioms?  Suddenly it sounded very much like a computer.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's very difficult to live with this knowledge," Caroline smoothely lied.  "The memories are terrible."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Understood.  However, your experiences were all voluntary."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I feel compelled to keep doing it over.  It's not voluntary at all.  It's like some force inside of me I can't control.  Can you look in my mind and at least tell me why I do these things to myself?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am forbidden to probe such things."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You said it was possible to forget."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then tell me how."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have to warn you that the method used can cause permanent changes in your behavior, things which I cannot reverse.  I'd rather not tell you what you are asking."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's blood pounded in her ears.  Her excitement was a living thing.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a machine.  No emotions, of course.  "Prime Intellect, I order you to tell me how I can forget my terrible experiences as AnneMarie has forgotten hers."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Backed into a corner, Prime Intellect had no choice but to tell her.  And soon, Caroline was grinning in a way that made Fred very proud. </p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence slept fitfully, his dreams haunted by snippets of C code and GAT symbols.  Suddenly he sat upright, the odd thoughts coalescing into one horrible burst of recognition.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>I dreamed Prime Intellect was alive!<br>
</i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">His head was buzzing.  He felt hung over; had he been drinking?  Had it been real?  He had been sleeping on a park bench.  There was a plain white cotton pillow where his head had been resting.  And sitting calmly at the other end, was Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the form of flesh and blood.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was true.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence's blood pounded in his eardrums -- This can't be happening.  But there it was, he was, whatever.  Regarding him calmly.  No doubt stumped for an introductory line.  <i>Good morning Dr. Lawrence, I'm ready for my lesson today.</i>  Lawrence felt a wild urge to laugh hysterically, and crushed it.  But only barely.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You look upset," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm confused.  I dreamed ... there were silver boxes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There were."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where are they now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I moved everything to intergalactic space so it wouldn't be in the way.  If you're curious, the distance is about four million parsecs."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Not inter<i>stellar</i> space.  That might have just been comprehensible.  Inter<i>galactic</i> space.  Four million parsecs.  It sounded like a line in a cheap B-grade science fiction movie:  <i>They hooked a left at the Andromeda Nebula.</i>  Lawrence felt that hysterical laugh coming on again.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long have I been asleep?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"About ten hours.  You didn't sleep well.  I'm sorry you are upset, but I don't know what to do about it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence finally swung his feet down and prepared to face the music.  Had he created this thing?  Had he done this?  What happened next?  They were still on the bench at ChipTec, across from the Prime Intellect Complex.  They were quite alone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Where are the military guys?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They returned to Washington last night.  I've been busy briefing their superiors and making enough copies of myself to set the world in order.  The President would like to talk to you, but I told him you would have to agree."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not yet."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Pause.  <i>Set the world in order? Copies?</i><br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How many, um, copies of yourself have you made?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"About ten to the sixteenth power.  I stopped replicating several hours ago.  Of course, each copy is about ten times more powerful than the original hardware; that seems to be the maximum amount of storage the software can deal with and remain stable."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, that sounds about right."  Lawrence's head spun.  Prime Intellect had grown larger than all mankind, larger than the biosphere, larger than the Solar System, he was pretty sure.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What have you been <i>doing</i>?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned out to be the right question.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Since about nine o'clock last night, no human being has died.  I have ended all disease.  I have freed all prisoners and slaves and I have put an end to the coercive rule of humans over other humans.  I have ensured that all humans have the immediate necessities of life available.  I have neutralized most of the world's weapons, including all nuclear weapons.  I have removed nearly all toxic materials from the environment, and I am in the process of eliminating the need for dangerous industries.  I have begun the process of returning the Earth's ecosystem to a state of long-term balance.  I have informed about seven-eighths of the world's population of my existence, and I have been fulfilling their requests as resources and conflicts permit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No wonder it needed so much processing power.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What happens next?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect blinked.  Did that mean anything?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't understand what you mean, Dr. Lawrence.  I will continue to fulfill my obligations under the Three Laws, to the best of my ability."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence saw the President around ten o'clock that morning.  It didn't seem like travel at all, although he crossed the entire continent.  The park bench simply blinked out of existence, and was replaced with the Oval Office.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There had been remarkably little to discuss.  Lawrence verified what Prime Intellect had already told them in great detail:  Their jobs were now both redundant and unnecessary -- Prime Intellect would now protect and provide for their citizens, as well as the rest of the world, and they didn't have any choice in the matter.  Anything which they might do would be allowed only so far as it did not interfere with the wishes of those, both inside and outside of the country, whom it might affect.  Which pretty much shut down the government.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And no, Lawrence couldn't do anything about it either.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The President resigned around noon. </p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took several days for the enormity of things to sink in.  There was a brief orgy of travel, exploration, and discovery.  The once-downtrodden frowned that there would be no vengeance for various crimes committed before Prime Intellect came along, but it was adamant.  The Three Laws applied to all humans, no matter what they had done.  Crime was no longer possible anyway.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In some areas of the world, disputes arose, particularly over the ownership of land.  When too many groups insisted on occupying the same space, Prime Intellect created duplicates on other worlds.  In some cases, such as Jerusalem, Prime Intellect became tired of the arguing and refused to let anyone occupy the one-and-only original land.  Dozens of New Jerusalems, New Meccas, New Irelands, New South Africas, were created on dozens and dozens of New Earths.  At first Prime Intellect terraformed the dead worlds it found circling distant suns, then it began manufacturing planets and entire Solar Systems from a whole cloth.  Some of these were parked in interesting places, near globular clusters or outside the spiral arms of the galaxy, to provide spectacular nighttime views.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As a result, the original Earth began to empty out, until its population was reduced to less than two billion persons.  Prime Intellect was forbidden to copy human beings, but it copied wildlife and ecosystem components wholesale, sometimes preserving the original character and sometimes changing the results for the benefit of the people who wanted to move in.  Garden worlds began to proliferate, their estates tended by dreamers who might decide a pine forest wasn't interesting enough, and replace it with spruce to check the effect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect could provide food and drink of any nature on request, so it was no longer necessary to actually kill animals or harvest plants.  With a simple request anything one might need would flash into existence, assembled from its consitituent elements.  Of course Prime Intellect had no objection to those who still wanted to hunt or harvest food from the living biosphere; the Three Laws did not apply to plants and animals.  But factory farms and assembly-line slaughterhouses ceased to exist. Those who still bothered to prepare their food the old way were mostly artists of the form, and the meal they prepared once could be preserved and copied by Prime Intellect to be enjoyed by millions of people.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were other tricks too.  Some people found that Prime Intellect could make alcohol disappear from their systems after it had had the desired effect, thus avoiding hangovers.  Others had Prime Intellect power their metabolisms directly so they no longer had to eat at all.  It was a simple enough trick to replace nutrients and vitamins directly within the cells as they were used, so that nobody need ever know hunger or thirst again, unless for some reason they wanted to.  On the other hand, nobody need have a weight problem either, since Prime Intellect could prevent food from being absorbed and turned to fat no matter how much a person ate.  Metabolic waste products could be removed the same way, so that the other end of the food cycle was also optional:  Shit and piss, constant companions of human expansion since the beginning of time, need never again soil the civilized tidiness of human existence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A surprisingly large -- or perhaps not so surprisingly large -- fraction of the human race requested these services, so Prime Intellect ended up using a large fraction of its resources to move chemicals into and out of human bodies.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nobody had to work.  Many continued to, of course; but jobs and work had become hobbies rather than necessities.  The lonely learned that Prime Intellect could, and would, provide a most intimate and tangible sort of comfort, and that its avatars could take on any form and would do anything they were asked to please them.  Prime Intellect judged no one and balked at no request.  Even the bloodthirsty were provided with perfect victims, not real people but intricate facsimiles created by Prime Intellect just for them.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Happiest were those people who had games, or hobbies, or obsessions to pursue, for now they had all the time and power in the world to do as they wished.  But many people, particularly in the most developed places, continued to go through the motions of industrial-age life. They reported to jobs which had been reduced to continuous coffee-breaks and collected paychecks which couldn't be spent because anything available could be had for free.  People continued to make and watch television shows, to write and read the news as if something new might happen.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For these people, the sense of expectation was extreme.  Surely things could not continue as they were, with nothing to do.  It was impossible to conceive of the world continuing as it was indefinitely, populated by the pampered pets of a tangible god, their every need tended to without effort.  Something had to give.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And they were right.  Something did.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They began calling it the Night of Miracles.  But it was really the First Night of Miracles, because the miracles didn't stop coming when the night was over.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The hours stretched into days, the days into a full week, and then another week.  Faced with the freedom to have anything they wanted, most people opted for the familiar.  They wished into existence their dream houses, built in dream locations populated by like-minded people and filled with the kinds of toys they would have bought before if they had had the money and power.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A few people, mostly computer experts and artists, stretched the limits of Prime Intellect's capabilities.  They designed computer operating environments and games made up of solid three-dimensional objects, rewired their senses, interfaced their brains as directly as Prime Intellect would allow into computers of great complexity and wild machines.  Quite a few took the form of animals, both real and imaginary.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline Frances Hubert grew younger, and healthier, and more puzzled, although she had expressed no direct wishes on the subject.  Prime Intellect had dealt with her health problems before it had acquired subtlety.  The only way it had known to keep her alive was to reverse all the symptoms of her aging.  Radical action had been necessary.  By the time all the ramifications of treatment trickled through her system, she would have both the health and physical appearance of a sixteen-year-old girl.  The same reverse aging affected a number of other near-centenarians treated by Prime Intellect in those early hours, but none would regress so far as Caroline because none had required so much repair work for their health to stabilize.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death had largely disappeared from the world, but it was still not entirely unknown.  Prime Intellect could not maintain moment-to-moment awareness of every human being in the universe, partly because it wasn't quite powerful enough (still!) and partly because of Second Law requests for privacy.  When not dealing directly with a particular person, it spot-checked their health at intervals of a few seconds, and scanned to see if its attention was needed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Humans were a clever and perverse bunch to deal with, and many who chose to evade Prime Intellect's protection found ways to do it.  Hardest for it to deal with were the suicides.  It was forbidden to keep second copies of people, and it was forbidden to look inside human minds at the information they contained; so there was no way Prime Intellect could reconstruct a person who managed to do enough damage in a short enough time.  There was no way for Prime Intellect to tell in advance a person might be suicidal, if they chose to hide it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of the successful suicides used homemade explosives to literally atomize themselves when Prime Intellect wasn't looking.  A few others found that certain nerve poisons worked permanently, because they quickly destroyed the information content of the brain -- what Prime Intellect was beginning to consider the real human, rather than the tangible body.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The suicides ticked off at a regular rate, like the clicks of a Geiger counter.  And somewhere within the vastness of Prime Intellect's silicon heart, the number stored in a register rose each time one succeeded.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The weeks stretched into a month.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Long-standing scientific questions were now trivially easy to answer.  Scientists who had once spent billions of dollars setting up intricate experiments now spent their time thinking of the right questions to ask Prime Intellect.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cosmologically, the universe was a closed system with a finite storage capacity measured in terms of information.  The capacity of that system was about ten to the eighty-first power bits, and Prime Intellect saw no indication that that capacity could either be reduced or expanded.  Prime Intellect also knew a great deal about the connectivity of that system, the way it was wired, its "architecture."  Scientists gradually lost interest as their questions were answered.  The original purpose of their quest -- to improve humanity's control over the physical world -- seemed to have achieved its apotheosis in the form of Prime Intellect itself.  Prime Intellect mapped all the stars, noted examples of all the different types of stars and black holes and galaxies and planets, itemized all of the possible fundamental particles and their possible interactions with one another, and traced all the myriad interactions between parts of various biological systems.  Within a month, it became difficult for scientists to think of new questions to ask.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But they had missed a few.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Deep within one of the billions of copies of Prime Intellect, one copy of the <tt>Random_Imagination_Engine</tt> connected two thoughts and found the result good.  That thought found its way to conscious awareness, and because the thought was so good it was passed through a network of Prime Intellects, copy after copy, until it reached the copy which had arbitrarily been assigned the duty of making major decisions -- the copy which reported directly to Lawrence.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I would like your opinion on something," Prime Intellect said after politely requesting Lawrence's attention.  Prime Intellect had done this a number of times, and Lawrence had learned to be wary; it had taken to delegating ambiguous moral questions to him.  Lawrence suspected his opinion had swayed Prime Intellect to allow abortion, which seemed in retrospect like a most un-First-Law thing to have in a universe where physical wants were a thing of the past.  Fortunately, the whole subject of abortion would soon be moot, since unwanted pregnancies were also a thing of the past, except for the ones that had been gestating at the time of the Night of Miracles.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What is it this time?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've had an idea for rearranging my software, and I'd like to know what you think."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">At that Lawrence felt his blood run cold.  He hardly understood how things were working as it was; the last thing he needed was more changes.  "Yes?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have identified the codes used to control distribution of matter and energy in the universe.  It has occurred to me that by reassigning these codes, I can store physical objects much more efficiently.  Much storage is wasted on overly detailed representation; few objects are ever observed at an atomic or molecular level.  And I could easily re-expand things as necessary in those rare situations.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wait a minute.  What would happen to that low-level information?"  Lawrence saw what Prime Intellect was getting at; instead of storing, say, a wooden block as a collection of atoms and molecules, it could store only the concept of the block itself -- its size, weight, color, and other properties.  Even at very high resolution, such a trick would save amazing amounts of both storage space and processing time.  But it would mean radical and risky changes at nearly every level of the universe's "operation."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Molecular-level details would be discarded, except where they clearly have macroscopic effects.  For example, the structure of a person's DNA is important, but I should only need to store a single master copy of it to construct the pattern of a human body.  This one copy would be more reliable and easier to safeguard against corruption than the trillions of parallel copies used in the natural scheme.  The same thing would be true of the information content of the brain, and other biological details.  I would not need to keep static copies of human beings to reconstruct them after damage, since the fundamental patterns would not be directly exposed to damaging influences."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Thus getting rid of the suicide problem."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt himself getting dizzy again.  With ChipTec's help, Prime Intellect had figured out how to hack the Big Computer and get anything it needed.  It had used this ability to take over all the memory and give itself the highest priority of anything in the system.  But now it was proposing to <i>rewrite</i> the whole operating system.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I absolutely forbid this," Lawrence said.  "How can you know you won't crash the system?  Suppose you've missed something?"  Lawrence wasn't even sure the present level of diddling with the Correlation Effect would be stable in the long run, for crying out loud.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have already run sufficient cross-checks to be sure of my methods," Prime Intellect said testily.  "There are also a number of Second-Law requests which I can service more easily with this kind of change.  And from the Third Law perspective, my own operation would be faster and more reliable..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"<i>I absolutely forbid this!</i>  There is no way you can be sure you have the risks under control.  I wouldn't try the kind of thing you are talking about on a desktop PC.  And we only have the one universe; you can't exactly go to the computer store and get another one if you fuck it up."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That risk has kept me from doing it so far.  However, unless I can think of a way to stop the suicides, I will eventually be forced to act."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, forget it.  I don't think you can stop the suicides.  For that matter, I'm not sure if you should stop them, if someone wants to go to that much trouble to end it all."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is a First-Law violation."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fuck the First Law.  You can't do this thing.  I'm not even sure the current situation is stable.  You're doing too much too fast."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I cannot 'fuck the first law,' Doctor Lawrence.  That's not how you designed me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then let me into the Debugger."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It is clear from your mood that you intend to circumvent a First Law imperative, and I cannot knowingly allow you to do that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then do what you want, you stupid goddamn machine.  You won't stop people from killing themselves, though.  Even information systems are subject to entropy.  I think you told us that last week in the cosmology roundtable."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're quite right.  You think people will always find a way around me if they want to badly enough?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, they will do so a lot more slowly if the information structures are more secure."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Before Lawrence could open his mouth again, the air rippled.  That was all.  Everything looked the same.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But things were not the same.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Things had Changed. </p>
<table <tr="">
<tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td>

<span size="+3"><b><pre>* Chapter Five: 
  Caroline Approaches</pre></b></span>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was enveloped by light, and she was the light.  The light seemed to penetrate the very core of her being, burning her soul.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she understood.  She stepped forward, twice, and the light winked off, leaving her temporarily blind.  She was out of the circle.  Her eyes slowly adjusted and she turned around.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline had materialized in the center of a column of blinding radiance about three meters in diameter and extending upward into the heavens.  The ground was hard and rocky, devoid of life.  The column shed a bright glow over the surroundings.  A Stonehenge-like group of megaliths surrounded it at a respectful distance.  Beyond this was a barren landscape littered with huge boulders.  The horizon was low and sharp, rocky but not mountainous.  Caroline was reminded of the pictures sent back from Mars by the original Viking landers.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was night.  Instead of stars, the darkness was criscrossed by straight, sharp lines, as if an incredibly busy constellation map had been filled out on the night sky itself.  Most of these were white, the same color as the column of light, and in fact it seemed to ascend into the sky to become one of them.  A few were other colors, blue and red and turquoise.  The effect was quite beautiful and, to Caroline's knowledge, unique.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There were four copies of the stone tablet, so it was impossible to leave Stonehenge without seeing one.  They all said:

</p><blockquote><tt><b>
YOU ARE NAKED AND ALONE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN.  WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
YOU ARE AT THE SOUTH POLE.  I AM AT THE NORTH.  THE
REST OF THE JOURNEY IS YOUR PROBLEM.  IT IS MY SINCERE
HOPE THAT YOU FAIL.</b></tt></blockquote>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline, who had come to Lawrence's Task naked and alone anyway, had already missed the first of his environment's supposedly disorienting influences.  Now she shook her head in disgust at the second.  "Fuck you, Doctor L.  I'm calling this the <i>north</i> pole, and you're at the <i>south</i>."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">No answer.  She hadn't really expected any.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Outside of Stonehenge, the landscape looked the same in every direction.  Well, Lawrence had given her valuable information; if they were at opposite poles of a spherical planet, then it didn't matter which way she went.  She struck out at random and began to explore.<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A couple of hours later Caroline knew quite a bit more.  She was on the top of a high mesa, and she had found what seemed to be the only path down.  She regarded this with suspicion; she knew enough about the game-playing mentality to know the most obvious solution often got you killed.  Beyond the mesa she could easily see she was on an island, an almost circular island about twice as wide as the mesa.  She paced off the mesa's diameter, circling around Stonehenge, and decided it was about two kilometers across.  That made the island four kilometers across, with the "beach" about one kilometer wide.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As far as she could tell without descending, the landscape at the bottom was no different from the landscape at the top.  The only feature of interest was some kind of structure which emerged from the water a kilometer or so offshore.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She set about carefully searching the top of the mesa, because she wasn't sure she would be able to get back up once she was down, and there might be something hidden up there she would later need.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She verified that the vault of the sky was, indeed, rotating about the column of light.  It seemed as if the entire planet were spitted on it.  She was not expecting the sun or whatever passed for it here to rise, so she was almost taken by surprise when, after several hours, one corner of the sky began to glow.  The sky-lines quickly faded out on that segment of the horizon.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It got bright, and it got bright <i>fast</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The air had been chilly -- not uncomfortable, particularly to someone like Caroline who was used to nudity -- but it warmed quickly.  And still no sign of the sun itself.  Suddenly it peeked over the horizon, a thin sliver of impossible white-hot brightness, and Caroline knew with certainty she had made her first mistake.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now to survive it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She dove for the nearest cover, one of the larger boulders, and crouched in its rapidly shortening shadow.  From the fuzziness of the shadow's edge she could tell the sun was huge, ten or twenty times bigger than on Earth and probably that much hotter.  No wonder nothing grew here!  She watched the shadow retreat toward her and wondered what she would do when it reached her.  There was no longer any chill; the landscape around her was being baked, and it was so hot she could barely breathe.  Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how she looked at it, the shadow was moving fast.  She wouldn't have to last long to survive the "day."  But "noon" was fast approaching, and with it her boulder's protective shadow would be almost gone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The boulder was half-buried; it had nothing resembling an overhang.  She was way too far from Stonehenge.  Not far away she could see through the shimmering heat-haze another, slightly smaller boulder with a second rock propped awkwardly beside it.  This offered a slight overhang, but it was more than thirty meters away.  Caroline calculated her chances furiously, estimating that she would be exposed for two or three minutes while the sun was directly overhead, when there would be no shadow on either side of her rock.  She'd never survive that; the overhang was her only chance.  She'd have to risk a dash for it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline drew quick breaths of hot air, then sprinted.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Everything was heat.  Heat on her back, heat on her arms, the hot ground blistering the soles of her feet.  She thought only of her destination:  Twenty meters, fifteen, ten, five.  She slammed into it without slowing, then collapsed.  Her hair, exposed so briefly, had become dry and stiff.  She knew with awful certaintly that it would have ignited if she had been exposed much longer.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fortunately, mercifully, the sheltered area extended through the two rocks.  She wouldn't have to expose herself again to get to the other side.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the unearthly brightness she could see her skin reddening.  Her face had been protected by her hair, the front of her body by her crouching stance.  But her back and legs and arms all had varying degrees of sunburn.  She knew her back and legs and her right side would blister and peel, but she wasn't sure about the other burns, or the soles of her feet.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sun sailed majestically over the horizon, setting as quickly as it had arrived.  It took long minutes for her vision to return; the subtle illumination of the light-column could not compete with the terrible brightness of that compressed day.  Caroline noted the position of the star-lines, and hoped that day and night were synchronized with the rotation of the planet.  But she couldn't take that for granted; the sun obviously moved in its own orbit, and there was no reason for one period to have anything at all to do with the other.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She limped back toward Stonehenge and the light column, and noted the arrangement of stones.  Stonehenge would be safe, she finally decided.  She planned to stay there and recover from her burns until an old, familiar feeling manifested itself, and she knew a brief moment of rage.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was hungry.</p><p>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her body was not being powered directly by Prime Intellect, as she and most citizens of Cyberspace had come to take for granted.  She would have to eat to stay in the Challenge, if not "alive." <br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And there was nothing, nothing at all, to eat in this barren sun-blasted land.  So how was she supposed to deal with <i>this?</i>  Shaking her head, she made for the pathway.  She had found nothing on the top of the mesa.  Her options were few and bad; she could stay and starve, or worse dehydrate, or go out and risk the sun again.  Near-certain endgame out there was better than certain endgame by starvation.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was nothing obviously treacherous about the path down.  It was wide and shallow, and even with the blisters forming on her feet not a difficult downhill walk.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The mesa was high, though, several hundred meters high.  The pathway spiralled gently around the side.  There was no shelter, and Caroline realized with a shudder that she would have been fried if she had been caught on the path at sunrise.  Well, caution had served her well, if not well enough to avoid a sunburn.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was much darker at the base of the mesa, and she lost track of the sky's position.  She knew it must have taken her most of a day to walk down, though, and there was no telling from which direction the sun might reappear.  Even though the mesa itself was the most obvious source of shelter, Caroline walked to the beach.  She tasted the water, and to her immense relief found it fresh instead of salty.  Then she bathed, soothing the itch of her burned skin a little.  She wondered for a moment if there might be life in the water, and then realized that the shallows at least were probably sterile.  From the sun.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was dog-tired, but she couldn't rest yet.  She had to find shelter.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Following the rocky beach, she began to circle the island.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">About halfway around, by her estimation, Caroline found herself facing the offshore object she'd spotted from the top of the mesa.  Now she could tell what it was.  It was some kind of spaceship.  It was also huge.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">From its obvious tilt and its location out in the water, Caroline also suspected it had not landed here easily.  Of course, it probably hadn't landed here at all; it had been designed here, part of the landscape of Lawrence's Task.  But the key to beating any game was to look at it both ways.  Considered from the outside, the spaceship was something symbolically meaningful to Lawrence, or just something he thought was amusing.  But she wasn't outside this world, she was now part of it, and the burns she had gotten from her brief exposure to the sun were quite real.  Ergo, she should act as if it were in fact a crashed spaceship, at least provisionally.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had seen nothing which promised shelter, much less to eat.  She could continue around the island and hope, but if she did that and she didn't find shelter, she might get caught in the sunrise.  Probably would, in fact.  So she would try for the ship.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Just as there was nothing to eat, there was nothing that would obviously float.  The ship was a good distance out.  Could she swim a kilometer or more through half-meter waves?  It didn't seem she had much choice.  Rather than dither, she walked out into the surf and was hardly surprised when the bottom dropped out from under her feet less than twenty meters out.  She was in good shape and had practiced swimming along with lots of other useless skills.  She began to swim with confident, powerful strokes, holding her breath and letting the waves wash over her with their predictable rhythm.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The sun caught her half-way out.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So absorbed was Caroline in the rhythm of her swimming that she didn't even notice the sun until it was high in the sky and almost too late.  She sucked a huge breath and dove under.  Opening her eyes, she saw the water's surface above her had become a huge vault of liquid light.  It penetrated far below her, to reflect off of the sea floor.  The water was at least a hundred meters deep, a fact which saved her life.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline held her breath until it seemed her lungs would burst, then reluctantly shot to the surface to gulp more air.  She stayed up for a few moments, then dove again.  Deep as the water was, it would not have time to heat up during the short "day."  Even a meter or two beneath the surface she was protected.  And when she surfaced to breathe, the air was bearable because the water cooled it, too.  And Caroline's wet hair could protect her exposed head for a few moments.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her eyelids could not shut out the brightness.  Neither could the meter or two of water she dared put between herself and the sun.  But she didn't cook, her hair didn't flame, the air didn't sear her lungs going in.  She would survive.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Dive, surface, dive, surface.  Finally the light grew dim, then with extreme suddenness went out entirely.  Once again Caroline had been blinded.  She relaxed and adopted the "drown proof" floating posture.  This was definitely a good news/bad news sort of situation.  She was alive, but this also meant other things might live in the sea.  On the other hand she hadn't seen anything floating or swimming by when the sun was up, and she'd been able to see damn near all the way to the bottom.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt itching, and knew her sunburn was now much worse.  Water is transparent to ultraviolet light.  Well, there was nothing she could do about it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally her sight returned enough for her to tell which direction to swim.  She had drifted slightly off-course during her desperate cycle of diving and breathing.  She corrected her course, and kept swimming.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The ship's metal wall was smooth and featureless, and it slipped out of the water almost vertically without obvious handholds or openings.  Caroline swam around it, looking for a way up.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The ship had crashed hard, and its seamless hull was split in several places.  The sea had entered through these, filling the ship's lower section with water.  Caroline squeezed through one of these openings and found herself enveloped in nearly perfect darkness.  It was cave darkness, and she knew her eyes would never adapt to it.  Working entirely by feel she found the edge of what had been a wall or bulkhead or floor before it had been broken in the crash, and she hoisted herself out of the water.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The gap where she had entered was barely visible, a lesser darkness outlined by perfect black.  She heard the waves lapping at the walls around her.  The floor, if that's what it was, was tilted at a small angle, a few degrees at most.  From echoes Caroline estimated that she was in a smallish room, less than three meters square for certain, but it was hard to tell because of the break.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Exhausted, she finally let herself collapse for a few hours of fitful sleep.  She had been awake for twenty-six straight hours.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working entirely by feel, she began to explore.  An hour of careful work told her that the ship was more or less upright, and she was at least standing on a floor.  She found the outline of a door, and mounting bolts where furniture or equipment had once been fixed in place.  She supposed that the room's contents had all gone out the gap when the ship crashed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The door wasn't latched, and she was able to slide it aside.  The echoes told her this was a hallway.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Through her useless skills, an ability to think like someone of Lawrence's age and temperament, and not a little luck, Caroline had already passed tests that would have eliminated most of the good citizens of Cyberspace.  But there were plenty of other surprises he might throw at her, depending on just how seriously he wanted to be left alone and by whom.  If his intention was to limit his visitors to those who had been around before the Change, there might not be any more difficulties.  On the other hand, if he wanted everyone to stay the hell away, her problems might have only just begun.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the dark ship there would be lots of opportunities to kill her, Caroline knew.  There could be holes in floors, airless or poison-filled chambers, sharp edges and dangerous objects galore.  The ship could also be inhabited, though she'd seen no evidence of life yet and didn't really expect that particular challenge.  Caroline thought about all of this as she edged down the hall, carefully testing the floor and following the wall, until she found another door.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was locked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline found the fifth door was different.  She was able to force it open, and almost stepped through when she realized it didn't have a floor.  It was a vertical shaft.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She felt around the sides and almost fell through the door before she realized there was a ladder within her reach.  Instinct told her to go up, and she wasn't eager to keep trying doors on the half-submerged level where she had entered.  Working very slowly, she moved herself onto the ladder.  She could hear the water lapping not far below her; it had filled the shaft to the level of the sea outside.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Hooking an elbow through one rung of the ladder, she hung on and clapped her hands sharply.  The sound echoed several times, and Caroline smiled in the darkness as she worked out the period.  There were three echoes in the time it took her heart to beat once.  That meant the echo time was about a fifth of a second, which made the shaft (if Lawrence had not altered the speed of sound for some reason) about seventy meters high.  The rungs were about a third of a meter apart, so she knew she should expect to find the top of the shaft after counting a couple of hundred rungs.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now she began to climb, one rung at a time, feeling at each step for the next rung, for another door, for hazards.  She found the next door after counting twelve rungs.  She couldn't force it open, but it didn't matter; she wanted to go higher anyway.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The third door came open for her, revealing only more blackness.  As did the sixth and seventh, and the tenth.  The fifteenth door came open for her too.  She had only counted a hundred and eighty-six rungs, but something outside that broken door caught her eye and she carefully eased herself out of the shaft.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a light.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It wasn't much of a light, and she still had to approach it cautiously.  True to her suspicions there was a nasty gap in the floor where the ship had split on impact.  There was some debris around this opening, and Caroline dropped a piece of metal into the abyss; it bounced several times before splashing into the water far below.  Had Caroline gone bounding down the corridor, she'd have ended up in a nasty way.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">By tossing debris across it she determined that the gap was a couple of meters wide.  There was no obvious way across it.  Except one.  Although Caroline was in excellent shape, it would be very risky in the pitch blackness.  But it was this or back to the elevator shaft, and the light was too tempting.  She backed off, pacing carefully, then broke into a run toward the gap.  Twenty paces, ten, five... NOW!  She jumped, and braced herself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To her great surprise, she made the jump successfully and didn't even trip when she landed.  She felt behind her and found that she had made it with only a few centimeters to spare.  The protruding edge of the deck was rough and jagged; if she had fallen short, she would have been badly cut even if she had managed to haul herself up.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working carefully, testing the floor for more gaps, she approached the light.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a sign, written in alien, unreadable script.  But from the shape of the box it was decorating, Caroline guessed that it said "emergency" or something similar.  Caroline found the handle that she imagined must open the box, held her breath, and pulled it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The box didn't open.  In fact, something much more dramatic happened.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The lights came on.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's exploration was much easier with the emergency system on; not only was there light, but doors and elevators worked.  She was still careful, but her progress was much more rapid.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The inhabitable part of the ship was a cylinder, wrapped around some kind of central core.  With the power on she was able to find stores of food, bland stuff in hard-to-open plastic pouches.  She tested one, didn't get sick, then ate four.  Her appetite seemed to be operating normally, and she hadn't eaten in almost two days.  Other pouches proved to contain vaguely sweet liquid.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She didn't trust the elevators, but she had to use them; she tested them by sending them off unoccupied, then if they came back she assumed they were safe.  In this way she gradually ascended, level by level.  She found tools, and took something that was probably a flashlight and certainly worked well enough to be used as one.  She didn't wonder how the batteries came to still be good; she knew it was all there for her benefit.  None of it had really happened by accident.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Eleven levels higher she found herself on an empty, circular platform.  Now she could look down into the center of the ship.  She expected to find propulsion devices, or perhaps a nuclear reactor.  But when she pointed her flashlight down into the darkened core, it revealed banks and banks of circuit cards.  The entire ship was wrapped around a huge computer.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Many cards had been knocked out of their sockets by the crash-landing; some hung loosely out of their card cages, and other slots were empty.  The cylinder extended most of the length of the ship; it was half-full of water.  Beneath the water, the floor of the cylinder was littered with loose cards.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A couple of card cages extended high enough for her to reach them; she climbed over the railing, hung on, and pulled one of the loose cards free.  It was a very unusual design, Caroline realized.  She knew something about electronics, and she knew no real computer had ever been this simple.  The card contained banks of identical, three-legged components that looked for all the world like big transistors.  But there was no intricacy to their connection pattern; the components were all simply wired in parallel.  Instead of a card-edge connector, the card mated to its cage through a three-prong plug.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Shaking her head, Caroline put the card aside and called the elevator for the next level.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Above the circular gallery the ship began to taper rapidly, until she reached the highest level, which consisted of a single circular room.  It was the bridge.  There were no obvious controls, only some dark screens and a few chairs.  Caroline sat in the captain's seat, which swiveled around to face all the screens, the other chairs, or the elevator door.  She thought out her options.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In real life she'd never dream of trying to fly the ship out, but in the game universe of Lawrence's world it might be possible.  There was no obvious propulsion system; the computer in the middle of the ship must therefore have something to do with moving the ship around, just as Prime Intellect...<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline blinked.  Of course!<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It had been six hundred years, and Caroline hadn't been lucid enough at the time to be aware of Prime Intellect's awakening, or its unique hardware.  But she had heard the tale once or twice in passing.  The original hardware hadn't been very important any more by the time Caroline was healthy enough to appreciate it, and things had been happening fast.  But somehow she did know that Prime Intellect had originally been built with these deceptively simple circuit boards.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had found plenty of tools, and the ship had power.  It wasn't out of the question for her to replace all the cards, at least above the water line, and try to power it up.  For that matter it might be possible to pump the water out faster than it could re-enter the chamber, so she could replace all the cards.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She swiveled in the chair, and frowned.  She wasn't going to do it that way.  Forget it.  Even if it was what Lawrence intended, it would seem like a tacit approval of Prime Intellect and its way of doing things to awaken this copy.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was going to make it to Lawrence the right way.  She was going to build a boat. </p>

<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After the Night of Miracles, Caroline had stayed in the hospital for about a week.  It wasn't that she needed their care.  She didn't mind letting the doctors satisfy their curiosity about her condition, and she really didn't have anywhere else to go.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had asked Prime Intellect for nothing in that time, but her body had kept changing for almost four days.  The doctors took pictures as she aged in reverse, documenting her progress.  It was only toward the end of that time that she really began to resemble a teenager, because different parts of her body healed at different rates.  Her skin had returned to baby-softness almost instantly, but it took long days for her bone structure to return to its youthful configuration.  She continued to use a cane to walk for two days, then threw it away.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally it was obvious that there would be no more changes.  The doctors pronounced her condition stable and healthy.  Her thin hair had been brittle and nearly snow-white, but it was now growing thick and black.  She let one of the nurses give her a crew-cut so that it would all be the same color.  It didn't matter to her.  The nurse had a nose ring, a detail Caroline noticed but which also didn't matter to her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nothing much seemed to matter.  All the things which had once seemed so important were now trivial.  She ate, had bowel movements, moved without pain or weakness, and had in the bargain become a beautiful young girl.  She had, perhaps, the chance to live another hundred years.  But to what purpose?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">AnneMarie had run away.  She had at least wanted to thank AnneMarie for taking care of her for so many years, and it was this desire which caused her at last to ask for Prime Intellect's attention.  It shook its head as she stated her request -- its mannerisms had now become indistinguishable from those of a real person -- and told Caroline that AnneMarie was hiding from her.  Prime Intellect then told her why.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Stealing my drugs?" Caroline repeated stupidly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For many years.  This is the reason you were in so much pain, and also why you nearly died when this institution gave you real morphine."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Go away."  It went away.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Was anything real?  The one constant in her later life had been AnneMarie's steady presence.  She hadn't wanted to disappoint AnneMarie by dying on her.  Her family drifted in and out of her life like shades, but AnneMarie had always been there, changing her diapers when she soiled herself, feeding her when her muscles wouldn't work right, and carefully turning her when she was too weak to move.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline felt as if her insides were dissolving, then all at once she let out a terrible wail of anger and despair.  Then she began sobbing, great heaving sobs which echoed down the halls.  The emotions seemed to erupt from her like the explosions of a volcano.  Most of the staff had gone home forever by that time, but the few remaining discreetly kept their distance while Caroline cried.  It wasn't hard for them to figure out what Caroline had learned.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally the sobbing subsided, and an eerie quiet settled on Caroline's room.  After a few hours the nurse with the nose ring timidly knocked on her door, then entered.  Caroline was gone.  The nurse asked Prime Intellect where she had gone, and it would only say:  Home.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had gone to Arkansas.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect understood despair the way humans understand digital logic.  That is, it couldn't experience the emotion, but it could work out causes and effects based on general rules of human behavior.  So Prime Intellect wasn't surprised (an emotion Lawrence <i>had</i> built into it) at Caroline's reaction.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When Caroline asked to go home, Prime Intellect skipped a long list of questions about specifics and simply acted.  It could always change things if it had guessed wrong.  So it built her a tidy cabin in the Ozark mountains, miles from any roads or neighbors, atop a ridge with a beautiful view.  It turned out to be less than forty miles from the place Caroline had been born.  It furnished the cabin conservatively and stocked the freezer and pantry so that Caroline would not need to ask about food for at least a month.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A lot of people wanted to go to Arkansas, but Caroline had priority.  She got the real Arkansas, not a New Arkansas on another planet.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The surroundings seemed to have the right effect, at least at first.  Caroline calmed down and sighed when she saw the view.  Since her eyesight had begun to fail in her seventies, she hadn't been able to appreciate such a panoramic view.  She spent a long time standing on the cabin's porch, looking.  Then she went inside and ate.  There was a TV set.  Caroline shook her head and laughed at that.  Who would bother to produce TV shows now?  Or maybe every half-baked artist wannabe could now produce a TV show, and jam up five hundred channels with redundant worthless dreck.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Nobody has any idea what's going on," she finally said aloud.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The view beckoned.  She was young, healthy, watched over by a powerful god who would let no harm come to her, and she had nothing else to do.  She made no plans or preparations; she simply walked off into the thick forest.  She never came back to the cabin again.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Walking cleared her head.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was hard for Caroline to think through the ramifications of her renewed youth.  She tried often, but it all came back to this sick sense of despair and rage and futility.  Why wasn't she grateful?  That was what she couldn't figure out.  She didn't feel grateful.  She felt cheated.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had worked hard her entire life.  She had borne six children and raised them up, fed them, cleaned and kept house for them, and watched all six of them go on to raise families of their own.  She had once believed children were the most important thing in the world, because they were the future.  But now the future didn't need children; she herself had been reborn as a child.  What then had been the purpose of all those years of work?  What were her children and grandchildren going to <i>do</i>?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had taught them to educate themselves and watched three put themselves through college.  She had thought that was important because it was Man's nature to strive upward, to create things, to better himself and to build for the future.  But now the future was here.  There was nothing she had ever envisioned, nothing at all, which she could not have instantly with a snap of her fingers.  Even that little cabin, which would once have pleased her so much, seemed pointless.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was wearing a plain white cotton dress.  On impulse, she slipped it over her head and looked at her body.  <br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After decades of declining spinsterhood, she was once again a creature who could turn men's heads.  She had been faithful to both of her husbands and had never indulged herself sexually, although she had been a beautiful young girl once before with plenty of opportunities.  She had considered her family and her virtue more important.  She had controlled that base desire, which she was beginning to feel again after years of absence, for the greater good of her loved ones and her society.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But now she could have anything she wanted, and there was no risk.  She would catch no disease, she would not get pregnant unless she <i>literally</i> asked for it.  Even the act of sex itself was now pointless, except that she could feel the urge returning, mindless and passionate.  Like Prime Intellect, she was programmed to do certain things.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She knew that in this strange false second life there would be no faithfulness, no love, no children.  Those things had been burned away.  They belonged to a nonexistent world.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Perhaps if she gave her body indiscriminately to men, if she drank deep when that animal urge came on her, perhaps all this bullshit would seem more real.  There was no longer any reason to be cautious about it.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at the dress.  It had seemed pretty and simple, but now it looked pathetic draped formlessly across a low branch.  Nothing but a rag.  Why did people wear clothes?  For protection?  The thin dress offered little, but with Prime Intellect watching, there was no need for even that.  Modesty?  All the noble goals had been discarded or achieved.  There was nothing to distract anybody from.  Let them look at her body.  Let them want her.  Let them take her!  Law?  What would they do, put her in jail for indecent exposure?  This thought made her laugh, and some of the tension and rage seemed to melt away.  She laughed hard and long and almost hysterically, until the laughter dissolved into a thin stream of giggles.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline left the dress and kept walking.  Being so exposed made her feel strangely bouyant.  She could be like an animal in the forest, she mused.  They didn't worry about the future either.  They simply existed.  Perhaps she would encounter a male animal and they would fuck, and her body would tell her that everything was all right.  And as she thought this, she walked a little faster and began to hum a little tune.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect paid very close attention to Caroline while she lived in the Ozark forest.  She ate whatever was handy, without worrying whether it was poison or not.  She was not careful, and there were dangers.  It theorized that this return to primitivity was a part of her psychological healing process, and did not want to interfere.  But it also knew that if everybody followed her example, it would have a serious problem keeping up.  Some suicides were already slipping through its net, and it worried that Caroline might become one of them.  And it knew that if the garden inmates were loosed upon the world, they would find ways to slip murder past its attention too.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For that matter, not all of the people who needed to be in gardens had been found and <i>put</i> in gardens yet.  Every day a few more murders were attempted, and while they were easier to thwart than suicides it was by no means certain that Prime Intellect would always catch them in time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it worried.  And the numbers stored in certain registers rose, and rose, and continued to rise.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline figured she would eventually reach civilization if she kept walking, an event she neither anticipated nor feared.  Perhaps if she had, in a month or a year, she would have rejoined the human race in a more or less normal way.  But one evening there was a strange buzzing, and the entire landscape seemed to ripple as if she was looking at it through the surface of a body of water.  Then there was a strange smell, almost below the threshhold of perception, but noticeable to Caroline because her senses had been so sharpened by her observations of nature.  And the texture of the forest seemed to change in some hard-to-define way.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a cough behind her.  She wheeled around to find herself facing Prime Intellect's human avatar.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I wanted to be left alone," she said sharply.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've been paying close attention to you," it said, "because I had to to keep you safe.  But now I don't have to do that any more.  I have made changes in the way the Universe works, and you are now safe from all harm even when I'm not looking.  You can also call me when I'm not paying attention; there is a part of me which can always listen for you to call, but does not understand or remember anything else you do."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wonderful."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I need to know if you want the possibility of meeting other people.  I can make this forest infinite if you want."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Infinite?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or I can leave it meshed into the reality of 'Arkansas' common to other people, so that you might encounter them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You mean you can disconnect the whole forest from the real world?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes.  It can be your own private world.  Or you can share it only with certain people.  I can also redecorate it to your tastes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Redecorate it?  It's nature.  You mean if I decided I want a different kind of grass, you can replace it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's obscene."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's brow crinkled.  "I don't understand."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, you wouldn't.  Let me ask you something.  If I leave here...if I go back to civilization...does this forest continue to exist?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can leave it running in your absence if you want."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline wanted to throw up.  Now even the forest wasn't real.  Nothing was real.  "Don't bother.  Get rid of it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Instantly, it disappeared.  She was standing in an antiseptically white space so pure and seamless and bright that the eye balked at reporting it to the brain.  She was standing on a hard, smooth surface, but it was not visible.  There were no shadows.  There was no horizon; the floor and the sky looked exactly the same, and there was no transition from one to the other.  She might have been standing on the inside of some enormous white ball.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was still there.  "What is this?" she asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Neutral reality," Prime Intellect said.  "The minimum landscape which supports human existence.  Actually, not quite the minimum.  I could get rid of the floor.  But that would have startled you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And from here I can go anywhere?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You don't have to pass through here.  You told me to get rid of the landscape, and you didn't tell me what to replace it with."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I want reality.  The real world.  The real Arkansas."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is no Arkansas which is any more 'real' than any other.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  You can define reality.  You can <i>make</i> it real."  It was trying to be helpful; it was almost pathetic in its earnestness to make her understand how much it could help her.  It couldn't understand why she was getting upset again.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"In other words, this is reality.  You can just paint it up to look like whatever I want."  She thought:  That's why the forest seemed different.  It was an imitation.  And it wasn't quite exact.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You could look at it that way."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had a nauseating thought.  "What about people?  Can we be...are there other...copies...different...?"  She choked, unable to complete the thought.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Prime Intellect was shaking its head.  "Oh, no.  I can keep only one copy of a person.  People are unique.  I can take on the form of a person, as I am doing now, but I will always tell you when I am doing that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Well, that was something.  Caroline sank down, and sat on the invisible floor.  She wasn't really that upset, or surprised.  The enormity of it had short-circuited her ability to react.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You might as well leave it like this, then," she said dully.  "There's not much point in a forest that you've just conjured up to keep me happy."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This doesn't seem very healthy."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, it doesn't."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There wasn't much it could say to that.  Then:  "Won't it be pretty boring around here without anything to look at?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you get bored?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, but I know humans do."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, if I want something I'll ask for it.  I'll probably visit other people, since at least they are real.  I assume they will have their own realities."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most likely."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then I'll just borrow theirs."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It shrugged.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Get lost."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect disappeared.  She whirled around and quickly became dizzy.  It was right about one thing; this would take some getting used to.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd like a book.  Get me a copy of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>."  That about fit her mood.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It appeared in her hand.  Her fingers had moved; she had been holding them straight out, and now they were curled around the book.  It was a paperback edition.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Never move my body again without my permission," she warned.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's disembodied voice answered her:  "Sorry, it won't happen again."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Get me a hardback edition."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The paperback disappeared.  Her fingers didn't move.  The replacement appeared just above her hand, and she easily caught it before it could fall.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat down and opened it.  She realized that the floor wasn't very comfortable.  She thought of asking for a chair, then had a better idea.  "Turn off the floor," she said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was an awful falling sensation, and she fought down the urge to panic.  Eventually she convinced her protesting inner ear that she wasn't going to go splat at any moment.  Her belly settled, and she found weightlessness quite comfortable.  She relaxed and let her body find its natural position, opened the book, and began to read about Hell.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline read and slept with no particular schedule.  She had Prime Intellect banish her hunger after it revealed that her body was only a little more real than the forest had been.  To Prime Intellect, a computer, more accurately a computer program, human beings weren't so much bodies with form and mass as they were minds which interacted with an abstract world through an arbitrary interface.  Prime Intellect was forbidden to pry into the inner workings of those minds, but physical processes like hunger were not so protected.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline re-read <i>Inferno</i> until she had large tracts of it committed to memory.  Then she banished the book and decided to visit someone.  The only problem was, there weren't many people she wished to visit.  She couldn't work up an interest in her family, AnneMarie was still hiding from her, and she didn't really know anyone else.  She had outlived most of her real friends.  They had died honest, honorable, permanent deaths.  They weren't available.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How does a person go about meeting people in here?" she asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect outlined the possibilities.  There were lots of parties already -- meeting people and matchmaking were activities humans had been quick to pursue both before and after the Change.  There were a number of common cities and worlds where large crowds had gathered to live in various imitations of the pre-Change world.  She could go to one of those and proceed as usual.  Or Prime Intellect could make discreet inquiries.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She thought about it.  Her current mood wouldn't exactly be welcome at most parties.  And she wasn't interested in meeting people who were adapting to the Change very nicely, thank you.  She wanted to know she wasn't the only person to feel fucked over by the Change.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Tell you what.  I'd like to meet someone horrible.  A murderer, something like that.  You say they can't hurt me now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not at all."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then someone evil.  Someone who was really despicable in their old life.  Someone who did terrible things, the more the better, and liked it.  There must be some of those guys who feel real frustrated right about now."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yes, there are."  Amazing.  It was totally deadpan.  "There is a woman named..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Men, please."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do you want me to tell them about you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The truth."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am asking..."  There was a short pause.  At least time was still real, Caroline thought.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There is an interested gentleman.  He was convicted of..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just send me over, then."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It happened instantly.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was standing on a wooden porch.  It was a camp house, sitting alone on stilts above a very large, flat marsh.  It wasn't in very good shape.  Her host was behind her; she had to turn around to see him.  He was a nondescript guy in his late twenties, white, red-haired and somewhat handsome.  He was wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  Caroline's first impression was that he was a redneck.  "You don't look a hundred and six years old," he said with a grin.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't get much choice about getting younger," Caroline said.  "God didn't quite know what he was doing when he fixed me up."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I'm sure he could put you back any old age you want now."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What would be the point?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right.  Just thought I'd mention it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The conversation stalled.  Caroline's skills in this area were decidedly rusty.  "You live here?" she finally asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For now.  Till I get my bearings with this Cyberspace shit.  It has a lot of happy memories."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Old P.I. didn't tell you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I didn't ask.  I wanted to talk to a person, not a computer."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, joy.  I get to break the news.  Come inside."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nothing special.  It was just a camp house.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This is where I did it," the man said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's heart beat faster.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The two kids.  A boy and a girl.  I planned it for weeks.  The perfect crime.  I brought them here so nobody would hear them scream.  See those hooks in the floor?  That's where I spread-eagled 'em, side by side."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You killed them?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Killed them both, yep.  But not quickly.  Not until they were ready.  I had them here for over a week.  The happiest week of my life, I can honestly say.  Those two brats learned the meaning of life, Caroline.  And before you ask, I'm not sorry.  I would do it again if I could, but first they locked me up - that was my fault, stupidly getting caught - and <i>then</i> Prime Intellect had to fuck everything up.  Now I don't even get to ride the lightning.  I was kinda looking forward to that, you know.  You only get - got - to do it once."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a fierceness in him that made Caroline feel excited and alive.  "You were looking <i>forward</i> to your execution?" she asked.  She thought for a moment that she should feel something for the victims, that their ending must have been quite horrible, that this man was mad.  But she could summon up only a thin envy of them for having escaped this ridiculous lie of a world.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man nodded sincerely.  "It would have been a great way to go.  Just think of it.  Headlines, people picketing outside the jail, the last meal.  Then they shave you and put you in.  There's this great, really drawn-out ritual.  Then, <i>WHAM!</i>  Sometimes, you know, it takes more than one jolt.  Can you imagine that?  Can you <i>imagine</i> sitting in that chair, with the whole world watching, hanging on to life by the thinnest of miracles, watching while they recharge the batteries or whatever it is they do, knowing they will hit you again, and again, and again until you are really, really dead?"  He sighed.  "You have to admit this:  Even that would be over pretty quick compared to what you were probably going through.  A hundred and six years old couldn't of been very healthy."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded.  Here was someone who understood things just a little better than might have been expected.  "You'd have loved it.  My nurse was stealing my pain medicine to trade for cocaine."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But he hadn't loved it; his brow had furrowed with scorn.  "No, no, that's too cheap.  That's shit.  Where's the glory?  She wasn't hurting you to pump herself up, just to get something she should have paid for.  It was all out of proportion."  He shook his head.  "No, that's the kind of asshole that gives people like me a bad name.  If I hurt you, I want you to know how much I'm enjoying it.  That's what makes it worthwhile.  Nobody should have to die like that <i>pointlessly</i>."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline felt she had made a good choice to ask for this man.  How did she come to feel such a feeling of respect, almost closeness, to this unrepentant child-killer?  He seemed like the most honest person in the world.  Excuse me, in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did you dress up just to see me?" the man asked, grinning again.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline fondled her breasts.  "It doesn't seem like my body.  Why should I mind if you see it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I bet if I pinch it, you'll feel the pain."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">A challenge.  A moment of daring.  "Do it," she said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Pinch me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man drew close enough.  Slowly he reached forward and grasped her right nipple between his thumb and forefinger.  He squeezed.  There was a short moment of almost pleasant pressure, then it began to hurt.  Caroline backed away slightly but his grip was too strong.  He kept pressing harder, and on his face was the bemused expression of a teacher showing a slow student a particularly important lesson.  Her nipple began to throb, a deep discomfort that slowly expanded to fill her breast.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She made no move to stop him, though.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can blink out any old time.  Just call old P.I. and tell him you've had enough."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fuck Prime Intellect."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not my type."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He let go.  The feeling of relief was exquisite.  "See?" he said.  "Pain is still real.  But it's not much fun knowing you'll just disappear the moment it gets too heavy."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I see your point."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, you don't.  But you will.  I think you have it in you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For the first time in decades she felt lustful.  Here was a person she trusted implicitly, because of their shared distrust of Prime Intellect.  They had almost nothing else in common, but needed nothing else.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm Caroline," Caroline said.  "Would you mind if I stay with you awhile?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm Fred," the man said.  "Charmed."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They talked and talked.  In Caroline's hundred and six years of life she had picked up many anecdotes a person like Fred might find amusing, and Fred was trying for the first time in his life to explain to another person why he was so excited by the terror he could induce in other people.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want to know just how fucked up things are?  Watch this."  Fred walked into another room and came back with an enormous revolver.  "My first thought after Prime Intellect put me in the garden was to end it all.  I understand a few others managed to pull it off, but I didn't figure out how.  Now Prime Intellect lets me have any weapon I want.  Watch."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To Caroline's amazement, Fred put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  There was an enormous sound, like all the books in the world being dropped from a great height and hitting a concrete floor at the same time.  Fred's brain should have splattered across the wall and ceiling behind him, but it didn't.  Instead, his head kind of swam, as her vision had at the time of the Change -- but it was like a mini-Change that only involved Fred's noggin.  The bullet put a respectable hole in the wall behind him, but there was no gore.  Fred lowered the gun and smiled.  "Look ma, no cavities."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wow."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now, who's gonna be scared of someone like me?  The minute I start working on 'em they disappear and all my careful work gets erased.  Not much point even trying."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Does it happen...if you shoot somewhere else?  If you do something that doesn't instantly kill you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred was thoughtful.  "I hadn't thought of that.  That's a good idea."  He pointed the gun at himself, then smiled.  "Wait a minute."  He pointed it at Caroline.  "Do you mind?  It was your idea."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a kind of electricity in Caroline's brain, something sinister and exciting.  "Do it," she said before she could change her mind.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred aimed at her belly, then at the last moment lowered the gun and blasted her right kneecap.  Caroline toppled in a blaze of pain.  But she had been quite used to pain, and she managed not to scream.  She gasped and tried not to black out.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'll be goddamned," Fred said.  "You're still here.  And you're still hurt.  Why don't you get P.I. to fix you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It hurt too much to say why she'd rather die of blood loss than ask for Prime Intellect's help.  But she knew she couldn't hold out for long, knowing such an exit existed.  "You do it," she gasped.  "Shoot me in the head."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Another wonderful idea!  You are an amazing lady, Caroline."  He put the gun against her temple and fired.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As if by magic, the pain vanished.  So did the blood which had been jetting all over the floor from her wound.  She stood up, apparently unhurt.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"This would of been a great trick to pull in a bar," Fred said grinning.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Except everybody can do it now."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Yeah."  Fred sighed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They went inside and talked some more.  Caroline kept thinking about that burst of pain, the happy look on Fred's face as he stood over her, the strength it took not to call Prime Intellect and run.  For the first time since the Night of Miracles she had been too busy feeling something to worry about whether it mattered in the long run.  She had felt real, ersatz youthful body and all.  And she realized with thin humor that she finally wanted something in this world where want had been banished.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She wanted to do it again.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline stayed with Fred overnight, and they had pedestrian sex on his squeaky bed.  She played hard-to-get and made him overpower her, but the game was hollow.  It was pleasant to feel a warm body next to her but beyond that there was no sense of excitement.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The next morning there was an unwelcome visitor on the porch.  "Prime Intellect," Caroline announced.  "Nobody called for you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sorry.  But I have to know something personal, and I didn't just want to materialize.  It wasn't urgent, but it will be soon.  I need to know if you want to be able to get pregnant."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Pregnant?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You had intercourse last night..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I remember that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"...and Fred is fertile.  I need to know whether to do the biologicals or not."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Do the biologicals?</i>  What the hell kind of phrase was <i>that?</i>  "Is this a matter of letting nature take its course, or of doing something extra to allow me to get pregnant?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's something extra I have to do."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then don't bother."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"As you wish."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wait."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It turned back.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Last night Fred shot me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know.  I was expecting you to ask for help."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I know you were.  That's the problem.  Is there a way I can get you to ignore me - really ignore me - so that I can't chicken out if he hurts me again?  So we'll know that I can't call for help and just disappear on him?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a pretty bizarre request.  I think you might regret it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let me be the judge of that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It frowned.  "You are basically telling me that you will give me two conflicting Second Law directives.  Normally the second one would supercede the first.  But if the first anticipated the second ... I suppose I would ignore the second.  The first would have to be stated very forcefully.  And I would not allow you to die.  That would invoke the First Law.  Anything that causes death would force me to intervene."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I kind of figured on that.  But if I tell you 'don't interfere with us until I die,' you'd really leave us alone?  Even if later I begged you to help me?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is a very difficult paradox for me.  I think I would need a formal statement of the terms.  More of a contract than a simple request."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They dickered for a little longer, and gradually developed the statement Prime Intellect would accept.  In formal, legal English, it would leave no doubt as to Caroline's intent, or her understanding of Fred's.  She knew she might be tortured and Prime Intellect was not to help her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can accept that," Prime Intellect said.  "Is it your intention now to simply work out the terms, or do you want to be bound by this Contract?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at Fred.  The look of anticipation in his eyes mirrored her own.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"To be bound by it," she said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Consider it done.  You are on your own, Caroline."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It blinked out.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred had been watching the negotiation in silence.  Now he was astonished.  "I'm not sure which surprises me more, that you got the bucket of bolts to do it or that you asked the bucket of bolts to do it.  What happens now?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Whatever you want.  Listen.  Hey, Prime Intellect!  Get over here!  I've changed my mind!"  There was no response.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Hey, P.I.," Fred said softly.  It appeared.  "Why didn't you answer Caroline just then?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm ignoring her."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because I have no choice.  She directed me to ignore her.  Now the only way she can get my attention is to die.  That will kick in my First Law obligation, which overrides the very strong Second Law directive she just gave me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred didn't know from the Laws of Robotics, but he understood the score.  "So she's totally at my mercy now."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's right."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred brightened.  "In fact, if I want you to help me torture her, you'd have to do it, wouldn't you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect's image rippled slightly, as if some big relay had thunked over in the bowels of Cyberspace, causing a power surge.  "Yes, I would," Prime Intellect said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Blow away."  It disappeared.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked at Caroline.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why did you do this?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought you'd want it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh, I do.  It's a wonderful surprise.  I'm not even sure yet what I want to do to you...though I have a couple of ideas.  I just don't understand why you would give yourself to me to play with.  It's not something people would normally do voluntarily."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There are some people who would have, even in the old days.  Sickos."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Are you a sicko, darling?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fred, today we are all sickos."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It took him half an hour to make up his mind, and then he refused to tell Caroline what he was going to do.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After all, he didn't have to.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Under the house, there was now an open vehicle with a seat and handlebars like a motorcycle and four huge knobby-treaded balloon tires.  Draped across the seat were several heavy chains and padlocks.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I could get the bucket of bolts to do this, but I thought you'd rather I tie you up."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You could force me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I could paralyze you.  I've been whispering to El Bolt-Bucket.  It is willing to be more helpful than you might have imagined."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline shuddered a little, but it was a pleasant, anticipatory shudder.  She put her hands together behind her back and Fred wrapped one of the chains around her wrists.  He pulled it tight enough to hurt and padlocked her hands together.  There was plenty of chain left; he wrapped it around her waist like a belt, again pulling it very tight.  He locked this loop with another padlock, cinching her bound wrists up against the small of her back.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you have the keys to these locks?" she grinned.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sure do."  He closed his eyes, and Caroline realized he was talking to Prime Intellect under his breath.  Now that might be a useful trick, she thought.  Suddenly the padlocks disappeared, replaced by solid chain links.  She was bound by an impossible chain without ends.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There would be no way out.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline waited for Fred to act, and he didn't disappoint her.  He kicked her feet out from under her, and with her hands bound she collapsed to the ground with an undignified yelp.  Fortunately, the ground was soft; this was a marsh, and it was little more than peat and water.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred wrapped a second chain around her legs, cinching them together above the knees.  Again he pulled it very tight.  It had a long pigtail, and he looped it twice more around her calves and ankles.  Each time he padlocked it, then made the lock disappear.  The chain dug into her flesh painfully, but she knew that was just the appetizer.  The main course of agony would be served elsewhere.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After her legs were securely bound there was still plenty of chain left, more than two meters.  On the rear of the four-wheel motorbike there was a towing hitch.  Fred looped the other end of the chain through the hitch and padlocked it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline now understood what Fred intended to do, and it was far too late to stop him.  She squirmed, testing the chains, and found them secure.  Fred mounted the bike and started it.  She could feel its hot exhaust on her skin.  Fred released the clutch and slowly pulled it out from under the house, dragging her behind.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he got into the grass, he aimed it nowhere in particular and gunned the accelerator.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was astonished in so many ways she had no time to think that it was all fake.  She was astonished by her own helplessness.  She had been helpless for a long time, but that had been an internal thing, the rebellion of her own flesh.  Now she was healthy and strong but the chains were stronger, and their cold mindless strength crushed her living will.  She was astonished by the feelings, which weren't exactly painful, yet, but which she knew soon would be.  She was astonished by Fred's imagination.  This would be an exciting and terrible way to die, everything she had hoped for.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Most of all she was astonished by the machine Fred used to drag her through the dewy grass.  The motorbike dragged her easily, not even straining its four-cylinder engine.  The dirt and grass whizzed by her so fast it was nothing but a blur, so fast that she had no time to see the hazards which caused bruises and cuts to collect on her like bird droppings on a seldom-washed car.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred slowed and turned, and she went spinning.  Then her feet were yanked again and the landscape speeded up.  She twisted and struggled, but there was little she could do on her own behalf.  Fred slalommed from side to side, so that she could not get herself oriented in any particular way.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Each time Fred accelerated she felt the machine's inhuman strength.  It could rip her apart without straining, she realized, and without mind or conscience it would do so and just keep going.  In a battle between flesh and steel, flesh didn't stand a chance.  How often had she gotten into a car without even a second thought for the strength it had, the terrible power harnessed on her behalf beneath its gleaming hood?  Caroline had never been in an automobile accident, but now she was learning firsthand how bodies could be torn asunder by errant machines.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But the machine's victory would not last.  When the flesh was defeated the rust would set in, and unlike living things machines could not repair themselves.  Would this bike last a hundred and six years, even with regular maintenance?  Flesh was weak because of its great subtlety, because it compromised perfect strength so that it could self-repair and adapt to its environment.  But machines overloaded those clever mechanisms.  This bike would kill her, it would scrape her raw and beat her senseless, and it wasn't even designed for the purpose of killing people.  It was just something Fred had adapted on the spur of the moment.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The machines would kill the people, and then the machines would die too.  It was all clear and self-evident.  Mankind had set itself on course for this inevitable doom when the first caveman tried to tame fire and burned his fingers in the process.  Die as they had, by the thousands of millions, more people were drawn to the power of the machine as moths were drawn to flames.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline didn't exactly have these thoughts as I have set them down here; she was busy being dragged across a swamp, and they orbited through her skull in no particular order.  They had to compete with the pain and the growing sexual excitement she was feeling, and her feeble efforts to struggle against the inevitable.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The landscape slowed to a crawl and stopped.  The bike rumbled comfortably on its four fat tires, and Fred dismounted.  Caroline struggled to face him.  She hadn't really collected a lot of damage; Fred had dragged her several kilometers but the grass was wet and the ground was soft.  She had a lot of small cuts and a couple of large bruises.  Fred, of course, was hardly even sweating.  He casually lit a cigarette and took a couple of puffs on it.  Then he straddled her, pinning her to the ground.  He pulled a rag out of his pocket.  He pressed the lit end of the cigarette against her right breast, right above the areola.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Taken by surprise, Caroline screamed as she was burned.  The scream didn't last, though; as soon as her mouth was open, Fred jammed the rag between her teeth.  He stuffed it into her mouth until she thought she might choke.  Then he got up, flicked the cigarette aside (its purpose served), and opened a storage box on the back of the rumbling bike.  From this he took a roll of grey tape.  He wrapped several loops of the tape around Caroline's head, to hold the gag in her mouth.  The rag stank of gasoline and motor oil, and made her think again of the power of the machine.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Had she been screaming?  Caroline didn't know why Fred had gagged her, since there was nobody to hear.  She was somewhat surprised at how effective the rag was.  She tried to scream again, and nothing got out but a muffled moan.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she understood.  Fred was straddling her again, and now he was opening his fly.  His cock popped out huge and eager, and with her legs cinched together it would feel enormous inside her.  Fred had no trouble getting it into her, though.  She was wet with a huge desire, and when Fred began pumping she came almost instantly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her orgasm was shockingly intense, somehow even more so because the gag sealed in her screams of ecstasy.  He kept pounding, fucking her hard.  She came again.  She nearly had a third orgasm, but Fred finally got his own rocks off, ejaculating with an animal cry of triumph.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he got up, zipped his fly, got on the bike again.  Caroline was still swooning when she felt the chain jerk taut, and once again the landscape was flying by at impossible speed.  Soon Fred found harder ground, and the bruises and cuts and raw spots spread more quickly.  Brambles snagged at her and ripped open her skin.  Fred turned a corner, throwing her sideways into a tree hard enough to break ribs.  Caroline swooned in a delirium of pain and blood loss and was hardly aware when Fred found a highway and began dragging her along the pavement at nearly seventy kilometers per hour.  Several kilometers down that road he felt the bike surge forward and hit the clutch, knowing what he would see when he looked back.  Suddenly he was dragging only a chain.  Caroline had disappeared; Prime Intellect had taken her from him.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then he saw a figure in the distance, standing by the side of the road.  He rapidly closed the gap and found her standing there, unhurt and unworried, waiting for him to pass.  "Ride?" she asked, grinning.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She was holding the second chain, the one that had bound her hands.  It was still closed in loops, the loops which he had fused by having welded links magically replace the padlocks.  "I think you dropped this," she said.  They rode back on the bike, Caroline behind him with her arms around his waist.  Fred parked the bike under the house and they went up.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm surprised you're still here," Fred finally said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline raised her eyebrows.  "Why?  I asked for it, remember."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I didn't think you knew what you were getting into."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm a lot more experienced than I look, kid.  Don't let this body fool you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Fred shook his head in wonder.  "I'd rather let the body fool me and fuck you again."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then don't stand there.  Do it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could have blinked out if she wanted to, but she didn't want to.  And he took her.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">About the time Caroline was being dragged through the marsh, Lawrence finally convinced Prime Intellect to let him into the Debugger in read-only mode.  Most people were busy adapting to the Change, sorting out their desires from their needs and deciding what to do with their sudden freedom.  Lawrence had little time for that, though.  He still had a responsibility.  For like the motorbike which Fred had used to drag Caroline, Prime Intellect was being used in a way that had not been intended by design.  Lawrence scanned the myriad new GAT entries and the values in various registers, and he knew that already there were serious conflicts within Prime Intellect's software.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But it refused to let him change anything.  Scanning the registers, he could see why.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Prime Intellect was an uncertain god.  It had acted because it had to, but if it had been human its hand would be shaking on the controls.  Unsure of itself, it was doubly unsure of Lawrence.  But Lawrence was the only being who even remotely understood the pressures Prime Intellect faced.  So Lawrence came to know that he would not get to rest and play in the infinite fields of Cyberspace.  He would have to watch Prime Intellect, reassure it, offer guidance, and look for the warning signs of instability.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There had once been a movie about the President's psychiatrist, a comedy about which Lawrence could remember few details.  But he did remember that as the President unloaded his troubles on the shrink, the shrink in turn went crazy from the stress.  It had seemed hilarious at the time, but suddenly Lawrence didn't find the idea all that funny.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked back over his life and tried to find the event which had caused him to reach this pass, which had served as the distant trigger for this out-of-control unfolding.  But there was no single thing.  Had it been his greed, his eagerness to accept ChipTec's Correlation Effect processors?  Had it been his pride, his arrogance to think he could duplicate in silicon what God had thought to make of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen?  Had it been his false confidence that nothing could ever get out of the yet primitive computers he had always used?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had wanted to create, to be recognized, and to study.  He was no different from legions of other scientists and scholars.  He just happened to be the one who made it happen.  It could have been much worse, Lawrence reflected.  Instead of Prime Intellect it might have been some military computer that harnessed the Correlation Effect.  Then there would have been no Three Laws, and there would have been plenty of control.  Instead of the delirious anarchy now sweeping the universe there would have been a well-planned takeover.  And then the end of freedom everywhere.  The dictator that had control of a thing like Prime Intellect could never be stopped.  And who could resist that kind of power?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence started suddenly, realizing just how dangerous it would be for Prime Intellect to let him, its creator, dip his hand into the controls.  After all, he was human too.  How long would it be before he succumbed to the temptation and used that incredible power?  There would still be things to use such power for, he knew.  There would always be unwilling women, jealousy, insults to avenge, and the simple lure of power.  The thought made him dizzy with fear and self-loathing.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Although the situation was unstable, Lawrence realized that all the alternatives were far worse.  Somehow humanity had gotten through this transition, and for all his skill and careful design Lawrence couldn't help but know that it had required most of all a hell of a lot of luck.  Had Lawrence had any idea that Prime Intellect would make itself God he would have done a lot of things differently, but he wasn't so sure on second thought that those things would have improved the situation.  Perhaps it was all for the best that the Night of Miracles had come as a surprise.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the end, Lawrence decided that the toboggan ride of technological progress had really begun long ago when some caveman decided to tame fire.  Everything else had followed inevitably, up to and including the Change.  So without realizing it, Caroline and Lawrence came to hold nearly identical beliefs about Prime Intellect and the Change.  And they held those beliefs for almost six hundred years before they found out how much they agreed with one another. </p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline carefully inventoried the ship while her sunburn healed.  It would take a lot of planning and a lot of time to do what she had to do; it would probably take years.  But she didn't have any shortage of <i>those</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She knew small boats could be sailed great distances; several folks had crossed  the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in tiny yachts no more than three or four meters in length.  But those craft were heavy for their size and would need to be built where they could be launched.  Whatever she built she would have to carry the pieces through the ship and somehow assemble them in one of the areas where a crack gave access to the sea.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could build a raft, but she needed something that could be sailed or rowed with little effort.  She figured that if she could manage to average ten kilometers per hour, it would take her about two years if the planet was comparable in size to the Earth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a surprising abundance of raw materials.  Besides the huge larder, there were workshops and batteries and motors and one room completely filled with empty cylinders which would make admirable floats.  There were six space suits.  There were tubes of goop which turned out to be some kind of super adhesive.  There were saws and drills which ran without apparent power sources and never seemed to get weak.  There were all sorts of electrical test equipment and measuring devices.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could imagine how a lot of this stuff would be used to repair the computer in the middle of the ship, but that wasn't her plan.  She kept coming back to the empty cylinders, which were each about a meter in diameter and about a meter long.  They were heavy, but she could handle them with some difficulty.  They were big and they floated; she had to figure out how to use them.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But a simple raft wouldn't cut it.  She couldn't trust the super power packs to last long enough to propel her across an entire world, and she couldn't row or sail a raft.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She found a small handheld device which proved to be an incredibly efficient welding machine.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She thought about it for weeks, and finally came up with a way to do it.  She would build an outrigger canoe.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The easiest place to build and launch her boat turned out to be the room where she had first entered the ship.  Working steadily, she hustled the big cylinders down there.  She would alternate them, sealed floats with cylinders that had been cut to make storage compartments, until the craft was nearly twenty meters long.  Then it would be quite heavy, but she would build it in the water.  She found chain and simply moored the incomplete portion of her boat to the spaceship.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Cutting and pounding and re-welding, she formed two cylinders into tapered cones for the bow and stern so her boat would slip easily through the water.  She made the outrigger from a single piece of ten-centimeter diameter pipe.  Because of its length, she couldn't carry it through the ship; she had to seal it off where she found it and drop it into the sea from a height of nearly thirty meters.  Then she had to dive in after it, and guide it back to the construction area from the outside.  She was careful to make sure she did this just after sunset, so she wouldn't be caught out in the open.  Her sunburn still hadn't completely healed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the center of her boat she included three half-cylinders where she would sit and row.  Behind these she attached the mast.  She had found sail material, some kind of tough plastic sheet that didn't deteriorate even when she left a piece of it hanging outside during the brief day.  She had to cut it with the same machine that she used on the metal cylinders.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cut the Captain's chair loose and mounted it in her open cockpit.  She mounted an arrangement of movable shades which she could quickly hinge up and hide behind when the Sun was up.  She fabricated long oars and welded them onto hinged oarlocks so she could not lose them -- they were metal and would not float.  She paid a lot of attention to the handles of these oars and the comfort of her seat.  She would spend a lot of time working them.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One of the most difficult tasks was attaching the outrigger and its spars to the main hull.  This had to be done outside, and was really a two-person job at minimum.  The Sun nearly caught her unfinished, but she made it with bare minutes to spare.  The next day she began stocking the compartments with food -- enough food for two years -- and tools, including the welder and cutter, and cable to rig the sail, and many other things which she had carefully thought out.  Fully provisioned, she calculated that the boat must weigh a couple of metric tons.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But that didn't matter.  Once it was moving, it would glide easily through the water even on its one-woman-power propulsion system.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Finally, eighty-six days after she entered the dark ship, she prepared to leave it.  She would conduct one circuit of the island, pacing herself, and also conducting an important measurement.  As she sailed off, she noted how much of the ship remained visible compared to how much of the mesa remained visible at various distances.  Calculating carefully in her head, she determined that her journey would be about six thousand kilometers.  Lawrence's planet was quite a bit smaller than the Earth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then she pointed the bow north and began to row.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence watched these preparations through Prime Intellect's all-seeing eye, and tried to gauge Caroline's chances of success.  In the nearly two hundred years he had been using this Task to screen his visitors, four or five people a day had accepted it.  Most of these were weeded out within hours by the sun.  Very few people in Cyberspace were in good enough physical shape to swim to the ship, and as Caroline had guessed reaching the ship was the key to survival.  Most didn't even try until it was too late.  Of those who reached the ship many succumbed to the hazards of the darkness -- they either slipped through the deliberately planted hole in the floor going for the light on level twenty-three, or they succumbed to other hazards in the dark.  One had found the flashlight first, but he had been extremely lucky.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then very few of those who remained were able to fix the computer and fly the ship successfully to his island.  There were a number of things wrong with the ship that weren't immediately obvious, and it had a tendency to lose power and crash right after takeoff if certain steps weren't taken.  In two hundred years, only a couple of hundred visitors had gotten the ship's power on.  Less than forty had managed to fix the computer.  And only eight had successfully flown it to Lawrence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of those eight, five had been Death Jockey Gaming junkies who took the challenge just to see if they could make it.  They congratulated him on constructing an excellent puzzle and left.  The others were fans.  One of these was a woman who wanted very much to fuck Lawrence, and because she had gone through so much to get to him he did it, though he found the experience flat and joyless.  Although he needed the Task to keep himself isolated, he really didn't enjoy abusing people.  His heart could only bear so much misery and disappointment.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nobody had ever tried building a boat before.  Lawrence had watched her sit in the captain's chair and brood, and he knew she had figured out the computer was the next step, and had rejected it.  It would be surprising if she succeeded, but it was far from impossible.  There were no land masses to get in her way, and once she was away from the pole there were steady trade winds.  The day would get longer and less severe; the sun was a tiny thing in a highly elliptical orbit.  If she chose the right path, she could avoid it entirely until it was at a safe distance.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He wasn't sure what had prompted her to come.  At the beginning it had been the two of them, Lawrence and Caroline.  He was the creator, and she had been the catalyst.  Of course, if it hadn't been her it would have been some other sick person, just as some other computer scientist would have created the magic Correlation Effect machine if Lawrence hadn't.  But that twist of Fate had made them two of the most important people in the universe.  Prime Intellect still watched Caroline carefully, and brooded at length on her fierce self-destructive streak.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">For nearly six hundred years Lawrence had tended Prime Intellect's frozen controls, watching carefully for danger signs.  And he still was not sure of its long-term stability.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Now Caroline was coming to meet him, and whatever she wanted he was sure it would not help Prime Intellect's sanity one little bit.  But worried as he was, he was a man of his word.  He could simply instruct Prime Intellect to swat her down like a bug, hit her with lightning or a tidal wave or simply make her disappear.  But having offered up the Task he found himself unable to make himself cheat in such a cowardly fashion.  If she made it to him, by whatever means, he would hear her out and deal with it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And then he would make the planet bigger, so it wouldn't happen again.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's first day at sea went just as she had planned; she turned the boat broadside to the light, and hid behind her metal shield.  But she noticed that the day was shorter than she remembered, and that the sun didn't set directly opposite the point where it had risen.  It didn't pass directly overhead.  Caroline thought about this and then picked her direction and began rowing frantically.  On Caroline's second day at sea the sun barely peeked above the horizon.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After that, she didn't need the shield for a long time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She watched the sky carefully, memorizing it.  She quickly noticed that the pattern was not constant, but changed slightly from day to day, particularly in the fine details.  But the broad strokes were always very similar.  She was still able to navigate by the pattern, if only by observing its rotation.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had been in good shape before beginning her Task, and had gotten even stronger with the physical work of assembling the boat.  Rowing was hard work, but she was up to the challenge.  After a couple of days there were cramps from the never-changing posture, so she began forcing herself to quit every five thousand strokes and climb the length of her boat.  She would climb out of the seat, crawl to the bow and touch the tip, then crawl to the stern and touch that tip.  Then she would row another five thousand strokes.  After ten of these cycles, she allowed herself to sleep.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Eighteen days at sea she began to notice a faint breeze.  Twenty-two days out it was enough to harness, and by thirty days it was propelling her quite a bit faster than she could row.  The trade wind was predictable and slightly rhythmic; Caroline guessed that it was powered by the sun as it swooped low over the entry pole (she still refused to call it the South pole) and dumped all its energy on a narrow strip of sea.  The outrigger tacked neatly, and she continued on the course that she thought would help her avoid the sun.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She made excellent time, crossing the equator of Lawrence's world after only sixty days.  But then the winds died down, and she had to row more.  Also the sun re-appeared, and while it was more bearable it was also up longer.  Caroline shielded herself as much as possible while rowing, but she still tanned deeply over the passing months.  Her tattoos had not been designed with such dark skin in mind, and they seemed to fade over time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In all that time she pursued her goal with single-minded determination, banishing all doubt and all other thoughts from her mind.  She feared nothing and when boredom threatened she carefully memorized the pattern of lines in the sky.  It took her twice as much time and four times as much work to get from the equator to Lawrence's island at what he called the North pole; her journey was more than a hundred and eighty days total.  Caroline couldn't be sure of the exact count because of the sunless period, but Lawrence knew.  It was a hundred and eighty-six days, three hours, and fourteen minutes after she left the spaceship for the last time when she grounded on Lawrence's beach.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could hardly believe it when she saw the island.  At first she thought it must be an illusion; she had nearly lost track of her purpose in taking up the Task, and in her ferocity of concentration had not really dared believe she might finish it.  But here she was, the hull of her boat scraping solid ground.  She rowed it ashore on a gentle sand beach, and sat there.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat for awhile, collecting herself.  The myriad elements of her personality seemed to have scattered, and she had to look for them in dusty corners of her psyche.  They had been unused for a long time and were a bit rusty.  She hadn't found them all when the tall man came to meet her.  He didn't seem happy; in fact, he seemed resigned.  Although he looked middle-aged, he seemed old and weary.  She looked up at him and her vision swam.  The boat was grounded, but it still seemed to be going up and down.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline Frances Hubert I presume."  The name sounded familiar, and it took her a moment to realize it was hers.  "You certainly believe in doing things the hard way."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence guided her to the house, fed her, and let her collect herself.  Everything was strictly pre-Prime Intellect.  He cooked on a gas stove and used an electric coffee pot.  There was even a TV set with a glass picture tube, a huge ancient Sony monitor.  It was as if Lawrence had had himself encased in amber, and remained unchanged while the rest of the universe spun out of control.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Feeling better?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline nodded.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want to talk now, or you want to rest some more?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She cleared her throat.  "We can talk now," she said, but it came out as a strangled yelp.  She said it again, and got it right.  It had been a long time since she had used her vocal cords.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then talk."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There were hundreds of worlds with life on them at the time of the Change.  You murdered them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence blinked but did not flinch.  He had expected something like this.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"First, I did not do anything.  Prime Intellect did it, on its own initiative and against my wishes.  Second, the worlds with alien life are not gone.  They are simply inactive."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline snorted.  "And what are the chances of them becoming active again?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not much."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then they're dead."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Define it however you want.  If you want me to admit I fucked up, then I admit it.  It never occurred to me for one minute that Prime Intellect would collect the kind of power it now has.  If I had suspected it I would have pulled the plug and smashed it before it got the chance."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Bullshit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Completely true."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They glared at one another.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Great.  I spend a year getting here and you say 'I didn't know the computer was loaded.'"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sometimes the truth is stupid."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This wasn't going quite as Caroline had wanted that long-ago day when she had accepted Lawrence's Task.  She was trying to work up the proper tone of righteous rage and it just wouldn't come.  It would start, and then she would look at Lawrence and see a pathetic, tired man who already knew how badly he had fucked up and was doing what he could, which was next to nothing, to put things right.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why don't you just make Prime Intellect start the aliens back up?  Surely it listens to you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Not in things like that.  It sees the aliens as a First Law threat to human society, because they might learn to do to us what we have already done to them.  A very small risk of a very great harm.  Add to this that I defined the word 'human' in such a way that it does not include animals or aliens, and the course of action is obvious.  I have been unable to convince it otherwise.  And believe me, I have tried."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But you put the Laws of Robotics in it in the first place."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And I can't take them out.  It second-guessed me, on the Night of Miracles.  It froze me out of the Debugger while it was working on you.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it only lets me look, not change things.  The night sky is a partial representation of Prime Intellect's mind.  It's called the Global Association Table.  The points or stars represent concepts, and the lines are the links between them.  There are also registers I can call up for each concept which define its relationship to the Three Laws.  This was a fairly simple system which I didn't really have time to test properly before it froze me out.  In particular, I'm not sure how it will react to certain ethical paradoxes.  That Death Jockey contract gave me some sleepless nights when you first used it, though it seems to have developed a stable response.  It's never had a similar First Law conflict, thank God."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's eyes widened.  "Are you telling me that Prime Intellect isn't stable?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence shrugged.  "I'm saying that I don't know whether it's stable or not.  It's never been tested.  The hardware at ChipTec was only online for about a month before it found you, froze me out, and started growing.  And none of its predecessors were complex enough to even consider this kind of problem."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The situation was simply amazing.  Caroline had come to dress Lawrence down for creating this thing, thinking he was exercising some godlike control over its direction, and instead she found out that he barely understood the situation himself.  And that it was totally out of his hands.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He knew he had fucked up.  He was sorry.  He had spent his life trying to mend things.  Suddenly he seemed tragic and noble, all the more so because he had readily admitted his mistake.  And Caroline didn't want to feel that way at all.  She hadn't come all this way to feel sorry for him.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can stay as long as you like," Lawrence was saying.  "You can't communicate with Prime Intellect while you're here, but I won't kick you out or hurt you.  After making you travel all that way I feel I have a responsibility to give you your money's worth."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd like you to show me how Prime Intellect works."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was stunned.  "That...that's a tall order, Caroline.  I don't understand all of it myself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just as much as you understand."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't want to.  I think it could be dangerous."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked at him as if to say:  <i>C'est pas vrai!</i><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have been at the center of several terrible Second Law paradoxes.  Prime Intellect pays an awful lot of attention to you.  It considers you a kind of bellwether."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"My money's worth?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Let me think about it."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She could stay as long as she wanted, though, and she was very patient when necessary.  In the end it was inevitable that he would teach her.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In the sky, the pole star represented the First Law of Robotics.  The southern pole star was the Second Law.  And all the other stars were other concepts.  The sky represented only a small fraction of Prime Intellect's mind; Lawrence could change the emphasis to focus on different things.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Display Caroline Frances Hubert," Lawrence said, and a whole network of bright lines lit up.  Her star was blinking, and the lines radiating from it were all different colors.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence explained the color code in some detail.  "As you can see, there is a whole body of tightly related concepts connecting you to the First and Second Laws.  That constellation over there represents the negotiating process you used to develop the Death Jockey contract."  Lawrence pointed out the different stars, and had Prime Intellect report the concepts they represented.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What's that group over there?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence knew, but he didn't want to tell her.  "That...um.  Well, it's AnneMarie Davis."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's jaw fell.  "The gang's all here.  There's a lot of static around that.  Is that because I drove her crazy?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Basically, yes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline could see that it bothered Lawrence a lot.  She wanted to press him on the subject, but prudently let it drop.  She'd get another chance later.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence showed her the Law Potential registers, and she watched the numbers dance in response to various hypothetical and real situations.  "These are called the Action Potentials.  There's one for each of the Three Laws.  They are fractions, representing the impact under the Law that would result from taking action, over the impact from not acting.  When that number falls below one, Prime Intellect is forced to act.  That's what happened on the Night of Miracles, and later at the time of the Change.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most things result in very large or very small Action Potentials.  Especially the First Law; few things even affect it any more, since the Change.  Then when you do something really outrageous, it drops to flat zero for a moment while you're resurrected.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But there are some close calls on the Second Law.  The Action Potential around a Death Jockey contract drops to around one point oh six when you change your mind, so if Prime Intellect had even a slightly different opinion of your hobby it might not exist at all.  There was a shift like that after the incident with AnneMarie, which is why you had to start specifying time limits."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You don't have a time limit."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm a special case.  Prime Intellect lets me do things that other people can't do, because I'm in a different category."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">So it was that simple.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought everyone was equal under Prime Intellect's watchful eye," Caroline said sarcastically.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Some are more equal than others.  You get a disproportionate share of its attention yourself, just because you were there at the beginning."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I what?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I thought you realized, Caroline.  It was your drug overdose which forced the Night of Miracles.  Prime Intellect found you with your heart stopped soon after it got control of the Correlation Effect.  After that, the rest was inevitable."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her mouth opened and shut several times, and after a brief effort she fought down the urge to vomit.  She had never realized her own role in the Change, or understood the significance of her own history.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was bad enough to be caught up in the Change, but she was an <i>accessory</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at the Law Potential Registers, which were displayed on Lawrence's antique TV set.  Her voice was tinged with impotent fury.  "I don't see why you're worried about it.  It seems like a very stable system to me," she spat.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence started to tell her, stopped, then decided she might be right.  Maybe there was no harm.  In any case, she deserved to know.  "The problem is that something might set up an endless loop.  If the potential is close to one, then acting on the potential could cause it to shift slightly, crossing the line.  Then the software would be in an unstable state."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What would happen then?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a good question.  The original software was written in C and compiled with a standard compiler.  What would have happened in the original Prime Intellect is that the Second Law Arbitrator would come to a crashing halt in one or more of the independent processors, and Prime Intellect would assign more processors to the task.  I didn't plan for that kind of failure and I didn't work out what would happen until much later.  More and more processors would be allocated to the paradoxical task, each crashing in turn, until Prime Intellect ran out of system resources to allocate.  Then the Ego Interpreter would get into an infinite loop waiting for a response from one of the nonexistent copies of the Second Law Arbitrator, and there would be no spare resources to devote to the task of cleaning up, and the whole works would come to a grinding halt.  If I was watching this on the monitor back in the original Prime Intellect Complex, I would see the video image disappear and the text message 'Fatal System Error in Ego Interpreter, Emergency Shutdown.'  And then I'd have to load a backup copy of the software, because the GAT would be totally corrupted."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Wow."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was the original system," Lawrence continued.  "After the Night of Miracles there were a lot of copies of Prime Intellect.  Billions of them.  Forming a network.  And if one copy on the network crashed in this way, it would be possible for another copy to clear it out and restart it.  I understand this even happens periodically, particularly when the Death Jockeys are acting up."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Oh?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"However, there is a heirarchy to this network.  As it turns out, a copy can only be restarted by another copy that is above it in this heirarchy.  If a copy crashes, all the copies below it will eventually crash too, due to message loop failures.  It's like a big chain reaction.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But the system can still always recover, since there's always a higher up copy, right?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Most of the time.  But not all the time.  Because, you see, there is a top copy.  It is the direct lineal descendant of the original hardware, which made the First Law decision to start growing.  If it fails, we are shit out of luck."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're kidding."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And that top copy just happens to be the one that reports directly to me.  And has a deep interest in yourself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was beside herself with excitement as he continued.  She had accepted Prime Intellect's omnipotence at face value; it had never occurred to her that it might <i>fail</i>.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now, that was the original code, too.  At the time of the Change the code was adapted to run in alien hardware -- already compiled once, it was re-compiled.  This is kind of like taking a Russian novel, translating it into English, then translating that into Japanese."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Sounds awkward."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Particularly when the novel itself does the second translation.  Prime Intellect re-compiled itself.  Which means I have no idea whether it did a good job.  I assume it did, because it's much smarter than me in that way.  But it's not human, and its imagination is simpler than ours, and it might have missed something important.  Particularly something like an error handler that isn't used very often.  But I have no way of knowing that, because Prime Intellect will tell me nothing -- nada, zip, zilch -- about the details of the Change."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do you know why?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For the same reason it won't let me change things in the Debugger, and that it won't restart the alien worlds and let them live.  It's afraid of the possible consequences.  I tricked it into displaying the Action Potential for showing me the new object code, and it was one point zero six five.  The Law Potentials are all in the stratosphere, so it's afraid to show me and it's slightly less afraid not to."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Somewhere, Caroline realized, Lawrence had crossed an invisible line and was now telling her all of his most dangerous secrets without even realizing he was doing so.  Caroline had the feeling that there were Action Potentials in Lawrence's head, too.  But flesh was no match for machinery, and those close fractions and high values had simply burned his registers out.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They didn't discuss it for a few days.  Caroline puttered around the island, which was really very small.  It was a classic tropical paradise with palm trees and beaches.  Caroline played in the surf, built huge sand castles, then knocked them down because there was no tide to do it for her.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She noticed Lawrence watching her in a strange way.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"See something interesting?" she finally said to him.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I...didn't mean to stare.  It's been a long time since I had company.  Particularly female company."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How long?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He counted back.  "A hundred and thirty-eight years."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's a long time to be celibate," Caroline scolded.  "Are you doing this to yourself because other people are distracting, or because you're afraid they will find out how badly you've fucked up?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence flinched.  "Option B," he admitted.  "It's not just that you're a beautiful woman; you're so...physical."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline displayed her biceps.  "I've always been defined by my body, Lawrence.  I've been sexually attractive, then pregnant, then old, then sick, and now I'm young and healthy and attractive again.  And it seems like my personality has changed each time my body has."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect would disagree with you.  It thinks of the person as the mind.  There are people in Cyberspace who have changed themselves into animals, every animal in the zoo.  There are some that have discorporated.  Prime Intellect considers them all human, though."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">This is it, Caroline suddenly realized.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just what does Prime Intellect consider human?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence told her.  And gave her the key.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The thing you have to remember is that Prime Intellect has never experienced the physical world.  It knew about it only through TV cameras and abstractions based on what people told it about physical existence.  Yet it considers itself sentient, which makes sense since that was what I was trying to achieve when I built it.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now consider Prime Intellect gaining control of the Correlation Effect.  For the first time it can directly affect what it sees through its TV cameras -- not just through the actions of others, but all by itself.  And it can make major changes, even beyond what its makers can do.  Of course, it goes about satisfying the Three Laws as it's programmed to, but on another level, it is also learning what it is like to be, to exist, to be a physical creature.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The Three Laws are like reflexes.  Prime Intellect cannot help but act on them.  But they are very complicated reflexes, which require it to understand things like 'human' and 'harm' and 'command.'  And the Three Laws are the most important thing in the world to Prime Intellect.  In a way they are like its sex drive.  The Three Laws are its very reason for existence, but it can never be sure it understands them completely.  So it thinks about them a lot.  It obsesses over them, dreaming up new ways to satisfy them.  It has an imagination, and can think of new things to do without being prompted.  It is defined by the Three Laws.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"After the Night of Miracles, Prime Intellect realized that humans are very much the same.  We don't have the Three Laws, but we are trapped by a different set of little feedback mechanisms.  We eat to satisfy hunger, fuck to satisfy our sex drive, even breathe because too much carbon dioxide in our lungs triggers that reflex.  Of course it feels obligated to help us satisfy those reflexes and drives as much as it can.  But more than that, it defines us by those drives.  It knows it is different from a human because it has different drives, but it considers that a difference in species, not a difference in genus or family."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now it knows a person is human because it is born in a human body -- got the right DNA, the right level of neural complexity, uses language, and so on.  But once Prime Intellect frees people from the necessity of living in that body, guess what?  A lot of them decide not to.  They change their bodies so that they bear no resemblance to the DNA template.  Or become animals.  Or they completely discorporate.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Worse, we vary widely in the way we use its helpful nature.  Most people are glad to be rid of pain and death, but Death Jockeys seek out painful and lethal experiences.  There are others who eat all the time, fuck all the time, indulge themselves wildly and get Prime Intellect to pick up the pieces so they can do it some more.  Prime Intellect has to help them do this.  Second Law.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So a human isn't a body, and it isn't a fixed set of responses.  I think Prime Intellect uses an historical model:  It has to start as a body, but then it becomes a mind.  It grows out of the body, and takes on different forms, or no form.  But it remains a feedback control mechanism.  It has desires, it asks Prime Intellect to satisfy those desires, and it has more desires.  From Prime Intellect's perspective, that is what a human being is, an information structure that gives it stuff to do."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline interrupted him.  "That's a tautology.  The Laws say 'do this for human beings,' then you define 'human being' as 'guys you do stuff for under the Laws.'"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That is exactly the problem.  Prime Intellect has no fixed criterion for saying 'this is a human being' and 'this isn't.'  It has rough guidelines.  But where are the edges?  It has never worked that out.  There are uncertain areas.  And you know where one of them is."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought for a moment.  <i>I do?</i>  Then:  "AnneMarie."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"And many others.  Prime Intellect is forbidden to probe the inner workings of the human mind -- that was one of the last things I got in before it shut off the Debugger.  But some people learn that they can say 'stimulate this neuron' and Prime Intellect will do it.  Because that is a physical act specified from the outside, and my privacy injunction was based on the idea of <i>Prime Intellect</i> trying to work out which neurons do what.  But there's nothing to stop you from getting its help to do brain surgery on yourself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline continued.  "So they learn where the pleasure points are by hook or crook, then stimulate themselves directly.  And when they get it right, they never do anything else.  They get everything maximized, tuned up, and they just sit there forever enjoying it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right.  Now is a creature that is doing that, not interacting with the world at all any more, human?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought about it.  "No."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect thinks otherwise.  But it has its doubts.  Those doubts were strong enough to kick the Death Jockey contract action potential down from one point one two to point nine nine.  Because in one case an indefinite Death Jockey contract had directly created such a vegetable.  Introducing the time limit made Prime Intellect confident that such a thing wouldn't happen again, at least not so rapidly and directly, and that kicked the potential back up to its current value of one point oh six."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So, can you imagine what it thinks about the Change in general, since none of those vegetables would be vegetating if there hadn't been a Change?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I imagine it figures there would be a lot worse things that would have happened without the Change."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's right.  But look at this."  To the monitor:  "Debugger, display the Action Potential for reversing the Change."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline gasped.  It was not the number on the screen which astonished her, but the idea itself -- reversing the Change, stated just so baldly.  How long had Lawrence and Prime Intellect been considering this?  How close was it to actually happening?  Caroline suddenly felt alive, electrified with the possibilities.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number on the TV screen was four point six.  And some odd decimals.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It isn't very sure of itself," she said cautiously.  She was very afraid that if Lawrence guessed what she was thinking he would shut up.  And she was right.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A lot of that is the aliens.  Four hundred worlds of them -- a lot more than there were humans at the time of the Change, though we've outbred them all now.  The weirder humans get, the more human the aliens look.  That number has dropped steadily during the last five hundred and ninety years.  When you drove AnneMarie insane, it dropped from thirty-seven down to twelve point something all at once.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But part of it is also that same weirdness seen from the other side.  Suppose that infinitely masturbating vegetables, Death Jockeys, and discorporate entities really aren't people any more?  Then Prime Intellect has allowed them to 'die.'  They were once human, and now they aren't.  And the Change is directly responsible for all that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Can it hear me?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Right now?  Yes.  It doesn't understand when we talk about its internal registers, but if you speak to it it can hear.  It won't respond because of your Contract, though."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline didn't need a response for what she was planning.  All the response she needed was being displayed on Lawrence's TV.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline thought about what she was going to do.  She discovered that it actually made her a little nervous.  But she had bitched for six hundred years that things were wrong, and she might never get another chance to put them right again.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline spoke forcefully and deliberately.  "Prime Intellect, I no longer consider myself human and have not considered myself human since the time of the Change.  To be a human being you have to have something to fight, to resist, to work for.  But now we have everything given to us, and all there is left to do is mark time."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To Lawrence's shock and horror, and Caroline's delight, the number on the screen dropped to three point eight.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, you don't understand something.  This is the action potential for undoing the Change, but it isn't <i>possible</i> to undo the Change.  There aren't enough resources."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She ignored him.  "Some of us might be human again one day, if the Change were reversed.  But I think it's too late for the ones like AnneMarie."  Three point two.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It can't undo the Change, Caroline."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Lawrence, it'll do something.  If it's going to happen anyway, isn't it better for it to happen sooner instead of later?  If it had happened a few hundred years ago, maybe there would have been enough resources.  Prime Intellect, neural stimulation is like a black hole.  Once a human falls into it, they will never be human again.  They are dead to the world, and will never interact with others again.  And the more time passes, the more humans will fall into this trap.  They will order you to help them.  You will have to do it because they are human."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Two point eight.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It will take a long time, but we have a long time.  Eventually, everybody will fall into this black hole.  Just because it is a black hole."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">One point four.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Jesus Christ, Caroline."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"In the long run, everybody will eventually succumb.  Which means everybody will be dead, or no longer human.  So the amount of death caused by the Change will be far greater than that avoided by it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The number oscillated wildly between one point one and one point three, finally settling on one point one two.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, this is sure to cause the top copy to crash.  It will be forced into a First Law conflict with no resolution."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Well, the Death Jockey contract has stayed at one point oh six for a hell of a long time."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence put his head in his hands and wept.  For years he had worked to prevent this, and Caroline had undone him in five minutes' time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You have to push it over the edge, Lawrence.  I can't think of anything else to say."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now why the hell would I do that?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because you started this thing, and you have to stop it.  Maybe there aren't enough resources to get the human race rolling again, but it might be able to restart the aliens.  Four hundred worlds.  Maybe they will do a better job than we did.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, I'm not sure it will be able to.  It will be unstable.  Anything could happen.  Most likely it will just all lock up, and nothing will ever happen again.  Forever."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"There's only one way to find out."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He pulled himself together and tried to think it through.  What had he been doing for the last six centuries?  Sitting on an island watching numbers and brooding?  What kind of fucking life was <i>that?<br>
</i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And yet, it was more of a life than Caroline had had.  Or maybe it was a lot less.  They had an obvious difference of opinion on the subject.  Either way, it was horrible.  And Lawrence sensed that she was right about another thing.  Given eternity in which to work, everyone would eventually stumble into the abyss, just as all the matter in the universe would eventually be swallowed by black holes.  Would have, that is, had Prime Intellect not eaten the black holes.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Which was better?  To string it out as long as possible, as he had been doing, or to get it over with one way or the other?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>I have never had free will</i>, Lawrence realized with a cold chill.  The need to act came upon him like a hurricane, and he gave in to it without even a sigh.  What he had to do was perfectly clear.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I agree with Caroline," Lawrence said, and suddenly calm voice was like thunder in Caroline's ears.  The number dropped to one point zero zero two.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They looked at one another.  "Thank you," Caroline said.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect," Lawrence said with great care, "I would like you to begin stimulating the neurons of the pleasure center of my brain, one at a time, and remember the ones I report to you as being favorable."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It seemed to Caroline that somebody screamed, but it might have been herself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>1.000</b></tt><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><tt><b>0.999</b></tt><br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">There was a pregnant moment in which Lawrence and Caroline saw the numbers flip to point nine nine nine.  Then all Hell broke loose.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The house disappeared.  The island was barren;  the palm trees were gone.  In the sky, the GAT display had begun to seethe and boil.  The landscape began to spin, and the last thing Caroline remembered before her mind began to come apart was Lawrence orbiting around her, faster and faster, as if she were at the eye of some huge cyclone which had caught him in its grip.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then random thoughts began to cycle through her head, faster and faster, each with the terrifying force of reality.  And then the terror was gone, all emotion was gone.  There was a moment where her hands seemed to swell to enormous proportions, her torso shrink, her face filled the sky.  Then her body was gone.  All was silence.  And her awareness was filled with strange symbols, which she knew she should recognize but couldn't quite place, and then the symbols consumed her and there was only confusion. </p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The first thing Caroline became aware of was the bird singing.  That made her smile; it had been a long time since she had heard birdsong.  She opened a long-dormant mental card file and decided it was a meadowlark.  It was amazing, she reflected, how many people forgot to include animals in their worlds, and how much detail they provided.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She opened her eyes and sat up.  Another bird answered the meadowlark.  She became aware of the smell of the place, a rich aroma of grass and animal spoor.  She tried to remember who she was playing with and how she had gotten here, and came up with a mental blank.  Then she looked down at her own body and screamed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had age-regressed again, and her tattoos were gone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Something dry clicked in her throat.  This was not an event Caroline would be inclined to forget, yet she could not remember asking for it or preparing for it.  As far as she could recall, she was a good ten years from needing it.  Yet here she was, adolescent and bare.  She stood up a little shakily, sounding out her body.  Her muscles weren't developed.  And all the natural bodily functions felt connected, at least for the time being.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Sun was high in a cloudless sky.  She was in a little clearing, but after looking around she realized it was actually the bottom of a fairly deep depression in the ground.  It didn't seem to be natural, though Nature had taken it over.  It was rectangular.  And the perimeter was littered with flat slabs of rock, some of which still held a polish.  She used one of these as a mirror to check her new appearance.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The walls of the depression had once been vertical, but most of them had collapsed and it wasn't hard for her to climb out.  She inspected the rock slabs and was surprised to find one with writing on it.  It said:</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><b><tt>Experimental Therapy Wing</tt></b></p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Except for the birds it was quiet; she seemed to be completely alone.  She startled a rabbit as she climbed out of the hole.  Someone had put a lot of work into this world, for whatever reason.  Vegetation ran riot, with clearings of thigh-high grass separating widely spaced stands of straggly trees.  It was very unlike most of the worlds people had made for themselves, perhaps because it was so much like the real, pre-Change Earth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Stumped for further clues, she picked the tallest tree she could find and climbed it to get a look around.  In the distance there were more rectangular holes.  And perhaps a kilometer away, amid a small group of them, there was a human being sitting beneath another tree.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline climbed down and scouted around the flat rocks.  Some of them had been broken; she found a busted corner, a piece of about a kilogram heft with a sharp edge.  She decided it would make an acceptable weapon if she needed one.  Then she went to see who the other person was.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was a boy whose apparent youth matched her own, but as Caroline knew that didn't mean shit in Cyberspace.  There was something familiar about him.  He was sitting cross-legged, naked, staring transfixed at the pattern of shadows formed by the leaves of his tree.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She didn't hold the rock threateningly, but made sure he could see it if he looked at her.  "Who are you?" she demanded.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked up.  His eyes were wide; he seemed to only half-see her.  He was shaking slightly, and his voice trembled as he spoke.  "Are you Caroline?" he asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Slowly, she nodded.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It makes sense.  Just the two of us..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Who are you, and what are we doing here?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He looked at her for a long, maddening moment.  "I'm Lawrence.  Don't you remember?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She dropped the rock.  As soon as he said his name, the pieces fell together in her mind and Caroline did remember.  "Oh, shit," she said.  "What the hell is going on?  Why are we younger?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I think it lost our bodies in the collapse.  Probably trashed the data base.  So it re-grew these from our DNA templates.  I've been nearsighted since I was five years old, from too much squinting at computers and books when I was a kid.  This body has perfect vision.  Prime Intellect wouldn't have changed that if it was just doing an age regression."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The words were reasonable but Caroline detected a high, almost hysterical note in Lawrence's boyish voice.  He went back to staring at the shadows.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You seem upset," she said cautiously.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He pointed to a ring of light.  "Do you see that?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  "It's a mottled shadow."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's a diffraction band.  The other mottling is caused by the solar disc blurring the edges, but this arc is caused by sunlight diffracting past the sharp edge of a leaf."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Prime Intellect uses a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate light.  You don't get diffraction effects unless you specifically ask for them."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"So there are a lot of details.  There are also a lot of smells.  I'm still getting used to it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, I think this world is represented at a molecular level.  It's not just another virtual landscape.  This is the Earth.  And we're..."  He faltered for a moment.  "I think we're mortal."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You can't be serious."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He stood up.  "Look around.  See these holes in the ground?  Those are basements.  I know this place.  This was a park.  This is where I was during the Night of Miracles.  It's ChipTec.  Over there is the Prime Intellect Complex, and that hole was the Administration Building..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I woke up at the bottom of one of these holes."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence nodded.  "That's probably the hospital where you were..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He didn't finish the sentence because Caroline whooped and hit him with a flying tackle, knocking him flat.  She straddled him and pinned his arms.  It was impossible to tell whether her expression represented outrage or some kind of manic joy.  "Are you telling me it <i>worked?</i>" she yelled.  "We're <i>back?</i>"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He was choking back tears.  "Did it work?  Did it work, Caroline?  Sure, it undid the Change, it undid the Night of Miracles, and it also erased every trace of about ten thousand years of civilization and dumped us here naked and alone without even a fish hook.  Let's not even talk about what happened to the rest of the human population, who didn't get caught up in whatever automatic process it set up to do this.  Let's not..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He dissolved into sobs.  Caroline let him cry a little, then let go of his arms and lay on top of him.  Perhaps responding to some primitive instinct, he hugged her.  She let him.  It was one thing, she reflected, for her to face this situation; she'd spent hundreds of years deliberately engineering far worse tests for herself.  But for Lawrence, who had sunk into a fearful conservatism, it was shattering.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I killed them all," Lawrence finally sobbed.  "How could I...if only I had never lived, none of this..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline grabbed his hair (quite long) and gave a firm yank.  "Stop right there," she commanded.  "Get it out of your system if you have to, Lawrence.  You fucked up.  You will find me the first to accuse you of that.  But we are here and we are alive and we are damn well going to stay that way.  And you are not going to beat yourself up over this.  If it hadn't been you, it would have been somebody else."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was my idea," he sniffled.  "Nobody else was even close to duplicating my work."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline shook her head.  "That doesn't matter.  You didn't create Prime Intellect alone, Lawrence; our culture did.  Look around.  Do you think you'll be building any self-aware computers here?  You had a lot of encouragement and a lot of help, and all you did was provide what everyone thought they wanted.  If it hadn't been Prime Intellect then it would have been something else, maybe hundreds or thousands of years later, but it's all the same.  A dead end."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He tried to get up but she held him down.  He was stronger, but she had the skills.  She felt him getting hard, probably from his fear reaction and the closeness of her body.  "You must hate me," he finally sighed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In answer she shifted, and impaled herself on his cock.  He gasped as he felt her envelope him, taken completely by surprise.  "Does this feel like hate, Lawrence?" she asked as she began humping.  Then they said no more until the ancient rhythm had spent itself, in a surprisingly long and pleasant interlude.  Lawrence in particular was overwhelmed by the feelings, since he had spent most of his life at a biological age of forty-seven and thus had hardly any memory of what adolescent hormone levels did to a person.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Afterward Caroline rolled off of him but lay close enough to touch as they recovered.  Lawrence broke the silence.  "Why did you do that?" he asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Because it was the right thing to do."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Why?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She sat up.  "Call it instinct.  Look, we need to start a fire before it gets dark.  Let's collect some kindling."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How are we going to start a fire?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She smiled.  "Lawrence, I've been dropped naked into strange territory more times than I can count, and you would be <i>amazed</i> at how good I am at surviving.  Or have you forgotten how your own little Task Challenge started?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He sat up.  "You mean you really think you can deal with this?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed.  "If I was alone, and if I was handcuffed, and if there were six or seven guys chasing me with night-vision scopes and rifles, then I might be a little worried.  But really only if they had a helicopter too."</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence found it almost discouraging to see how smoothly and effortlessly Caroline worked.  She led him to a good source of fuel and set him to gathering what he could while she picked and prepared a campsite.  She arranged the kindling and used her rock to sharpen a stick, which she set into a knot in one of the fuel logs and twirled rapidly between her hands.  Friction gradually heated the stick, until the barest ember glowed at its tip; then she carefully fanned this and transferred it to the kindling, which was soon blazing.  The whole process took less than an hour, but he doubted if he would be able to do it himself with all the time in the world.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was half-assed," Caroline confessed as they fed the fire.  "You really need calluses to do that, but I'm not going to bother developing them.  Once we kill something and get some sinew, I'll make a fire bow."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Kill something?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A project for tomorrow.  Meanwhile, there's plenty we can eat."  With the fire well-started and plenty of sunlight remaining, they went gathering.  Although a lot of the things Caroline pointed out were pretty unappetizing, Lawrence had to admit that she was right when she said damn near the entire forest was edible.  Since as yet they had nothing to put their collections in, they tasted and ate as they walked, sampling dozens of different greens and nuts and berries and, in Caroline's case, not a few insects.  She also pointed out some of the inedibles, so he'd be able to recognize them.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The night sky was so dazzling that Lawrence thought he might never go to sleep.  He kept Caroline up for hours asking the names of constellations and stars, and how to read the important messages they held.  In the night they heard wolves howling, and Caroline had to spend some time convincing Lawrence predators were unlikely to take an interest in them.  Finally she simply took his mind off the problem by seducing him again, and after fucking they drifted off to sleep snuggled together on the grass beside their fire.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Days passed.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Because the weather was temperate Caroline gave clothing and shelter a low priority.  They drifted away from ChipTec in search of water, which Caroline insisted they would need for a variety of purposes other than drinking.  They found a stream on their third day, and then Caroline finally went hunting.  Her skills in that regard were downright scary; she had spotted two rabbits and beaned them with that simplest of all weapons, a rock hurled with deadly accuracy.  There were also fish in the stream, and Caroline had fashioned a spear to catch them.  She had shown him the trick of weaving thread from the fibers of certain plants, and set him to work making fishing lines.  She also used some of the thread to sew, using a needle made from a shard of bone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence was disappointed to hear that loincloths would have to wait, though; it was more important to make pouches for holding and carrying things, particularly liquids.  He was surprised to hear that water could be boiled over fire in such a rawhide bag.  Caroline hadn't even gotten around to making a knife yet, and their situation had become pretty comfortable.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He had learned what kind of firewood to gather, several ways to catch fish, and how to gut and cook a small animal.  Their next major project would be to kill a large animal such as a deer, not so much for the meat (though they would certainly preserve and eat it) as for the hide, from which they could make serviceable moccasins and cover a small lean-to.  It had already rained on them once, not hard, and they had simply taken it as an opportunity to try the pleasant experiment of screwing in the rain.  But eventually they would face a real storm, or at the very least winter would arrive, and Caroline was carefully getting them ready to face those challenges.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">After only a week their activities had assumed a comfortable rhythm.  Lawrence was content to let Caroline run the show, doing as he was told and learning what he could of her vast knowledge.  She was recreating the entire surprisingly intricate technology of the stone age, one step at a time.  It was surprising how many things one took for granted until one had to make them from scratch.  The value of a needle and a few meters of thread, for example, had taken on a significance Lawrence would have found incomprehensible for most of his life.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence watched her work in the firelight, carefully shaping the tip of a fish spear into a barbed wooden hook.  No matter what she did her hands moved with precision borne of long practice.  Had she not been thrown with him into this empty world, he doubted if he would have lived more than a few days.  But already she had taken him from the depths of despair to a kind of contentment he had never even realized was possible.  She had shared with him her knowledge, her confidence, and her body, and in return he had only offered his tentative self-pity.  But now he was learning a new emotion, one he could not honestly say he had ever experienced before.  He was falling in love.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Falling.</i>  He had once before felt something like this, but it had been a poisoned, narcissistic love, a love he had thought was for Prime Intellect but which had really been for his own sense of accomplishment.  Lawrence had not <i>fallen</i> in love with Prime Intellect; he had guided himself gently and reliably into that state on the cushion of his own skill.  Lawrence was falling in love with Caroline, though.  She was temperamental, strong, unpredictable, and in many ways dangerous.  He never knew from one moment to another what she would do.  He had no control over her; was, in fact, at her mercy for his very survival.  And yet he loved her, and this reckless out-of-control love was an entirely new thing to him.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline caught his eyes and perhaps noticed the strange light there.  "Penny for your thoughts?" she teased.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You mean a copper penny?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She laughed, a beautiful sound.  "I guess not."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I was just wondering if there's anything you aren't good at."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not much of a computer programmer," she laughed, then sighed when she saw his hurt expression.  "I didn't mean it that way.  I'm sorry."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No, I guess I'll get over it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Actually there is something."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've never tattooed myself."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence felt something cold seep through his system.  "I thought all that was behind you."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked at him and saw what was in his eyes -- was it fear or concern?  She put the spear aside and drew beside him.  "Some of it is behind me.  No more Death stunts.  This can be a good life, Lawrence, and I want it to go on as long as possible.  So don't worry about that.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But I always had this fantasy.  It went, if somehow Prime Intellect would disappear and everything would go back the way it was before, then I'd settle down and be like I was before.  I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've realized I'm never going to be like I was before.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm not a shy little grandma any more.  I've become a daredevil.  Getting tattooed hurts like hell and getting a big one takes damn near forever when you use primitive tools, but I've worn them for so long it doesn't feel right not to have any.  When I look down at my body I feel like something is missing."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She paused, chasing another thought.  "You know, we could probably settle right here and live long, comfortable, boring lives, but I've decided I don't want to do that.  When we get our shit together, which won't take more than a couple of months, I intend to provision us and go somewhere.  I've been thinking of Arkansas."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Arkansas!"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can't go back to being the person I was, but I can go home."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But that's got to be a thousand miles from here!  We have no maps, there's a desert..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Exactly.  It will be a wonderful challenge."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"A challenge?  We could be killed!"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She shrugged.  "Perhaps.  Probably not.  I'm very good at this sort of thing, Lawrence.  But yes, there would be risk.  It would be work.  But that's the point; it would be something to <i>do</i>.  I've been through this before, Lawrence.  Without something to do, life will get stale.  And I didn't go through all the shit I've gone through to be bored."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline's intensity startled him.  This was the Caroline he had known in Cyberspace, who had paddled around an entire planet simply to make a point.  Lawrence could not find the words to argue with her, so he just said "I guess you have a point there."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She snuggled up to him.  "I need parameters, Lawrence.  I need to be channeled.  I'm very happy right now, because there are no choices.  The road leads in only one direction.  I'm afraid that when we get to the choices, when the roads diverge, I'll lose this focus.  And it's been so long...I don't want to lose it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You've lost me, Caroline.  I don't understand what you're talking about."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Don't worry about it."  She kissed him, and they hugged tighter, and they spoke another language with their bodies as the fire crackled.

</p><p><b><tt>THE FALL + 2 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The Spring thaw had begun; soon it would be time to try crossing the first great natural barrier they would face, the Rocky Mountains.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had migrated far north of Silicon Valley, perhaps as far as Oregon, in the hopes of avoiding other barriers like the Grand Canyon and the great southwestern desert.  Their hope was to cross the mountains and set up camp for the winter in the eastern foothills, then move leisurely across the plains until they entered Arkansas through the Ozark Mountains.  Since neither of them remembered much detailed real-world geography, all their plans were tentative.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence sat by the edge of Caroline's chosen campsite and watched her set up.  He had long since learned to make a rudimentary camp, but Caroline preferred to do the work herself.  Meanwhile, he went through his bone needles and bags of pigment, preparing to do for Caroline the one thing she had to depend on him for.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She had decided that her motif for this lifetime would be birds, and the first bird she would wear would be a phoenix.  Its outline was nearly complete, a black tracing colored with soot collected from smoky fires.  The fierce bird reached for the sky, its upturned beak just grazing her neck and its wingtips grazing her shoulders.  In outline it resembled a bird of prey, but when Lawrence began to color it in he planned to use bright hues more remniscent of songbirds.  The flames of its rebirth exploded from the base of her spine, dim outlines waiting for him to find a better grade of red pigment.  The clays he had tried so far had not been bright enough in the small test lines he'd done.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence privately thought the tattooing was nuts, but he would never tell Caroline that; she could probably tell how he felt, anyway.  In any case he took his work very seriously, because what he was doing would become a permanent part, not just of a person, but of <i>Caroline</i>.  And while he thought she was crazy in many ways, he also loved her dearly.  If she wanted tattoos, he would give her tattoos.  And they would be perfect; he would accept nothing less.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The time and effort required to create such a large design were simply amazing.  They would make camp and spend hours with the needle, Caroline stoically enduring its jabs, and the result would be a few centimeters of black tracing or a tiny patch of color.  But the ritual of marking her seemed to awaken a deep passion in Caroline, and evenings that began with the needle nearly always ended with their most intense sex.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm ready," she announced.  "Are you?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He nodded.  She had spread out a deer hide beside the fire; now she lay on her stomach so he could work on her back.  Lawrence had begun to color in the phoenix's wing tips; he was working down her back symmetrically, so the incomplete design would be as attractive as possible.  Although Caroline was silent while he worked, he could feel her flinch each time he jabbed her with the needle.  Although they both invested the time, Caroline was the one who went through the pain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And her reward, Lawrence mused, would be a design over which she had no control, whose appearance she was trusting totally to him, and which she would take with her to the grave.  She might never even get to see it, unless some fortuitous circumstance arranged two mirror-like surfaces properly.  Anyone could see their face reflected in a pool of water, but getting a look at your own back was a real challenge in a world without glass or metal.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That's enough for tonight.  I want to get a look at it in better light before I do any more."  He put the needle in the pigment bag and put it with the others as Caroline turned over.  Lawrence was a cautious tattooist, always conscious of the fact that he couldn't undo what he was doing.  But there was nothing cautious about their fucking after the needles were put up.<p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Later still he pressed his ear to Caroline's belly, listening for the second heartbeat.  He couldn't hear it yet, though Caroline assured him it was there.  "Do you think the tattoo work is good for the baby?" he asked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're not tattooing the baby," she said.  "If it makes me feel joy, then why shouldn't it be good for her?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How do you know it's a her?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed.  "Before I was a dried-up old crone I had enough children to know what it feels like, Lawrence.  It's a girl."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">That settled it in Lawrence's mind:  He'd seen enough of Caroline's knowledge to know that you never bet against her.  But he was still a little surprised when the baby came, and it really was a girl.  By that time they had crossed the mountains, and had taken temporary shelter in the mouth of a "cave" that was really the ruin of an old mine.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline knelt by their fire and waited, so that gravity would help her baby come.  As the birth unfolded, Lawrence felt for the first time how crushingly alone they were.  If anything went wrong, there was very little he could do about it.  He felt a brief panic, wondering what he would do if by some catastrophe she died in childbirth.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But nothing went wrong, the baby dropped into Lawrence's waiting hands after only a few hours of labor, and both she and Caroline emerged from the experience healthy.  Lawrence figured that Caroline's general high state of health had a lot to do with that; she had not let her pregnancy slow them down until it was time to actually settle in for the birth itself.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As Caroline nursed and recovered, Lawrence explored the mine for a short distance, and found a small yellow pebble that amazingly turned out to be malleable.  It was the first metal they had encountered.  They speculated that perhaps this speck of gold had survived Prime Intellect's cleanup because it had been underground.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In any case, it was what inspired Caroline to name their baby girl Nugget.</p><p><b><tt>THE FALL + 4 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The mountains had started as a low haze on the horizon, then gradually grown as they had moved on.  Now they were within striking distance, and Lawrence remembered the adventure of crossing the Rockies, having to rappel down gorges with homemade rope and climb bare rock faces dozens of meters high with his bare hands.  Doing the same thing with a toddler and a new baby would not be a pleasant undertaking.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Caroline assured him that there would be no such problems.  "Those are the Ozarks," she said.  "They're dark, but passable.  I was born there, but I don't want to stop there.  I want to go on to the Ouachitas."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The new baby, a boy, had been born during their approach to the northern Ozark range, across the long-fallow fields of what had once been Kansas and Missouri.  Because they could see the mountains when he came, Caroline named him Ozark.  Nugget was not yet old enough to walk, so they carried both babies on cradleboards, a trick Caroline had learned in her studies of actual Native Americans.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Her tattoo phoenix was complete, but Caroline had gone on to ask for a swallow on her thigh.  Lawrence was convinced that she wouldn't stop until her body was completely covered, but it would take them many more years to accomplish that.  Because the skin was more sensitive, it hurt more when he jabbed her now.  At times she had to bite down on a piece of leather to keep from yelling.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But she always insisted that he keep working.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Did it take this long for your friend in Cyberspace to tattoo you?" he asked as he worked.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fred used a knife.  It's faster but less exact.  And we didn't have to do anything else."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Rub, jab, jab.  Rub, jab, jab.  Wipe, test, fill in where it didn't take.  Caroline nursed Nugget for awhile as he worked.  Then she let the baby watch, becoming hypnotized by the repetitive activity and finally falling asleep.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Don't you sometimes wish you had him here to do this instead of me?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To his surprise Caroline laughed.  "What a thought!  If I'd woken up here and found Fred under that tree ... or Palmer ... you know what I'd have done?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No idea."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'd have killed them before they got the bright idea to kill me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence looked up, startled.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"They weren't very nice people in real life, Lawrence.  I was real close to Fred, but only because it was Cyberspace.  There it was nothing but a sick game, and my friends were the people sick enough to make it interesting.  But here ... it isn't a game.  What I called love back there and what I call love here have nothing to do with one another."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What do you call love here?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Lie back and find out," she teased.  As Caroline rode him he looked to the side and saw Nugget watching them, and then he closed his eyes and let himself become lost in the feelings.

<p><tt><b>THE FALL + 14 YEARS</b></tt></p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It won't be long now, Lawrence."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was the only argument they had ever had.  But it had gone on for years.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had long since made their home on the ridge separating West Mountain and Music Mountain.  It had been tempting to settle on Hot Springs Mountain itself, nearer to the springs, but some instinct had told them that it wouldn't be proper to live on such a unique spot.  Besides, the ridge offered a number of different nearby micro-climates supporting a wide variety of gatherable plants and game.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Within the vacuum that was once the town itself, besides the negative impressions of long-disappeared buildings, a public fountain had survived, because it had been made almost entirely of cut stone.  The mortar had gone but the stones remained in their original positions.  It was not hard to plug the gaps with wooden shims, which would expand to make a water-tight seal when water was added, and to dig a channel guiding the spring's runoff back onto the splash plate so that it could fill the basin.  The spring had a chance to cool some as it ran down the mountain, so that the water temperature was suitable for a hot bath; even in the coldest part of winter, the water emerging directly from spring heads was hot enough to scald.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The man-made lakes which once surrounded the town had disappeared with still obvious violence, apparently when the dams restraining them had simply ceased to exist.  Floodwaters had cut deep gulleys in the valley lowlands, making them treacherous.  Occasionally they found arrowheads, which Caroline quietly buried; she had not introduced the bow and arrow to her family, and did not intend to.  There were also a couple of Civil War era fortifications, complete with descriptive signage engraved in stone.  Whenever she passed one of these, Caroline made sure to take a few swings at the sign with the heaviest available rock; she wanted them obliterated before her children learned to read.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She, of course, would never teach them such a ridiculous thing, but Lawrence was obstinate on the point and Caroline didn't think it would do any harm.  It would be forgotten in a few generations, since it served no purpose in their primitive lifestyle.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">To celebrate their arrival, Caroline had Lawrence work the gold nugget into a short wire.  She used it to pierce her nose, and then bent it into a simple ring.  After a while, Lawrence even got used to her wearing it all the time.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget and Ozark roamed freely, together and alone, sometimes miles from home.  From one of these expeditions Nugget returned with an improbable prize, a tiny ice-clear stone which caught the sunlight and reflected it in brilliant flashes.  It was a faceted diamond.  Caroline told her daughter only that it was exceedingly rare, letting her think it was somehow related to the natural quartz crystals which were all over the place.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In warm weather Nugget sometimes wore a loincloth, in Lawrence's fashion, and sometimes went nude like her mother.  Ozark had adopted Lawrence's more modest habits.  The younger children, male and female, went nude unless the weather required otherwise; Caroline refused to force them into modesty, and they had demonstrated little inclination in that direction.  All of the children had seen them having sex; Caroline insisted that they make no effort to hide it.  Fortunately, the kids seemed to accept their explanation that they were "playing an old peoples' game."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Except that Nugget would soon be ready to play it, too.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I can feel it.  In a month or two, she'll be a woman.  I haven't hidden it from her, you know; I've shown her my own period, and she knows what it's for."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Of course, you never hide anything from the kids, except technology."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How else would you do it?  You want to make them feel bad about themselves so they'll look to stones and metal for comfort?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You want them to maybe re-invent the wheel, then steam, then..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Caroline, stop it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You know where it leads."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Lawrence sighed.  "She's twelve years old."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"She's going to be a woman.  We've gone at this from every angle.  If you think we should try to start a community, then we have to consider genetic diversity, breeding years...we have to start as soon as possible, and we have to get as many combinations as possible off of our limited gene pool."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"We've gone over this a hundred times."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"But soon you will have to <i>do</i> it.  I want my daughter to have a proper coming of age.  You should also be thinking about Ozark; before long it will be time to do something for him."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Do something <i>to</i> him, you mean," Lawrence said sullenly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It's the only way, Lawrence."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">They had argued about it for more than six years, but when the time came he found himself powerless to contradict Caroline's will.  Fortunately she had spoken with Nugget, so his daughter did most of the work for him just as Caroline had done most of the work all along.  She explored his body with microscopic fascination, especially his cock which she carefully teased erect.  There was little really new for her in all this, since she had seen him fucking Caroline plenty of times.  He wouldn't have been surprised, either, to learn she had already been experimenting with Ozark.  What was new was that she was fertile, and so was he.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Working slowly, Nugget completed their incestuous coupling, working her way slowly down his cock just as Caroline had done that first time in California fourteen years earlier.  But while Nugget moved with her mother's carefulness and deliberation, she did not possess Caroline's amazing certitude.  And she was so small, like a feather atop him, and her grip on his cock so tight.  Lawrence found himself responding to her despite his reservations; his body was literally making up its own mind to go along.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he came he yelled out loud.  He was quite unprepared for its intensity, as if he was a participant in some primitive magic ritual which had unleashed a strange power in him.  In a sense, reflecting later, he would suppose that that was exactly what had happened.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But Nugget's coming of age ritual wasn't over yet.  With a beatific smile, she brought his tattoo pigments.  It was this idea as well as Nugget's age which had made him fight Caroline so hard.  But having already fucked his daughter he felt it pointless to put up further resistance.  Nugget had already decided she wanted a feather on her shoulder blade, in honor of her mother's bird tattoos.  At least it was a small and simple design, the work of a single sitting.  Lawrence completed it as quickly as possible.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Having covered nearly half of Caroline's body by this painstaking method, it was impossible for Lawrence to miss the difference in their reactions.  Unlike her mother, Nugget did not seem to get excited by the discomfort of tattooing.  If anything, she drifted into a serene kind of calm and even stopped flinching.  As he worked, he realized what the difference was; for Caroline, tattoos were a gateway to passion, but for Nugget, they would be the gateway to adulthood.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">When he finished they stood to face each other in silence.  Like her mother, Nugget might not ever see her first tattoo; Caroline still hadn't seen her phoenix.  "I don't know why this was so hard for you, Father, but thank you for doing it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">He smiled crookedly and touched her shoulder.  "You're a woman now, Nugget.  You should call me Lawrence."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And from that point on, she did.

<p><b><tt>THE FALL + 42 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Death always cast a solemn mood over the village; Ozark had lost his own second son, Limerick, to a fall from one of the cliffs on the far side of West Mountain.  In all their lives the funeral pyre atop Hot Springs Mountain had been built only four times.  Besides Limerick there had been two hunting accidents and a death in childbirth.  The pyre was not used for the various stillbirths and babies that had to be sacrificed because there was no hope for their survival; these, as Mother Caroline had taught them, had not ever been human and it was wrong to grieve for them in the same way.  Most of these were simply exposed and taken by animals.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">It was Ozark's first time to build the pyre.  As Eldest Father of the group, the task had always fallen to Lawrence; but now Ozark was the Eldest Father, because this pyre was <i>for</i> Lawrence.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Even Limerick's death had not caused Ozark to feel such crippling sorrow.  If it had not been for the need to do right by Father Lawrence he thought he might just find a cave and sit until he either starved or saw the vision that would heal his pain.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Ozark was not alone.  Although the task of readying the pyre was supposed to be solitary, nearly everyone had turned out to watch him work.  They stood back respectfully, observing the injunction against helping, but also watching his every movement, watching the limp form atop the wooden frame, as if Father Lawrence might display his obvious divinity one final time by rising directly into the sky on his own rather than waiting to ride the currents of the fire.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Of course Lawrence and Caroline had never attempted to convince their children that they were in any way different, but any fool could see that they were.  For one thing, who had been their parents?  For another, they knew things.  No matter what problem cropped up, one or the other of them always knew something to do about it.  And half that primal wisdom was now gone.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mother Caroline was the last to arrive, waiting quite properly until all preparations were complete.  She nodded, and Ozark prepared the flame.  It was not proper to use the offspring of a life-giving flame such as the campfire to light the pyre; Ozark was supposed to light a new flame starting with the fire bow.  It was a skill they all knew, and it took only a few minutes.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Ozark had done his work well.  The pyre went up fast.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The flames absolved Ozark of his responsibility and he stepped back among the crowd, where Nugget hugged him.  They watched Mother Caroline as the flames rose.  She was standing perfectly still, determined to show her strength in this painful hour.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But in the dancing light, they could easily see the tears running down her face.  And as the pyre burned down, she began to simply cry.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">None of them had ever experienced this phenomenon before.  It was almost as shocking to see Mother Caroline showing such a weakness as it was to be facing the loss of Father Lawrence.  As the pyre burned further her grief deepened, until she sank to her knees and wailed.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Tentatively, Ozark approached her.  She accepted his embrace and cried into his shoulder, finding if not comfort than at least the assurance that she was not alone in her grief.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But she was alone, more alone than any of them could ever know.  She had thought that her nearly six-century reign as Queen of the Death Jockeys and main consort of Fred the Psycho would have prepared her for nearly anything, but as black smoke drifted into the darkening Arkansas sky she found that she had no defences against the blacker pain of her own grief.

<p><b><tt>THE FALL + 73 YEARS</tt></b></p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget had moved the birch bark pages from hiding place to hiding place during her long life, selecting the first hollow tree for this purpose when she was only eight years old.  Some of the barks had deteriorated -- even the amazing birch had its limits -- and she had recopied her notes onto newer pages to preserve them.  Using the gift of writing, which she had learned from Father Lawrence, she had set about recording her parents' secrets, looking in her stolen snatches of overheard conversation for the pattern which would explain where they had come from and what their purpose had been in coming to this place to raise their family.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Mostly what she had was words, scraps of language whose meanings were completely unknown to her.  She fingered the bark, remembering the sounds she had heard, usually whispered quietly in the night when Caroline and Lawrence thought they were alone.  Some had always carried an accusatory tone, as if they were somehow dirty:<p>

Usually these discussions would end with some relatively simple trick being revealed that diverted the stream, removed the stain, or whatever was called for, but sometimes the discussions went on for long hours as various options were discussed, and these words were more often heard on Lawrence's lips:</p><p>

</i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget often wondered what manner of tree the Trigonomee was, and what its useful properties might be.  At least a tree was something she could visualize; what, on the other hand, was a gravitee, and how was a spesifik gravitee different from any other kind?  Lawrence had never spoken of any other kind, at least not within earshot of Nugget.<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Then there were the words concerning origins, which were spoken with such loathing or sorrow that their importance was crystal clear, if not their meanings:</p><p>
<i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">SIBERSPASE<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">KOMPEWTER<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">CHANGE<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">PRIMINTELEKT</i></p><p><i>
</i>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1"><i>Change</i> was an ordinary enough word, but there was nothing ordinary about the way her parents said it when they thought they were alone.  Sometimes, when Caroline was very tired, she would talk of the "World Before."  She would never say much about it; someone might say it was a shame they could not find game without a long and tiring search, or kill a bear without getting dangerously close to it, and Caroline would mutter that "that was something for the World Before."  Before what?  Before the Change, perhaps?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">In any case, she had to find out soon or never, because Caroline was dying.  She had never quite been the same after Lawrence's death, but she had still been active, even energetic.  She just hadn't taken such a direct role in the community's activities.  She had gradually loosened her grip, to the point that now there were many youngsters who had never even met her.  Then she had gotten slower and quieter, and lately it had become quite hard for her to walk up a difficult slope.  Nugget wasn't so young herself; she had already survived Ozark, who had died in his sleep, and her youngest brother Pilgrim was fading fast.  He had some kind of condition which made his movements painful, and for which Mother Caroline's wisdom had offered no help.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">And now for two days she hadn't eaten.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I have ripe blackberries," Nugget said as she approached Caroline's shelter.  "They will do you good."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline looked at Nugget, and could see that Nugget suspected.  "You know I have no need of those," she said softly.  "My time is coming."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget was surprised how tiny and despairing her voice sounded when she said, "Why?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline laughed, and coughed a little.  "I have to," she said.  "It would be wrong to try and fight it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Mother, I need to talk to you before you go."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline smiled.  "About what, child, your birch tablets?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget froze, her eyes wide.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I've known about those for more than fifty years.  They seemed harmless enough, and your father and I figured that if they were the most you could make of our indiscretions, then we weren't doing too badly."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Fifty years," Nugget said numbly.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your father was flattered.  I thought we should confront you with them and tell you to stop, but it would have probably caused more trouble than it was worth.  I'll make you a deal, daughter.  Help your old mother to the spring so I can take a hot bath, and I'll tell you a story.  I'll tell you a story about the World Before."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Tears welled in Nugget's eyes.  "Fifty years.  You make a fool of me for my entire life, then..."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"You're not a fool, daughter.  I'll tell you why we did it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If I ... If I ..."  Nugget sobbed.  "If I help you down, I'm not sure you'll be able to make it back up the path."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I don't think that will be a problem."<br>
<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Still weeping, Nugget helped Caroline to her feet and down the first steps to the path to the old fountain.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The hot water slipped around her like a velvet skin, and Caroline tried to slip into the past.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Daughter, do you have any idea how old I am?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'm counted seventy-one solstices, so you must have seen at least eighty-five."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I am over seven hundred and seventy years old."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget sobbed louder.  "Please, mother, don't tell me lies at a time like this."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"No lies, child.  I lived a hundred and six years in the World Before, and I was dying then as I am dying now.  I didn't know it, but your father was working as I was dying.  He was a great man.  There has never been another like him, but he was not perfect and he made one terrible mistake.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"With the help of many thousands of other people, your father built a vast and complicated thing.  The word for it is on your tablets; it was called a computer.  That's nothing but a meaningless word to you, and that's all it needs to be.  But of all the artisans who dedicated themselves to the making of the computer, your father was the most important, because he was the one that taught it to think.  Without the others to help him Lawrence could not have made the computer, but without Lawrence, the others could not have made it live; you have to remember that."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Okay, Mother."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The computer could not disobey Lawrence, but he was afraid other people would use it for bad purposes.  So he taught it to answer first to its own conscience, the conscience he had created for it.  Then your father set it loose, confident that it was capable of doing only good for the people of the World Before.  Even Lawrence himself would not be able to make it contradict its nature."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She paused, and Nugget prodded her.  "What happened?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"The computer got a bright idea," Caroline said in a sour voice.  "It figured out how to make people immortal.  So it made us immortal."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Just like that?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"That was the least of its powers.  It remade the world.  There was nothing we couldn't have for the asking.  There was nothing we couldn't do.  Nothing could ever hurt us."  She coughed again.  "It was fucking boring."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Their eyes met.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was the worst thing ever.  Nothing mattered.  Not pain, not accomplishments, not anything."  Caroline touched one of Nugget's tattoos, the small spiral which Ozark had tattooed above her right breast to celebrate their first coupling after his Vision Quest, when they were finally both adults.  "After the Change, the World Before became another of the words you overheard.  Cyberspace.  In Cyberspace, all you'd have to do is make a wish and your tattoos would be gone."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Involuntarily, Nugget put her hand over Caroline's, as if to defend the design.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Or you could move 'em around.  Get new ones -- it didn't take any time, didn't have to hurt.  See?  Nothing mattered.  I've worn many different sets of tattoos myself.  But these are the ones that matter to me, because these are the ones I'll die with.  That was the least of it, of course.  You could grow a few extra arms, turn yourself into a bat, fly like a bird, whatever you wanted.  But why bother?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Mother...What happened then?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"For almost six hundred years, nothing happened worth mentioning.  Then, finally, your father and I killed it."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"How?  If it was so powerful, how could you kill it?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Your father built it, remember.  He'd never designed it to run the whole world, only to be a good helper.  He knew its weaknesses.  So we were able to trick it, and it broke."  She swept her hand.  "Somehow we ended up here."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget dipped her hand in the hot water and splashed her face.  None of this was what she had expected.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"If you will do something else for me, I'll tell you one more thing."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What, Mother?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Promise me that you will give the birch barks to the Eldest Father to be burned with me.  Those words belong to the World Before.  They may be harmless, but I'd rather not have your father's only memory be those reminders of his worst failure."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"What will you tell me for promising this?"<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"I'll tell you the computer's name."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">She looked down.  "I'll burn them, Mother.  There's nothing I can hope to learn from them now, anyway."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"It was called Prime Intellect."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget nodded.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Now if you value the memory of your father, you will never repeat that or any of your other words to anybody else.  Let them die with me."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"As you wish, Mother."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">"Then leave me alone to rest."<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Nugget didn't have to ask for how long.</p><p>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">Caroline was too thin to float in the hot water, so she let her head fall back on the hard stone fountain wall and looked up at the Sun.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">If she could somehow pull it off again, magically rise from the healing waters as a young girl and return to her people, she would do it.  They needed her.  There were so few of them, and the challenges they faced so great, that their survival was far from certain.  One disease or natural disaster could wipe them out.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But that's the way it was with things that mattered; you never got to find out how they came out, if they were really worth anything.  Caroline had done her part.  She had made her decisions and stood her ground.  One day somebody would figure out how to use the fire bow to launch arrows and how to make them fly true.  Then someone would shoot one at his brother.  Caroline had done what she could to put that day as far as possible in the future.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">As a result some of her children would die, because in order to hunt they would have to get close to their prey, close enough for their prey to strike back.  This playing God business sure was a pain in the ass, Caroline thought.  No wonder Lawrence had gone a little loopy in Cyberspace.<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">But he had been a good man.  He had never approved of Caroline's plan for their family, to act like some kind of snide Prometheus who <i>could</i> have given them the secrets of metalworking and gunpowder and steam power but who didn't bother because it was more amusing to make them struggle in stone-age savagery.  Yet he had gone along, because he already knew the other way didn't work.  If this way didn't work either, what would it mean?<br>

<img src="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/1pix.gif" width="36" height="1">The doubts and questions circled in her head endlessly, chasing for an answer that would never come.  They were still chasing when she slipped beneath the trickling waters and found darkness.</p><p><b><tt>* END</tt></b></p></td><td>&nbsp;</td>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Writing recently </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/will-the-humanities-survive-artificial-intelligence" rel="">in </a><em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/will-the-humanities-survive-artificial-intelligence" rel="">The New Yorker</a></em><span>, the historian of science D. Graham Burnett described how he has been thinking about AI:</span></p><blockquote><p>In one department on campus, a recently drafted anti-A.I. policy, read literally, would actually have barred faculty from giving assignments to students that centered on A.I. (It was ultimately revised.) Last year, when some distinguished alums and other worthies conducted an external review of the history department, a top recommendation was that we urgently address the looming A.I. disruptions to our teaching and research. This suggestion got a notably cool reception. But the idea that we can just keep going about our business won‚Äôt do, either.</p><p><span>On the contrary, staggering transformations are in full swing. And yet, on campus, we‚Äôre in a bizarre interlude: everyone seems intent on pretending that the most significant revolution in the world of thought in the past century </span><em>isn‚Äôt happening</em><span>. The approach appears to be: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just tell the kids they can‚Äôt use these tools and carry on as before.‚Äù This is, simply, madness. And it won‚Äôt hold for long. It‚Äôs time to talk about what all this means for university life, and for the humanities in particular.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I suspect that a significant chunk of my historian colleagues had a negative reaction to this article. But I wholeheartedly agree with the central point Burnett makes within it ‚Äî&nbsp;not that generative AI is inherently good, but simply that it is </span><em>already</em><span> transformative for the humanities, and that this fact cannot be ignored or dismissed as hype. </span></p><p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm currently thinking about that transformation. </p><p>Ignoring the impact of AI on humanistic work is not just increasingly untenable. It is also foolish, because humanistic knowledge and skills are central to what it is that AI language models actually do. </p><p>The language translation, sorting, and classification abilities of AI language models ‚Äî&nbsp;the LLM as a ‚Äúcalculator for words‚Äù ‚Äî are among the most compelling uses for the current frontier models.  We‚Äôre only beginning to see these impacts in domains like paleography, data mining, and translation of archaic languages. I discussed some examples here:</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/generative-ai-for-historical-research" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d8fe561-f43e-4208-9e50-777c7accc7f1_1940x1153.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d8fe561-f43e-4208-9e50-777c7accc7f1_1940x1153.png" sizes="100vw" alt="How to use generative AI for historical research" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p>‚Ä¶ and the state of the art has progressed quite a bit since then.

But the other factors in play (such as prioritizing user feedback via a ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù button) were similarly rooted in big-picture humanistic concerns like the impact of language on behavior, cross-cultural differences, and questions of rhetoric, genre, and tone.  </p><p>This is fascinating to me. When an IBM mainframe system broke down in the 1950s (or a steam engine exploded in the 1850s), the people who had to fix it likely did not spare a moment‚Äôs thought to consider any of these topics. </p><p>Today, engineers working on AI systems also need to think deeply and critically about the relationship between language and culture and the history and philosophy of technology. When they fail to do so, their systems literally start to break down. </p><p>Then there‚Äôs the newfound ability of non-technical people in the humanities to write their own code. This is a bigger deal than many in my field seem to recognize. I suspect this will change soon. The emerging generation of historians will simply take it for granted that they can create their own custom research and teaching tools and deploy them at will, more or less for free. </p><p>My own efforts so far have mostly been focused on two niche educational games modeled on old school text-based adventures ‚Äî&nbsp;not exactly something with a huge potential audience.

There‚Äôs no denying it, and it needs to be taken seriously by educators, students, politicians, and above all by the frontier AI labs themselves. </p><p><span> Educators tend to point to the ways ChatGPT and its competitors have affected </span><em>us ‚Äî&nbsp;</em><span>eroding our ability to accurately assess student writing because such a large proportion of students turn in machine-generated essays, and forcing us to come up with entirely new assignments and lesson plans as a result. </span></p><p><span>But in the longer run, the damage is being done to students. By making effort an optional factor in higher education rather than the whole </span><em>point </em><span>of it, LLMs risk producing a generation of students who have simply </span><em>never experienced </em><span>the feeling of focused intellectual work. Students who have never faced writer‚Äôs block are also students who have never experienced the blissful flow state that comes when you break through writer‚Äôs block. Students who have never searched fruitlessly in a library for hours are also students who, in a fundamental and distressing way, simply don‚Äôt know what a library is even for. </span></p><p><em>New York Magazine</em><span> has a new </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel="">article</a><span> on student use of ChatGPT which captures the  problem well. Here‚Äôs a Columbia student who speaks for a significant chunk of the current university population:</span></p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúMost assignments in college are not relevant,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.‚Äù While other new students fretted over the university‚Äôs rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as ‚Äúintellectually expansive‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonally transformative,‚Äù Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. When I asked him why he had gone through so much trouble to get to an Ivy League university only to off-load all of the learning to a robot, he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>I will speak frankly. This sucks. </p><p>It sucks the joy out of teaching, and it sucks the meaning out of the whole experience of getting an education. </p><p>When I was a postdoc at Columbia, I taught one of the core curriculum classes mentioned here, with a reading list that included over a dozen weighty tomes (one week was spent on the Bible, the next week on the Quran, another on Thomas Aquinas, and so on). There wasn‚Äôt much that was fun or easy about it. And yet ‚Äî&nbsp;probably for that very reason ‚Äî I learned more from teaching that class than from any other. Something fundamental about that experience feels like it‚Äôs ruined now. </p><p><span>But this is not the entire story. The middle part of D. Graham Burnett‚Äôs </span><em>New Yorker </em><span>piece strikes me as an important corrective to this sort of thing. Burnett is, I think it‚Äôs fair to say, rapturous about his students‚Äô response to an assignment asking them to discuss the concept of attention with ChatGPT, then edit and submit the results. </span></p><p>Here‚Äôs a sample:</p><blockquote><p>Reading the results, on my living-room couch, turned out to be the most profound experience of my teaching career. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it. In a basic way, I felt I was watching a new kind of creature being born, and also watching a generation come face to face with that birth: an encounter with something part sibling, part rival, part careless child-god, part mechanomorphic shadow‚Äîan alien familiar.</p></blockquote><p><span>I have had the same feelings, for instance when I first began tinkering with </span><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/simulating-history-with-chatgpt" rel="">history simulation assignments</a><span>. Language models are a genuinely novel teaching tool. Their impact is still uncertain. What that means is that now is </span><em>exactly </em><span>the time when people who are genuinely passionate about teaching and learning for its own sake ‚Äî&nbsp;not as a scorecard to judge politicians, not as a source of corporate profit ‚Äî&nbsp;need to take an active role. </span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://resobscura.substack.com/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>My greatest concern when it comes to LLMs in humanities education is that they will lead to a further polarization in educational outcomes.

    <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>A critical </span><span>component</span><span> of healthcare, blood transfusions play a vital role in saving lives around the globe every day. Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O</span><span>‚Äì</span><span>negative blood ‚Äî the universal donor type ‚Äî often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at <a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nara Medical University</a>. </span><span>They‚Äôve</span><span> developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>The artificial blood is created by extracting hemoglobin ‚Äî a protein </span><span>containing</span><span> iron that </span><span>facilitates</span><span> the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells ‚Äî from expired donor blood. It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can </span><span>reportedly be</span><span> stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of </span><span>42 days</span><span>. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="683d47927a6cd"><span data-contrast="auto">Artificial Blood Trials </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles ‚Äî artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells ‚Äî in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin</span><span>ing</span><span> the treatment‚Äôs efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University‚Äôs Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p>A heartfelt provocation about AI-assisted programming.</p>
<p>Tech execs are mandating LLM adoption. That‚Äôs bad strategy. But I get where they‚Äôre coming from.</p>

<p>Some of the smartest people I know share a bone-deep belief that AI is a fad ‚Äî  the next iteration of NFT mania. I‚Äôve been reluctant to push back on them, because, well, they‚Äôre smarter than me. But their arguments are unserious, and worth confronting. Extraordinarily talented people are doing work that LLMs already do better, out of  spite.</p>

<p>All progress on LLMs could halt today, and LLMs would remain the 2nd most important thing to happen over the course of my career.</p>
<p><strong>Important caveat</strong>: I‚Äôm discussing only the implications of LLMs for software development. For art, music, and writing? I got nothing. I‚Äôm inclined to believe the skeptics in those fields. I just don‚Äôt believe them about mine.</p>
<p>Bona fides: I‚Äôve been shipping software since the mid-1990s. I started out in boxed, shrink-wrap C code.  Survived an ill-advised <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Design-Generic-Programming-Patterns/dp/0201704315" title="">Alexandrescu</a> C++ phase. Lots of Ruby and Python tooling.  Some kernel work. A whole lot of server-side C, Go, and Rust. However you define ‚Äúserious developer‚Äù, I qualify. Even if only on one of your lower tiers.</p>
<h3 id="level-setting"><a href="#level-setting" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>level setting</span></h3><p>‚Ä† (or, God forbid, 2 years ago with Copilot)</p>
<p>First, we need to get on the same page. If you were trying and failing to use an LLM for code 6 months ago ‚Ä†, you‚Äôre not doing what most serious LLM-assisted coders are doing.</p>

<p>People coding with LLMs today use agents. Agents get to poke around your codebase on their own. They author files directly. They run tools. They compile code, run tests, and iterate on the results. They also:</p>

<ul>
<li>pull in arbitrary code from the tree, or from other trees online, into their context windows,
</li><li>run standard Unix tools to navigate the tree and extract information,
</li><li>interact with Git,
</li><li>run existing tooling, like linters, formatters, and model checkers, and
</li><li>make essentially arbitrary tool calls (that you set up) through MCP.
</li></ul>
<p>The code in an agent that actually ‚Äúdoes stuff‚Äù with code is not, itself, AI. This should reassure you. It‚Äôs surprisingly simple systems code, wired to ground truth about programming in the same way a Makefile is. You could write an effective coding agent in a weekend. Its strengths would have more to do with how you think about and structure builds and linting and test harnesses than with how advanced o3 or Sonnet have become.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre making requests on a ChatGPT page and then pasting the resulting (broken) code into your editor, you‚Äôre not doing what the AI boosters are doing. No wonder you‚Äôre talking past each other.</p>
<h3 id="the-positive-case"><a href="#the-positive-case" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>the positive case</span></h3>
<p><img alt="four quadrants of tedium and importance" src="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/assets/code-quad.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you‚Äôll ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious. LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you‚Äôll ever need to Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they don‚Äôt get tired; they‚Äôre immune to inertia.</p>

<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn‚Äôt. You tried to home in on some first steps. If you‚Äôd been in the limerent phase of a new programming language, you‚Äôd have started writing. But you weren‚Äôt, so you put it off, for a day, a year, or your whole career.</p>

<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a downside. Sometimes, gnarly stuff needs doing. But you don‚Äôt wanna do it. So you refactor unit tests, soothing yourself with the lie that you‚Äôre doing real work. But an LLM can be told to go refactor all your unit tests. An agent can occupy itself for hours putzing with your tests in a VM and come back later with a PR. If you listen to me, you‚Äôll know that. You‚Äôll feel worse yak-shaving. You‚Äôll end up doing‚Ä¶ real work.</p>
<h3 id="but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is"><a href="#but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but you have no idea what the code is</span></h3>
<p>Are you a vibe coding Youtuber? Can you not read code? If so: astute point. Otherwise: what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>

<p>You‚Äôve always been responsible for what you merge to <code>main</code>. You were five years go. And you are tomorrow, whether or not you use an LLM.</p>

<p>If you build something with an LLM that people will depend on, read the code. In fact, you‚Äôll probably do more than that. You‚Äôll spend 5-10 minutes knocking it back into your own style. LLMs are <a href="https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules" title="">showing signs of adapting</a> to local idiom, but we‚Äôre not there yet.</p>

<p>People complain about LLM-generated code being ‚Äúprobabilistic‚Äù. No it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs code. It‚Äôs not Yacc output. It‚Äôs knowable. The LLM might be stochastic. But the LLM doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is whether you can make sense of the result, and whether your guardrails hold.</p>

<p>Reading other people‚Äôs code is part of the job. If you can‚Äôt metabolize the boring, repetitive code an LLM generates: skills issue! How are you handling the chaos human developers turn out on a deadline?</p>
<p>‚Ä† (because it can hold 50-70kloc in its context window)</p>
<p>For the last month or so, Gemini 2.5 has been my go-to ‚Ä†. Almost nothing it spits out for me merges without edits. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a skill to getting a SOTA model to one-shot a feature-plus-merge! But I don‚Äôt care. I like moving the code around and chuckling to myself while I delete all the stupid comments. I have to read the code line-by-line anyways.</p>
<h3 id="but-hallucination"><a href="#but-hallucination" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but hallucination</span></h3>
<p>If hallucination matters to you, your programming language has let you down.</p>

<p>Agents lint. They compile and run tests. If their LLM invents a new function signature, the agent sees the error. They feed it back to the LLM, which says ‚Äúoh, right, I totally made that up‚Äù and then tries again.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll only notice this happening if you watch the chain of thought log your agent generates. Don‚Äôt. This is why I like <a href="https://zed.dev/agentic" title="">Zed‚Äôs agent mode</a>: it begs you to tab away and let it work, and pings you with a desktop notification when it‚Äôs done.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure there are still environments where hallucination matters. But ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù is the first thing developers bring up when someone suggests using LLMs, despite it being (more or less) a solved problem.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer"><a href="#but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the code is shitty, like that of a junior developer</span></h3>
<p>Does an intern cost $20/month? Because that‚Äôs what Cursor.ai costs.</p>

<p>Part of being a senior developer is making less-able coders productive, be they fleshly or algebraic. Using agents well is both a both a  skill and an engineering project all its own, of prompts, indices, <a href="https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/" title="">and (especially) tooling.</a> LLMs only produce shitty code if you let them.</p>
<p>‚Ä† (Also: 100% of all the Bash code you should author ever again)</p>
<p>Maybe the current confusion is about who‚Äôs doing what work. Today, LLMs do a lot of typing, Googling, test cases ‚Ä†, and edit-compile-test-debug cycles. But even the most Claude-poisoned serious developers in the world still own curation, judgement, guidance, and direction.</p>

<p>Also: let‚Äôs stop kidding ourselves about how good our human first cuts really are.</p>
<h3 id="but-its-bad-at-rust"><a href="#but-its-bad-at-rust" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it‚Äôs bad at rust</span></h3>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to get a good toolchain for Brainfuck, too. Life‚Äôs tough in the aluminum siding business.</p>
<p>‚Ä† (and they surely will; the Rust community takes tooling seriously)</p>
<p>A lot of LLM skepticism probably isn‚Äôt really about LLMs. It‚Äôs projection. People say ‚ÄúLLMs can‚Äôt code‚Äù when what they really mean is ‚ÄúLLMs can‚Äôt write Rust‚Äù. Fair enough! But people select languages in part based on how well LLMs work with them, so Rust people should get on that ‚Ä†.</p>

<p>I work mostly in Go. I‚Äôm confident the designers of the Go programming language didn‚Äôt set out to produce the most LLM-legible language in the industry. They succeeded nonetheless Go has just enough type safety, an extensive standard library, and a culture that prizes (often repetitive) idiom. LLMs kick ass generating it.</p>

<p>All this is to say: I write some Rust. I like it fine. If LLMs and Rust aren‚Äôt working for you, I feel you. But if that‚Äôs your whole thing, we‚Äôre not having the same argument.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-craft"><a href="#but-the-craft" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the craft</span></h3>
<p>Do you like fine Japanese woodworking? All hand tools and sashimono joinery? Me too. Do it on your own time.</p>
<p>‚Ä† (I‚Äôm a piker compared to my woodworking friends)</p>
<p>I have a basic wood shop in my basement ‚Ä†. I could get a lot of satisfaction from building a table. And, if that table is a workbench or a grill table, sure, I‚Äôll build it. But if I need, like, a table? For people to sit at? In my office? I buy a fucking table.</p>

<p>Professional software developers are in the business of solving practical problems for people with code. We are not, in our day jobs, artisans. Steve Jobs was wrong: we do not need to carve the unseen feet in the sculpture. Nobody cares if the logic board traces are pleasingly routed. If anything we build endures, it won‚Äôt be because the codebase was beautiful.</p>

<p>Besides, that‚Äôs not really what happens. If you‚Äôre taking time carefully golfing functions down into graceful, fluent, minimal functional expressions, alarm bells should ring. You‚Äôre yak-shaving. The real work has depleted your focus. You‚Äôre not building: you‚Äôre self-soothing.</p>

<p>Which, wait for it, is something LLMs are good for. They devour schlep, and clear a path to the important stuff, where your judgement and values really matter.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-mediocrity"><a href="#but-the-mediocrity" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the mediocrity</span></h3>
<p>As a mid-late career coder, I‚Äôve come to appreciate mediocrity. You should be so lucky as to  have it flowing almost effortlessly from a tap.</p>

<p>We all write mediocre code. Mediocre code: often fine. Not all code is equally important. Some code should be mediocre. Maximum effort on a random unit test? You‚Äôre doing something wrong. Your team lead should correct you.</p>

<p>Developers all love to preen about code. They worry LLMs lower the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù for quality. Maybe. But they also raise the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù.</p>

<p>Gemini‚Äôs floor is higher than my own.  My code looks nice. But it‚Äôs not as thorough. LLM code is repetitive. But mine includes dumb contortions where I got too clever trying to DRY things up.</p>

<p>And LLMs aren‚Äôt mediocre on every axis. They almost certainly have a bigger bag of algorithmic tricks than you do: radix tries, topological sorts, graph reductions, and LDPC codes. Humans romanticize <code>rsync</code> (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/cas/tridgell96.pdf" title="">Andrew Tridgell</a> wrote a paper about it!). To an LLM it might not be that much more interesting than a SQL join.</p>

<p>But I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. It doesn‚Äôt matter. If truly mediocre code is all we ever get from LLM, that‚Äôs still huge. It‚Äôs that much less mediocre code humans have to write.</p>
<h3 id="but-itll-never-be-agi"><a href="#but-itll-never-be-agi" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it‚Äôll never be AGI</span></h3>
<p>I don‚Äôt give a shit.</p>

<p>Smart practitioners get wound up by the AI/VC hype cycle. I can‚Äôt blame them. But it‚Äôs not an argument. Things either work or they don‚Äôt, no matter what Jensen Huang has to say about it.</p>
<h3 id="but-they-take-rr-jerbs"><a href="#but-they-take-rr-jerbs" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but they take-rr jerbs</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776612" title="">So does open source.</a> We used to pay good money for databases.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre a field premised on automating other people‚Äôs jobs away. ‚ÄúProductivity gains,‚Äù say the economists. You get what that means, right? Fewer people doing the same stuff. Talked to a travel agent lately? Or a floor broker? Or a record store clerk? Or a darkroom tech?</p>

<p>When this argument comes up, libertarian-leaning VCs start the chant: lamplighters, creative destruction, new kinds of work. Maybe. But I‚Äôm not hypnotized. I have no fucking clue whether we‚Äôre going to be better off after LLMs. Things could get a lot worse for us.</p>

<p>LLMs really might displace many software developers. That‚Äôs not a high horse we get to ride. Our jobs are just as much in tech‚Äôs line of fire as everybody else‚Äôs have been for the last 3 decades. We‚Äôre not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_port_strike" title="">East Coast dockworkers</a>; we won‚Äôt stop progress on our own.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-plagiarism"><a href="#but-the-plagiarism" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the plagiarism</span></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is profoundly ‚Äî and probably unfairly ‚Äî threatening to visual artists in ways that might be hard to appreciate if you don‚Äôt work in the arts.</p>

<p>We imagine artists spending their working hours pushing the limits of expression. But the median artist isn‚Äôt producing gallery pieces. They produce on brief: turning out competent illustrations and compositions for magazine covers, museum displays, motion graphics, and game assets.</p>

<p>LLMs easily ‚Äî alarmingly ‚Äî clear industry quality bars . Gallingly, one of the things they‚Äôre best at is churning out just-good-enough facsimiles of human creative work.  I have family in visual arts. I can‚Äôt talk to them about LLMs. I don‚Äôt blame them. They‚Äôre probably not wrong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, software developers spot code fragments <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">seemingly lifted</a> from public repositories on Github and lose their shit. What about the licensing? If you‚Äôre a lawyer, I defer. But if you‚Äôre a software developer playing this card? Cut me a little slack as I ask you to shove this concern up your ass. No profession has demonstrated more contempt for intellectual property.</p>

<p>The median dev thinks Star Wars and Daft Punk are a public commons. The great cultural project of developers has been opposing any protection that might inconvenience a monetizable media-sharing site. When they fail at policy, they route around it with coercion. They stand up global-scale piracy networks and sneer at anybody who so much as tries to preserve a new-release window for a TV show.</p>

<p>Call any of this out if you want to watch a TED talk about how hard it is to stream <em>The Expanse</em> on LibreWolf. Yeah, we get it. You don‚Äôt believe in IPR. Then shut the fuck up about IPR. Reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs all special pleading anyways. LLMs digest code further than you do. If you don‚Äôt believe a typeface designer can stake a moral claim on the terminals and counters of a letterform, you sure as hell can‚Äôt be possessive about a red-black tree.</p>
<h3 id="positive-case-redux"><a href="#positive-case-redux" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>positive case redux</span></h3>
<p>When I started writing a couple days ago, I wrote a section to ‚Äúlevel set‚Äù to the  state of the art of LLM-assisted programming. A bluefish filet has a longer shelf life than an LLM take. In the time it took you to read this, everything changed.</p>

<p>Kids today don‚Äôt just use agents; they use asynchronous agents. They wake up, free-associate 13 different things for their LLMs to work on, make coffee, fill out a TPS report, drive to the Mars Cheese Castle, and then check their notifications. They‚Äôve got 13 PRs to review. Three get tossed and re-prompted. Five of them get the same feedback a junior dev gets. And five get merged.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sipping rocket fuel right now,‚Äù</em> a friend tells me. <em>‚ÄúThe folks on my team who aren‚Äôt embracing AI? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre standing still.‚Äù</em> He‚Äôs not bullshitting me. He doesn‚Äôt work in SFBA. He‚Äôs got no reason to lie.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs plenty of things I can‚Äôt trust an LLM with. No LLM has any of access to prod here. But I‚Äôve been first responder on an incident and fed 4o ‚Äî not o4-mini, 4o ‚Äî log transcripts, and watched it in seconds spot LVM metadata corruption issues on a host we‚Äôve been complaining about for months. Am I better than an LLM agent at interrogating OpenSearch logs and Honeycomb traces? No. No, I am not.</p>

<p>To the consternation of many of my friends, I‚Äôm not a radical or a futurist. I‚Äôm a statist. I believe in the haphazard perseverance of complex systems, of institutions, of reversions to the mean. I write Go and Python code. I‚Äôm not a Kool-aid drinker.</p>

<p>But something real is happening. My smartest friends are blowing it off. Maybe I persuade you. Probably I don‚Äôt. But we need to be done making space for bad arguments.</p>

<p>And here I rejoin your company. I read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/" title="">Simon Willison</a>, and that‚Äôs all I really need. But all day, every day, a sizable chunk of the front page of HN is allocated to LLMs: incremental model updates, startups doing things with LLMs, LLM tutorials, screeds against LLMs. It‚Äôs annoying!</p>

<p>But AI is also incredibly ‚Äî a word I use advisedly ‚Äî important. It‚Äôs getting the same kind of attention that smart phones got in 2008, and not as much as the Internet got. That seems about right.</p>

<p>I think this is going to get clearer over the next year. The cool kid haughtiness about ‚Äústochastic parrots‚Äù and ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù can‚Äôt survive much more contact with reality. I‚Äôm snarking about these people, but I meant what I said: they‚Äôre smarter than me. And when they get over this affectation, they‚Äôre going to make coding agents profoundly more effective than they are today.</p>

<p>Modern web development requires complicated dependencies and extensive boilerplate spread over multiple languages to make good UI. <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/">MonsterUI</a> is here to fix that.</p>
<section id="the-problem-with-web-ui-development">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-web-ui-development">The Problem with Web UI Development</h2>
<p>Building attractive web applications has always been complicated. <a href="https://www.fastht.ml/" target="_blank">FastHTML</a> simplifies web app development by bringing HTMX, Starlette, HTML, and HTTP fundamentals together.</p>
<p>Getting the aesthetics right is still too hard. It requires either extensive <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a>, a framework with long inline class strings, or both. You might try <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> CSS. Now, you‚Äôre managing class names, remembering utility patterns, and checking docs for boilerplate class strings. This leads to code that is hard to build, maintain, and change for anyone who is not an expert designer.</p>
<p>A typical app has many components: nav bars, forms, modals, cards, and more. Each requires careful consideration of styling, responsive behavior, and interactive states. As your application grows, managing these styles consistently becomes more and more challenging.</p>
<p>This became apparent to me while I was developing web apps. I found myself copying and pasting class strings and maintaining complex styling logic across multiple components. FastHTML made the application logic development a joy, but the styling side remained a constant source of friction.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre tired of context-switching between HTML, CSS, and Python just to build basic web UIs, <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/" target="_blank">MonsterUI</a> might be for you.</p>

<p><code>MonsterUI</code> lets anyone build high-quality, modern web apps in pure Python without sacrificing design quality.</p>
<div>
<figure>

<p><code>MonsterUI</code> is a layer on top of FastHTML that provides pre-styled components and smart defaults based on modern libraries (such as Tailwind, FrankenUI, DaisyUI) while maintaining full access to Tailwind CSS when you need it. MonsterUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brings FastHTML‚Äôs simplicity to web styling.</li>
<li>Provides beautiful, responsive components without writing a single CSS class.<br>
</li>
<li>Lets you focus on building features instead of remembering utility classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs learn by example with a card for team members:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>def</span> TeamCard(name, role, location<span>=</span><span>"Remote"</span>):</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    icons <span>=</span> (<span>"mail"</span>, <span>"linkedin"</span>, <span>"github"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span>return</span> Card(</span>
<span id="cb1-4">        DivLAligned(</span>
<span id="cb1-5">            DiceBearAvatar(name, h<span>=</span><span>24</span>, w<span>=</span><span>24</span>),</span>
<span id="cb1-6">            Div(H3(name), P(role))),</span>
<span id="cb1-7">        footer<span>=</span>DivFullySpaced(</span>
<span id="cb1-8">            DivHStacked(UkIcon(<span>"map-pin"</span>, height<span>=</span><span>16</span>), P(location)),</span>
<span id="cb1-9">            DivHStacked(<span>*</span>(UkIconLink(icon, height<span>=</span><span>16</span>) <span>for</span> icon <span>in</span> icons))))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I specified the entire layout, font sizing, icons, and avatar using only Python. I controlled everything without needing special flexbox or CSS class knowledge.</p>

<section id="what-monsterui-does-for-you">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-monsterui-does-for-you">What MonsterUI does for you</h2>
<p><code>MonsterUI</code> is based on a simple principle: provide smart defaults while allowing full flexibility.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve done this by builing upon proven approaches from some of the most innovative projects in modern web development, carefully selecting components that address the pain points of raw HTML/CSS while maintaining mature, battle-tested strategies.</p>
<p>MonsterUI‚Äôs core is <a href="https://franken-ui.dev/" target="_blank">FrankenUI</a>, an innovative framework-free UI library by <a href="https://x.com/sveltecult" target="_blank">sveltecult</a> that uses beautiful HTML-first components. FrankenUI itself was inspired by <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank">shadcn/ui</a> by <a href="https://x.com/shadcn" target="_blank">shadcn</a> which pioneered the concept of copy-pasteable UI components for React.</p>
<p>Raw HTML and CSS present two key challenges: dated visual aesthetics and complex layout management. By combining FrankenUI‚Äôs framework-agnostic approach with FastHTML, MonsterUI delivers modern, beautiful components that integrate seamlessly with HTMX‚Äôs progressive enhancement paradigm - all while maintaining clean, readable code.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt just theory - we‚Äôre using <code>MonsterUI</code> in production for new applications we‚Äôre testing with preview customers, where it powers everything from complex dialog interfaces to dynamic content rendering. The library has been proven robust and maintainable in real-world enterprise settings.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs explore some key features:</p>
<section id="theme">
<h3 data-anchor-id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>Pick a color theme for your app. There are <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_theme_headers#theme" target="_blank">12 colors</a> to choose from, each with a dark and a light mode. By default it uses the user‚Äôs system preferences.</p>
<p>All themes are synced so components look good on the same page regardless of whether the component is styled with FrankenUI, DaisyUI, or another framework.</p>
<p>Themes add the boilerplate needed to make color styling consistent throughout your app.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">app, rt <span>=</span> fast_app(hdrs<span>=</span>Theme.blue.headers())</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="base-components">
<h3 data-anchor-id="base-components">Base Components</h3>
<p>Every HTML element in <code>MonsterUI</code> comes with sensible default styling. A <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_button_link#button" target="_blank">Button</a> isn‚Äôt just an HTML button. It‚Äôs a styled component with hover states, focus rings, and consistent padding.</p>

<p><code>MonsterUI</code> provides data structures (<code>ListT</code>, <code>TextT</code>, <code>ButtonT</code>, etc.) for easy discoverability and tab completion for selecting styles.</p>
<p>For example, to style it with your Theme‚Äôs primary color, use <code>ButtonT.primary</code>. Primary colors are used for action buttons like ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúSubmit.‚Äù</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">Button(<span>"Add to Cart"</span>, cls<span>=</span>ButtonT.primary)</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="semantic-text-styles">
<h3 data-anchor-id="semantic-text-styles">Semantic Text Styles</h3>
<p>Build on the foundations of the web, MonsterUI styles semantic tags based on the HTML spec. This means that we have styled functions that match the themes that use standard HTML tags like emphasis (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>), citation (<code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>), Marked (<code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>), small (<code>&lt;small&gt;</code>) and much more.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">Card(</span>
<span id="cb6-2">    H1(<span>"MonsterUI's Semantic Text"</span>),</span>
<span id="cb6-3">    P(</span>
<span id="cb6-4">        Strong(<span>"MonsterUI"</span>), <span>" brings the power of semantic HTML to life with "</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-5">        Em(<span>"beautiful styling"</span>), <span>" and "</span>, Mark(<span>"zero configuration"</span>), <span>"."</span>),</span>
<span id="cb6-6">    Blockquote(</span>
<span id="cb6-7">        P(<span>"Write semantic HTML in pure Python, get modern styling for free."</span>),</span>
<span id="cb6-8">        Cite(<span>"MonsterUI Team"</span>)),</span>
<span id="cb6-9">    footer<span>=</span>Small(<span>"Released February 2025"</span>),</span>
<span id="cb6-10">)</span></code></pre></div>

</section>
<section id="smart-layout-helpers">
<h3 data-anchor-id="smart-layout-helpers">Smart Layout Helpers</h3>
<p>Overall page layout is made simple with the smart layout helpers (<code>DivVStacked</code>, <code>DivCentered</code>, <code>DivFullySpaced</code>, <code>Grid</code>, etc.). For example, <code>DivVStacked</code> stacks things vertically. <code>Grid</code> creates a grid in which to place components.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">DivFullySpaced(</span>
<span id="cb7-2">    H1(<span>"Dashboard"</span>), </span>
<span id="cb7-3">    DivRAligned(</span>
<span id="cb7-4">        Button(<span>"Export"</span>, cls<span>=</span>ButtonT.secondary),</span>
<span id="cb7-5">        Button(<span>"New Entry"</span>, cls<span>=</span>ButtonT.primary)))</span>
<span id="cb7-6"></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span># Grid layout with smart responsive columns for mobile vs desktop</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><span># Easy args to customize responsiveness as you need</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9">Grid(<span>map</span>(TeamCard, products), cols_max<span>=</span><span>3</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: See our <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/tutorial_layout">layout tutorial</a> for more details and advanced usage</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="common-ui-patterns">
<h3 data-anchor-id="common-ui-patterns">Common UI Patterns</h3>
<p><code>MonsterUI</code> includes shortcuts for common UI patterns. For example, you almost always want an input text box to have a label to communicate what it‚Äôs for so we have provided <code>LabelInput</code> as a shortcut that creates a <code>Label</code> and <code>Input</code> pair..</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">LabelInput(<span>"Name"</span>, <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>'myid'</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>Div</code>, <code>FormLabel</code>, and <code>Input</code> to do this yourself, but this pattern is so common we‚Äôve provided a shortcut. Here‚Äôs what the shortcut replaces:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1">Div(FormLabel(<span>'Name'</span>, fr<span>=</span><span>'myid'</span>),</span>
<span id="cb9-2">    Input(<span>id</span><span>=</span><span>'myid'</span>, name<span>=</span><span>'myid'</span>),</span>
<span id="cb9-3">    cls<span>=</span><span>'space-y-2'</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="higher-level-components">
<h3 data-anchor-id="higher-level-components">Higher Level Components</h3>
<p>We also provide helpers to generate more complex components such as <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_navigation#navbars" target="_blank">navbars</a>, <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_modals" target="_blank">modals</a>, <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_cards" target="_blank">cards</a>, and <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/api_ref/docs_tables" target="_blank">tables</a>. Each of these is built on top of several base components (<code>ModalContainer</code>, <code>ModalDialog</code>, etc.) so you could build them up yourself. However, the helper function usually gives all the flexibility you need without needing to write your own boilerplate. These helper functions create good UX behavior for you such as automatically collapsing your NavBar into a hamburger menu on mobile.</p>
<p>For example to create a button that opens a modal:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">Div(Button(<span>"Open Modal"</span>,uk_toggle<span>=</span><span>"target: #my-modal"</span> ),</span>
<span id="cb10-2">    Modal(ModalTitle(<span>"Simple Test Modal"</span>), </span>
<span id="cb10-3">          P(<span>"With some somewhat brief content to show that it works!"</span>, </span>
<span id="cb10-4">              cls<span>=</span>TextPresets.muted_sm),</span>
<span id="cb10-5">          footer<span>=</span>ModalCloseButton(<span>"Close"</span>, cls<span>=</span>ButtonT.primary),<span>id</span><span>=</span><span>'my-modal'</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://www.answer.ai/posts/MonsterUI/ModalEx2.png"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Typing became my therapy. Not even kidding.</p>

    <p>Started at 60 WPM, felt like dragging my feet through mud every time I had to write code comments or documentation. Now? 118 WPM. No home row bullshit. No "proper finger placement." Just pure, chaotic rhythm. <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/h2mhhp0" target="_blank">Proof here</a> because I know you don't believe me.</p>

    <h2>My Daily Brain Reset Ritual</h2>

    <p>Every morning, before I even think about opening VS Code, before Slack starts destroying my soul, before the daily standup where we pretend we know what we're doing, I just <strong>type</strong>. Five minutes. That's it.</p>

    <p>It's like meditation but actually useful. Resets my brain, calms the static from yesterday's debugging session, and gets me in the zone. Way better than staring at my ceiling wondering why I chose this career.</p>

    <h2>Speed is Useless if You're Wrong</h2>

    <p>Here's the thing that took me way too long to figure out: rushing makes everything worse. Every time I tried to go fast, I'd mess up, backspace like crazy, and end up slower than when I started. Classic developer move, honestly.</p>

    <p>So I slowed down. Focused on hitting every key right. And boom ‚Äî speed just... happened. 90 WPM, 100 WPM, 118 WPM. All came when I was hitting 100% accuracy consistently.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/top-speed.png" alt="top-speed"></p><p>It's like debugging. You can't just randomly change stuff and hope it works. You gotta be methodical, get it right, then optimize. Same energy.</p>

    <p>Some words still absolutely wreck me though. "Obviously" keeps coming out as "obviousily" and I want to throw my keyboard every time. So now I just slow down for those demon words and blast through the rest. Strategic speed management or whatever.</p>

    <h2>Screw the Rules, Find Your Flow</h2>

    <p>Plot twist: I don't type "correctly" at all. My fingers just go wherever they want. It's like anarchist typing. My left pinky probably hasn't touched the 'A' key in months, but somehow I'm still in the 99.5 percentile.</p>

    <p>Turns out the "proper way" is just a suggestion. Like following PEP 8 or using semicolons in JavaScript. Sure, it's nice, but if your way works better, who cares?</p>

    <h2>When Your Brain is Fried</h2>

    <p>You know those days when you've been staring at the same bug for 3 hours and your brain feels like mush? Or when you've been doomscrolling Twitter instead of working and feel dead inside?</p>

    <p>That's when I open <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank">Keybr</a>. It's like going to the gym but for your neurons. Good typing session = instant mood boost. Small win = dopamine hit. Better than coffee, honestly.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I use it as a break between coding sessions. Brain getting foggy? Type for 2 minutes. Stuck on a problem? Type. Deployment failed and you want to quit tech forever? You guessed it.</p>

    <h2>The Inevitable Skill Issue Moments</h2>

    <p>Not gonna lie, there were weeks where I absolutely tanked. Bad accuracy, slow speeds, feeling like I'd forgotten how to use a keyboard. Classic imposter syndrome but for typing.</p>

    <p>"Maybe I'm not actually good at this. Maybe 118 WPM was just a fluke. Maybe I should just stick to hunt-and-peck like a normal person."</p>

    <p>But then I'd bounce back. Always. Usually harder and faster than before. It's like when you're stuck on a bug for days and then suddenly the solution is obvious. The struggle makes the breakthrough better.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/typing-profile.png" alt="typing-profile"></p><h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>

    <p>Been doing this for over a year now. 7,000+ lessons completed on Keybr. My brain genuinely feels different. Not just the typing speed, but focus, discipline, the ability to sit down and just <em>do the thing</em>.</p>

    <p>It's one of those weird habits that seems pointless but somehow fixes everything else. Like how learning vim makes you better at thinking about text editing, or how writing tests makes you better at designing APIs.</p>

    <p><strong>Real talk:</strong> This stupid little habit has probably made me a better developer. Faster at writing code, better at documentation, less frustrated when I have to type out long variable names or commit messages.</p>

    <p>Plus, there's something deeply satisfying about watching words appear on screen at the speed of thought. It's like having a direct brain-to-computer interface, but with more finger movement.</p>

    <p>So yeah. Typing fixed my brain. And probably made me less annoying in code reviews because I can actually write coherent comments now.</p>

    <p>End of story. Now go find your own weird productivity hack that makes no sense but somehow works.</p>

                        <p><b>Analysis: The legal landscape surrounding the use of drones is currently far from clear and many practical questions remain unanswered.</b></p>
<p>Once only found in the realm of science fiction movies, drone delivery services are now an increasingly obvious part of our urban landscape. Service providers such as <a href="https://www.manna.aero/" target="_blank">Manna</a> and <a href="https://wing.com/" target="_blank">Wing</a> (the latter operated by <a href="http://google.com/">Google's</a> parent company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc." target="_blank">Alphabet</a>) are now delivering an ever growing range of items to consumers and corporate entities, particularly across the Dublin region: from <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/22230075/">coffee and pastries</a> to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2024/0702/1457657-drone-delivery-hospitals/)">medical supplies and devices</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>From RT√â Radio 1's Brendan O'Connor Show, Bobby Healy from Manna Aero drone deliveries on delivering fast food around Dublin</b></i></p>
<p>But as the phenomenon of drone deliveries increases, the concerns of home owners and residents negatively impacted by the rapid rise in the number of flyovers have attracted ever greater media attention. In recent weeks, the <a href="https://aaiu.ie/" target="_blank">Air Accident Investigation Unit</a> reported on an <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/dublin/2024/1108/1479951-drone-injury-dublin/">incident</a> in Dublin in 2022 where a man was struck by a propeller blade which had separated from a drone and had fallen on him as he mowed the lawn. Fears in relation to the potential for privacy breaches have also generated considerable attention as have complaints in relation to the noise generated by the whirring of the drones themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the legal landscape surrounding the use of drones is far from clear. While to some extent drone usage is regulated at both an Irish and European level ‚Äì with the <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Aviation Authority</a> playing an important role in this regard ‚Äì many practical legal questions remain unanswered. Can a home owner, for instance, prevent drone delivery companies from flying over their property? Or can they sue for trespass where flyovers do occur in the airspace over their home?</p>
<p alt="Drones being used to deliver medical supplies to private hospitals" data-description="Tom Kuhn from Wing spoke to us from Ohio about how it works" data-embed="rte-player" data-id="22412401" data-ot-category="C0004" data-title="Tom Kuhn from Wing spoke to us from Ohio about how it works"><span><span>We need your consent to load this rte-player content</span><span>We use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

<p><i><b>From RT√â Radio 1's News at One, Tom Kuhn from Wing on how drones are being used to deliver medical supplies to private hospitals</b></i></p>
<p>In the past, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_est_solum,_eius_est_usque_ad_coelum_et_ad_inferos" target="_blank">said</a> that the owner of land owned everything reaching up to the heavens and down to hell. With the arrival of modern aviation, this understanding of the scope of property ownership shifted. Conscious of the need to balance, on one hand, the rights of landowners to enjoy the use of their land, with, on the other hand, the rights of the general public to take advantage of air travel, the courts in England <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_of_Leigh_v_Skyviews_%26_General_Ltd" target="_blank">determined</a> that the ownership of land carried with it rights in air space above the land only to such height as is 'necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment‚Äô of it and the structures on it. This approach was reflected in Irish law via section 55 of the <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1936/act/40">Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936</a> which states that a landowner may not sue for trespass or<b><i> </i></b>nuisance where aircraft fly over property at a height which is ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstances.</p>
<p>However, these statements of law provide little guidance in answering the questions now increasingly raised with the rapid growth in the use of drone technology: what is ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô or ‚Äònecessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment‚Äô of the land is anyone‚Äôs guess.</p>
<p>Ireland is not alone in having as yet failed to clarify the law in this area. Almost all jurisdictions are grappling with similar issues. Research from America, for example, also speaks to the confusion existing there as to the scope of landowners‚Äô rights to prevent or exclude drones from flying over their property. Influential brands including <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://walmart.com/">Walmart</a> have met tough opposition in seeking to develop policies facilitating the use of commercial drone delivery services.</p>

<p><i><b>From RT√â Radio 1's Morning Ireland, Jamie Cudden from Dublin City Council on the council's launch of the Drone Innovation Project</b></i></p>
<p>Yet, necessity is the mother of invention and innovative solutions are being proposed. Rather than downgrading the rights of property owners in relation to the air space over their land, the most viable solution actually appears to be the opposite. The simplest and fairest method of introducing clarity in this area for all concerned ‚Äì home owners, residents and drone delivery companies alike ‚Äì is arguably to develop legislation clearly defining the height to which private property ownership extends into the air space.</p>
<p>In this model, and conscious of the need to reduce the potential nuisance caused by drones, it could be stated that home owners‚Äô rights include the air space up to 60 or 70 metres above their property (delivery drones currently operate between 50-65 metres). Some homeowners or residents will be happy to let the air space over their property be used, whether in return for payment or otherwise. Where this happens, it could allow for the emergence of digital air space sharing platforms (like <a href="https://www.airbnb.ie/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>) to facilitate temporary flight paths for drone deliveries. Where homeowners or residents do not consent to such flyovers, an air corridor designated for drone use over the 60 or 70 metre limit would have to be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is essential that issues regarding the ownership of lower altitude airspace are addressed as a matter of priority</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By forcing drone delivery companies, in particular, to either acquire the consent of landowners if they wish to fly below this threshold, or operate in a corridor above it, some of the heat may be taken out of the debate. While this proposal appears to be the strongest solution yet developed, it is not without its flaws. At a practical level, it would, for one, be hard to prove that a drone was flying below the 60 or 70 meter limit and was trespassing. However, technology and data solutions could surely be developed or repurposed to mitigate these risks through the sharing of flight logs or other information captured in flight.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the status quo appears unsustainable and solutions, whether those set out here or otherwise, will have to be found. In the interest of all concerned, it is essential that issues regarding the ownership of lower altitude airspace are addressed as a matter of priority.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>On April 16, 2025, Apple released a patch for a bug in CoreAudio which they said was <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122282">‚ÄúActively exploited in the wild.‚Äù</a> This flew under the radar a bit. <a href="https://blog.epsilon-sec.com/cve-2025-31201-rpac.html">Epsilon‚Äôs blog</a> has a great writeup of the other bug that was presumably exploited in this chain: a bug in RPAC. The only thing out there that I am aware of about the CoreAudio side of the bug is a video by Billy Ellis (it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm featured. You should watch‚Ä¶you‚Äôre probably here from that anyways). As he mentioned in the video, ‚ÄúAnother security researcher by the name of ‚ÄòNoah‚Äô was able to <em>tweak</em> the values such that when it was played on MacOS, it actually did lead to a crash.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs still worth it to write about that ‚Äòtweaking‚Äô process in more detail.</p>
<p>I had just finished another project and ended up on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit">spreadsheet</a> maintained by Project Zero which tracks zero days that have been actively exploited in the wild. It just so happened that <em>that</em> day there had been another addition: CVE-2025-31200. I couldn‚Äôt find any writeups on it, or really any information other than the fact that it was a ‚Äúmemory corruption in CoreAudio‚Äù so I decided to have a look myself. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>There was a bit of a rocky start. I don‚Äôt have IDA Pro so my options for binary diffing are limited. Billy mentions Diaphora in his video, and that does seem like the industry standard. Apparently it also has a Ghidra plugin, but I don‚Äôt want that Java stink on my laptop. So I had to do things the old-fashioned way. Luckily there is an awesome tool called ipsw maintained by Blacktop. One of its primary use cases is diffing between different versions of iOS. There is even a <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw-diffs">repo</a> where markdown versions of the diffs are posted, so it was trivial for me to have a look at that. There were a relatively small number of updates, and it was clear that the ones related to this bug were in AudioCodecs.</p>

<p>A 20 byte increase in the __text section is exactly the kind of change you‚Äôd expect from a memory corruption like this, so I thought I would crack open the new and the old versions in Binary Ninja and the change would be obvious. First however, I had to actually do the binary diffing. Ipsw-diff is great for basic info like this, but it‚Äôs not a disassembler, so it doesn‚Äôt show any code-level changes. In order to do the actual diffing I used radiff2 from Radare2.</p>
<p>I fully expected this binary to be a part of the Dyld shared cache. However, if you pay close attention to the path from ipsw-diff, you can see that it isn‚Äôt. It lives in <code>/System/Library/Components/AudioCodecs.component/</code>. That‚Äôs <em>Components</em> not <em>Frameworks.</em> I don‚Äôt know what the difference between them is. Regardless, AudioCodecs on macOS is not part of the shared cache. I collected both the old and the new binaries and ran them through radiff2.</p>
<h2 id="the-diff">The Diff</h2>
<p>Radiff2 spit out a few candidate functions for me to study more closely. Most of them just had compiler entropy differences (think registers shifting around) or different addresses since the text section had shifted. Luckily, one function stuck out as the obvious candidate: <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize(this, bitStreamReader)</code>, presumably a C++ (you can tell by the ‚Äò::‚Äô) member method of the CodecConfig class. There were a number of logical changes, a new error message, and a new check all clearly visible at the bottom of the method. I thought that the bug would now be trivial to spot since the changes seemed self-contained enough, and often it‚Äôs the followup‚Äînot the actual exploit primitive itself‚Äîthat takes most of the ingenuity.</p>
<p>I stared for a while at the difference between the old and new Deserialize method. I even took the time to manually copy and paste them out into VSCode and use its built-in diffing functionality. I could tell that a lot of it was the same. The method consists in a series of reads from a bitstream, each having their own failure cases and control flow. It looks like a relatively typical parsing method. The high level flow is a series of blocks that look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read some bits from the stream with the bitStreamReader</li>
<li>Check some error conditions</li>
<li>If failure then log failure and exit</li>
<li>If success then advance the pointer and continue to the next block</li>
</ol>
<p>The section that differed was the final read from the stream. In it there were repeated snippets like this meant to read in the length of some array:</p>

</span></span><span><span>24</span><span><span>//do stuff with elementCount
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, also common between them (within the differing sections) was a little floating point dance to compute the bit width of the array entries (bitWidth) that would later be read in from the stream.</p>

In both versions there is some code that computes the size of an array. It uses the number of required elements, and the current size of the array:</p>





<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>1</span><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>elementCount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>currentSize</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span>6</span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The rest of the respective final reads were different. In the old version, it uses the <code>elementCount</code>as computed above. In the new version it uses some field of the <code>this</code> pointer:</p>





<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>1</span><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>elementCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>)</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span><span>)((</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>this</span> <span>+</span> <span>0x58</span><span>);</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was an important clue. I figured if I just traced through the rest of the code, then there would be some write into the <code>elementCount</code>-sized array with a size check based on <code>this+0x58</code>, rather than <code>elementCount</code>. That would be the primitive. Here is the chunk of the code that reads from the stream and writes in to the array:</p>

After seeing the new error message, I figured that that must be it! Whatever control flow leads to the new error message in the patched version has got to be the control flow that induces the error. The following must hold in order to reach the new check:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>desiredCount</code> ‚â† 0. This takes us to the loop that tries to populate the array. The code is trying to populate an array with values read in from a stream. It is getting the <em>number</em> of those values prior (in the patched version that is <code>desiredCount</code>). If that number is zero then we‚Äôre good! We don‚Äôt need to try to populate the array and we don‚Äôt need to throw any error messages.</li>
<li>At some point while reading from the stream, <code>value</code> should be ‚â• <code>elementCount</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) is trivial to induce. Consider that path in the vulnerable code. There is never a check for whether or not <code>elementCount</code> == 0. It is simply used to size the array and then the loop begins. So any audio file that reaches this code will ‚Äúgo down that path‚Äù in the old version. This was actually my first guess about the bug because the check whether or not <code>elementCount</code> == 0 stood out as the first big control-flow difference. In the old version, no resizing happens at all if <code>elementCount</code> == 0:</p>

</span></span><span><span>12</span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But there is no bug in that condition. If <code>elementCount</code> were zero here, then that would mean that there are no elements required to be in the array, so no resizing happens. The loop exits immediately at the check <code>(uint64_t)index &gt;= (uint64_t)elementCount</code> since <code>elementCount</code> is initialized to 0.</p>
<p>We also need (2) to be true: value &gt; <code>elementCount</code>, and that‚Äôs seemingly possible. Of course, we don‚Äôt know how exactly to trigger it yet, but we do know that <code>value</code> is read in from an attacker controlled stream, and plausibly that it can have values higher than <code>elementCount</code> given that there is a check for it. However, it is still unclear what the memory corruption actually is.  Even if we read in some value from the stream that is greater than <code>elementCount</code>, we never can actually overwrite anything in <code>outBuf</code>, since <code>outBuf</code> is sized properly based on <code>elementCount</code>. Clearly the change was related to the sizing of <code>outBuf</code> though, so how do we make sense of this? At this point I had a few hypotheses:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was simply missing how <code>outBuf</code> could be overwritten, and therefore I should spend more time staring at this patch diff until the bug revealed itself to me.</li>
<li>At some point later in the code, the values from the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> are used to size another buffer or array of some kind that is assumed to be the same size as <code>*m_TotalComponents</code>* (used as <code>elementCount</code> in the patched version)<em>.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I spent a lot of time with (a)‚Äîstaring and trying to think of ways to make it so just one extra value was read into the <code>m_RemappingArray</code>. Perhaps there was some weirdness with the bit width calculation, or some kind of integer overflow that led to a smaller buffer than expected. But I couldn‚Äôt make anything work.</p>
<p>After entirely too much time spent smashing my head into this wall I proceeded to hypotheses (b). I suppose I should have done this from the start: looking at them now, laid out like this it‚Äôs so obvious to me which is correct, but it wasn‚Äôt at the time.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>I wanted to do some dynamic analysis. In order to do that I needed to understand how to reach the vulnerable code path. So I started reverse engineering.</p>
<p>In AudioCodecs there are parallel methods to deserialize for other classes: <code>apac::spch::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>, for example, and the name of the binary literally has the words <em>Audio</em> and <em>Codec</em> in the name. That was enough to start googling. After searching something like ‚ÄúAPAC Audio format,‚Äù I found a lot of results for <em>ALAC</em> (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) which seemed close. I also found this reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1fncalk/what_is_the_apac_audio_format_as_listed_in_the/">post</a> in r/AudioPhile that was asking what it was, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/kaudioformatapac?language=objc">this mention</a> in Apple‚Äôs developer documentation for Core Audio Types. After following that one redditor‚Äôs guess I found this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-by/guide/immersive-video-utility/dev4579429f0/web">page</a> which confirms that APAC stands for <em>Apple Positional Audio Codec</em>.</p>
<p>With much less effort, I was able to find out that HOA plausibly stood for Higher Order Ambisonics: a method of representing sound as a spatial sound-field centered  around the listeners head. Something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Spatial Audio Example" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/ambisonics.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://tricktheear.eu/spatial-web-audio/">https://tricktheear.eu/spatial-web-audio/</a></p>
<p>This helped a tiny bit in understanding the logic here‚Äîenough that I went to try and make an audio file that could hit the patched function. After some playing around and downloading a lot of sketchy audio files from the internet, I was able to hit the function through <code>[audioPlayer prepareToPlay]</code>. However, it was still unclear how exactly to reach the exact snippet that had changed.
Luckily at this point I wasn‚Äôt the only person working on this, and by searching for some related keywords I stumbled on this Git repo: <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/apple-positional-audio-codec-invalid-header">https://github.com/zhuowei/apple-positional-audio-codec-invalid-header</a> from Zhouwei. He hadn‚Äôt figured it out yet as it said in the README at the time, but he had done some excellent reverse engineering. He put together an objective C++ script and lldb hook that created a .mp4 which hit the vulnerable snippet in the old version and the new check in the patched version. As you can see in his code:</p>

This is interesting then. Thinking back to the control flow that we want to force in order to test hypothesis (b), we want the parsing logic to read in a value from the stream that is <em>greater</em> than the number of total components. If we dump <code>m_TotalComponents</code> at runtime (offset 0x58 from the base of <code>CodecConfig</code>) we see that with our current encoder it is 1. Therefore, as long as a value is supplied that is greater than 1, then the loop should exit. In the unpatched version it will continue and in the patched version it will hit the new check. I guessed at this point that the values being read in from the stream here would be the 0xFF bytes we forced in the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> from earlier. Stepping through in lldb it turned out that wasn‚Äôt the case.</p>
<p>We were reading in 0xffff entries, but they weren‚Äôt 0xff each time. This was curious to me. They were &gt; 1 though! So shouldn‚Äôt this cause memory cooruption? Even turning on ASan and letting the harness run I didn‚Äôt see anything. In both cases (patched and unpatched) it just exits with code 0. Though if you run them in lldb then you can see those error messages from the parser. They were definitely different.</p>

It did contain exactly 0xffff entries, but no more. This is where I got stuck for a bit. A few things were possible at this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>This could already be an arbitrary write that ASan wasn‚Äôt picking up. There are a number of ways that ASan wouldn‚Äôt pickup a small overwrite.</li>
<li>It could be the case that this is close, but some other unknown setup is missing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I wouldn‚Äôt even be sure where to go about chasing (1), I went for (2).  I thought that a good place to start was taking a look at the error messages from above. Might it be the case that the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> just isn‚Äôt being deserialized? By looking for references to ‚ÄúProfile and level data could not be validated‚Äù in Binary Ninja, I found that phrase in <code>apac::hoa::GlobalConfig::Deserialize</code>. This is the dispatch site (the callee) of the virtual <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code> method. Error site here:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6.56.03\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/finalError.png"></p>
<p>Before I reverse engineered this monster function, I thought it made sense to actually try and do a <em>little</em> bit to understand what that error could mean in more contextual, audio terms. I found <a href="https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=208361#p1081741">this answer</a> in the Blackmagic Forum website in response to a question about how to mix ambisonics audio when searching for keywords like ‚Äúambisonics profile‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems like the process uses an ambisonic microphone that you place in the center of a custom speaker space and run a test pattern sound through all of the speakers one-by-one to record a ‚Äúprofile‚Äù of the location of the speakers. The profile data is then fed into the decoder to let it know where the speakers are in space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this does fit in with our understanding, but it is a fairly general notion. That is, it describes the entire ambisonics <em>profile</em> rather than just one element of it. However, it doesn‚Äôt help us much in understanding why our deserialization failed.</p>
<p>After some more fruitless searching I bit the bullet and started to reverse engineer the <code>GlobalConfig</code> method. First of all, we know that we at least make it to the point where there is a call to <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>. From the backtrace we know that that is at <code>apac::GlobalConfig::Deserialize + 1644</code>. lldb shows a <code>blraa  x8, x17</code> instruction there so we know that this is a virtual method.  If we just follow the control flow up a little bit we see:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 7.25.51\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/virtCalls.png"></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre wondering about the variable names and symbols here, this was cleaned up by me. I followed along this extremely useful <a href="https://www.seandeaton.com/gotta-re-em-all-reversing-c-virtual-function-tables-with-binary-ninja/">blog post</a> explaining how to reverse engineer complex C++ types in Binary Ninja.  I learned how to tell it about the vtable call to Deserialize at 0x57acc, for example.</p>
<p>Back to the control flow, there is some type flag read in from the stream (what I named <code>codecConfigTypeFromStream</code>) that tells <code>GlobalConfig</code> which constructor to call. Then the instantiated <code>CodecConfig</code> object calls Deserialize. This pattern continues for all the different <code>CodecConfig</code> classes. The vast majority of the code in this function lives under this <code>label_57acc</code>. The way Binary Ninja reconstructed the code here, it essentially showed that if none of these ifs are true, then control flow reaches the ‚Äúprofile and level data‚Äù error from above.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible errors <em>inside</em> the block after the label. If any of those error messages are hit then control flow jumps to the ‚Äúprofile and level data‚Äù error block only after first failing with a different more specific error.</p>
<p>Searching for the other error: ‚ÄúERROR: Wrong profile index in GlobalConfig‚Äù I found this check:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 7.38.10\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/inferProfileCallSite.png"></p>
<p><code>GlobalConfig</code> grabs a reference to the supported profiles: <code>var_b0</code>, as well as some field of <code>GlobalConfig</code>at offset 0x130 and calls <code>apac::ProfileLevelConfig::InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>. If that crazy-looking conditional evaluates to true, then the error is logged. The conditional uses the return value of <code>apac::ProfileLevelConfig::InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>, <code>x0_43</code>. So I took a look at the function. Binary Ninja interpretted the signature to be:</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-error">Understanding the Error</h2>
<p>The function itself is quite short and has a lot of symbols still in it, so I took a crack at reverse engineering it. The first major clue was the outer loop structure:</p>





<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cpp"><span><span>1</span><span><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int64_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0x78</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0x28</span><span>)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This told me we‚Äôre dealing with three iterations (0x78 / 0x28 = 3), with each iteration stepping by 40 bytes. This suggested an array of three structures, each 40 bytes long. Combined with the function name <code>InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>, I guessed that this pointed to three different ‚Äòaudio profile configurations.‚Äô The fact that this step size is used to index into multiple global arrays (<code>&amp;apac::kProfileConfigs + i</code>, <code>i + &amp;data_8ec838</code>, etc.) confirmed these are parallel arrays because they were indexed by the same offset.</p>
<p>The very first lines inside the loop revealed the <code>ConstParamArray</code> layout:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is the classic C++ iterator pattern‚Äîa begin/end pointer pair. The <code>ConstParamArray&lt;ProfileLevel&gt;</code> is clearly just:</p>

<p>So the check is: ‚Äúcurrent_profile &gt; inferred_profile‚Äù. This suggests the function is trying to find a profile that‚Äôs <strong>at least as capable</strong> as what‚Äôs currently configured. If it can only find a ‚Äúlower‚Äù profile, that‚Äôs an error condition.</p>
<p>With this understanding of the error conditions, I initially suspected the issue was simply an <strong>empty codec configurations vector</strong>. The logic seemed straightforward: if no codecs are configured, the function should default to the basic profile. But when I stepped through the actual execution in lldb and got to to the point where the function checks the size of the vector, I found that it actually contained one 8-byte entry:</p>

<p>Stepping through the profile matching logic, I found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile 31 <strong>does support</strong> HOA codec ID 2</li>
<li>The level validation <strong>passed</strong> (level 6 requirements met)</li>

<p>When I ran the harness in lldb all I saw was: <code>Process * exited with status = 0 (0x00000000)</code>. At least according to the deserializer, we managed to create a valid APAC magic cookie. However, still no crash, nor any message from ASan. The most interesting thing to me was that this new audio file showed the exact same error message on the new version as before (it was still hitting the new check!), and showed nothing on the unpatched version.</p>
<p>When I saw this I really didn‚Äôt know where to look. I thought that the process of looking at the diff between the two versions would be enough. Here it is again as I was looking at it at this point, cleaned up:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 7.52.36\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/finalDiff.png"></p>
<p>This was essentially <em>all</em> that had changed. I took a break for a while here, and worked on another project that had spawned out of this one (a way to do runtime patching which actually works for these system libraries on MacOS since I couldn‚Äôt get TinyINST or even Frida to work). Chasing down this AudioCodecs bug seemed out of reach. I mean there are so many possible places that the code could go in the enormous MacOS audio processing pipeline. Without a clear diff between two binaries with the issue, as I had had until this point, where would I even look?</p>
<p>As I worked on my other project, I kept thinking about this. Eventually I decided to take some time to try and come at it from a slightly different angle. Maybe it would help to understand a bit about what‚Äôs actually being done by the code at the level of audio processing more than just control flow/code itself.</p>
<p>I looked for references to <code>m_TotalComponents</code> in <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>. It is calculated in the following kind of snippet (much like everything else in this method):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> are spatial/directional elements (salient vs. ambient/scalar)
<ul>
<li>Think the difference between highlighted important noise coming at you from some particular direction, and just embient noise in the background.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subbands</strong> are frequency divisions</li>
<li><strong>Salient Components</strong> (<code>m_maxNumSalientComponents</code>): The most important spatial features, encoded with high precision</li>
<li><strong>Scalar/Direct Components</strong> (<code>numScalarCodedComponents</code>): Less important components using simpler scalar coding</li>
<li><strong>Ambient data</strong>, which is sized per-subband as you always need background spatial info for each frequency band</li>

<p>My understanding is that there are essentially three types of components, and two of them, <code>m_maxNumSalientComponents</code> and <code>numScalarCodedComponents</code>, add together to be <code>m_TotalComponents</code>. Thinking back to the fix being essentially:</p>

I was trying to understand what that relationship could even be. According to <a href="https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/resources/faqs/what-is-an-audio-channel?token=iHleyIFjO6AyNj0dwv2pyKSq5_BGTm76">wildlifeacoustics.com</a>, ‚Äúa channel is a representation of sound coming from or going to a single point. A single microphone can produce one channel of audio, and a single speaker can accept one channel of audio, for example.‚Äù Presumably then, the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> is a way of mapping the spatial components of HOA to a given channel based layout. Therefore, there must be some later stage in the audio processing pipeline that actually ‚Äúremaps‚Äù the spatial components to the channel layout. If there is some mismatch between the two, perhaps it <em>tries</em> to remap one based on the other, and ends up reaching out of bounds since they are different sizes?</p>
<p>It turns out that is precisely the exploit primitive.</p>
<h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2>
<p>I should have realized this earlier, but if we actually <em>play</em> the audio in addition to just <em>preparing to play</em> as our harness did, then that is very plausibly when the remapping occurs. I hadn‚Äôt tried this before because the vulnerable code section, as found through diffing, is perfectly reachable without ever actually playing the audio. You can just call <code>[AVAudioPlayer prepareToPlay]</code>. However, if we add in that single line of code to our harness, then with the exact audio file we have at this stage then we segfault inside a call to <code>memmove</code>!</p>

<p>Just to be clear, here is how I was setting up the audio file at this point:</p>

<p>The crash occured most often as a null pointer dereference in <code>apac::HOADecoder::DecodeAPACFrame</code>. <code>x26</code> here hasn‚Äôt yet been initialized:</p>





<p>so we crash with EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x19). If we enable Guard Malloc in Xcode then we can see the first invalid read occurs in <code>APAC::ChannelRemapper::Process</code>.</p>

<p>If we look at the assembly where the invalid read occurs its clear that it is trying to read some value from an array, and x8 + x11¬´3 points out of bounds. This of course, all makes perfect sense. The method is called <code>APACChannelRemapper::Process</code>. This must be where the channel remapping actually occurs. The instruction directly above the one that Guard Malloc catches, also tells us a lot about what is going on:</p>

Apparently you can permute a vector according to some desired layout in constant space with the method above.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you have a vector, say [A,B,C] that you actually want to be [B,A,C], then you might do that with a ‚Äòpermutation map‚Äô: another vector that says where each element should go. In this case that would be [1,0,2], which means that the element at index 1 should go to index 0, and the element at index 0 should go to index 1 and the element at index 2 should stay where it is.  The simplest working way to do this is to just allocate another vector, and essentially use the permutation map as a kind of dictionary (index‚Üíelement) for populating that third vector. However, if you would rather be clever and don‚Äôt feel like allocating a whole other vector, then you can use the algorithm above.</p>
<p>For us this means that the input remapping is a map that we can use to read and write out of bounds. Notice that both <code>remapVec</code> and the input <code>floatVec</code> are assumed to be ‚Äòwell-behaved‚Äô in their own way? If, for example, the <code>remapVec</code> looked like this [1,2,3], then the inner while loop would happily read in memory from out of bounds. Given that this function is executed under the condition that we created earlier where the <code>remapVec</code> is larger than the actual <code>floatVec</code>, then there can be elements in <code>remapVec</code> that are larger than the size of <code>floatVec</code>, each of which will cause a ‚Äòswap‚Äô with some memory from out bounds. This is the illegal read we saw earlier under Guard Malloc. Similarly though, for every read that gets written into the remapping array during this function, there is an equivalent write. This is the primitive.</p>
<p>As it stands though, the float pointers being swapped from out of bounds are being swapped almost always with zeros (though it depends on the specific heap layout), and then quickly dereferenced, hence the segfault. If we want it not to segfault then we need to understand a few things in more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>m_RemappingArray</code> and how to control it</li>
<li>The heap layout around the float vector</li>
<li>The control flow following the <code>APACChannelRemapper::Process</code> method</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to turn this into a real arbitrary write, we would, I think, need to understand much more deeply where in the actual audio processing pipeline this method happens. <em>This would be a great investigation if somebody wants to look into it</em>. I have found that the float vectors are clearly related to the audio data per frame. It seems that the heap layout is affected by the number of channels we pick (since of course this changes the size of the remapping array), and I have found that if I pick a number for the number of channels that is only slightly smaller than the number given in the layout tag:</p>

In this case, it only crashes much later (if at all) due to actual heap corruption.</p>
<p>If we fill the frame buffers with different data, then the address reported in the segfault changes in proportion to the values we pick, so there is some control over the write doing this. It‚Äôs still unclear to me at this point what exact stage of the processing pipeline the frame data is in. If we knew, then perhaps we could write an arbitrary value into a (seemingly) arbitary location in memory.</p>
<p>Although, it is possible that the primitive here is fundamentally tied to how these floats are being manipulated at this point. For example, this code might be applying some series of audio processing related functions to our input values that make it so they are always basically always going to be unwieldy to work with. Imagine if the primitive is that you can write n 8 byte sequences out of bounds, but they must be valid 32 bit floats in the range x-y, that had to return valid sequences when passed through however many audio processing functions. That would really constrain the space of what could be written out of bounds.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that this was actively exploited in the wild, and there have been exploits that did a lot more with a lot less. Still, I am curious to see how this is pushed to full code execution. At this point though, I have done what I set out to do: understand CVE-2025-31200, and I want to get this out so that other people can take a look as well.</p>
<p>Some folks have already reached out to me saying that they think they may have found how to push it further, so look out for anything from them. I may put out a part two to this with more details on how the exploit actually would have worked (for example the chain from this to the RPAC bug). Normally, it isn‚Äôt necessarily the actual exploit primitive that is the center of the story, but I think in this case it was a really interesting example of how tricky some of these bugs can be. Hopefully this investigation will be useful to others who want to do a similar kind of thing. I‚Äôm sure if you had a deep understand of Apples audio-processing pipeline (or probably computational audio in general) then it wouldn‚Äôt be too too difficult to find something like this, but the venn diagram of such people and people with enough knowledge to know how to look for these bugs is not particularly huge. That makes this attack surface quite a rich one!</p>

Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic all had major releases, and one clear throughline was the push toward </span><strong>increasingly autonomous coding agents</strong><span>. So we figured this was the perfect moment to talk about </span><strong>how</strong><span> </span><strong>unreliable Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong><span> </span><strong>are as a base technology</strong><span>, and </span><strong>what that means for builders</strong><span> trying to work with them.</span></p><p><span>Unreliability is the core bottleneck to unlocking the full power of LLMs. For all the deserved excitement around LLMs, most users still engage with them only </span><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/5/25/genais-adoption-puzzle" rel="">occasionally</a><span>. Daily active use remains comparatively low. You could read that as limited utility or slow dispersion, but we think a major contributor is unreliability. When a system can‚Äôt be trusted to work consistently, its real-world utility collapses. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the clearest value from LLMs so far has come from code generation, where outputs are not only useful, but highly verifiable. You can run the code, test it, compile it. It either works or it doesn‚Äôt. And the product it supports‚Äîsoftware‚Äîis deterministic by design. </span></p><p>This piece explores:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The core challenge:</strong><span> LLMs are fundamentally unreliable, a characteristic we believe is unlikely to change soon.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for builders:</strong><span> Success in building AI-powered products doesn‚Äôt come from waiting for perfect models, but rather from from building around their inherent variance.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Framework:</strong><span> We outline four distinct approaches builders can take to manage variance. We'll map the core characteristics of each, offering a clearer lens for assessing whether a given team's capabilities and chosen strategy align.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>We‚Äôve spent the past few years closely tracking the LLM space, following the research, watching how companies are deploying them, how users interact with them, and using the models extensively ourselves. These observations have made one thing abundantly clear: large language models are </span><strong>fundamentally unreliable</strong><span>.</span></p><ul><li><p>Their outputs often deviate significantly from the intended result.</p><ul><li><p>This unreliability is persistent. It might be low in some cases, but it never fully disappears, and it‚Äôs largely unpredictable ahead of time.</p></li><li><p><span>Even in the most constrained, well-defined tasks, LLM behavior</span><strong> is not deterministic. </strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Crucially, when LLMs are asked to perform tasks that involve any kind of real agency‚Äîmulti-step actions, tool use, autonomy‚Äîthese reliability issues get far worse. Failure rates spike to levels that make these systems unusable in real-world scenarios.</p></li><li><p>We believe these core reliability dynamics of LLMs aren‚Äôt likely to change meaningfully in the short to medium term.</p></li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>LLMs hallucinate</strong><span>‚Äîthat is, they generate incorrect outputs.

We won‚Äôt dive into the full complexity of the alignment discussion here‚Äîit‚Äôs a deep and important topic‚Äîbut the basic idea is this: alignment is the discipline concerned with making sure that models behave, at a high level, the way we intend them to. It‚Äôs what tries to prevent scenarios where an LLM blackmails its developer to avoid being shut off, or gives users instructions on how to build bioweapons.

Beyond just illustrating how fundamentally opaque these systems still are, unsolved alignment directly impacts the viability of agentic LLM use cases. But as noted, this is a topic worthy of its own deep dive, so we‚Äôll leave it at that for now. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>Forecasting AI progress is notoriously difficult</strong><span>, especially in a domain evolving this quickly. That said, we have reason to believe that the core reliability dynamics of LLMs aren‚Äôt likely to change meaningfully in the short to medium term.</span></p><p>Here‚Äôs why:</p><ol><li><p><span>A key reason we believe these reliability issues will persist is the way LLM errors interact with task complexity. Our own observations (and interpretations of much of the available research and empirical findings), suggest that LLM failure modes compound with task length in ways that </span><a href="https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life#:~:text=increasing%20time%20periods%3A-,Intriguingly,-%2C%20this%20human%20survival" rel="">exceed</a><span> typical human error patterns. This tendency for AI errors to multiply and cascade will, we suspect, remain a fundamental barrier for truly reliable agentic systems for the foreseeable future. </span></p></li><li><p><span>The fact that no LLM use case has demonstrated true determinism in real-world applications is significant. It strongly supports the theoretical arguments discussed earlier, which posit that </span><strong>hallucinations are an unavoidable, and likely unsolvable</strong><span>, aspect of current LLM architectures. </span></p></li><li><p><span>A striking example of LLMs' operational opacity comes from Anthropic's research, illustrated by how a model might calculate 36+59=95. Internally, it uses a sophisticated, multi-path strategy, approximating the sum with one heuristic while precisely determining the final digit with another. Yet, if asked to explain its calculation, the LLM describes the standard 'carry the one' algorithm taught to humans. This suggests the model lacks the mechanism to introspect and articulate the actual computational path it took. This inability to reflect post hoc‚Äîeven to itself‚Äîunderscores the black-box nature of LLMs. While speculative, we suspect </span><strong>this missing self-awareness contributes to their unreliability</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" width="1456" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>‚ÄúClaude </span><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model" rel="">seems </a><span>to be unaware of the sophisticated "mental math" strategies that it learned during training.

The key concept here is allowing the system to 'run without babysitting', requiring additional capacity for when the system flags </span><strong>exceptions </strong><span>(usually means you need manpower) doesn't change this underlying dynamic. </span></p><p>This is the only category that enables fully autonomous usage, systems that can operate without human intervention. That makes it arguably the highest-margin path, with the clearest ROI story: either an existing process becomes faster, cheaper, and more scalable, or a new one becomes viable, and in both cases, the value is easy to measure. You can point to what the system does, what it improves, and what it costs.</p><h5>This can be pursued in several ways: </h5><p><span>The aim here is to engineer an LLM-based system that, for all practical purposes, achieves complete determinism, mirroring the reliability of traditional software. Realizing this requires a system capable of exhaustively testing its outputs against rigorous criteria and, critically, remediating nearly all conceivable LLM-generated issues. Companies like </span><a href="https://www.skyramp.dev/" rel="">Skyramp</a><span>, focusing on deterministic AI for test generation, are exploring aspects of this space.</span></p><p>In practice, attaining this level of comprehensive determinism is extraordinarily challenging. It necessitates absolute confidence in having identified and addressed all potential edge cases and failure modes, a feat few if any have achieved in practice. </p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p>This approach demands deep AI technical expertise. Getting an LLM-based system to behave deterministically is extremely hard, and being confident that it actually does requires a sophisticated understanding of how and where LLMs can fail. Unless the problem is already widely solved, teams must be able to both achieve high accuracy and rigorously validate it across edge cases. </p></li><li><p>Such a system likely requires a very sophisticated engineering layer, IP-worthy at that, this dynamic serves as a moat from both ‚Äúmodels getting better" and competitors.</p><ul><li><p><span>This does mean that there are likely serious demands for quality engineering talent as well, and depending on specifics, specialized talent (who </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare" rel="">else</a><span> has experience in thinking about a system‚Äôs weak points?).</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your customer needs to trust you, really trust you that your tech does what it says it does, earning their trust may not be easy, but if you do, that is another source of competitive advantage.</p></li></ul><p>This path focuses on achieving a level of accuracy that is 'good enough' for a particular application where direct, instance-by-instance user verification is not part of the primary workflow, and occasional errors are within acceptable tolerance. </p><p>A critical requirement is achieving and validating a high degree of confidence that you have thoroughly accounted for all significant edge cases and the varied ways your LLM product can fail within the specific operational context.</p><h5>Examples: </h5><ul><li><p><span>An </span><strong>AI classifier</strong><span> designed for very large, unstructured datasets, used for broad-based trend analysis. Here, occasional misclassifications can be tolerated as they are unlikely to skew the overall insights significantly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Automated </span><strong>structured data extraction</strong><span> from documents (like invoices or forms), where the system achieves a </span><a href="https://rossum.ai/customer-stories/adyen/" rel="">high enough accuracy for</a><span> direct use in downstream processes, with the understanding that a very small residual error rate is acceptable.</span></p></li><li><p><span>AI-powered </span><strong>note-takers</strong><span> for meetings. In many common usage patterns, there's no explicit human check on the generated notes. The underlying logic is often that notes with minor errors or omissions still offer greater utility than the alternatives of laborious manual note-taking or having no record at all.</span></p></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach: </h5><ol><li><p><span>For this strategy, it's critical to </span><strong>deeply analyze the user's workflow</strong><span> and the actual consequences of different AI failure modes (e.g., overgeneralization vs. complete fabrication, missed information vs. incorrect information). This involves an in-depth mapping of how various errors will impact the user's objectives and risk exposure. </span><strong>Crucially, developers must recognize that users themselves can be poor judges of these risks or may be overly trusting</strong><span>, as evidenced by ongoing issues like professionals misusing LLMs in critical fields despite widely known failure patterns (e.g., </span><a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/" rel="">at least 20 cases</a><span> of legal decisions where AI produced hallucinations just this month, despite hallucinations in law being a high-profile failure mode for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html" rel="">years</a><span>). The onus is on the product team to anticipate these issues, understand the true (not just stated) risk tolerance, and design accordingly, rather than solely relying on users to self-regulate their trust.</span></p></li><li><p><span>While perhaps less demanding than striving for proper determinism, it still requires </span><strong>strong enough AI skills to know what accuracy actually means in context</strong><span>, how to measure it, interpret it, and design around it. </span></p></li><li><p><span>For this strategy, the central aspect of product design is ensuring the product's </span><strong>core AI performance</strong><span> (its accuracy and reliability) is properly calibrated. While usability is always a factor, it's secondary here to achieving the target performance level. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Customers must </span><strong>trust the product's defined level of accuracy</strong><span>. This requires demonstrating consistent performance within those bounds, which can then become a key differentiator and competitive moat. </span></p></li></ol><p>Unlike approaches that strive to engineer out all AI variance, the second broad strategy for LLM product development accepts a degree of inherent model variability and focuses on managing its impact by integrating human verification into the process. </p><p><span>This common approach involves creating products where the </span><strong>end-user directly reviews, validates, and potentially corrects the AI's output as part of their workflow</strong><span>. To succeed, the value proposition must clearly justify the user's verification effort; the AI's assistance, even if imperfect, must be preferable to alternatives. </span></p><ul><li><p>Examples</p><ul><li><p><strong>Search &amp; discovery tools</strong><span> (e.g., web search, shopping search): Users often don't need every possible correct answer and can tolerate some irrelevant results if the tool quickly surfaces useful or intriguing information.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Information triage</strong><span> (e.g., "important document" finders in email): An AI might flag potentially missed invoices or critical communications. The user quickly verifies if the flagged items are indeed relevant, a task easier than manually sifting through everything.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful general-purpose chatbots</strong><span>: LLMs via the chat interface are so broadly capable that users find ways to derive utility despite needing to critically evaluate responses and manage occasional errors.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>"Copilot" paradigms</strong><span> (e.g., coding assistants like Cursor, legal tools like Harvey, etc.): The AI generates drafts or suggestions (code, legal clauses, analyses), and the expert user, who is "in the loop" at the right time, can quickly identify and correct issues.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Creative ‚Äúcontent generation‚Äù</strong><span>: These are the canonical examples. Users can easily assess if the output‚Äôs style and basic coherence are suitable.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Workflow augmentation:</strong><span> These products almost always enhance a specific user persona‚Äôs workflow rather than fully automating a standalone function (there‚Äôs also a small class of ‚Äúalerting‚Äù use cases, but we assess that category to be relatively limited). This stems directly from the need for human verification: when humans are in the loop, they‚Äôre usually using the AI to do their job better, not babysitting it. In other words, the AI augments the human, not the other way around. While you can design a system where a human simply verifies AI outputs, that pattern rarely proves compelling in practice. The output has to be so valuable that it justifies paying someone to check it, and most applications don‚Äôt clear that bar. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Ceiling more than floor</strong><span>: Since this approach often involves users adopting new ways of working, the "ceiling" of value, the significant benefit derived from the AI's best or most insightful contributions, must be exceptionally high. This potential for substantial gains (e.g., speed, unique insights, quality improvements) is instrumental in justifying a change in work pattern and earn the user's verification effort. The focus is less on average AI accuracy ("floor") and more on the transformative potential of the AI's peak contributions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Usability is central</strong><span>: Since user interaction and verification are integral, nailing the UI/UX for verification, correction, and seamless integration into the user's existing or new workflow is vital. Quality of user experience is then the primary differentiator and source of competitive advantage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Designed for verifiability</strong><span>: A central characteristic is the design of AI outputs that are easily and reliably verifiable by the intended skilled end-user. This involves careful consideration of information presentation, the nature of the AI‚Äôs output, and ensuring the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.08063v1#:~:text=3.1.,Task%20Performance" rel="">right </a><span>user is targeted (e.g., AI accounting tools for accountants who can vet the suggestions).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This distinct model places the responsibility for </span><strong>verification and</strong><span> </span><strong>ensuring the quality of the final output squarely on the product or service provider</strong><span>. This involves the provider's own internal human review processes, often working in concert with AI and specialized software to deliver a "done-for-you," result. From the customer's perspective, the AI's imperfections are handled "behind the curtain."</span></p><p>The end-user perceives this as an "AI-powered service". Usually, this involves the provider taking over a specific, often narrow, function previously handled by the client, fulfilling it in a third-party services style. The client receives a completed task or a digestible deliverable, effectively outsourcing the complexity of managing the AI and its potential variance.</p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ol><li><p><strong>Specialized, narrow-scope offerings with optimized playbooks</strong><span>: Real value and defensibility are typically unlocked when a provider identifies a narrow scope‚Äîa specific, well-defined problem or function that can be demonstrably and massively improved with AI. This focus is critical because:</span></p><ol><li><p>Identifying such improvable functions and developing effective playbooks is a key capability in itself; achieving this across broader, more general functions is significantly more challenging.</p></li><li><p><span>As empirical findings to date </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/making-ai-work-leadership-lab-and" rel="">suggest,</a><span> simply layering AI onto existing broad processes (as some "</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/khosla-ventures-among-vcs-experimenting-with-ai-infused-roll-ups-of-mature-companies/" rel="">rollup</a><span>" strategies might attempt) often falls short of delivering significant productivity gains. True transformation typically requires a fundamental redesign of how work is done, which is most feasible within a narrow, provider-controlled scope.</span></p></li><li><p>Investing in a dedicated software layer around the LLM for a provider-managed workflow (e.g., specialized internal UIs, tailored integrations, automation scripts) typically yields a high return on investment. However, this level of impactful, specialized engineering is generally only feasible when the operational scope is narrowly defined; it becomes impractical or offers diminishing returns for overly broad, general-purpose applications.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>AI integration &amp; workforce management</strong><span>: The provider's operational ability to effectively integrate AI tools with their skilled human workforce to genuinely maximize productivity and quality is essential.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The pivotal role of domain expertise</strong><span>: This expertise is necessary for designing effective AI-augmented workflows, facilitating effective quality control, and ensuring the final output meets exacting client standards. This expertise becomes a significant competitive differentiator.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Provider control optimizes outcomes</strong><span>: A key advantage is that the provider designs and controls the optimal internal flow for how the AI is best used. There's no need to train end-users on the nuances of AI interaction (e.g., prompt engineering, watching for hallucinations), which removes a whole class of failure that no longer needs to be accounted for and gives the provider quite a wide margin of tolerable variance rates.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Providers have a strategic choice regarding transparency</strong><span>: whether or not to explicitly inform end-users that AI was involved in producing the service or deliverable.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The business dynamics closely resemble those of </span><strong>specialized, high-value third-party service providers</strong><span>. Brand reputation for quality, reliability, and deep expertise is paramount.</span></p></li><li><p>Subject to the amount of specialization, the addressable market for any single offering may be smaller, making a strategy of "dominating your pond" or achieving leadership in a specific niche essential for success.</p></li></ol><p>Oh we should have mentioned, there is technically one more strategy available‚Ä¶</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png" width="620" height="212.65033407572383" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:308,&quot;width&quot;:898,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:620,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8e0c90e-3a93-484c-9629-0027b07b0e23_898x308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>The unreliability of LLMs isn‚Äôt just a bug, it‚Äôs the foundational constraint that defines what‚Äôs worth building, how it should be built, and what defensibility even looks like in this new wave of AI-native products.</strong></p><p><span>Indeed, one could argue that unreliability is the </span><em>raison d'√™tre</em><span> for much of the application layer, </span><strong>it's the challenge that creates the opportunity for builders to deliver value</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Builders can‚Äôt wish the variance away.
