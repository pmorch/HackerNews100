<p dir="auto">Winamp is a multimedia player launched in 1997, iconic for its flexibility and wide compatibility with audio formats. Originally developed by Nullsoft, it gained massive popularity with still millions of users. Its development slowed down, but now, its source code was opened to the community, allowing developers to improve and modernize the playerto meet current user needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building of the Winamp desktop client is current based around Visual Studio 2019 (VS2019) and Intel IPP libs (You need to use exactly v6.1.1.035).
There are different options of how to build Winamp:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use a build_winampAll_2019.cmd script file that makes 4 versions x86/x64 (Debug and Release). In this case Visual Studio IDE not running.</li>
<li>Use a winampAll_2019.sln file to build and debug in Visual Studio IDE.</li>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/halide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halide</a> may have been featured during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 16</a> keynote, but it seems that wasn’t enough to protect it from an over-zealous App Store reviewer. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lux</a> co-founder Ben Sandofsky shared that the latest version of Halide was rejected from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> …</p>



<p>The reason? Because it seemingly wasn’t clear why a camera app needs access to the camera in order to take photos.</p>



<p>When you run Halide, the app of course requests access to the camera. Developers are required to explain why they require access to features like this, and Lux’s explanation seems reasonably clear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But it appears that Apple decided that wasn’t sufficiently clear, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandofsky/113181384256449181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandofsky explained</a> on Mastodon.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest Halide update was rejected because, after seven years, a random reviewer decided our permission prompt wasn’t descriptive enough.</p>



<p>I don’t know how to explain why a camera app needs camera permissions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2466517/app-store-review-is-still-broken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macworld’s</a></em> Macolope suggested clearer, if less grammatical, text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs for the app that you just downloaded to take photographs for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Halide is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/16/halide-gets-camera-control-support-also-available-from-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the apps to support</a> the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/19/familiarize-yourself-with-the-camera-control-button-before-your-iphone-16-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camera Control button</a> on the iPhone 16.</p>

    <h3><i>Almost</i>-Rans</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s the change of weather. Fall often finds me looking backward, to the past —&nbsp;and anyway it is as 
        good excuse as any as to why I have found myself peering into old hard drives trying to recover old bits and bytes from games that 
        I wrote some thirty-five years ago or so. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        Shareware games that I released all those years ago I gathered onto a disk image and posted to GitHub as 
        <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy Software — Early Shareware Projects</a>. 
        I wrote about the sometimes extraordinary work I needed to employ in order to recover some of these in 
        <a href="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/shareware/shareware.html">a blog post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disk image is the kind you can drag to a 68K or PPC Mac emulator such as <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>, 
            <a href="https://sheepshaver.cebix.net/">Sheepshaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">MiniVMac</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed up the shareware disk image with a disk image of <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Casady &amp; Greene Projects</a>. 
            Casady &amp; Greene was the name of the company that published my <b>Glider 4.0</b> game back in 1991 and so the sources and build tools 
            used to create <b>Glider 4.0</b> are on that disk image.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The thing that I enjoyed the most about this trip down memory lane was rediscovering and revisiting the <i>almost-rans</i>. 
        While the paper airplane game I released is what people might know, there were plenty of game experiments that never even 
        made it beyond the <i>Hello World</i> stage —&nbsp;for various reasons. What I rediscovered on the old hard drives were many of 
        those early experiments. In trying to recover them, get them to compile again, I was reminded that there are so many 
        indefinable things that go into making a <i>good</i> game. Some of these abandoned experiments may in fact have been gems 
        in the rough had I spent a little more time trying to facet them, polish them. Or maybe not.
    </p>

        <b>AirBikes</b> would have been a futuristic racing game —&nbsp;if it had been completed.

    </figure>
    <h3>Move Fast</h3>
    <p>
        I was really excited to also find a document that I had created in 1991 or so listing the games and “creator codes” that I 
        had used in these games. <i>Creator codes</i> were like a very crude “bundle identifier” back in the pre-OS-X era of the 
        Macintosh. They were supposed to be unique from all other application creator codes. The document is interesting to me today 
        because in it I had cataloged the projects that I had worked on up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows is the list I created containing a creator code followed by the name and then the state of the game:
    </p>
    <figure>
		<img width="524" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/creator_codes.jpg" alt="List of creator codes.">
	</figure>
    <p>
        Out of twenty-seven titles, five of them I released (highlighted above). What were the other applications? Quick prototypes. And these 
        represent the projects over about an eighteen-month period. <i>(At the time I created this list I was apparently “working on” 
        three titles.)</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I guess to be precise, I did release <i>UnMask</i> —&nbsp;a utility I spent ten minutes writing. I would dismiss it from the data though.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I was very prolific during that time —&nbsp;staying up well past midnight coding every night. I also developed a kind of 
        “shell” for the type of sprite-based games that I was experimenting with so that the cost of a new “sketch”, a prototype 
        game, was primarily paid for in <b>MacPaint</b> —&nbsp;creating the sprites, artwork. A little code for unique input methods, 
        some game mechanics or physics would also be needed. Sounds, high scores, saved games —&nbsp;these are the things we could 
        kick down the road, implement only for the deserving games.
    </p>

            Sprites from <b>AirBikes</b>.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
        But I was developing a methodology of prototyping ideas quickly in order to determine (quickly) if an idea had legs —&nbsp;if 
        it stuck to the wall so to speak.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype Things</h3>
    <p>
        Games are funny things. When I consider games that I liked, the reasons the game hooked me are often nuanced. I’m not sure 
        you can just set out and <i>make</i> a good game. Serendipity seems to plays a role. Or maybe it’s just that <i>I</i> have 
        found myself unable to just conjure up a great game the first go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Want to know if a kite-fighting game would be fun? Knock out enough of the game in a few days to where you can play with the 
        physics and control of the kite. If flying the kite is too difficult to master, probably no one is going to enjoy the game. 
        On the other hand if just flying the kite is fun, even without the combat element, you’re probably on to something.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/K-10.png" alt="Another unfinished game, K-10.">
        <figcaption>
            Another racing game, <b>K-10</b> (Kansas highway 10) never moved beyond the prototype stage.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Maybe you have played the arcade game, <b>Joust</b>. Even before enemies <i>rez in</i> it was fun just hitting the flap 
        button to fly —&nbsp;sometimes having to pace your flapping, sometimes flapping frenetically to climb quickly. Quite fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that a simple game where a paper airplane in a cluttered house had to make use of floor vents to get lift was kind 
        of fun as well —&nbsp;even before you realize you should be making progress through the rooms and avoiding toast or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as I say, there’s only one way to find out if what you <i>thought</i> would be fun on paper is in fact fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Abandon Them</h3>
    <p>
        Some games make it out of the starting gate but then you find there’s nowhere to go with the game. In my list at the top 
        of this post I had brutally noted <b>&lt;no point&gt;</b> for some games. Like the platformer game I began, 
        <b>Thief of Baghdad</b>, where you could ride a magic carpet and leap about. That was kind of fun, but … then what?
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Carpet.png" alt="Unfinished game, Thief of Baghdad.">
        <figcaption>
            <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> never got off the ground.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Consider too that I was a solitary programmer. So some games seemed to have potential but it became clear very quickly 
        that I would need to invest a year or more to get the game to a finished state. I loved <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and 
        would have loved to write a sprite-based adventure game. But, man, when I consider all the sprite-work that would be 
        required for the player, wielding all the weapons they might wield, all the monsters and their moves, all the spell 
        effects, etc. Never mind coding all the spells, varied combat, etc.

        But this is not a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">The Marriage Problem</a>, you can 
        always go back and revisit a game you had previously shelved. <i>(Assuming you can still find the sources, resources, and 
        project files.)</i> I did revisit <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> eighteen or so months later (in color and renamed <b>Scheherazade</b>) 
        and it even started to get “a point”.
    </p>

        Alas though, maybe you can’t go back after all —&nbsp;or perhaps <i>should</i> not. While I got further with the game in 
        its second incarnation, it never really attained that <i>indescribable something</i> and so was abandoned again.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Never mind that you can also <i>harvest</i> code from any of your shelved projects. I mean why rewrite the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm</a> if you have it already 
        in a shelved game? Code for switching the monitor depth (on those early Macs) I moved from game to game… Polygon-point 
        collision code, a sine lookup-table for quick trig functions, a dot-product routine, cross-product routines…
    </p>
    <p>
        I never regarded these prototyping efforts as wasted ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Salaryman</h3>
    <p>
       The era of the indie Mac game developer felt to me like it was coming to a close as the 1990’s decade proceeded. In any 
       event when I was presented with a job offer to come out to California and work at Apple I eagerly took it —&nbsp;even though 
       I understood that from that point on I would not be allowed to work on non-Apple projects in my spare time.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Not strictly true —&nbsp;to code outside of work though you did have to get written permission from management. 
        I mean it’s part of that whole <i>non-compete</i> clause —&nbsp;tech companies having been burned throughout history 
        by employees creating  start-ups that eventually take over their business. Apple was not in the <i>games business</i> 
        so perhaps I would have gotten a pass. It’s that fear that: what if I ask for permission and they say no?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Finding myself in a world of whiteboards and conference rooms made no difference —&nbsp;I found that I continued to take a 
        quick-prototyping approach to any project that landed on my desk (though, perhaps needless to say, the projects were no 
        longer games).
    </p>
    <p>
        Other programmers that I worked with (maybe I should call them <i>software engineers</i>) <i>designed</i> software. And they 
        made better use of the whiteboards than I did. Rather than iterate at compile-time like I was want to do, they would 
        instead carefully plan and design their software before ever typing a line of code —&nbsp;iterating I suppose on a whiteboard.
    </p>

            I wrote flight-sim code following a book and I soon had a steam-punk project … shelved (too much still to do).
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        From my approach of diving in rather than planning I began to regard myself at Apple as a “blue-collar” programmer 
        working among “white-collar” professionals (imposter syndrome maybe?). But to give myself some credit, after having 
        written code for seven years or so at this point, my instinct as to which direction to dive in with a task was at least 
        an informed one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There’s a guy on GitHub, his status is “I am typing on the keyboard to do the job.” Story of my life —&nbsp;I like it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        No doubt though, often enough, this freewheeling approach might send me into the weeds. But with the speed at which I 
        pulled the code together, I often found the bottlenecks fairly quickly —&nbsp;quick enough that I could more or less start 
        the whole project over. If you find this narrator reliable, I will say that I often would start and then restart a project 
        perhaps three times and, when all was said and done, have the project in as good a state at about the same time that my 
        white-collar cohorts would have their more carefully designed code also running.
    </p>
    <p>
        So was the whole exercise of my guerilla programming technique a wash? Maybe. But it always served <i>me</i> well 
        (or was perhaps the only way I knew to program effectively). Often though my last code <i>revision</i> was in fact to 
        simplify the code —&nbsp;generally to make it easier to follow, easier to understand, easier to maintain. <i>(The insight on 
        how at last to organize the code having come out of treating the whole thing as wildly mutable from the beginning.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        There were times too when a coworker might have said, “You should have used a Bloom Filter” and I was able to come back with, 
        “Yeah, already tried that but the typical data we are seeing is so small that the performance gains were negligible and added 
        unnecessary complexity to the code base so I tossed it.” Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Okay, maybe something like that happened only once —&nbsp;but it was awesome when it did!)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>A.B.I.</h3>
    <p>
        By the time I finally retired I had slowly come around to feeling like I had in fact been a contributing employee at Apple. 
        To be clear, it was important to me to be a contributing <i>co-worker</i> really. The engineers on the teams that I worked 
        on were the highlight of working as a salaryman (no longer coding solo in a monitor-lit corner of the bedroom all night). 
        I worked with the smartest people I have ever come to know. There were people I worked with that were an order of magnitude 
        better programmer than I will ever be. And it was important to me to feel like I was helping too in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I did rank among the <i>fastest</i> programmers. <i>(Is that a category?)</i> You wanted something prototyped to show as a 
        demo for a meeting this week, I’ll have two versions for you then (one with and without a Bloom Filter, ha ha).
    </p>
    <p>
        And this bit is for my daughters. I have always told them growing up, “A. B. I.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “‘A’ — Always. ‘B’ — Be. ‘I’ — Iterating.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Always Be Iterating.”
    </p>

            too be a lesson to game devs in all the times that a game has <i>not</i> launched. For me, as I stated at the outset, 
            I assembled these relics for the memories —&nbsp;or maybe to close that chapter.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
  
  <time datetime="2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Sep 2024</time>
  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> recently saw a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/post/3l2zpatdkjx2f">massive spike</a> in activity in response to Brazil’s ban of Twitter.</p>

<p>As a result, the AT Proto event firehose provided by Bluesky’s Relay at <code>bsky.network</code> has increased in volume by a huge amount. The average event rate during this surge increased by ~1,300%.</p>

<p>Before this new surge in activity, the firehose would produce around 24 GB/day of traffic. After the surge, this volume jumped to over 232 GB/day!</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/firehose_traffic.png" alt="Graph of firehose traffic vs a week prior"></p>

<p>Keeping up with the full, verified firehose quickly became less practical on cheap cloud infrastructure with metered bandwidth.</p>

<p>To help reduce the burden of operating bots, feed generators, labelers, and other non-verifying AT Proto services, I built <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> as an alternative, lightweight, filterable JSON firehose for AT Proto.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-firehose-works">How the Firehose Works</h2>

<p>The AT Proto firehose is a mechanism used to keep verified, fully synced copies of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">repos</a> of all users.</p>

<p>Since repos are represented as Merkle Search Trees, each firehose event contains an update to the user’s MST which includes all the changed blocks (nodes in the path from the root to the modified leaf). The root of this path is signed by the repo owner, and a consumer can keep their copy of the repo’s MST up-to-date by applying the diff in the event.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth explanation of how Merkle Trees are constructed, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901220955/https://www.baeldung.com/cs/merkle-trees">this explainer</a>.</p>

<p>Practically, this means that for every small JSON record added to a repo, we also send along some number of MST blocks (which are content-addressed hashes and thus very information-dense) that are mostly useful for consumers attempting to keep a fully synced, verified copy of the repo.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the difference between cloning a git repo v.s. just grabbing the latest version of the files without the <code>.git</code> folder. In this case, the firehose effectively streams the diffs for the repository with commits, signatures, and metadata, which is inherently heavier than a point-in-time checkout of the repo.</p>

<p>Because firehose events with repo updates are signed by the repo owner, they allow a consumer to process events from any operator without having to trust the messenger.</p>

<p>This is the “Authenticated” part of the Authenticated Transfer (AT) Protocol and is crucial to the correct functioning of the network.</p>

<p>That being said, of the hundreds of consumers of Bluesky’s production Relay, &gt;90% of them are building feeds, bots, and other tools that don’t keep full copies of the entire network and don’t verify MST operations at all.</p>

<p>For these consumers, all they actually process is the JSON records created, updated, and deleted in each event.</p>

<p>If consumers already trust the provider to do validation on their end, they could get by with a much more lightweight data stream.</p>

<h2 id="how-jetstream-works">How Jetstream Works</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> is a streaming service that consumes an AT Proto <code>com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos</code> <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream">stream</a> and converts it into lightweight, friendly JSON.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out yourself, you can connect to my public Jetstream instance and view all posts on Bluesky in realtime:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>websocat <span>"wss://jetstream.atproto.tools/subscribe?wantedCollections=app.bsky.feed.post"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Note: the above instance runs on a $5/mo VPS and is just run by me personally, official public Jetstream instances are coming soon</em></p>

<p>Jetstream converts the CBOR-encoded MST blocks produced by the AT Proto firehose and translates them into JSON objects that are easier to interface with using standard tooling available in programming languages.</p>

<p>Since Repo MSTs only contain records in their leaf nodes, this means Jetstream can drop all of the blocks in an event except for those of the leaf nodes, typically leaving only one block per event.</p>

<p>In reality, this means that Jetstream’s JSON firehose is nearly 1/10 the size of the full protocol firehose for the same events, but lacks the verifiability and signatures included in the protocol-level firehose.</p>

<p>Jetstream events end up looking something like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Each event lets you know the DID of the repo it applies to, when it was seen by Jetstream (a time-based cursor), and up to one updated repo record as serialized JSON.</p>

<p>Check out this 10 second CPU profile of Jetstream serving 200k evt/sec to a local consumer:
<img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/no_comp_cpu.png" alt="pprof of Jetstream showing CPU without compression"></p>

<p>By dropping the MST and verification overhead by consuming from relay we trust, we’ve reduced the size of a firehose of all events on the network from 232 GB/day to ~41GB/day, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="jetstream-and-zstd">Jetstream and <code>zstd</code></h3>

<p>I recently read a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240921070907/https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent">great engineering blog</a> from Discord about their use of <code>zstd</code> to compress websocket traffic to/from their Gateway service and client applications.</p>

<p>Since Jetstream emits marshalled JSON through the websocket for developer-friendliness, I figured it might be a neat idea to see if we could get further bandwidth reduction by employing <code>zstd</code> to compress events we send to consumers.</p>

<p><code>zstd</code> has two basic operating modes, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter3">“simple”</a> mode and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter7">“streaming”</a> mode.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-compression">Streaming Compression</h4>

<p>At first glance, streaming mode seems like it’d be a great fit. We’ve got a websocket connection with a consumer and streaming mode allows the compression to get more efficient over the lifetime of the connection.</p>

<p>I went and implemented a streaming compression version of Jetstream where a consumer can request compression when connecting and will get <code>zstd</code> compressed JSON sent as binary messages over the socket instead of plaintext.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this had a massive impact on Jetstream’s server-side CPU utilization. We were effectively compressing every message once per consumer as part of their streaming session. This was not a scalable approach to offering compression on Jetstream.</p>

<p>Additionally, Jetstream stores a buffer of the past 24 hours (configurable) of events on disk in <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble">PebbleDB</a> to allow consumers to replay events before getting transitioned into live-tailing mode.</p>

<p>Jetstream stores serialized JSON in the DB, so playback is just shuffling the bytes into the websocket without having to round-trip the data into a Go struct.</p>

<p>When we layer in streaming compression, playback becomes significantly more expensive because we have to compress outgoing events on-the-fly for a consumer that’s catching up.</p>

<p>In real numbers, this increased CPU usage of Jetstream by 23% while lowering the throughput of playback from ~200k evt/sec to ~28k evt/sec for a single local consumer.</p>

<p>When in streaming mode, we can’t leverage the bytes we compress for one consumer and reuse them for another consumer because <code>zstd</code>’s streaming context window may not be in sync between the two consumers. They haven’t received exactly the same data in the session so the clients on the other end don’t have their state machines in the same state.</p>

<p>Since streaming mode’s primary advantage is giving us eventually better efficiency as the encoder learns about the data, what if we just taught the encoder about the data at the start and compress each message statelessly?</p>

<h4 id="dictionary-mode">Dictionary Mode</h4>

<p><code>zstd</code> offers a mechanism for initializing an encoder/decoder with pre-optimized settings by providing a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data">dictionary</a> trained on a sample of the data you’ll be encoding/decoding.</p>

<p>Using this dictionary, <code>zstd</code> essentially uses it’s smallest encoded representations for the most frequently seen patterns in the sample data. In our case, where we’re compressing serialized JSON with a common event shape and lots of common property names, training a dictionary on a large number of real events should allow us to represent the common elements among messages in the smallest number of bytes.</p>

<p>For take two of Jetstream with <code>zstd</code>, let’s to use a single encoder for the whole service that utilizes a custom dictionary trained on 100,000 real events.</p>

<p>We can use this encoder to compress <em>every</em> event as we see it, before persisting and emitting it to consumers. Now we end up with two copies of every event, one that’s just serialized JSON, and one that’s statelessly compressed to <code>zstd</code> using our dictionary.</p>

<p>Any consumers that want compression can have a copy of the dictionary on their end to initialize a decoder, then when we broadcast the shared compressed event, all consumers can read it without any state or context issues.</p>

<p><em>This requires the consumers and server to have a pre-shared dictionary, which is a major drawback of this implementation but good enough for our purposes.</em></p>

<p>That leaves the problem of event playback for compression-enabled clients.</p>

<p>An easy solution here is to just store the compressed events as well!</p>

<p>Since we’re only sticking the JSON records into our PebbleDB, the actual size of the 24 hour playback window is &lt;8GB with sstable compression. If we store a copy of the JSON serialized event <em>and</em> a copy of the <code>zstd</code> compressed event, this will, at most, double our storage requirements.</p>

<p>Then during playback, if the consumer requests compression, we can just shuffle bytes out of the compressed version of the DB into their socket instead of having to move it through a <code>zstd</code> encoder.</p>

<h2 id="savings">Savings</h2>

<p>Running with a custom dictionary, I was able to get the average Jetstream event down from 482 bytes to just 211 bytes (~0.44 compression ratio).</p>

<p>Jetstream allows us to live tail all posts on Bluesky as they’re posted for as little as ~850 MB/day, and we could keep up with all events moving through the firehose during the Brazil Twitter Exodus weekend for 18GB/day (down from 232GB/day).</p>

<p>With this scheme, Jetstream is required to compress each event only once before persisting it to disk and emitting it to connected consumers.</p>

<p>The CPU impact of these changes is significant in proportion to Jetstream’s incredibly light load but it’s a flat cost we pay once no matter how many consumers we have.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_cpu.png" alt="Jetstream CPU pprof with compression"></p>

<p><em>(CPU profile from a 30 second pprof sample with 12 consumers live-tailing Jetstream)</em></p>

<p>Additionally, with Jetstream’s shared buffer broadcast architecture, we keep memory allocations incredibly low and the cost per consumer on CPU and RAM is trivial. In the allocation profile below, more than 80% of the allocations are used to consume the full protocol firehose.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_allocations.png" alt="Jetstream allocation pprof with compression"></p>

<p>The total resident memory of Jetstream sits below 16MB, 25% of which is actually consumed by the new <code>zstd</code> dictionary.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_ram.png" alt="Jetstream in-use memory pprof with compression"></p>

<p>To bring it all home, here’s a screenshot from the dashboard of my public Jetstream instance serving 12 consumers all with various filters and compression settings, running on a $5/mo OVH VPS.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/jetstream_dash.png" alt="jetstream dashboard screenshot"></p>

<p>At our new baseline firehose activity, a consumer of the protocol-level firehose would require downloading ~3.16TB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer getting all created, updated, and deleted records without compression enabled would require downloading ~400GB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer that only cares about posts and has <code>zstd</code> compression enabled can get by on as little as ~25.5GB/mo, &lt;99% of the full weight firehose.</p>

It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding (the first classic being <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/">Elite</a>, of course).</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not David Braben's original source code, as that hasn't been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that's been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="3D-Stacked CMOS Takes Moore’s Law to New Heights"><p><strong>Perhaps the most</strong> far-reaching technological achievement over the last 50 years has been the steady <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-better-way-to-measure-progress-in-semiconductors" target="_self">march toward ever smaller transistors</a>, fitting them more tightly together, and reducing their power consumption. And yet, ever since the two of us started our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> more than 20 years ago, we’ve been hearing the alarms that the descent into the infinitesimal was about to end. Yet year after year, brilliant new innovations continue to propel the semiconductor industry further.
</p><p>
	Along this journey, we engineers had to change the transistor’s architecture as we continued to scale down area and power consumption while boosting performance. The “planar” <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> designs that took us through the last half of the 20th century gave way to 3D fin-shaped devices by the first half of the 2010s. Now, these too have an end date in sight, with a new gate-all-around (GAA) structure rolling into production soon. But we have to look even further ahead because our ability to scale down even this new transistor architecture, which we call RibbonFET, has its limits.
</p><hr><p>
	So where will we turn for future scaling? We will continue to look to the third dimension. We’ve created experimental devices that stack atop each other, delivering logic that is 30 to 50 percent smaller. Crucially, the top and bottom devices are of the two complementary types, NMOS and PMOS, that are the foundation of all the logic circuits of the last several decades. We believe this 3D-stacked complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), or CFET (complementary field-effect transistor), will be the key to extending Moore’s Law into the next decade.
</p><h2>The Evolution of the Transistor </h2><p><strong>Continuous innovation is an essential underpinning of Moore’s Law</strong>, but each improvement comes with trade-offs. To understand these trade-offs and how they’re leading us inevitably toward 3D-stacked CMOS, you need a bit of background on transistor operation.
</p><p>
	Every metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET, has the same set of basic parts: the gate stack, the channel region, the source, and the drain. The source and drain are chemically doped to make them both either rich in mobile electrons (
	<em>n</em>-type) or deficient in them (<em>p</em>-type). The channel region has the opposite doping to the source and drain.
</p><div id="rebelltitem19" data-id="19" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-19" data-basename="particle-19" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669929004" data-use-pagination="False"><p>In the planar version in use in advanced microprocessors up to 2011, the MOSFET’s gate stack is situated just above the channel region and is designed to project an electric field into the channel region. Applying a large enough voltage to the gate (relative to the source) creates a layer of mobile charge carriers in the channel region that allows current to flow between the source and drain.</p><p>As we scaled down the classic planar transistors, what device physicists call short-channel effects took center stage. Basically, the distance between the source and drain became so small that current would leak across the channel when it wasn’t supposed to, because the gate electrode struggled to deplete the channel of charge carriers. To address this, the industry moved to an entirely different transistor architecture called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>. It wrapped the gate around the channel on three sides to provide better electrostatic control.</p></div><p><img id="e1679" data-rm-shortcode-id="19f1ce24c1d6d33cec903b159c775a2f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" width="1300" height="1300" alt="Blocks of grey, silver, and black with a stripe of gold dots on one and a fin-shaped structure of gold dots on the other."></p><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927851" data-use-pagination="False"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-new-transistors-enter-the-third-dimension" target="_self">Intel introduced its FinFETs</a> in 2011, at the 22-nanometer node, with the third-generation Core processor, and the device architecture has been the workhorse of Moore’s Law ever since. With FinFETs, we could operate at a lower voltage and still have less leakage, reducing power consumption by some 50 percent at the same performance level as the previous-generation planar architecture. FinFETs also switched faster, boosting performance by 37 percent. And because conduction occurs on both vertical sides of the “fin,” the device can drive more current through a given area of silicon than can a planar device, which only conducts along one surface.</p><p>However, we did lose something in moving to FinFETs. In planar devices, the width of a transistor was defined by lithography, and therefore it is a highly flexible parameter. But in FinFETs, the transistor width comes in the form of discrete increments—adding one fin at a time–a characteristic often referred to as fin quantization. As flexible as the FinFET may be, fin quantization remains a significant design constraint. The design rules around it and the desire to add more fins to boost performance increase the overall area of logic cells and complicate the stack of interconnects that turn individual transistors into complete logic circuits. It also increases the transistor’s capacitance, thereby sapping some of its switching speed. So, while the FinFET has served us well as the industry’s workhorse, a new, more refined approach is needed. And it’s that approach that led us to the 3D transistors we’re introducing soon.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927940" data-use-pagination="False"><p>This advance, the RibbonFET, is our first new transistor architecture since the FinFET’s debut 11 years ago.

CMOS logic became mainstream in the 1980s because it draws significantly less current than do the alternative technologies, notably NMOS-only circuits. Less current also led to greater operating frequencies and higher transistor densities.</p><p>To date, all CMOS technologies place the standard NMOS and PMOS transistor pair side by side. But in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8993462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keynote</a> at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8971803/proceeding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in 2019</a>, we introduced the concept of a 3D-stacked transistor that places the NMOS transistor on top of the PMOS transistor. The following year, at IEDM 2020, we presented <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9372066" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the design for the first logic circuit using this 3D technique</a>, an inverter. Combined with appropriate interconnects, the 3D-stacked CMOS approach effectively cuts the inverter footprint in half, doubling the area density and further pushing the limits of Moore’s Law.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Taking advantage of the potential benefits of 3D stacking means solving a number of process integration challenges, some of which will stretch the limits of CMOS fabrication.</p><p>We built the 3D-stacked CMOS inverter using what is known as a self-aligned process, in which both transistors are constructed in one manufacturing step. This means constructing both <em>n</em>-type and <em>p</em>-type sources and drains by epitaxy—crystal deposition—and adding different metal gates for the two transistors. By combining the source-drain and dual-metal-gate processes, we are able to create different conductive types of silicon nanoribbons (<em>p</em>-type and <em>n</em>-type) to make up the stacked CMOS transistor pairs. It also allows us to adjust the device’s threshold voltage—the voltage at which a transistor begins to switch—separately for the top and bottom nanoribbons.</p></div><p><img id="be20b" data-rm-shortcode-id="6b57a2642594eb748f7a1356e29d79ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" width="1498" height="1060" alt="Three pairs of two grey rectangles float above three more pairs of grey rectangles in a black-and-white micrograph."><small><p>In CMOS logic, NMOS and PMOS devices usually sit side by side on chips. An early prototype has NMOS devices stacked on top of PMOS devices, compressing circuit sizes.</p></small><small><p>Intel</p></small></p><p>How do we do all that? The self-aligned 3D CMOS fabrication begins with a silicon wafer. On this wafer, we deposit repeating layers of silicon and silicon germanium, a structure called a superlattice. We then use lithographic patterning to cut away parts of the superlattice and leave a finlike structure. The superlattice crystal provides a strong support structure for what comes later.</p><p>Next, we deposit a block of “dummy” polycrystalline silicon atop the part of the superlattice where the device gates will go, protecting them from the next step in the procedure. That step, called the vertically stacked dual source/drain process, grows phosphorous-doped silicon on both ends of the top nanoribbons (the future NMOS device) while also selectively growing boron-doped silicon germanium on the bottom nanoribbons (the future PMOS device). After this, we deposit dielectric around the sources and drains to electrically isolate them from one another. The latter step requires that we then polish the wafer down to perfect flatness.</p><p>Finally, we construct the gate. First, we remove that dummy gate we’d put in place earlier, exposing the silicon nanoribbons. We next etch away only the silicon germanium, releasing a stack of parallel silicon nanoribbons, which will be the channel regions of the transistors. We then coat the nanoribbons on all sides with a vanishingly thin layer of an insulator that has a high dielectric constant. The nanoribbon channels are so small and positioned in such a way that we can’t effectively dope them chemically as we would with a planar transistor. Instead, we use a property of the metal gates called the work function to impart the same effect. We surround the bottom nanoribbons with one metal to make a <em>p</em>-doped channel and the top ones with another to form an <em>n</em>-doped channel. Thus, the gate stacks are finished off and the two transistors are complete.</p><div id="rebelltitem14" data-id="14" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-14" data-basename="particle-14" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928471" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The process might seem complex, but it’s better than the alternative—a technology called sequential 3D-stacked CMOS. With that method, the NMOS devices and the PMOS devices are built on separate wafers, the two are bonded, and the PMOS layer is transferred to the NMOS wafer. In comparison, the self-aligned 3D process takes fewer manufacturing steps and keeps a tighter rein on manufacturing cost, something we demonstrated in research and reported at IEDM 2019.<br></p><p>Importantly, the self-aligned method also circumvents the problem of misalignment that can occur when bonding two wafers. Still, sequential 3D stacking is being explored to facilitate integration of silicon with nonsilicon channel materials, such as germanium and III-V semiconductor materials. These approaches and materials may become relevant as we look to tightly integrate optoelectronics and other functions on a single chip.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem17" data-id="17" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-17" data-basename="particle-17" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928814" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The new self-aligned CMOS process, and the 3D-stacked CMOS it creates, work well and appear to have substantial room for further miniaturization. At this early stage, that’s highly encouraging. Devices having a gate length of 75 nm demonstrated both the low leakage that comes with excellent device scalability and a high on-state current. Another promising sign: We’ve made wafers where the smallest distance between two sets of stacked devices is only <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720633" target="_blank">55 nm</a>. While the device performance results we achieved are not records in and of themselves, they do compare well with individual nonstacked control devices built on the same wafer with the same processing.</p><p>In parallel with the process integration and experimental work, we have many ongoing theoretical, simulation, and design studies underway looking to provide insight into how best to use 3D CMOS. Through these, we’ve found some of the key considerations in the design of our transistors. Notably, we now know that we need to optimize the vertical spacing between the NMOS and PMOS—if it’s too short it will increase parasitic capacitance, and if it’s too long it will increase the resistance of the interconnects between the two devices. Either extreme results in slower circuits that consume more power.</p><p>Many design studies, such as one by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720577/" target="_blank">TEL Research Center America presented at IEDM 2021</a>, focus on providing all the necessary interconnects in the 3D CMOS’s limited space and doing so without significantly increasing the area of the logic cells they make up. The TEL research showed that there are many opportunities for innovation in finding the best interconnect options. That research also highlights that 3D-stacked CMOS will need to have interconnects both above and below the devices. This scheme, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">buried power rails</a>, takes the interconnects that provide power to logic cells but don’t carry data and removes them to the silicon below the transistors. Intel’s PowerVIA technology, which does just that and is scheduled for introduction in 2024, will therefore play a key role in making 3D-stacked CMOS a commercial reality.</p><h2>The Future of Moore’s Law</h2><p>With RibbonFETs and 3D CMOS, we have a clear path to extend Moore’s Law beyond 2024. In a <a href="https://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph250/lee1/docs/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2005 interview</a> in which he was asked to reflect on what became his law, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gordon-moore">Gordon Moore</a> admitted to being “periodically amazed at how we’re able to make progress. Several times along the way, I thought we reached the end of the line, things taper off, and our creative engineers come up with ways around them.”</p><p>With the move to FinFETs, the ensuing optimizations, and now the development of RibbonFETs and eventually 3D-stacked CMOS, supported by the myriad packaging enhancements around them, we’d like to think Mr. Moore will be amazed yet again.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

I built a rugged, durable collapsable duck blind on an 18 foot Lund Alaskan. Excellent product. I found out about this product on the Facebook page DIY duck boat and blind builders page. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to build something DIY but with a bit more of a professional finish.</p> <p>

                        Rick C.<br></p></div> <div data-block-id="1489285524898-1"> <p>I looked into railing kits but to get what I want it's stupid expensive. I've worked for an electrical contractor and I've built countless solutions to crazy problems using EMT conduit, usually by welding which is difficult and dangerous because of the zinc galvanize. I no longer have access to a welder so I began to search "conduit fittings" which led me to Maker Pipe which is the coolest concept ever!</p> <p>

<p><span>Anime – what started as a niche genre of manga and animation has become a multi-billion dollar </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>industry</span></a><span> in its own right, with chart-topping games like </span><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-go-catches-nearly-8-billion-in-eight-years/#:~:text=Niantic's%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Go%20has,launched%2C%20according%20to%20AppMagic%20estimates." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon Go</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1208573/genshin-impact-player-spending-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span> grossing billions and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_%E2%80%93_The_Movie:_Mugen_Train" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>movies</span></a><span> like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba becoming one of the highest grossing films of the year.

We estimate the total </span><b>market size of anime to be north of $50B</b><span>, once accounting for anime, comics, and games (</span><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/go/the-state-of-anime-gaming-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>data</span></a><span>.ai, </span><a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Precedence Research</span></a><span>).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yet, </span><b>we believe that anime is just getting started – today, new technologies and business models are accelerating a once niche industry to even greater heights</b><span>. Anime is where the future of creation and play is happening, whether with innovative games on our phones, user-created fanfictions and games, roleplaying as the characters themselves, or interactions with AI-versions of these fictional beings. We believe that anime will become one of the dominant formats through which we consume and engage with content.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The usual lifecycle of an anime fan looks something like this: they are introduced to the format with great IP – the Attack on Titan anime or the One Piece live action show or one of the miHoYo games. They then deepen their fandom through new forms of social and creative engagement (UGC, VTubing, community formation, cosplay, etc.). </span><b>What we’re most excited about is how anime engagement has evolved from passive to interactive over the last few years. </b><span>This has happened along a few different axes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>AI companions</b><span>, an evolution of classic visual novels, are the most popular for anime characters and IP. They are quickly becoming one of the dominant forms of roleplay.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>UGC platforms</b><span> (user-generated content) such as Roblox allow anime fans to create their own renditions of popular anime games much more easily than ever before. Fans can express their creativity with play that they define themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Anime studios</b><span> are adopting new AI technologies to create content faster and more cost effectively, but they are also iterating on new core loops with AI-native character interactions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>VTubing</b><span> has transformed the way millions of anime fans interact with their favorite characters in new social and parasocial relationships by allowing any fan to roleplay as the characters themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>

<h2><span>A Quick History of Anime</span></h2>
<p><span>Anime is a genre of animation that originated from Japan and is known for its distinctive art style: bright colorful graphics, strong outlines, large, exaggerated eyes and features, and brightly colored hair. It originated in the early 1900s with visual strips, but really started becoming more popular in the 60s and 70s with shows like </span><i><span>Astro Boy, Lupin III, Akira, Mobile Suit Gundam, </span></i><span>and of course, Hayao Miyazaki’s works at Studio Ghibli. Anime entered the mainstream in the 2000s with popular shounen anime like Naruto, One Piece, and now Attack on Titan. You might see football players referencing the Attack on Titan </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1367264349581148170" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>salute</span></a><span> as a celebration, or pop culture memes all around the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays anime is more popular than ever: </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/sony-crunchyroll-specialty-streamer-asian-content-1235352518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Crunchyroll</span></a><span> estimated that viewership doubled between 2020-2022 alone to over 300M fans worldwide. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/japan-content-boom-1235753598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> reported in 2022 that over half of its subscribers worldwide watched some anime content on its platform. The top 4 </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1327143/discord-top-gaming-servers-worldwide-by-number-of-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Discord servers</span></a><span> worldwide are all anime-related. Anime is also a medium that caters to many different audience types, from mature </span><i><span>seinen </span></i><span>anime like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Monster</span></a><span> to classic action </span><i><span>shounen </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_demon%2520slayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Demon Slayer</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_naruto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Naruto</span></a><span>, from female-oriented </span><i><span>shoujo </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816397/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_ouran%2520" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ouran High School Club</span></a><span> to contemplative slice of life stories like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0807832/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_mushi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mushi-shi</span></a><span>. Because of this broad appeal, there’s a huge community of diverse fans that have engaged with the medium over many years and developed strong affinity toward IP and characters. This affinity has led to one of the most popular use cases of AI recently –&nbsp; AI waifus and husbandos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The Rise of AI Waifus / Husbandos</span></h2>
<p><span>First, to explain popular slang – what is a </span><a href="https://www.cbr.com/anime-waifu-popularity-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>waifu</span></a><span> or husbando? Waifus / husbandos are fictionalized girls and guys who viewers feel some level of emotional or romantic attachment to. This isn’t as rare of an occurrence as one might think; </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/2024/1/22/24034466/anime-viewer-survey-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Polygon</span></a><span> reported that 44% of surveyed anime viewers reported developing a crush on an anime character. “The other 56% are lying,” the report jokes. After all, anime fans tend to express their fandom deeply through merch, fanart, conventions, cosplay, and other means (66% make some form of fan art according to </span><a href="https://view-su2.highspot.com/viewer/64d51fda505755b87e89cb58#_ga=2.94274269.1720429966.1709007503-1299405015.1706207646" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>fandom</span></a><span>). So it’s not surprising that they would also develop a deep attachment to the characters. Anime Expo in LA for instance, routinely attracts hundreds of thousands of fans each year, the a16z team included.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Waifu / husbando culture derives from visual novels, and AI companions are the logical extension of these animated storybook games. Originally, </span><a href="https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/a-brief-history-of-visual-novels-641a2e6b1acb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visual novels</span></a><span> were serialized books with anime-styled pictures in between. But now the term colloquially refers to the digital version in which the player has agency, with branching storylines where you roleplay as the main character, advancing through the plot and choosing to romance other male/female characters. This is a relatively niche market (</span><a href="https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-26F13788/global-visual-novel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>~$150M</span></a><span> according to some sources), but one that has an outsized impact on the industry. For example, Fate/Grand Order, one of the most successful gacha games with $5B+ cumulative revenue, is descended from a visual novel called Fate/Stay Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The structure of the visual novel with branching dialogue trees is a precursor to modern AI companions today. While there are many practical use cases for AI-simulated human interactions – AI as therapist, as teacher, as assistant, etc. – one of the most popular realizations are as friends and romantic companions (more on the broader companion space from my colleagues </span><a href="https://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>). For instance, </span><a href="https://beta.character.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>character.ai</span></a><span>’s top characters are all from Genshin Impact; Raiden, Yae Miko, and Hu Tao take some of the top spots at 390M, 202M, and 113M messages respectively as of the time of this blog, compared to Elon Musk at a mere 40M messages. Other top characters are Gojo Satoru (638M) from popular shounen </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12343534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></a><span> and Levi Ackerman (250M) from </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Attack on Titan</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Many of the top companion sites like </span><a href="http://janitorai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>janitorai</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://chub.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>chub.ai</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="http://spicychat.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>spicychat.ai</span></a><span> also feature anime companions – ranging from roleplay with school bullies to overprotective sisters to… furries? – as some of their top personalities. There are also vertically specific companion apps for anime: </span><a href="http://crushon.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>crushon.ai</span></a><span> is an 18+ example, </span><a href="https://www.talkie-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>talkieai</span></a><span> is relatively safe-for-work, while </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyper</span></a><span> includes VTuber-esque live facial elements. There’s </span><a href="https://www.moemate.io/?page=1&amp;tags=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>moemate</span></a><span> which allows you to bring the companions cross-browser and play games like chess and checkers, and </span><a href="https://kajiwoto.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>kajiwoto</span></a><span> that allows you to more deeply customize your prompts and datasets and share them on server.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>AI is deepening the previously parasocial relationships we had with our favorite anime characters from passive linear media, into powerful new, interactive relationships</b><span>. The reason why anime is so resonant as a genre for AI companions is because character affinity / romance is already built into many of the best anime stories. The majority of top anime games and visual novels are role playing games that feature a romance mechanic, and so it’s natural for fans to want to deepen their connection to their favorite IP and characters through active interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As AI advances, the interactions will become non-scripted and more multi-modal: we’ll interact with our companions through voice and text, their animations and reactions will be generated in real time, we’ll be able to play games with them, and they’ll have longer context windows to remember our shared history together. We’re already seeing startups pushing the boundaries for how we interact with content. </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.sekai.app&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sekai</span></a><span> is using AI to create short, bite-sized videos of you and anime characters in fanfiction-esque scenarios. Meanwhile, there are several stealth studios that are building </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otome_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>otome games</span></a><span> in the vein of </span><a href="https://loveanddeepspace.infoldgames.com/en-EN/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Love and Deep Space</span></a><span> ($200m+ annualized revenue, SensorTower), but where the side quests, dates, and interaction texts in the game are AI-generated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>UGC Democratizes Creation for Anime Fans</span></h2>
<p><b>Anime is the new playground for content creation.</b><span> Fans often engage with anime IP by creating their own versions of art, novels, and games, and innovation is happening across the stack. There’s </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> for art, </span><a href="https://novelai.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NovelAI</span></a><span> for fanfiction, </span><a href="https://www.fanbox.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixivFANBOX</span></a><span> for creator support, and UGC-platforms for games. For instance, several of the top Roblox games are based on IP like One Piece or One Punch Man, and for a platform with over 60M DAU and 300M MAU, this is a very broad player base of anime fans. In particular, Roblox is a good proxy for what’s trending with the younger generation given its </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1190869/roblox-games-users-global-distribution-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>demographic</span></a><span> skews towards kids and teens. Similar to how AI companions give fans a new way to interact with IP, UGC allows them to reimagine and remix their favorite IP in wholly new contexts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There are a few notable reasons for the popularity of these games. The first is that there’s clear player demand against a shortage of high quality anime IP games; one example is Palworld’s recent success as the “Pokemon with guns” game, selling </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-sells-15-million-on-steam-in-a-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>over 25M copies</span></a><span> in a month across Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The second reason is that the anime IP licensing landscape is notoriously difficult to navigate for developers, creating a potential undersupply of games. Besides the language and cultural barrier, IP may be owned by different parties for different regions and different formats (movie, game, manga, etc.). Large aggregators like Crunchyroll and Funimation may already own exclusive licenses for certain IPs altogether. Some startups like </span><a href="https://en.kasagilabo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kasagi Labo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.layerlicensing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Layer</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.story.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Story Protocol</span></a><span> are tackling this issue to make IP more democratized and easier to access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>We believe that as new AI tools emerge and existing UGC platforms embrace AI, we’ll see the barriers to creation drop and the release of even more fan-created transmedia content. </b><span>Roblox has already incorporated </span><a href="https://aibusiness.com/nlp/roblox-gives-users-ai-tools-to-generate-3d-models-from-text-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI into user workflows</span></a><span>, and Google’s DeepMind team recently announced </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genie</span></a><span> which can convert prompts into 2D playable environments. The Tencent team also recently unveiled </span><a href="https://gamegen-o.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GameGen-O</span></a><span> which pushes the boundaries for generated open world games like Genshin Impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond UGC platforms, AI models and tools are enabling first-time creators to make compelling anime content that previously would only have been possible with a team of professionals. For art, </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> is an image diffusion model focused on generating high-quality anime images from text, a collaboration between </span><a href="https://spellbrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Spellbrush</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Midjourney</span></a><span>. There are also various fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models (a few </span><a href="https://civitai.com/tag/anime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span> hosted on citiv.ai) that capture different styles and poses, some trained on SD 1.5, others like </span><a href="https://civitai.com/models/260267" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Animagine XL V3</span></a><span> on SDXL 1.0. </span><a href="https://yodayo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Yodayo</span></a><span> integrates AI generated anime art and character chatbots together, and </span><a href="https://pixai.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixai.art</span></a><span> contains models that mimic popular IP (Genshin, Pokemon, Blue Archive, etc.).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For animations and video there are several options available for the aspiring creator. </span><a href="https://runwayml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RunwayML</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Luma Labs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.hedra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hedra</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://pika.art/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PikaLabs</span></a><span> have built foundation models for text-to-video generation. One can use </span><a href="https://domoai.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>domoAI</span></a><span> for anime-specific polish, and </span><a href="https://magnific.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>MagnificAI</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-photo-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Topaz Labs</span></a><span> to enhance images and image-to-video prompts. </span><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ElevenLabs</span></a><span> is used for voiceovers and dubs, and </span><a href="https://www.udio.com/"><span>Udio</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://suno.com/"><span>Suno</span></a><span> are used for music. For manga/comics, there are companies like </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/shortbread" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Shortbread</span></a><span> that are helping to create webcomics and manga more seamlessly, with context and consistency between scenes and shots. There’s still a way to go to improve model accuracy, speed, and cost, but it’s clear that as these tools evolve they will empower more creators that might previously have lacked technical or artistic skills to bring their anime ideas to life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Anime Game Studios Lead the Way&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>On the other side of the spectrum, professional game studios are leading the charge for high production-value consumer experiences that build on or create new IP. </span><b>Anime games are some of the highest grossing in the games industry, </b><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/mobile-gaming/state-of-anime-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>accounting for 20%</b></a><b> of spend on the mobile app store despite only having usage penetration of &lt;3%</b><span>. For example, Monster Strike has out-earned Candy Crush ($7.6B cumulative revenue vs. $6.9B) on a much smaller player base of 10M MAU vs. Candy Crush’s 70M+ MAU (SensorTower, 2016-19). Meanwhile, miHoYo’s Genshin Impact is on track to be one of the highest earning games of all time at its current trajectory (see below), with nearly $4B earned since launching just over three years ago.</span></p>

<p><span>There are two ways that anime game studios broaden the horizon for players. First, they usually create the highest quality games of the most popular IPs like Dragon Ball, Pokemon, or Dragon Quest. Six of the top 10 highest grossing anime games are based on existing IP, allowing fans to interact directly with the characters themselves. Second, they often innovate on core game loops or technology: miHoYo’s Genshin Impact was one of the first true cross-platform anime games, GungHo’s Puzzles &amp; Dragons mixed match-3 and RPG mechanics for the first time, and Riot’s Valorant was one of the most accessible entries into tactical first person shooters. There are also&nbsp; several stealth startups experimenting with weaving LLMs into visual novel gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, what makes these games so compelling and why do they make so much money? We theorize that there are a few key components that contribute to their success:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Proven, better, new. </b><span>A lot of the games that have become breakout hits like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pokemon Go</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</span></a><span> combine familiar systems with some form of unique gameplay innovation. For Pokemon it was the unique location-based game system combined with being the first Pokemon game on the mobile platform and for Genshin it was combining the open world gameplay of Zelda with the RPG elements of a traditional gacha and true cross-platform play. However, for many games, the bulk of many systems will be borrowed from the existing status quo and best-in-class from other games: banner-based live ops and events, gacha monetization, power creep and player progression, character personality archetypes like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>tsunderes</span></a><span>, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>RPG at its core. </b><span>Almost all the highest grossing games this year were role-playing games (RPGs). In this genre, players have one, or multiple characters that they “role-play” as by leveling them up, fighting monsters, equipping items, changing builds, etc. This isn’t surprising given that RPGs make up the highest spend for all mobile games (31%) despite having some of the lowest downloads by genre (3%). They are simply very deep games that the most hardcore gamers tend to gravitate towards, and can monetize well through pay for power or gacha.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Strong / compelling IP. </b><span>It’s not an accident that six of the top ten anime games license popular IP for their titles. In anime games, because character collection is a primary driver of gameplay and monetization, IP is very important to drive that core motivation. Story matters.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Gacha monetization. </b><span>Gacha games have some of the highest average revenue per user (ARPU) in the industry and is a reason why Japan has some of the highest </span><a href="https://asoindex.io/mobile-growth/why-arpu-in-japan-surpasses-other-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ARPU by country</span></a><span>. Gacha traces its history back to </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2017/08/19/lifestyle/gachapon-tracing-evolution-japans-colorful-toy-capsules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gachapon</span></a><span>, Japanese toy machines that dispense a random toy each time you put in a coin. The modern equivalent would be trading card packs such as in FIFA Ultimate Team. There is some controversy over this monetization practice, but more recent games have raised S-tier earn rates, added pity drops, and increased the drip of premium currency to balance out monetization and fun.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For now, we’ve been covering mostly free-to-play (F2P) mobile games. However, there are several successful PC/console anime games as well: </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Doki Doki Literature Club</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Persona series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Final Fantasy series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Fire Emblem series</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Phoenix Wright</span></a><span>, just to name a few. Many of these game franchises have been sold quite successfully through a premium business model. For instance, the Final Fantasy VII remake was one of the most anticipated in the series, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1252583111390408706" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sold over 3.5M copies in the first 3 days</span></a><span>. After three years, it’s now sold over </span><a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1702446167185883194?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>7 million copies total</span></a><span>.</span></p>

			
	
<p><span>There are several startups that have taken up the mantle in the West to build anime games for a global audience, and we’re excited to see what kinds of new experiences they create for players. </span><a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Odyssey Interactive</span></a><span> is building competitive multiplayer PvP games like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOXlvs87Lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Omega Strikers</span></a><span>. </span><a href="https://www.pahdolabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pahdo Labs</span></a><span> is building a UGC platform starting with the anime game Starlight Re:Volver. </span><a href="https://believer.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Believer</span></a><span> is building an open world drawing on inspiration from Genshin Impact. </span><a href="https://www.studiosai.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Studio Sai</span></a><span> has made a hybrid dating action game, while </span><a href="https://starmi.com/our-vision#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Starmi</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.gaudiumstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Gaudium</span></a><span> are both creating collectible hero gacha action games. These are just a few of the studios that are focused on realizing anime worlds for players. We believe that these studios will continue to push the boundaries of gameplay and technology, and we’re excited to see these new experiences come to fruition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>VTubing Blurs Human-Digital Interactions</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve seen how AI companions, UGC, and games allow players different ways of interacting with popular anime IP. VTubing takes it to the next level where fans can </span><i><span>become </span></i><span>popular anime characters themselves. VTuber stands for “Virtual YouTuber” and refers to a content creator who overlays an anime facial / body rig that tracks their real time motion and projects a digital avatar onto the stream (e.g. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kizuna AI</span></a><span>). This phenomenon likely spawned from virtual idols such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hatsune Miku</span></a><span> that exist as fully digital characters, similar to virtual influencers like </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lil Miquela</span></a><span> in the west. There are various things that VTubers will do on stream, usually a mix of singing, chatting, dancing, and gaming. It allows for the creator to adopt a different personality, and makes it easier to create content regardless of appearance or age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1291" srcset="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png 2000w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-300x194.png 300w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1024x661.png 1024w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-768x496.png 768w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1536x991.png 1536w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-400x258.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span>Today, VTubing is a relatively small but fast-growing community that has potential to ride the anime wave into a much larger segment of content viewership and creation. While VTubers only represent </span><a href="https://blog.gamesight.io/vtuber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>0.4% of all streamers on Twitch</span></a><span>, they represent 5.7% of total viewership. And in the first half of 2023, VTubing viewership rose by 28% despite overall Twitch views staying flat. Some of the top VTubers like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChgPVLjqugDQpRLWvC7zzig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ironmouse</span></a><span> have millions of viewers, and are professionally run by organizations like </span><a href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>VShojo </span></a><span>or </span><a href="https://hololivepro.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hololive</span></a><span>. </span><b>One day, VTubing could become just as ubiquitous as Memojis on Apple FaceTime or Snapchat filters.</b></p>
<p><span>Startups are tackling this market from a few different angles. </span><a href="https://ironvertex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Iron Vertex</span></a><span> is the go to for professional rigs done by designers experienced in Live2D, but if you need a cheaper option, startups like </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyperonline</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.gohibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GoHibe</span></a><span> are making it easier than ever to design your own avatar. </span><a href="http://mtion.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mtion.tv</span></a><span> meanwhile helps users design the background and environment for their avatar with visual based programming. There’s also VTubers like </span><a href="https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Neuro-sama" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Neuro-sama</span></a><span>, which is an AI that represents a human VTubing streamer, and platforms that are native to the VTuber experience like </span><a href="https://anilive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Anilive</span></a><span>. If anime companions represent the human-digital relationship and multiplayer games the human-to-human relationship, then VTubing sits in the middle as a unique parasocial relationship mixing digital and human interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>Today, anime is more than an art style, it’s a content format and cultural aesthetic that has transcended gender, race, age, and geography to become one of the largest and most profitable creative industries. Anime is also leading the way for digital play, turning previously passive consumption of linear media into a new dynamic form of entertainment. We’re excited about how anime is shaping the future of interactivity through its embrace of new technologies and business models: from AI agents to UGC platforms, from artistry tools to novel game mechanics, from interactive VTubing to new anime platforms. It’s clear that the best is yet to come for current and future anime fans.&nbsp;</span></p>
