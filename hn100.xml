  <strong>A network of fake Scottish</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25757818.ofcom-launches-probe-x-ai-chatbot-concerns/" target="_blank"><strong>X accounts</strong></a> <strong>linked to</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/national/25758779.swinney-very-concerned-situation-iran/" target="_blank"><strong>Iran</strong></a> <strong>has gone dark, after an internet blackout was imposed in the</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25756687.iranian-scientist-glasgow-calls-government-back-protestors/" target="_blank"><strong>West Asian</strong></a> <strong>nation.</strong>
</p><p>
  The silence from the group of accounts, which began on Thursday, comes amid widespread protests against the leadership of the Islamic Republic.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  Industry publication <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UK Defence Journal</a>, which has tracked the accounts for months, <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said that</a> multiple X accounts claiming to be supporters of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/scottish-independence/?ref=au" target="_blank">Scottish independence</a> have ceased activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  One such account, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/fiona175161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fiona</a>’, has not posted since Thursday.
</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-575 575w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-962 962w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-642 1400w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-620 1401w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 575px, (max-width: 992px) 962px, (max-width: 1400px) 1400px, (min-width: 1401px) 1401px" width="100%"><span>The accounts went silent after the internet was cut amid protests in Iran. <em>(Image: PA)</em></span>
</p>
<p>
  The account, which describes itself as “a proud Scottish lass” and “passionate about Scotland's independence &amp; our right to self-determination”, is based in Europe (according to X’s location data).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  However, this is likely due to the use of a VPN which obscures the country or region the account is located in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Other accounts, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/jakeq9170/status/2009122928085160433" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jake</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://x.com/lucy9760" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lucy</a>’, have also been quiet since the blackout began.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  The accounts, which have thousands of followers, increasingly shared extreme content in the days prior to going dark.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Jake’ claimed that a “top BBC anchor resigned on air and was immediately detained by security services” and that “crowds have surrounded the residence of the newly appointed ‘Governor General’ imposed by London”.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/edinburgh-news/?ref=au" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> go viral”.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Lucy’ claimed that "farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘<a href="https://x.com/kelly18600" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25413339.iranian-bots-behind-1-300-pro-independence-x-accounts/" target="_blank">disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed</a> that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.

  Similarly, a 2024 <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/images/hiding-under-the-kilt1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by researchers at Clemson University has estimated that 4% of content relating to independence were linked to one Iranian-backed bot network of around 80 accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  According to the study, "the accounts in this network all have false persona which purport to be citizens of the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  "They post messages which support left leaning political views and attack conservative politicians, champion Scottish independence and back the Scottish National Party (<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/snp/" target="_blank">SNP</a>) and denounce <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/israel/" target="_blank">Israel</a> and its behavior in the ongoing war in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/gaza/" target="_blank">Gaza</a>.”

            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:16:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/">https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46597518">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Before I start, let me get two things out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this article I’m <strong>not</strong> going to include the admittedly cool <a href="https://www.brow.sh/">browsh,</a> because it only works by utilizing Firefox under the hood. When I say text-based, I’m talking about old-school browsers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks">ELinks</a>, <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> or <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m.</a> These are also the three browsers I’ve used to test everything described below.</li>
<li>The whole article ended up being a rant about how text-based browsers deal with features that got added to HTML. Or more like, how they neglect dealing with said features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-text-based-web-browsers-still-matter" tabindex="-1">Do text-based web browsers still matter?</h2>
<p>Well, I won’t be the judge of that. I like them, I have them installed, and I test every project I create in them. But they are not what I use to surf the web.</p>
<p>Speaking of testing your creations, here’s the good news: If your project has a solid HTML foundation that you then <a href="https://cssence.com/2021/the-day-the-website-stood-still/">progressively enhance</a> with CSS and JS, you are off to a great start.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-html-evolve-in-recent-years" tabindex="-1">How did HTML evolve in recent years?</h2>
<p>While CSS is the star of the show when it comes to new features, HTML ain’t stale either. If we put the long-awaited <strong>styleable selects</strong> and Apple’s take on <strong>toggle switches</strong> aside, there’s a lot readily available cross-browser.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Whenever we say cross-browser, we usually look at the big ones, never at text-based browsers. So in this article I wanna shed some light on how they handle the following recent additions.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-text-based-web-browsers-handle-modern-html" tabindex="-1">How do text-based web browsers handle modern HTML?</h2>
<nav aria-labelledby="toc">

<ul>
<li><a href="#details">Details</a></li>
<li><a href="#data-lists">Data lists</a></li>
<li><a href="#dialogs">Dialogs</a></li>
<li><a href="#popovers">Popovers</a></li>
<li><a href="#inert-content-areas">Inert content areas</a></li>
<li><a href="#hidden-content">Hidden content</a></li>
<li><a href="#visually-hidden-content">Visually hidden content</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
<p>When viewing a web page in a text-based browser, you essentially get plain HTML, no CSS, no JS. There is some “styling”, a result of the elements’ semantics, but don’t expect anything fancy, we are down to colors, indentation, and centered text.</p>
<p>It reminds me of what the browsers we are used to give us when they show unstyled HTML—well, HTML with the browser default styles, to be exact. That in turn reminds me of <a href="https://cssence.com/about/css-naked-day/">CSS Naked Day.</a></p>
<p>Text-based browsers work well with good old HTML. Said recent additions however are a bit more nuanced (e.g. interactive), so let’s talk about them individually.</p>
<h3 id="details" tabindex="-1">Details</h3>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-styling-the-details-element/">Disclosure widgets</a> are simple interactive elements we no longer need JS for. When <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> are closed, only their <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> is shown.</p>
<p>Text-based browsers have no clue what disclosure widgets are, so they always show the whole <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> content, meaning you always get the <code>open</code> state. This way things can get verbose, but in essence it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="data-lists" tabindex="-1">Data lists</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist">Data lists</a> can be used to add suggested values to an input field. In my tests they have been ignored entirely, Lynx even mentions that it encountered “bad HTML”, probably because it expects <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> only in a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> parent. At least no browser rendered the options on the screen, they simply fall back to a plain <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field, which is better than nothing. Side note: I’ve been told data lists have accessibility issues, so …</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<h3 id="dialogs" tabindex="-1">Dialogs</h3>
<p>Yes, HTML can do <a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/dialog/">modal and non-modal dialogs, and even alert dialogs,</a> all thanks to the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element. Initially we needed JS to toggle their visibility, but with the help of the Popover API (see next chapter) we can now even get most of it done in plain HTML.</p>
<p>Alas, once again there is no support in text-based browsers, so you’ll end up seeing all dialog content, as if they had their <code>open</code> attribute set. Consequently, there’s no awareness of a form’s <code>method="dialog"</code> nor a submit button’s <code>formmethod="dialog"</code>, so in both cases the form <code>action</code> is triggered.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Problematic.</p>
<h3 id="popovers" tabindex="-1">Popovers</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/introducing-popover-api/">The Popover API</a> is probably my favorite new feature, but only if you stick to regular web browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/clarifying-the-relationship-between-popovers-and-dialogs/">Given that dialogs are a type of popover,</a> it’s no surprise that nothing works, and once again all <code>popover</code> content gets dumped onto the screen.</p>
<p>By now I think you get the idea, so I won’t even talk about the <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/7/">Invoker Commands API</a> at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Most likely problematic.</p>
<h3 id="inert-content-areas" tabindex="-1">Inert content areas</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/articles/inert">A modal dialog makes the rest of the page inert</a>, so we don’t have to do it. But with the global <code>inert</code> attribute we can do this manually too, if we need to make certain parts of the DOM unreachable.</p>
<p>Sure enough, text-based browsers will happily let you access interactive elements inside an inert content area.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Bad.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Hidden content</h3>
<p>We’re now approaching something that is not new at all, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden">global hidden attribute</a> has been supported for over a decade. It allows us to hide content in the same way as <code>display: none</code>, but directly in HTML.</p>
<p>Adding support in text-based browsers has been discussed back in the day, but got rejected, hence it was never implemented. You’ll end up seeing all content marked as <code>hidden</code>. This is the primary reason why I started writing this article, and what enrages me the most. If I decide to hide content in HTML instead of CSS, I must have a very good reason, thus hidden content should not be visible in any browser! Certain progressive enhancement techniques work by hiding content in HTML and then making it visible via CSS or JS. That possibility goes out the window in text-based browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Epic fail. 😠 🤬</p>
<h3 id="visually-hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Visually hidden content</h3>
<p>Just kidding, there’s still <a href="https://cssence.com/2024/native-visually-hidden/">no native way in HTML to hide content visually</a>, so we continue to rely on class names like <code>.visually-hidden</code> or <code>.sr-only</code>. No matter how they are named, they need to summon <a href="https://vispero.com/resources/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">quite a few of lines of CSS</a> to get things done. Whether there should be a native way is up for debate. Personally I would welcome a one-liner to achieve this, but it should remain in the domain of CSS.</p>
<p>However, if we had a way in HTML, text-based browsers would display such visually hidden content anyway, that is certain.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> To be continued.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-what-now" tabindex="-1">Now what? What now?</h2>
<p>Text-based browsers and modern HTML, no success story in sight. Given the progress we see in web technologies, the gap will only widen, so much so that w3m and its friends might fall into oblivion.</p>

<h2>Why AI Overviews produces errors</h2>
<p>The recurring problems with AI Overviews stem from a design flaw in how the system works. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">reported</a> in May 2024, Google built AI Overviews to show information backed up by top web results from its page ranking system. The company designed the feature this way based on the assumption that highly ranked pages contain accurate information.</p>
<p>However, Google’s page ranking algorithm has long struggled with SEO-gamed content and spam. The system now feeds these unreliable results to its AI model, which then summarizes them with an authoritative tone that can mislead users. Even when the AI draws from accurate sources, the language model can still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">draw incorrect conclusions</a> from the data, producing flawed summaries of otherwise reliable information.</p>
<p>The technology does not inherently provide factual accuracy. Instead, it reflects whatever inaccuracies exist on the websites Google’s algorithm ranks highly, presenting the facts with an authority that makes errors appear trustworthy.</p>
<h2>Other examples remain active</h2>
<p>The Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” still prompted AI Overviews. Hebditch said this was a big worry and that the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.</p>
<p>AI Overviews still appear for other examples that The Guardian originally highlighted to Google. When asked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known&nbsp;and reputable sources and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.</p>
<p>Google said AI Overviews only appear for queries where it has high confidence in the quality of the responses. The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.</p>
<p>This is not the first controversy for AI Overviews. The feature has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">told</a> people to put glue on pizza and eat rocks. It has proven unpopular enough that users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/01/just-give-me-the-fing-links-cursing-disables-googles-ai-overviews/">discovered</a> that inserting curse words into search queries disables AI Overviews entirely.</p>

The <code>ts_zip</code> utility can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is
    required. </li>
  <li>It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and
    decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).</li>
  <li>Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed
  much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained
  mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including
  source code.</li>
  <li>It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected
    between the various versions.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="https://www.bellard.org/ts_sms">ts_sms</a> which is optimized for the
    compression of small messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>ts_zip</code> uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV 169M v4</a>
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.</li>
  <li>The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An
    arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible
    way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU
    model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point
    ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we released Claude Code, we expected developers to use it for coding. They did—and then quickly began using it for <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2009666254815269313" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170">almost everything else</a>. This prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone—<a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-claude-code" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173">not just developers</a>—to work with Claude in the very same way. Cowork is available today as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on our <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176">macOS app</a>, and we will improve it rapidly from here.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAmKyyZ-b9E" title="Introducing Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work"></iframe></p></figure><p>How is using Cowork different from a regular conversation? In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.&nbsp;</p><p>In Cowork, Claude completes work like this with much more agency than you’d see in a regular conversation. Once you’ve set it a task, Claude will make a plan and steadily complete it, while looping you in on what it’s up to. If you’ve used Claude Code, this will feel familiar—Cowork is built on the very <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a">same foundations</a>. This means Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve mastered the basics, you can make Cowork more powerful still. Claude can use your existing <a href="https://claude.com/connectors" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f">connectors</a>, which link Claude to external information, and in Cowork we’ve added an initial set of <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832">skills</a> that improve Claude’s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. If you pair Cowork with <a href="https://claude.com/chrome" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835">Claude in Chrome</a>, Claude can complete tasks that require browser access, too.</p><p>Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format. Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E" title="Organize your desktop files with Cowork"></iframe></p></figure><h2>Stay in control</h2><p>In Cowork, you can choose which folders and connectors Claude can see: Claude can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to. Claude will also ask before taking any significant actions, so you can steer or course-correct it as you need.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, there are still things to be aware of before you give Claude control. By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it’s instructed to. Since there’s always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this.&nbsp;</p><p>You should also be aware of the risk of “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c">prompt injections</a>”: attempts by attackers to alter Claude’s plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We’ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety—that is, the task of securing Claude’s real-world actions—is still an active area of development in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>These risks aren’t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2">Help Center</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking forward</h2><p>This is a research preview. We’re releasing Cowork early because we want to learn what people use it for, and how they think it could be better. We encourage you to experiment with what Cowork can do for you, and to try things you don’t expect to work: you might be surprised! As we learn more from this preview, we plan to make lots of improvements (including by adding cross-device sync and bringing it to Windows), and we’ll identify further ways to make it safer.&nbsp;</p><p>Claude Max subscribers can try Cowork now by downloading the <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa">macOS app</a>, then clicking on “Cowork” in the sidebar.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>After creating thousands</span> of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-pushing-ai-undressing-mainstream/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">“undressing” pictures of women</a> and sexualized imagery of apparent minors, Elon Musk’s X has apparently limited who can generate images with Grok. However, despite the changes, the chatbot is still being used to create “undressing” sexualized images on the platform.</p><p>On Friday morning, the Grok account on X started responding to some users’ requests with a message saying that image generation and editing are “currently limited to paying subscribers.” The message also includes a link pushing people toward the social media platform’s $395 annual subscription tier. In one test of the system requesting Grok create an image of a tree, the system returned the same message.</p><p>The apparent change comes after days of growing outrage against and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">scrutiny</a> of Musk’s X and xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot. The companies face an increasing number of investigations from regulators around the world over the creation of nonconsensual explicit imagery and alleged sexual images of children. British prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjzknepvzo">has not ruled out</a> banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.”</p><p>Neither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED’s inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. X has previously <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223&quot;}" href="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a> it takes “action against illegal content on X,” including instances of child sexual abuse material. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">X and Grok remain available</a> in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>For more than a week, users on X have been asking the chatbot to edit images of women to remove their clothes—often asking for the image to contain a “string” or “transparent” bikini. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts.</p><p>“We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say.</p><p>A WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed.</p><p>On Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok’s stand-alone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos</a>, including celebrities and other real people. Bouchaud says it is still possible to use Grok to make these videos. “I was able to generate a video with sexually explicit content without any restriction from an unverified account,” they say.</p><p>While WIRED’s test of image generation using Grok on X using a free account did not allow any images to be created, using a free account on Grok’s app and website still generated images.</p><p>The change on X could immediately limit the amount of sexually explicit and harmful material the platform is creating, experts say. But it has also been criticized as a minimal step that acts as a band-aid to the real harms <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-survivor-breeze-liu-microsoft/">caused by nonconsensual intimate imagery</a>.</p><p>“The recent decision to restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate—it represents the monetization of abuse,” Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at UK domestic abuse charity Refuge, said in a statement. “While limiting AI image generation to paid users may marginally reduce volume and improve traceability, the abuse has not been stopped. It has simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">yolobox uses <strong>container isolation</strong> (Docker or Podman) as its security boundary. When you run <code>yolobox</code>, it:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Starts a container with your project mounted at <code>/workspace</code></li>
<li>Runs as user <code>yolo</code> with sudo access <em>inside</em> the container</li>
<li>Does NOT mount your home directory (unless explicitly requested)</li>
<li>Uses Linux namespaces to isolate the container's filesystem, process tree, and network</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The AI agent has full root access <em>inside the container</em>, but the container's view of the filesystem is restricted to what yolobox explicitly mounts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trust Boundary</h3><a id="user-content-trust-boundary" aria-label="Permalink: Trust Boundary" href="#trust-boundary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The trust boundary is the container runtime</strong> (Docker/Podman). This means:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>✅ Protection against accidental <code>rm -rf ~</code> or credential theft</li>
<li>✅ Protection against most filesystem-based attacks</li>
<li><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> <strong>NOT protection against container escapes</strong> — a sufficiently advanced exploit targeting kernel vulnerabilities could break out</li>
<li><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> <strong>NOT protection against a malicious AI</strong> deliberately trying to escape — this is defense against accidents, not adversarial attacks</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you're worried about an AI actively trying to escape containment, you need VM-level isolation (see "Hardening Options" below).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Threat Model</h3><a id="user-content-threat-model" aria-label="Permalink: Threat Model" href="#threat-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What yolobox protects:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your home directory from accidental deletion</li>
<li>Your SSH keys, credentials, and dotfiles</li>
<li>Other projects on your machine</li>
<li>Host system files and configurations</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What yolobox does NOT protect:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your project directory (it's mounted read-write by default)</li>
<li>Network access (use <code>--no-network</code> to disable)</li>
<li>The container itself (the AI has root via sudo)</li>
<li>Against kernel exploits or container escape vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hardening Options</h3><a id="user-content-hardening-options" aria-label="Permalink: Hardening Options" href="#hardening-options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Level 1: Basic (default)</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yolobox  # Standard container isolation"><pre>yolobox  <span><span>#</span> Standard container isolation</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Level 2: Reduced attack surface</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yolobox run --no-network --readonly-project claude"><pre>yolobox run --no-network --readonly-project claude</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Level 3: Rootless Podman</strong> (recommended for security-conscious users)</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install podman and run rootless
yolobox --runtime podman"><pre><span><span>#</span> Install podman and run rootless</span>
yolobox --runtime podman</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Rootless Podman runs the container without root privileges on the host, using user namespaces. This significantly reduces the impact of container escapes since the container's "root" maps to your unprivileged user on the host.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Level 4: VM isolation</strong> (maximum security)</p>
<p dir="auto">For true isolation with no shared kernel, consider running yolobox inside a VM:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: Use a Linux VM via UTM, Parallels, or Lima</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Use a Podman machine or dedicated VM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This adds significant overhead but eliminates kernel-level attack surface.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Network Isolation with Podman</h3><a id="user-content-network-isolation-with-podman" aria-label="Permalink: Network Isolation with Podman" href="#network-isolation-with-podman"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For users who want to prevent container access to the local network while preserving internet access:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Rootless podman uses slirp4netns by default, which provides
# network isolation from the host network
podman run --network=slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=false ..."><pre><span><span>#</span> Rootless podman uses slirp4netns by default, which provides</span>
<span><span>#</span> network isolation from the host network</span>
podman run --network=slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=false ...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">yolobox doesn't currently expose this as a flag, but you can achieve it by running rootless Podman (the default network mode for rootless is slirp4netns).</p>

<p dir="auto">Charles DarwinECCEMACY. Sir, — The following case is interesting to me : — I was in London a fortnight, and was much affected with an attack of rheumatism. The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense</p>

<p dir="auto">Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?</h2><a id="user-content-why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora" aria-label="Permalink: Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?" href="#why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm using books, legal documents, newspapers, and other writings from 1800–1875 London. The list I linked (for v0) has like 200 but for the first training I just used 50 files about ~187 MB. You can view a list of the documents:

  <p>Time makes fools of us all, and JavaScript is no slouch in that department either. Honestly, I’ve never minded the latter much — in fact, if you’ve taken <a href="https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone">JavaScript for Everyone</a> or tuned into the <a href="https://wil.to/posts#js4e">newsletter</a>, you already know that I largely <em>enjoy</em> JavaScript’s little quirks, believe it or not.</p>
<p>I like when you can see the seams; I like how, for as formal and iron-clad as the ES-262 specification might seem, you can still see all the good <em>and</em> bad decisions made by the hundreds of people who’ve been building the language in mid-flight, if you know where to look. JavaScript has <em>character</em>. Sure, it doesn’t necessarily do everything <em>exactly</em> the way one might expect, but y’know, if you ask me, JavaScript has a real charm once you get to know it!</p>
<p>There’s one part of the language where that immediately falls apart for me, though.</p>

<p><code>Date</code> sucks. It was hastily and shamelessly copied off of Java’s homework in the car on the way to school and it got all the same answers wrong, right down to the name at the top of the page: <code>Date</code> doesn’t represent a <em>date</em>, it represents a <em>time</em>. Internally, dates are stored as number values called <strong>time values</strong>: Unix timestamps, divided into 1,000 milliseconds — which, okay, yes, a Unix time does also necessarily imply a date, sure, but <em>still</em>: Date represents a time, from which you can infer a date. Gross.</p>

<div><p>Words like “date” and “time” mean things, but, sure — <em>whatever, JavaScript</em>.</p></div>
<p>Java deprecated <em>their</em> <code>Date</code> way back in 1997, only a few years after JavaScript’s <code>Date</code> was turned loose on the unsuspecting world; meanwhile, we’ve been saddled with this mess ever since. It’s wildly inconsistent when it comes to parsing dates, as you’ve seen so far here. It has no sense of time zones beyond the local one and GMT, which is not ideal where “world-wide” is <em>right there in the web’s name</em> — and speaking-of, <code>Date</code> <em>only</em> respects the Gregorian calendar model. It wholesale does not understand the concept of daylight savings time, which— I mean, okay, yeah, samesies, but I’m not <em>made of computers</em>. All these shortcomings make it exceptionally common to use a third-party library dedicated to working around it all, some of which are absolutely <em>massive</em>; a performance drain that has done real and measurable damage to the web.</p>
<p>None of these are my major issue with <code>Date</code>. My complaint is about more than parsing or syntax or “developer ergonomics” or the web-wide performance impact of wholly necessary workarounds or even the definition of the word “date.” My issue with <code>Date</code> is soul-deep. My problem with <code>Date</code> is that using it means <em>deviating from the fundamental nature of time itself</em>.</p>

<p>All JavaScript’s primitives values are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning that the values themselves cannot be changed. The number value <code>3</code> can never represent anything but the concept of “three” — you can’t make <code>true</code> mean anything other than “true.” These are values with concrete, iron-clad, real-world meanings. We know what three is. It can’t be some other non-three thing. These immutable data types are stored <strong>by value</strong>, meaning that a variable that represents the number value <code>3</code> effectively “contains” — and thus behaves as — the number value <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When an immutable value is assigned to a variable, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that value and stores the copy in memory:</p>

<p>When we initialize <code>theOtherNumber</code> with the value bound to <code>theNumber</code>, that mental model holds: once again a <code>3</code> is created and stored in memory. <code>theOtherNumber</code> can now be thought of as containing its own discrete <code>3</code>.</p>

<div><p>You can’t change the binding of a <code>const</code>, and you <em>definitely</em> can’t alter the meaning of <code>3</code>.</p></div>
<p>Data types that <em>can</em> be changed after they’re created are <strong>mutable</strong>, meaning that the data value <em>itself</em> can be altered. Object values — any non-primitive value, like an array, map, or set — are mutable.</p>
<p>Variables (and object properties, function parameters, and elements in an array, set, or map) can’t “contain” an object, the way we might think of <code>theNumber</code> in the example above as “containing” <code>3</code>. A variable can contain either a primitive value or a <strong>reference value</strong>, the latter of which is a pointer to that object’s stored location in memory. When you assign an object to a variable, instead of creating a copy of that object, the identifier represents a reference to the object’s stored position in memory. That’s why an object bound to a variable declared with <code>const</code> can still be altered: the <em>reference value</em> can’t be changed, but the values of the object can:</p>

<p>When a reference value is assigned from one variable to another, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that reference value — not the object value itself, the way a discrete copy is made of a primitive value. Both identifiers point to the same object in memory — any changes made to that object by way of one reference will be reflected by the others, because they’re all referencing the same thing:</p>

<p>See what happened there? the variable <code>today</code> represents a reference to the object created by <code>new Date()</code>. When we provided <code>today</code> as an argument to the <code>addDay</code> function, the parameter <code>theDate</code> now represents a copy of the reference value — not a copy of the value, but a second reference to the object that represents today’s date. When we manipulate that value to determine the date of the following day, we’re manipulating the mutable object in memory, not an immutable copy — today becomes tomorrow, the falcon has a hard time hearing the falconer, the center starts to look a little iffy vis-a-vis “holding,” and so on.</p>
<p>Now, by this point you can probably tell that I’m not here to praise <code>Date</code>, but what you might not expect is that I’m here to <em>bury</em> it. That’s right: <code>Date</code> is soon to be over, done, gone, as “deprecated” as any part of the web platform can be — which is to say, “around forever, but you shouldn’t use it anymore, if you can avoid it.” Soon we will — at long last — have an object that replaces <code>Date</code> wholesale: <code>Temporal</code>.</p>

<p><em>Yes, we’re still working with a mutable object that represents the current date</em>, I say in my spookiest voice, flashlight squarely beneath my chin. At a glance, this might not seem like it addresses my big complaint with <code>Date</code> at all.</p>
<p>Well, we’re kind of at the mercy of the nature of the language, here: dates represent complex real-world values, complex data necessitates complex data structures, and for JavaScript, that means objects. The difference is in how we <em>interact</em> with these Temporal objects, as compared to instances of <code>Date</code>, and — as is so often the case — the magic is in the prototype chain:</p>

<p>Right away you’ll notice that there are a number of methods and properties devoted to accessing, formatting, and manipulating the details of the Temporal object we’re working with. No big surprises there — it means a little bit of a learning curve, sure, but nothing an occasional trip over to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">MDN</a> couldn’t solve, and they all more-or-less do what they say on their respective tins. The big difference from working with <code>Date</code> is <em>how</em> they do so, at a fundamental level:</p>

<p>Notice how none of these transformations required us to manually spin up any new objects, <em>and</em> that the value of the object referenced by <code>nowTemporal</code> remains unchanged? Unlike <code>Date</code>,  the methods we use to interact with a Temporal object result in <em>new</em> Temporal objects, rather than requiring us to use them in the context of a new instance or to modify the instance we’re working with — which is how we’re able to chain the <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> methods together in <code>nowTemporal.add({ months: 1, days: 1 }).subtract({ years: 2 })</code>.</p>
<p>Sure, we’re still working with objects, and that means we’re working with mutable data structures that represent real-world values:</p>

<p>…But the value represented by that Temporal object isn’t meant to be changed during the normal course of interacting with it — even though the object is still essentially mutable, we’re not stuck using that object in ways that could alter what it means in terms of real-world dates and times. I’ll take it.</p>
<p>So, let’s revisit that janky little “today is X, tomorrow is Y” script we wrote using <code>Date</code> earlier. First, we’ll fix it by making sure we’re working with two discrete instances of <code>Date</code> rather than modifying the instance that represents today’s date:</p>

<p>Okay, fine. It gets the job done, just as it has since the day <code>Date</code> first bumbled its way onto the web. We’re not unwittingly altering the value of <code>today</code> since we’re spinning up a new instance of <code>Date</code> inside our <code>addDay</code> function — wordy, but it works, as it has for decades now. We add <code>1</code> to it, which we have to just kind of <em>know</em> means add one <em>day.</em> Then in our template literal we need to keep nudging JavaScript to give us the date in a format that doesn’t include the current time, as a string. It’s functional, but verbose.</p>
<p>Now, let’s redo it using <code>Temporal</code>:</p>

<p><em>So much better</em>. Leaner, meaner, and <em>way</em> less margin for error. We want today’s date without the time, and the object that results from invoking <code>plainDateISO</code> (and any new Temporal objects created from it) will retain that formatting <em>without</em> being coerced to a string. Formatting: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>We want to output a value that represents today’s date plus one day, and we want to do so in a way where we are unmistakably saying “add one day to it” with no parsing guesswork: <em>check</em> and <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we don’t want to run the risk of having our original <code>today</code> object altered unintentionally — because the result of calling the <code>add</code> method will always be a new Temporal object: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p><code>Temporal</code> is going to be a <em>massive</em> improvement over <code>Date</code>, and I only say “going to be” because it still isn’t quite ready for prime-time usage. <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/">The draft specification for the proposed <code>Temporal</code> object</a> has reached stage three of the standardization process, meaning it is now officially “recommended for implementation” — not yet part of the standard that informs the ongoing development of JavaScript itself, but close enough that browsers can start tinkering with it. That means the results of that early experimentation may be used to further refine the specification, so nothing is set in stone just yet. Web standards are an iterative process, after all.</p>
<p>That’s where you and I come in. Now that <code>Temporal</code> has <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Temporal">landed in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox</a> — and others, soon — it’s time for us to get in there and kick the tires a little bit. We may not have had any say in <code>Date</code>, but we get to experiment with <code>Temporal</code> before the final implementations land.</p>
<p>Soon, JavaScript will have sensible, modern date handling, and we’ll finally be able to cram <code>Date</code> way in the back of the junk drawer with the rubber bands, mismatched jar lids, mystery keys, and probably-half-empty AA batteries — still present, still an inexorable part of the web platform, but no longer our first, last, and only way of handling dates. And we only had to wait— well, hold on, let me just crunch the numbers real quick:</p>
<div>
  <astro-island uid="ZO0XPc" prefix="r9" component-url="/_astro/ConsoleLogger.67Rv-5VD.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BIGLHmRd.js" props="{&quot;instruction&quot;:[0],&quot;code&quot;:[0,&quot;\nconst today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();\nconst jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( \&quot;1995-12-04\&quot; );\nconst sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });\n\nconsole.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );\n&quot;],&quot;language&quot;:[0,&quot;js&quot;],&quot;outputType&quot;:[0,&quot;log&quot;],&quot;consoleOutput&quot;:[0,&quot;\n30 years, 0 months, and 27 days.\n&quot;],&quot;showLineNumbers&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ConsoleLogger&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p data-wrapper-type="inner"><h3>Try it out</h3></p><hr><div data-wrapper-type="inner"><pre tabindex="0"><code>const today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
const jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( "1995-12-04" );
const sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });

console.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );</code></pre></div></div><template data-astro-template="">
    
  </template><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
</div>
<p>Sure, the best time to replace <code>Date</code> would’ve been back in 1995, but hey: the second best time is <code>Temporal.Now</code>, right?</p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        
        <p>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2021/06/02/Design-issues-in-LLVM-IR.html">design issues in LLVM IR</a>. Since then, one of these issues has been fixed fully (opaque pointers migration), one has been mostly fixed (constant expression removal), and one is well on the way towards being fixed (ptradd migration).</p>

<p>This time I’m going to be more ambitious and not stop at three issues. Of course, not all of these issues are of equal importance, and how important they are depends on who you ask. In the interest of brevity, I will mostly just explain what the problem is, and not discuss what possible solutions would be.</p>

<p>Finally, I should probably point out that this is written from my perspective as the lead maintainer of the LLVM project: This is not a list of reasons to not use LLVM, it’s a list of opportunities to improve LLVM.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-issues">High level issues</h2>

<h3 id="review-capacity">Review capacity</h3>

<p>Unlike many other open-source projects, LLVM certainly <a href="https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/llvm-llvm-project">does not suffer</a> from a lack of contributors. There are <em>thousands</em> of contributors and the distribution is relatively flat (that is, it’s not the case that a small handful of people is responsible for the majority of contributions.)</p>

<p>What LLVM does suffer from is insufficient review capacity. There are a lot more people writing code than reviewing it. This is somewhat unsurprising, as code review requires more expertise than writing code, and may not provide immediate value<sup id="fnref:review_value" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:review_value" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to the person reviewing (or their employer).</p>

<p>Lack of review capacity makes for a bad contributor experience, and can also result in bad changes making their way into the codebase. The way this usually works out is that someone puts up a PR, then fails to get a qualified review for a long period of time, and then one of their coworkers (who is not a qualified reviewer for that area) ends up rubberstamping the PR.</p>

<p>A related problem is that LLVM has a somewhat peculiar contribution model where it’s the responsibility of the PR author to request reviewers. This is especially problematic for new contributors, who don’t know whom to request. Often relevant reviewers will become aware of the PR thanks to a label-based notification system, but this is not apparent from the UI, and it’s easy for PRs to fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>A potential improvement here would be a Rust-style <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/triagebot/pr-assignment.html">PR assignment system</a>.</p>

<h3 id="churn">Churn</h3>

<p>Both the LLVM C++ API and LLVM IR are not stable and undergo frequent changes. This is simultaneously a great strength and weakness of LLVM. It’s a strength because LLVM does not stagnate and is willing to address past mistakes even at significant cost. It’s a weakness because churn imposes costs on users of LLVM.</p>

<p>Frontends are <em>somewhat</em> insulated from this because they can use the largely stable C API. However, it does not cover everything, and most major frontends will have additional bindings that use the unstable C++ API.</p>

<p>Users that integrate with LLVM more tightly (for example downstream backends) don’t have that option, and have to keep up with all API changes.</p>

<p>This is part of LLVM’s general development philosophy, which I’ll express somewhat pointedly as “upstream or GTFO”. LLVM is liberally licensed and does not require you to contribute changes upstream. However, if you do not upstream your code, then it will also not factor into upstream decision-making.</p>

<p>This point is somewhat unlike the rest, in that I’m not sure it’s possible to make things “strictly better” here. It’s possible that LLVM’s current point on the stability scale is not optimal, but moving it somewhere else would come with significant externalities. Making major changes in LLVM is already extremely hard due to the sheer scale of the project, without adding additional stability constraints on top.</p>

<h3 id="build-time">Build time</h3>

<p>LLVM is a huge project. LLVM itself is &gt;2.5 million lines of C++ and the entire monorepo is something like 9 million. C++ is not exactly known for fast build times, and compiling all that code takes time. This is bearable if you either have fast hardware or access to a build farm, but trying to build LLVM on a low-spec laptop is not going to be fun.</p>

<p>An additional complication is building with debug info (which I always recommend against), in which case you’ll add the extra gotchas of slow link times, high risk of OOM and massive disk usage. There are ways to avoid that (using shared libs or dylib build, using split dwarf, using lld), but it takes some expertise.</p>

<p>Promising changes in this area are the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-use-pre-compiled-headers-to-speed-up-llvm-build-by-1-5-2x/89345?u=nikic">use of pre-compiled headers</a> (which significantly improves build time), and changing to use a <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-link-llvm-dylib-should-default-to-on-on-posix-platforms/85908?u=nikic">dylib build by default</a> (which reduces disk usage and link time, esp. for debuginfo builds). Another is to <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-reducing-process-creation-overhead-in-llvm-regression-tests/88612?u=nikic">reduce test overhead</a> using daemonization (not strictly part of the “build time”, but relevant for the development cycle).</p>

<h3 id="ci-stability">CI stability</h3>

<p>LLVM CI consists of over 200 post-commit buildbots that test LLVM in lots of different configurations on lots of different hardware. Commits that turn a buildbot from green to red result in an email to the commit author.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this CI is never fully green, and flaky on top. This is in part due to flaky tests (typically in lldb or openmp), but can also be due to buildbot-specific issues. The end result is that it’s “normal” to get buildbot failure notifications for any given commit, even if it is perfectly harmless. This dilutes the signal, and makes it easier to miss the real failures.</p>

<p>The introduction of pre-merge testing on PRs did significantly improve the overall CI situation, but not the buildbot problem as such. I think we need to start taking flaky tests/buildbots more seriously before we can really make progress here.</p>

<p>Because someone is definitely going to mention how this <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html">is not rocket science</a>, and we just need to start using bors / merge queues to guarantee an always-green build: It’s a problem of scale. There are &gt;150 commits on a typical workday, which would be more than one commit every 10 minutes even if they were uniformly distributed. Many buildbots have multi-hour runs. This is hard to reconcile.<sup id="fnref:bors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bors" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="end-to-end-testing">End-to-end testing</h3>

<p>In some respects, LLVM has very thorough test coverage. We’re quite pedantic about making sure that new optimizations have good coverage of both positive and negative tests. However, these tests are essentially unit tests for a single optimization pass or analysis.</p>

<p>We have only a small amount of coverage for the entire optimization pipeline (phase ordering tests), so optimizations sometimes regress due to pass interactions. Tests for the combination of the middle-end and backend pipelines are essentially nonexistent. There is likely room for improvement here, though it comes with tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, what actually concerns me are end-to-end executable tests. LLVM’s test suite proper does not feature these at all. Executable tests are located in a separate <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite">llvm-test-suite</a> repo, which is typically not used during routine development, but run by buildbots. It contains a lot of different code ranging from benchmarks to unit tests.</p>

<p>However, llvm-test-suite has quite few tests (compared to LLVM lit tests) and does not comprehensively cover basic operations. Things like testing operations on different float formats, on integers of different sizes, vectors of different sizes and element types, etc.</p>

<p>In part this is because of limitations of testing through C/C++, which is very heterogeneous in type support (C compilers don’t like exposing types that don’t have a defined psABI for the target). But that’s no excuse to delegate this testing to Zig instead (which exposes everything, everywhere, and has the corresponding test coverage).</p>

<h3 id="backend-divergence">Backend divergence</h3>

<p>While LLVM’s middle-end is very unified, backend implementations are very heterogeneous, and there is a tendency to fix issues (usually performance, but sometimes even correctness) only for the backend you’re interested in.</p>

<p>This takes many forms, like implementing target-specific DAG combines instead of generic ones. Though my definite favorite is to introduce lots of target hooks for optimizations – not because the optimization is actually only beneficial for one target, but because the person introducing it just doesn’t want to deal with the fallout on other targets.</p>

<p>This is understandable – after all, they may lack the knowledge to evaluate a change for other targets, so it may require working with many other maintainers, which can slow progress a lot. But the end result is still increasing divergence and duplication.</p>

<p>Lack of end-to-end testing compounds this issue, because that would act as something of a forcing function that at least all operations compile without crashing and produce correct results for all tested targets.</p>

<h3 id="compilation-time">Compilation time</h3>

<p>Because I’ve <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html">complained</a> about this enough in the past, I’ll keep it short: LLVM is slow, which is an issue both for JIT use cases, and anything that tends to produce huge amounts of IR (like Rust or C++).</p>

<p>Since I’ve started <a href="https://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/">tracking compile-times</a>, the situation has significantly improved, both through targeted improvements and avoidance of regressions. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement: LLVM still isn’t fast, it’s just less slow.</p>

<p>One thing that LLVM is particularly bad at are <code>-O0</code> compile-times. The architecture is optimized for optimization, and lots of costs remain even if no optimization takes place. The <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/tpde-llvm-10-20x-faster-llvm-o0-back-end/86664?u=nikic">LLVM TPDE</a> alternative backend shows that it’s possible to do better by an order of magnitude.</p>

<h3 id="performance-tracking">Performance tracking</h3>

<p>The flip side of the compile-time coin is runtime performance. This is something that LLVM obviously cares a lot about. Which is why I find it rather surprising that LLVM does not have any “official” performance tracking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of organizations which track performance of LLVM downstream, on their own workloads. In some ways this is good, because it means there is more focus on real-world workloads than on synthetic benchmarks like SPEC. However, not having readily accessible, public performance tracking also makes it hard for contributors to evaluate changes.</p>

<p>To be fair, LLVM does have an <a href="https://lnt.llvm.org/">LNT</a> instance, but a) it’s currently broken, b) LNT is one of the worst UX crimes ever committed, c) little data gets submitted there, and d) it’s not possible to request a test run for a PR, or something like that.</p>

<p>This point is frankly just baffling to me. I don’t personally care about SPEC scores, but I know plenty of people do, so why there is no first-class tracking for this is a mystery to me.</p>

<h2 id="ir-design">IR design</h2>

<h3 id="undef-values">Undef values</h3>

<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehavior.html#undef-values">Undef values</a> take an arbitrary value from a certain set. They are used to model uninitialized values, and have historically been used to model deferred undefined behavior. The latter role has been replaced by poison values, which have much simpler propagation rules and are more amenable to optimization. However, undef is still used for uninitialized memory to this day.</p>

<p>There are two main problems with undef values. The first is the multi-use problem: An undef value can take a different value at each use. This means that transforms that increase the use count are generally invalid, and care has to be taken when optimizing based on value equality. The mere existence of undef values prevents us from performing optimizations we want to do, or greatly increases their complexity.</p>

<p>The second issue is that undef is very hard to reason about. Humans have trouble understanding it, and for proof-checkers it is computationally expensive.</p>

<p>Most likely, uninitialized memory will be represented using poison values instead in the future, but this runs into the problem that LLVM currently is not capable of correctly treating poison in memory. Proper support for poison in memory requires additional IR features, like the <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-byte-type/">byte type</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unsoundness-and-specification-incompleteness">Unsoundness and specification incompleteness</h3>

<p>While most miscompilations (that is, correctness bugs) in LLVM are resolved quickly, there are quite a few that remain unfixed despite having been known for a long time. These issues usually combine the qualities of being largely theoretical (that is, appearing only in artificially constructed examples rather than real-world code) and running up against issues in LLVM’s IR design.</p>

<p>Some of them are cases where we have a good idea of how the IR design needs to change to address the issue, but these changes are complex and often require a lot of work to recover optimization parity. There is often a complexity cliff where you can do something that’s simple and <em>nearly</em> correct, or you can do something very complex that is fully correct.</p>

<p>Then there are other cases, where just deciding on how things <em>should</em> work is a hard problem. The provenance model is a prime example of this. The interaction of provenance with integer casts and type punning is a difficult problem with complex tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, at some point these issues do need to be resolved. The recently formed <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-forming-a-working-group-on-formal-specification-for-llvm/89056?u=nikic">formal specification working group</a> aims to tackle these problems.</p>

<h3 id="constraint-encoding">Constraint encoding</h3>

<p>A key challenge for optimizing compilers is encoding of constraints (like “this value is non-negative” or “this add will not overflow”). This includes both frontend-provided constraints (based on language undefined behavior rules), but also compiler-generated ones.</p>

<p>In particular, there are many different analyses that can infer facts about the program, but keeping these up-to-date throughout optimization is challenging. One good way to handle this is to encode facts directly in the IR. Correctly updating or discarding these annotations then becomes part of transform correctness.</p>

<p>LLVM has many different ways to encode additional constraints (poison flags, metadata, attributes, assumes), and these all come with tradeoffs in terms of how much information can be encoded, how reliably it is retained during optimization and to what degree it can <em>negatively</em> affect optimization. Information from metadata is lost too often, while information from assumes is not lost often enough.</p>

<h3 id="floating-point-semantics">Floating-point semantics</h3>

<p>There are various issues with floating-point (FP) semantics once we move outside the nice world of “strictly conforming IEEE 754 floats in the default environment”. A few that come to mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling of signaling NaN and FP exceptions, and non-default FP environment in general. LLVM represents this using constrained FP intrinsics. This is not ideal, as all the FP handling is split into two parallel universes.</li>
  <li>Handling of denormals. LLVM has a function attribute to not assume IEEE denormal behavior, but this is only suitable for cases where flush to zero (FTZ) is used globally. It does not help with modeling cases like ARM, where scalar ops are IEEE, while vector ops use FTZ.</li>
  <li>Handling of excess precision, in particular when using the x87 FPU.</li>
</ul>

<!--### Type-based representation

This is something I've written about enough in the past, so I'll keep it brief: For historical reasons, LLVM IR encodes unnecessary type information that no longer carries any semantic meaning in various places. The biggest offender here were pointer element types, which were removed by the [opaque pointers migration][opaque_pointers].-->

<h2 id="other-technical-issues">Other technical issues</h2>

<h3 id="partial-migrations">Partial migrations</h3>

<p>LLVM is a very large project, and making any significant changes to it is hard and time consuming. Migrations often span years, where two different implementations of something coexist, until all code has been migrated. The two prime examples of this are:</p>

<p><strong>New pass manager:</strong> The “new” pass manager was first introduced more than a decade ago. Then about five years ago, we started using it for the middle-end optimization pipeline by default, and support for the legacy PM was dropped.</p>

<p>However, the back-end is still using the legacy pass manager. There is ongoing work to support the new pass manager in codegen, and we’re pretty close to the point where it can be used end-to-end for a single target. However, I expect it will still take quite a while for all targets to be ported and the legacy pass manager to be completely retired.</p>

<p><strong>GlobalISel:</strong> This is an even more extreme case. GlobalISel is the “new” instruction selector that is intended to replace SelectionDAG (and FastISel). It was introduced approximately one decade ago, and to this day, none of the targets that originally used SelectionDAG have been fully migrated to GlobalISel. There is one new target that’s GlobalISel-only, and there is one that uses GlobalISel by default for unoptimized builds. But otherwise, SelectionDAG is still the default everywhere.</p>

<p>There are two backends (AMDGPU and AArch64) that have somewhat complete GlobalISel support, but it’s not clear when/if they’ll be able to switch to using it by default. A big problem here is that new optimizations are continually being implemented on the SDAG side, so it’s hard to keep parity.</p>

<h3 id="abi--calling-convention-handling">ABI / calling convention handling</h3>

<p>Essentially everything about the handling of calling conventions in LLVM is a mess.</p>

<p>The responsibility for handling calling conventions is split between the frontend and the backend. There are good reasons why LLVM can’t do this by itself (LLVM IR sits at a too low level of abstraction to satisfy the extremely arcane ABI rules).</p>

<p>This is not a problem in itself – however, there is zero documentation of what the calling convention contract between the frontend and LLVM is, and the proper way to implement C FFI is essentially to look at what Clang does and copy that (invariably with errors, because the rules can be very subtle).</p>

<p>I’ve proposed to fix this by introducing an <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-an-abi-lowering-library-for-llvm/84495?u=nikic">ABI lowering library</a> and vortex73 has <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-25-abi-library/">implemented a prototype</a> for it as part of GSoC. So we’re well on the way to resolving this side of the problem.</p>

<p>There are more problems though. One that Rust has struggled with a lot is the interaction of target features with the calling convention. Enabling additional target features can change the call ABI, because additional float/vector registers start getting used for argument/return passing. This means that calls between functions with a feature enabled and disabled may be incompatible, because they assume different ABIs.</p>

<p>Ideally, ABI and target features would be orthogonal, and only coupled in that some ABIs require certain target features (e.g. you can’t have a hard float ABI without enabling FP registers). Target features are a per-function choice, while the ABI should be per-module.</p>

<p>Some of the newer architectures like Loongarch and RISC-V actually have proper ABI design, but most of the older ones don’t. For example, it’s currently not possible to target AArch64 with a soft float ABI but hard float implementation.</p>

<h3 id="builtins--libcalls">Builtins / libcalls</h3>

<p>Somewhat related to this is the handling of compiler builtins/libcalls, which are auxiliary functions that the compiler may emit for operations that are not natively supported by the target. This covers both libcalls provided by libc (or libm), and builtins provided by compiler runtime libraries like libgcc, compiler-rt or compiler-builtins.</p>

<p>There are two sources of truth for this, TargetLibraryInfo (TLI) and RuntimeLibcalls. The former is used by the middle-end, primarily to recognize and optimize C library calls (this mostly covers only libc, but not libgcc). The latter is used by the backend, primarily to determine which libcalls may be emitted by the compiler and how they are spelled (this covers libgcc, and the subset of libc covered by LLVM intrinsics).</p>

<p>A problem with RuntimeLibcalls is that it currently largely works off only the target triple, which means that we have to make “lowest common denominator” assumptions about which libcalls are available, where the lowest common denominator is usually libgcc. If <code>--rtlib=compiler-rt</code> is used, LLVM does not actually know about that, and cannot make use of functions that are in compiler-rt but not libgcc.</p>

<p>This also means that we’re missing a customization point for other runtime libraries. For example, there is no way for Rust to say that it provides f128 suffix libcalls via compiler-builtins, overriding target-specific naming and availability assumptions based on which type <code>long double</code> in C maps to.</p>

<p>There is a lot of ongoing work in this area (by arsenm), so the situation here will hopefully improve in the near-ish future.</p>

<h3 id="context--module-dichotomy">Context / module dichotomy</h3>

<p>LLVM has two high-level data holders. A module corresponds to a compilation unit (e.g. pre-LTO, a single file in C/C++). The LLVM context holds various “global” data. There’s usually one context per thread, and multiple modules can (in principle) use a single context.</p>

<p>Things like functions and globals go into the module, while constants and types go into the context. The module also contains a data layout, which provides important type layout information like “how wide is a pointer”.</p>

<p>The fact that constants and types do not have access to the data layout is a constant source of friction. If you have a type, you cannot reliably tell its size without threading an extra parameter through everything. We have subsystems (like ConstantFold vs. ConstantFolding) that are separated entirely by whether data layout is available or not.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel like this split is not actually buying us a lot. Having shared types and constants is somewhat convenient when it comes to module linking, because they can be directly shared, but I think performing explicit remapping in that one place would be better than having complexity everywhere else. Additionally, this would also allow cross-context linking, which is currently only possible by going through a bitcode roundtrip. In theory, the context could also allow some memory reuse when compiling multiple modules, but I think in practice there is usually a one-to-one correspondence between those.</p>

<h3 id="licm-register-pressure">LICM register pressure</h3>

<p>This is getting a bit down in the weeds, but I’ll mention it anyway due to how often I’ve run across this in recent times.</p>

<p>LLVM considers loop invariant code motion (LICM) to be a canonicalization transform. This means that we always hoist instructions out of loops, without any target specific cost modelling. However, LICM can increase the live ranges of values, which can increase register pressure, which can lead to a large amount of spills and reloads.</p>

<p>The general philosophy behind this is that LICM hoists everything, all middle-end transforms can work with nicely loop invariant instructions, and then instructions will get sunk back into the loop by the backend, which can precisely model register pressure.</p>

<p>Except… that second part doesn’t actually happen. I believe that (for non-PGO builds) instructions only get sunk back into loops either through rematerialization in the register allocator, or specialized sinking (typically of addressing modes), but for anything not falling into those buckets, no attempt to sink into loops in order to reduce register pressure is made.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. There’s more I could mention, but we’d get into increasingly narrow territory. I hope I covered most of the more important things – please do let me know what I missed!</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Standard residual connections</strong> are the backbone of every modern transformer. The idea is simple:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>l</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>F</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>l</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{l+1} = x_l + F(x_l)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>The input flows through unchanged, plus the layer’s output. One stream of information. What goes in comes out, plus a learned update. This is why transformers can be hundreds of layers deep: the gradient has a clean path backward. Simple. Stable. Unchanged since 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-Connections</strong> take a different approach. Instead of one stream, expand to <strong>n parallel streams</strong> with learnable mixing matrices:</p>

<p>Three matrices control how information flows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>H_res</strong>: How streams mix in the residual path (the red crossings)</li>
<li><strong>H_pre</strong>: How streams combine before entering the layer</li>
<li><strong>H_post</strong>: How the layer’s output distributes back to streams</li>
</ul>
<p>More expressive. More parameters with negligible computational overhead. Better performance, in theory.</p>
<p>The problem? Those mixing matrices are <strong>unconstrained</strong>. They can amplify signals, not just route them.</p>

<h2 id="the-explosion">The Explosion</h2>
<p>Under aggressive learning rates, Hyper-Connection (HC) signal amplification in my reproduction hit 7x before eventually collapsing. Amax (the maximum of row and column absolute sums) measures how much a matrix can amplify signals.</p>

<p>At my 10M parameter scale, this is survivable. But DeepSeek saw this at 27B:</p>
<blockquote data-astro-cid-7q4cr32f=""> <p>“The Amax Gain Magnitude yields extreme values with peaks of 3000”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>That’s not a typo. Three thousand times amplification. At 27B parameters, unconstrained HC didn’t just drift. It exploded. My 10M reproduction hitting 9.2x is the early warning sign of this exponential failure.</p>
<p>This is why unconstrained mixing matrices break at scale. Small amplifications compound exponentially.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix-constrain-the-manifold">The Fix: Constrain the Manifold</h2>
<p>DeepSeek’s fix is clean: constrain the mixing matrices to be <em>doubly stochastic</em>.</p>
<p>A doubly stochastic matrix has:</p>
<ul>
<li>All non-negative entries</li>
<li>Rows sum to 1</li>
<li>Columns sum to 1</li>

<p>The algorithm is dead simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with any matrix</strong> (the raw learned weights)</li>
<li><strong>Exponentiate</strong> to make all entries positive: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>H</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P = e^H</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li><strong>Normalize rows</strong> so each row sums to 1</li>
<li><strong>Normalize columns</strong> so each column sums to 1</li>
<li><strong>Repeat steps 3-4</strong> until convergence</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. Alternate row and column normalization. Twenty iterations is enough.</p>
<p>This procedure is <em>differentiable</em>. Gradients flow back through all twenty iterations.

<p>When I first saw this, it felt like cheating. You’re not learning stability. You’re forcing it. But some properties shouldn’t be learned; they should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Technical note: Strictly speaking, only the recursive matrix H_res needs the full Sinkhorn doubly-stochastic treatment. It’s the one compounding errors layer-over-layer. The input/output mixers (H_pre, H_post) are just bounded via sigmoid. The Sinkhorn compute cost is paid only where it matters most.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Val Loss (mean ± std)</th><th>Max Amax (mean ± std)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HC</td><td>0.884 ± 0.033</td><td>6.77 ± 0.60</td></tr><tr><td>mHC</td><td>1.116 ± 0.012</td><td>1.00 ± 0.00</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>HC wins on raw performance: 0.88 vs 1.12 validation loss. At 10M parameters, the mHC constraint acts like a stability tax; you pay in expressivity. But at 27B parameters, that tax is the only thing preventing your model from exploding to NaN.</p>
<p>But look at the variance. HC’s loss varies 3x more across seeds (±0.033 vs ±0.012). And Amax? HC swings from 6.1 to 7.6 depending on the seed. mHC is 1.00. Every seed. Every run. Zero variance.</p>
<p>At 10M parameters, the instability is survivable. HC still wins. But at 27B parameters, that 6-7x amplification becomes 3000x. You can’t gamble at that scale.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loss improves with depth</strong>, until it doesn’t. Depth 20 hit the sweet spot (0.85 val loss). Depth 24 regressed slightly (0.93) due to the width bottleneck from shrinking dim to 192.</li>
<li><strong>Amax is unpredictable.</strong> Depth 20 spiked to 9.2x. Depth 12 hit 6.6x. Depth 8 stayed at 4.3x. There’s no clean relationship; HC is chaotic.</li>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Residual connections are more than a trick to help gradients flow. They’re a conservation law.</p>
<p>In physics, conservation laws constrain what’s possible but enable prediction. You can’t build a perpetual motion machine, but you can calculate exactly where a ball will land.</p>
<p>The identity mapping in residual connections is similar. It constrains the network by preventing arbitrary transformations, but it guarantees stability. Signal magnitude is preserved.</p>
<p>HC breaks conservation; mHC restores it, not by returning to identity, but by finding a richer manifold that still conserves signal.</p>
<p>In 2016, He et al. introduced ResNets to solve the vanishing gradient problem, ensuring signals didn’t die. Ten years later, the opposite problem emerged: exploding signals from hyper-connectivity. The identity mapping solved the first by being passive. mHC solves the second by enforcing conservation.</p>
<blockquote data-astro-cid-7q4cr32f=""> <p>Every residual connection is a conservation law. mHC enforces it.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Not a hack, not a trick. A principled constraint that makes the architecture work at scale.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The stream persistence bug humbled me.</strong> My first implementation looked right. The equations matched the paper. The code ran. But I was projecting the output back to a single stream and re-expanding it at each layer, killing the parallel architecture. The “hyper” part of Hyper-Connections wasn’t actually doing anything. Three separate audits said “looks correct.” The bug was architectural, not mathematical. I only caught it by asking: “Wait, what shape is actually flowing between layers?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constraints aren’t limitations; they’re guarantees.</strong> The doubly stochastic projection forces stability. You’re not learning good behavior. You’re making bad behavior impossible. My first reaction: “That’s not elegant. That’s a straitjacket.” Then I saw HC hit 7x amplification. Oh. That’s the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The boring choice scales.</strong> Standard residual connections have survived since 2016 not because they’re optimal, but because they’re stable. HC is more expressive but fragile. mHC finds a middle ground: more expressive than standard residuals, with stability guarantees.</p>
</li>

<li>Goal: Validate the core claim: HC explodes, mHC doesn’t</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2 (Thursday):</strong> Scale up to see real instability.</p>
<ul>
<li>1B parameters on A100s</li>
<li>C4 dataset, fixed width (no bottleneck)</li>
<li>Goal: Push toward the 3000x Amax regime</li>
</ul>
<p>At 10M params, HC peaked at 9.2x amplification, chaotic but survivable. The paper saw 3000x at 27B. Part 2 will show where things break.</p>

This Bill is a useful baseline and we need to move quickly to address this problem,” Mr Byrne said </p><p>Ireland’s child protection rapporteur, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, has said the harms from deep fake sexual abuse for the individuals depicted are “equivalent” to those from authentic images “because for victims the videos feel real”.</p><p>Ms Gallagher also questioned whether Ireland’s protections holding social media platforms to account were sufficient.</p><p><span>[&nbsp;</span><a aria-label="Open related story" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2026/01/05/watchdog-raises-concerns-with-eu-over-x-sexually-explicit-images-created-by-grok-ai/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Watchdog raises concerns with EU over X sexually explicit images created by Grok AI<span>Opens in new window</span></a><span>&nbsp;]</span></p><p>The special rapporteur on child protection was speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland about concerns over the X platform’s Grok AI tool which includes the facility to “nudify” images.</p><p>“Given how realistic they are, victims know that they might be perceived as real by others,” she said.</p><p>“Generating these images is often part of a pattern of abuse or harassment. And I’m acutely conscious of the horrendous case of Nicole Coco Fox from Clondalkin, who died by suicide due to online abuse. So we know how devastating online abuse of any kind can be. We have to see this in that perspective.”</p><p>Ms Gallagher also raised the issue of other nudification apps being trained on vast data sets of mostly female images “because they tend to work most effectively on women’s bodies”.</p><p>“As a result, 99 per cent of sexually explicit deepfakes accessible online are estimated to be of women and girls. So this is also a gender-based violence issue.”</p><p>Ms Gallagher added that there was concern internationally about whether the protections in place were sufficient, because most of the protections from a legal and policy perspective internationally were very focused on the users themselves who may generate the images rather than the platforms and the products which facilitate the creation of these images.</p><p>“To take the platforms themselves, in this case X AI has its own acceptable use policy and which prohibits depicting likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner, but plainly that’s completely insufficient.” </p><p>Ms Gallagher said Ireland’s relevant laws, including section five of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and Coco’s Law, were “quite focused on the individual users”.</p><p>“The issue here is Ireland’s not alone and internationally there is a concern about the adequacy of the mechanisms for holding the platforms to account. Ultimately, this is in part a product safety issue and about whether the product itself which allows the images to be generated should be illegal or should be regulated more tightly rather than simply the individual users who take action using it,” she said.</p></article></div>]]></description>
