            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/">https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37255079">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are officially introducing a proof-of-work (PoW) defense for onion services designed to prioritize verified network traffic as a deterrent against denial of service (DoS) attacks with the release of Tor 0.4.8.</p>
<p>Tor's PoW defense is a dynamic and reactive mechanism, remaining dormant under normal use conditions to ensure a seamless user experience, but when an onion service is under stress, the mechanism will prompt incoming client connections to perform a number of successively more complex operations. The onion service will then prioritize these connections based on the effort level demonstrated by the client. We believe that the introduction of a proof-of-work mechanism will disincentivize attackers by making large-scale attacks costly and impractical while giving priority to legitimate traffic. Onion Services are encouraged to update to version <a href="https://forum.torproject.org/t/stable-release-0-4-8-4/8884">0.4.8.</a></p>
<h2>Why the need?</h2>
<p>The inherent design of onion services, which prioritizes user privacy by obfuscating IP addresses, has made it vulnerable to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">DoS attacks</a> and traditional IP-based rate limits have been imperfect protections in these scenarios. In need of alternative solutions, we devised a proof-of-work mechanism involving a client puzzle to thwart DoS attacks without compromising user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Proof of work acts as a ticket system that is turned off by default, but adapts to network stress by creating a priority queue. Before accessing an onion service, a small puzzle must be solved, proving that some "work" has been done by the client. The harder the puzzle, the more work is being performed, proving a user is genuine and not a bot trying to flood the service. Ultimately the proof-of-work mechanism blocks attackers while giving real users a chance to reach their destination.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for attackers and users?</h2>
<p>If attackers attempt to flood an onion service with requests, the PoW defense will kick into action and increase the computational effort required to access a .onion site. This ticketing system aims to disadvantage attackers who make a huge number of connection attempts to an onion service. Sustaining these kinds of attacks will require a lot of computational effort on their part with diminishing returns, as the effort increases.</p>
<p>For everyday users, however, who tend to submit only a few requests at a time, the added computational effort of solving the puzzle is manageable for most devices, with initial times per solve ranging from 5 milliseconds for faster computers and up to 30 milliseconds for slower hardware. If the attack traffic increases, the effort of the work will increase, up to roughly 1 minute of work. While this process is invisible to the users and makes waiting on a proof-of-work solution comparable to waiting on a slow network connection, it has the distinct advantage of providing them with a chance to access the Tor network even when it is under stress by proving their humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we have put a lot of work into mitigating attacks on our network and enhancing our defense for onion services. The introduction of Tor's PoW defense not only positions onion services among the few communication protocols with built-in DoS protections but also, when adopted by major sites, promises to reduce the negative impact of targeted attacks on network speeds. The dynamic nature of this system helps balance the load during sudden surges in traffic ensuring more consistent and reliable access to onion services.</p>

  <div>
    <div><div><p>Experiences porting FreeBSD 14 to run on the Firecracker VMM</p></div>
<div><div><p>A large amount of fantastic open source software originates from “scratching an itch”. Such was the case with <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank" title="Firecracker on github" rel="nofollow">Firecracker</a>.&nbsp;In 2014, Amazon launched AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" title="AWS Lambda" rel="nofollow">Lambda</a> as a “serverless” compute platform: Users can provide a function — say, ten lines of Python code — and Lambda provides all of the infrastructure between an HTTP request arriving and the function being invoked to process the request and generate the response.</p><p><span>To provide this service efficiently and securely, Amazon needed to be able to launch virtual machines with minimal overhead. Thus was born Firecracker: A Virtual Machine Monitor which works with Linux KVM to create and manage “microVMs” with minimal overhead.</span></p></div><div>
    <div><p>Why FreeBSD on Firecracker?</p></div><div><p><span>In June 2022, I started work on porting FreeBSD to run on Firecracker. My interest was driven by a few factors. </span></p><p><span>First, I had been doing a lot of work on speeding up the FreeBSD boot process and wanted to know the limits that could be reached with a minimal hypervisor. </span></p><p><span>Second, porting FreeBSD to new platforms always helps to reveal bugs — both in FreeBSD and on those platforms. </span></p><p><span>Third, AWS Lambda only supports Linux at present; I’m always eager to make FreeBSD more available in AWS (although adoption in Lambda is out of my control, Firecracker support would be a necessary precondition). </span></p><p><span>The largest reason, however, was simply because it’s there. Firecracker is an interesting platform, and I wanted to see if I could make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div>
    <div><p>Launching the FreeBSD Kernel</p></div><div><p><span>While Firecracker was designed for Lambda’s needs — launching Linux kernels — there were patches available from 2020 that added support for the PVH boot mode in addition to “linuxboot”. FreeBSD had support for PVH booting under Xen, so I decided to see if that would work. </span></p><p><span>Here I ran into the first problem: Firecracker could load the FreeBSD kernel into memory but couldn’t find the address at which to start running the kernel (the “kernel entry point”). According to the PVH boot protocol, this value is specified in an ELF Note — a piece of special metadata stored in ELF (Executable and Linker Format) files. It turned out that there are two types of ELF Notes: PT_NOTEs and SHT_NOTEs, and FreeBSD wasn’t providing the one Firecracker was looking for. A small change to the FreeBSD kernel linker script fixed this, and now Firecracker was able to start executing the FreeBSD kernel.</span></p><p><span>That lasted for about 1 microsecond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div><p><span>FreeBSD has wonderful debugging functionality, but if your kernel crashes before the debugger is initialized or the serial console is set up, you’re not going to get much help. In this case, the Firecracker process exited, telling me that the FreeBSD guest hit a triple-fault — but that’s all I knew.</span></p><p><span>It turned out, however, that this was enough information to get me started, given a bit of creativity. If the FreeBSD kernel execution reached a hlt instruction, the Firecracker process would keep running but use 0% of the host’s CPU time (since it was virtualizing a halted CPU). As such, I could distinguish between “FreeBSD is crashing before this point” and “FreeBSD is crashing after this point” by inserting a hlt instruction — if Firecracker exited, I knew that it was crashing before reaching that instruction. Thus started a process I referred to as “kernel bisection” — rather than bisecting a list of commits to find one which introduced a bug (as in <strong>git bisect</strong>) I would do a binary search through the kernel startup code to find the line of code that was making FreeBSD crash.</span></p></div><div><p><span>The first thing I discovered in this process was Xen hypercalls. The PVH boot mode originated as the Xen/PVH boot mode, and FreeBSD’s PVH entry point was, in fact, an entry point specifically for booting under Xen — and the code made the quite reasonable assumption that it was, indeed, running inside Xen and could thus make Xen hypercalls. KVM (which provides the kernel functionality used by Firecracker) is not Xen, of course, so it doesn’t provide those hypercalls; attempting to use any of them resulted in the virtual machine crashing. As an initial workaround, I simply commented out all the Xen hypercalls; later, I added code to check <strong>CPUID</strong> for a Xen signature before making calls e.g., to write debugging output to the Xen debug console.</span></p><p><span>There was one Xen hypercall that provided essential functionality, however: Retrieving the physical memory map. (Of course, inside a hypervisor, the “physical” memory is only virtually physical. It’s turtles all the way down.) Here, we’re saved by the fact that Xen/PVH was retroactively declared to be version 0 of PVH boot mode: From version 1 onwards, a pointer to the memory map is passed via the PVH <strong>start_info</strong> page (a pointer to which is provided in a register when the virtual CPU starts executing). I had to write code to make use of the PVH version 1 memory map instead of relying on a Xen hypercall to get the same information, but that was easy enough. </span></p><p><span>Another related issue arose from how Xen and Firecracker arrange structures in memory: Whereas Xen loads the kernel first and then places the <strong>start_info</strong> page at the end, Firecracker placed the <strong>start_info</strong> page at a fixed low address and then loaded the kernel afterwards. This would have been fine but that FreeBSD’s PVH code – having been written with Xen in mind — assumed that the memory immediately after the <strong>start_info</strong> page would be free for use as scratch space. Under Firecracker, that very quickly meant overwriting the initial kernel stack — not an optimal outcome! A change to FreeBSD’s PVH code to assign scratch space after all the memory regions initialized by the hypervisor fixed this problem.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>On x86 platforms, FreeBSD normally makes use of ACPI to learn about (and in some cases control) the hardware on which it is running. In addition to discovering things via ACPI which we might commonly think of as “devices” — disks, network adapters, etc. — FreeBSD also learns about fundamental things like CPUs and interrupt controllers via ACPI.</span></p><p><span>Firecracker, being deliberately minimalist, does not implement ACPI, and FreeBSD gets upset when it can’t figure out how many CPUs it has or where to find their interrupt controllers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, FreeBSD has support for the historic Intel MultiProcessor Specification, which provides this critical information via an “MPTable” structure; it’s not part of the GENERIC kernel configuration, but for running in Firecracker, we want to use a stripped-down kernel configuration anyway, so it was easy to add <strong>device mptable</strong> to make use of what Firecracker provides.</span></p><p><span>Except… it didn’t work. FreeBSD still couldn’t find the information it needed! It turned out that Linux has bugs in how it finds and parses the MPTable structure — and Firecracker, being designed to boot Linux, provided the MPTable in a way that Linux supported but was not in fact compliant with the standard. FreeBSD, having an implementation independently written to follow the standard, failed both to find the (incorrectly located) MPTable and to parse the (invalid) MPTable once it was found.</span></p><p><span>So now FreeBSD has a new kernel option: You can add <strong>options MPTABLE_LINUX_BUG_COMPAT</strong> to your kernel configuration if you need bug-for-bug compatibility with Linux’s MPTable handling — and with that, FreeBSD managed to boot a bit further in Firecracker.</span></p></div><div><p><span>One of the few emulated devices — as opposed to virtualized devices like the Virtio block and network devices — provided by Firecracker is the serial port. In fact, in a common configuration, when you launch Firecracker, the standard input and output of the Firecracker process become the serial port input and output of the VM, making it seem like the guest OS is just another process running inside your shell (which, in a certain sense, it is). At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work.</span></p><div><p><span>By this point in the process of bringing up FreeBSD inside Firecracker I was able to boot a FreeBSD kernel with a root disk compiled into the kernel image — I didn’t have the virtualized disk driver working yet — and read all the console output from the kernel. After all the kernel console output, however, FreeBSD entered the userland portion of the boot process, and I got 16 characters of console output — and then it stopped.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Funnily enough, I’d seen that exact symptom over ten years earlier, when I was first getting FreeBSD working on EC2 instances. A bug in QEMU resulted in the UART not sending an interrupt when the transmit FIFO emptied; FreeBSD wrote 16 bytes to the UART and then wouldn’t write anymore because it was waiting for an interrupt which never arrived. Modern EC2 instances run on Amazon’s “Nitro” platform, but in the early days they used Xen and devices were emulated using code from QEMU. Somehow, a decade after this bug was fixed in QEMU, exactly the same bug was implemented in Firecracker; but luckily for me, the workaround I put into the FreeBSD kernel —&nbsp;<strong>hw.broken_txfifo=”1”</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;— was still available, and adding that loader tunable (which, since Firecracker loads the kernel directly without going through the boot loader, meant compiling the value into the kernel as an environment variable) fixed the console output.</p></div><p><span>I then found that the console input was also broken: FreeBSD didn’t respond to anything I typed into the console. In fact, tracing the Firecracker process, I found that Firecracker wasn’t even reading from the console — because Firecracker thought that the receive FIFO on the emulated UART was full. This turned out to be another bug in Firecracker: While initializing the UART, FreeBSD fills the receive FIFO with garbage to measure its size and then flushes the FIFO by writing to the FIFO Control Register. Firecracker didn’t implement the FIFO Control Register, so it was left with a full FIFO and quite sensibly didn’t try to read any more characters to put into it. Here, I added another workaround to FreeBSD: If <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> is still asserted after we try to flush the FIFO via the FIFO Control Register — which is to say, if the FIFO didn’t empty as requested — we now proceed to read and discard characters one by one until the FIFO empties. With this, Firecracker now recognized that FreeBSD was ready to read more input from the serial port, and I had a working bidirectional serial console.</span></p></div><div><p><span>While a system without disks or network could be useful for some purposes, before we can do very much with FreeBSD, we’re going to want those devices. Firecracker supports Virtio block and network devices and exposes them to virtual machines as mmio (memory-mapped I/O) devices. First step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Add <strong>device virtio_mmio</strong> to the Firecracker kernel configuration.</span></p><p><span>Next up, we need to tell FreeBSD how to find the virtualized devices. FreeBSD expected <strong>mmio</strong> devices to be discovered via FDT (Flattened Device Tree), which is a mechanism commonly used on embedded systems; but Firecracker passes device parameters via the kernel command line with directives such as <strong>virtio_mmio.device=4K@0x1001e000:5</strong>. Second step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Write code for parsing such directives and creating <strong>virtio_mmio</strong> device nodes. (Once we create the device node, FreeBSD’s regular process for device probing kicks in and the kernel will automatically determine the type of Virtio device and hook up the appropriate driver.)</span></p><p>If we have multiple devices however — say, a disk device and a network device — another problem arises: Firecracker passes directives the way Linux expects — as a series of key=value pairs on the kernel command line — while FreeBSD parses the kernel command line as environment variables… meaning that if there were two <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> directives passed on the command line, only one was retained. To fix this, I rewrote the early kernel environment parsing code to handle duplicate variables by appending a numbered suffix: We end up with <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> for one device and <strong>virtio_mmio.device_1=</strong> for the second device.</p><div><p><span>With this, I finally had FreeBSD booting and discovering all of its devices — but one more problem arose with disk devices: If I shut down the virtual machine uncleanly, on the next boot the system would run fsck on the filesystem, and the kernel would panic. It turned out that fsck is one of very few things in FreeBSD that will cause non-page-aligned disk I/Os, and FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver was causing a kernel panic when trying to pass unaligned I/Os to Firecracker.</span></p></div><p>When an I/O crosses a page boundary — as will happen with page-sized I/Os which aren’t aligned to page boundaries — the physical I/O segments will typically not be contiguous; most devices can handle I/O requests which specify a series of segments of memory to be accessed. Firecracker, being extremely minimalist, does not do this: Instead, it accepts only a single data buffer — meaning that a buffer that crosses a page boundary can’t simply be split into pieces the way it would with other Virtio implementations. Fortunately, FreeBSD has a system in place specifically for taking care of device complications like this: <strong>busdma</strong>.</p><p><span>This was probably the hardest part of getting FreeBSD running in Firecracker, but after several attempts, I think I finally got it right: I modified FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver to use <strong>busdma</strong>, and now unaligned requests are “bounced” (aka. copied via a temporary buffer) in order to comply with the limitations of the Firecracker Virtio implementation.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Once I had FreeBSD up and running in Firecracker, it rapidly became clear that there were some improvements to be made. One of the first things I noticed was that, despite having 128 MB of RAM in the virtual machine I was testing, the system was barely usable, with processes being frequently killed due to the system running out of memory. The <strong>top(1)</strong> utility showed that almost half of system memory was in the “wired” state, which seemed odd to me; so I investigated further, and found that busdma had reserved 32 MB of memory for bounce pages. This was clearly far more than needed — given Firecracker’s limitations and the fact that bounce pages are generally not allocated contiguously, each disk I/O should use at most a single 4 kB bounce page — and I was able to reduce this memory consumption to 512 kB with a patch to <strong>busdma</strong> which limited its bounce page reservations for devices which supported only a small number of I/O segments.</span></p><ul><li><span>FreeBSD’s kernel random number generator usually obtains entropy from hardware devices, but in virtual machines this may not be an effective source. As a backup source of entropy, on x86 systems we make use of the <strong>RDRAND</strong> instruction to obtain random values from the CPU; but we were only obtaining a very small amount of entropy on each request and were only requesting entropy once every 100 ms. Changing the entropy gathering system to request enough entropy to fully seed the Fortuna random number generator shaved 2.3 seconds off the boot time.</span></li><li><span>When FreeBSD first boots, it records a Host ID for the system. This is typically obtained from hardware via the <strong>smbios.system.uuid</strong> environment variable, which the boot loader sets based on information from BIOS or UEFI. Under Firecracker, however, there is no boot loader — and thus no ID being provided. We had a fallback system in place that would generate a random ID in software on systems that didn’t have a valid hardware ID; but we also printed a warning and waited 2 seconds to allow the user to read it. I changed this code to print the warning and wait 2 seconds if the hardware provided an invalid ID, but proceed silently and quickly if the hardware simply didn’t provide an ID.</span></li><li>IPv6 mandates that systems wait for “Duplicate Address Detection” before using an IPv6 address. In <strong>rc.d/netif</strong>, after bringing up interfaces, we were waiting for IPv6 DAD if any of our network interfaces had IPv6 enabled. There’s just one problem with that: We <em>always</em> have IPv6 enabled on the loopback interface! I changed the logic to only waiting for DAD if we had IPv6 enabled on an interface other than the loopback interface and sped up the boot process by 2 seconds — if another system is trying to use the same IPv6 address as us on our lo0, we have bigger problems than an address collision!</li><li><span>&nbsp;When rebooting, FreeBSD printed a message (“<strong>Rebooting...</strong>”) and then waited 1 second “for printf’s to complete and be read”. This seemed minimally useful, since people can usually tell that the system is rebooting — there is now a <strong>kern.reboot_wait_time sysctl</strong> which defaults to zero.</span></li><li><span>When shutting down or rebooting, the FreeBSD BSP (CPU #0) waits for the other CPUs to signal that they have stopped… and then waited an extra 1 second to make sure that they had a chance to stop. I removed the extra second of wait time.</span></li></ul><p>Once the low-hanging fruit was out of the way, I pulled out <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/papers/bootprofiling.pdf?utm_source=emailmarketing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=emailmarketing" target="_blank" title="Profiling the FreeBSD kernel boot" rel="nofollow">TSLOG</a> and started looking at flamecharts of the boot process. Firecracker is a great environment for doing this, for two reasons: First, the minimalist environment eliminates a lot of noise, making it much easier to see what’s left behind; and second, having Firecracker launch virtual machines extremely quickly made it possible to test changes to the FreeBSD kernel very rapidly — often well under 30 seconds to build a new kernel, launch it, and generate a new flamechart.</p></div><div><p><span>Investigation with TSLOG revealed a number of available optimizations:</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>lapic_init</strong> had a 100000-iteration loop to calibrate how long <strong>lapic_read_icr_lo</strong> took to execute; cutting this down to 1000 iterations shaved off 10 ms.</span></li><li><span><strong>ns8250_drain</strong> called DELAY after each character was read; changing this to check for <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> and only DELAYing if nothing was already available to be read shaved off 27 ms.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD makes use of a CPUID leaf which most hypervisors use to advertise the TSC and local APIC clock frequencies; Firecracker, unlike VMWare, QEMU, and EC2, did not implement this. Adding support for this CPUID leaf to Firecracker shaved 20 ms off the FreeBSD boot time.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD was setting <strong>kern.nswbuf</strong> (which controls the number of buffers allocated for a variety of temporary purposes) to 256 regardless of the size of the system; changing this to 32 * mp_ncpus shaved 5 ms off the boot time on a small (1 CPU) virtual machine.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>mi_startup</strong> function, which kicks off machine-independent system initialization routines, was using a bubblesort to order the functions it called; while this was reasonable in the 90s given the small number of routines needing to be ordered at that point, there are now over 1000 such routines and the bubblesort was getting slow. Replacing it with a quicksort will save 2 ms. (Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023).</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>vm_mem</strong> initialization routine was initializing <strong>vm_page</strong> structures for all available physical memory. Even on a relatively small VM with 128 MB of RAM, this meant initializing 32768 such structures — and took a few ms. Changing this code to initialize <strong>vm_page</strong> structures “lazily” as the memory is allocated for use will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li><li><span>Firecracker was allocating VM guest memory via an anonymous mmap, but Linux was not setting up the paging structures for the entire VM guest address space. As a result, the first time any page was read, a fault would occur taking roughly 20,000 CPU cycles to be resolved while Linux mapped in a page of memory. Adding the <strong>MAP_POPULATE</strong> flag to Firecracker’s <strong>mmap</strong> call will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span>FreeBSD boots under Firecracker — and does so extremely quickly. Including uncommitted patches (to FreeBSD and also to Firecracker), on a virtual machine with 1 CPU and 128 MB of RAM, the FreeBSD kernel can boot in under 20 ms; a flame chart of the boot process appears in Figure 1.</span></p></div><div>

Due to the history of PVH boot mode originating from Xen, the code used for PVH booting is still mixed up with Xen support; separating those will simplify things significantly. Similarly, it’s currently impossible to build a FreeBSD arm64 kernel without PCI or ACPI support; finding the bogus dependencies and removing them will allow for a smaller FreeBSD/Firecracker kernel (and also shave off a few more microseconds from the boot time – we spend 25 us checking to see if we need to reserve memory for Intel GPUs).</span></p><p><span>More aspirationally, it would be great to see if Firecracker could be ported to run on FreeBSD — at a certain point, a virtual machine is a virtual machine, and while Firecracker was written to use Linux KVM, there’s no fundamental reason why it shouldn’t be possible to make it use the kernel portion of FreeBSD’s bhyve hypervisor instead.</span></p><p><span>Anyone wanting to experiment with FreeBSD in Firecracker can build a FreeBSD 14.0 kernel with the amd64 <strong>FIRECRACKER</strong> kernel configuration, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/feature/pvh" target="_blank" title="feature/pvh branch of firecracker" rel="nofollow">feature/pvh branch</a>&nbsp;from the Firecracker project; or if that branch no longer exists it means the code has been merged into the mainline Firecracker tree.</span></p><p><span>If you try out FreeBSD on Firecracker — especially if you end up using it in production — please let me know! I started this project mainly out of interest, but I’d love to hear if it ends up being useful.</span></p></div><div><p><em>This article originally appeared in the July/August issue of the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/past-issues/containers-and-cloud/" target="_blank" title="FreeBSD Journal" rel="nofollow">FreeBSD</a> Journal.</em></p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-aee7d72d-1986-96c0-42f8-92db39229870-4f1cb9b1"><h3>Background: Shimmer’s ADHD Coaching System</h3><p>Shimmer was born from my personal frustration when I was <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/blog/shimmer-adhd-coaching-launch">diagnosed last year</a> &amp; wasn’t able to find an affordable, quality ADHD coach. True hyperfocus mode, I joined up with the top ADHD experts, the ADHD community, and an incredible team to build <strong>the first Affordable ADHD Coaching Platform</strong>, built by and for people with ADHD.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>Our vision: a world where every person with ADHD reaches their full potential, <span data-token-index="1">t</span><span data-token-index="2">he</span><span data-token-index="3">i</span><span data-token-index="4">r</span><span data-token-index="5"> </span><span data-token-index="6">w</span><span data-token-index="7">a</span><span data-token-index="8">y</span><span data-token-index="9">.</span></p></div><p>‍</p><p>This last year has been a whirlwind of an adventure to say the least. Since then, we’ve built an incredible ADHD community of 60K+, onboarded 20+ coaches, launched our <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/about">ADHD Coaching Programme</a>, and served over <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/blog/1000-members-celebration">1,000 members</a> through it. </p><p>‍</p><p>A bit on how Shimmer works:</p><ul role="list"><li>The science:</li><li>~Shimmer’s program is rooted in Health &amp; Wellness Coaching and closely linked to it's sister discipline of positive psychology</li><li>~Your coach will help you focus on your horizons and the opportunities ahead, and not solely on diagnostics and deficits. You’ll work together to build skills, develop awareness, and institute habits and routines that work for your life</li><li>The day-to-day:</li><li>~Get matched w/ an expert ADHD coach, meet weekly</li><li>~Set goals &amp; experiment with skills, strategies, and routines each week</li><li>~Stay accountable to progress, learning and growing through the Shimmer platform</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The Why: Driving Force Behind the Web Platform</h3><p>Contrary to the prevailing notion of pushing mobile usage and competing for attention, our core purpose has always centered around addressing the unique needs of people with ADHD and prioritizing coaching outcomes. So we ask ourselves the question: What are the key obstacles or voids preventing our members from fully realizing their coaching goals? We then reverse-engineer solutions from these challenges. Here are a few primary hurdles we tackled and how the web platform elegantly resolves them:</p><p>‍</p><h4>🙈 Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h4><p>For those of us with ADHD, when things are not in our view or realm of attention, it’s very difficult to retrieve this information. Our members, predominantly spending their time on laptops, often find that Goals, Actions, and even their Coach fade into the background until they later pick up their phones.</p><p>‍</p><p>The new mobile-web system introduces <strong>diverse entry points</strong>, empowering users to engage with their coaching journey across an array of devices, extending beyond the confines of smartphones.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🤿 Desire to Go Deeper</h4><p>Shimmer is a lot more than an app, it’s a holistic Coaching Experience that requires deep thought and reflection. Our members have been itching for the web app to be able to better engage in the in-app Experiences that require a deeper level of thinking, typing, and consuming information.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web platform is purposefully crafted to enable deep exploration. Not only does it offer <strong>expanded typing space</strong> for introspection and the convenience of keyboard input, but it also enhances the capability to <strong>bookmark and retrieve</strong> relevant insights.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🧠 Forgetting Coaching Goals &amp; Insights</h4><p>Members often walk away with “a-ha” moments, especially after initially setting holistic goals for their ADHD Coaching Journey. Unfortunately these are sometimes lost either on the way from their laptop to their phone, or simply because it was not displayed in the right way at the right time.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web platform provides a <strong>visual cue</strong> for Coaching Goals, maintaining their prominent position to sustain motivation. Furthermore, coaching insights can now be easily captured within pre- and post-session workflows.</p><p>‍</p><h4>📱 Phone Addiction</h4><p>Many of our members either struggle with phone addiction, or are simply looking to reduce their use of their phone. Several members have their main goal as reducing phone time. For these members, knowing they need to go to their phone to work on their ADHD goals can cause distraction: e.g. checking their Shimmer app but ending up on Instagram.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web-based platform offers a <strong>focused environment</strong> for engagement, minimizing the potential distractions often associated with mobile apps.</p><p>‍</p><h3>The How: An Iterative Community Effort</h3><p>If you’ve touched even just an edge of the Shimmer Orbit, you’ve likely noticed we’re absolutely obsessed with <strong>building with the community</strong>. Every single day, the team holds lively feedback calls with members, coaches, ADHD creators, and ADHD experts.</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is a look into a few key components of our web design process. We’re happy to elaborate if you message us! We’ve…</p><ul role="list"><li>Held hundreds of <strong>1:1 interviews</strong> with potential members, current members, cancelled members</li><li>Ran <strong>focus groups</strong> and “<strong>CTO open houses</strong>”</li><li>Implemented a <strong>direct chat line</strong> through the app to our CTO</li><li>Ran an extremely <strong>iterative 360 UX design</strong>: interviewing coaches, members</li><li>Pressure tested our Web App &amp; design with the <strong>wider ADHD community</strong> including ADHD creators</li><li>…And the table-stakes testing phases with members (Alpha, Beta…)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The What: Web App Unveiled</h3><h4>🎨 Design Guidelines</h4><p>Getting to design for people with ADHD is a privilege and a brain teaser all at once—most products built for neurotypical audiences don’t have as strong of a focus on accessibility, but for us it’s one of the most rewarding things to think about and get right. Here are our 3 guiding design philosophies:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Accessibility</strong> is a prerequisite: visual coherence, sans-serif typography, thoughtfully spaced elements, and appropriately sized fonts.</li><li>However, <strong>stimulation</strong> is necessary: careful use of visual elements like color, images, movement (and confetti)</li><li>All flows are <strong>ADHD-elevated:</strong> For example, making sure multi-step forms where previous steps need to be referenced are properly shown. Another one is the inclusion of examples for key questions from other members to reduce cognitive load and decision making paralysis.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h4>🌐 The Web App!</h4><p>If you’re still reading, kudos—we hope you’re as invested and excited as we are now! If you skipped and scrolled right to here, we see you 👀.</p><p>‍</p><p>Each flow has been carefully thought out, tested, and designed to elevate the ADHD coaching experience. Check it out:</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>1. Onboarding</strong>: Sit down and get comfy. You’ll start off by setting your long-term vision and assess your starting state, setting the foundation for your coaching goals.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d440cb0eec1ae8e9684005_small_mastery.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>2.

Completing actions, reflecting, and celebrating</strong>: Experiment with weekly actions with your coach, reflect on what’s working (or not!), and celebrate your wins.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d43f3c4eefd6c69228fd69_small_actions.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. Coach support</strong>: Between sessions, your coach will be notified of your progress and cheer you on! You can also ping your coach for troubleshooting or advanced learning resources.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d44107c71dc866a97d7ffc_small_chat.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. Continued learning</strong>: Embark on bite-sized learning modules on key ADHD topics or access resources assigned by your coach.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d440f4be2a4ff921778317_small_learning.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Curious to learn more? Take a deeper look into our Web App on our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shimmer-web-app">Product Hunt launch</a> (we’d appreciate the support!) or by signing up for a coach at <a href="https://app.shimmer.care/">app.shimmer.care</a>.</p><p>‍</p><div><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shimmer-web-app?utm_source=badge-featured&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-shimmer-web-app" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=408154&amp;theme=light" alt="Shimmer Web App - ADHD Coaching | Reach your full potential, your way | Product Hunt" width="250" height="54"></a></p></div><p>‍</p><h3>The Future: A World Where Difference is Our Strength</h3><p>I can no longer count the amount of times I sat on my floor and cried after hearing mind-boggling, heart-warming, awe-inspiring success stories from our incredible members. Promotions to positions they never thought they’d achieve, mending and strengthening of close-to-breaking relationships, the first feeling of pride as a parent in <strong><em>years</em></strong>, and thriving in new, purposeful jobs… the list goes on.</p><p>‍</p><p>What this shows me (what I already knew in my heart), is that people with ADHD have an immense amount of talent, intelligence, creativity, beauty, and love to contribute to the world that is often being blocked or held down.</p><p>‍</p><p>What this also screams to me is the need farther reaching accommodations, support, and understanding from the wider community to help unleash the strengths of difference. Employers, family members, partners, teachers, friends—this is an invitation to join us in our mission, because <em>“When we shape the world for difference, we all thrive.

    <div><p><strong>At the age of 30, Ann suffered a brainstem stroke that left her severely paralyzed. She lost control of all the muscles in her body and was unable even to breathe. It came on suddenly one afternoon, for reasons that are still mysterious.</strong></p>

<p>For the next five years, Ann went to bed each night afraid she would die in her sleep. It took years of physical therapy before she could move her facial muscles enough to laugh or cry. Still, the muscles that would have allowed her to speak remained immobile.</p>

<p>“Overnight, everything was taken from me,” Ann wrote, using a device that enables her to type slowly on a computer screen with small movements of her head. “I had a 13-month-old daughter, an 8-year-old stepson and 26-month-old marriage.”</p>

<p>It is the first time that either speech or facial expressions have been synthesized from brain signals. The system can also decode these signals into text at nearly 80 words per minute, a vast improvement over the 14 words per minute that her current communication device delivers.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang">Edward Chang</a>, MD, chair of neurological surgery at UCSF, who has worked on the technology, known as a brain-computer interface, or BCI, for more than a decade, hopes this latest research breakthrough, published Aug. 23, 2023, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06443-4"><em>Nature</em></a>, will lead to an FDA-approved system that enables speech from brain signals in the near future.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to restore a full, embodied way of communicating, which is the most natural way for us to talk with others,” said Chang, who is a member of the <a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences</a> and the Jeanne Robertson Distinguished Professor. “These advancements bring us much closer to making this a real solution for patients.”</p>

              <h2><br>
Decoding the signals of speech</h2>

<p>Ann was a high school math teacher in Canada before her stroke in 2005. In 2020, she described her life since in a paper she wrote, painstakingly typing letter-by-letter, for a psychology class.</p>

<p>“Locked-in syndrome, or LIS, is just like it sounds,” she wrote. “You’re fully cognizant, you have full sensation, all five senses work, but you are locked inside a body where no muscles work. I learned to breathe on my own again, I now have full neck movement, my laugh returned, I can cry and read and over the years my smile has returned, and I am able to wink and say a few words.”</p>

<p>As she recovered, she realized she could use her own experiences to help others, and she now aspires to become a counselor in a physical rehabilitation facility.</p>

<p>“I want patients there to see me and know their lives are not over now,” she wrote. “I want to show them that disabilities don’t need to stop us or slow us down.”</p>

<p>She learned about Chang’s study in 2021 after reading about a paralyzed man named Pancho, who helped the team <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a412e3d6-6159-4bb8-a5f1-0db7c1e6cf3f" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis" title="“Neuroprosthesis” Restores Words to Man with Paralysis">translate his brain signals into text as he attempted to speak</a>. He had also experienced a brainstem stroke many years earlier, and it wasn’t clear if his brain could still signal the movements for speech. It’s not enough just to think about something; a person has to actually attempt to speak for the system to pick it up. Pancho became the first person living with paralysis to demonstrate that it was possible to decode speech-brain signals into full words.</p>

	</div>
</dom-twocolumn-layout><hr><p>With Ann, Chang’s team attempted something even more ambitious: decoding her brain signals into the richness of speech, along with the movements that animate a person’s face during conversation.</p>

<p>To do this, the team implanted a paper-thin rectangle of 253 electrodes onto the surface of her brain over areas they previously discovered were critical for speech. The electrodes intercepted the brain signals that, if not for the stroke, would have gone to muscles in Ann’s lips, tongue, jaw and larynx, as well as her face. A cable, plugged into a port fixed to Ann’s head, connected the electrodes to a bank of computers.</p>

<p>For weeks, Ann worked with the team to train the system’s artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize her unique brain signals for speech. This involved repeating different phrases from a 1,024-word conversational vocabulary over and over again until the computer recognized the brain activity patterns associated with all the basic sounds of speech.</p>

              <p>“It was exciting to see her go from, ‘We’re going to just try doing this,’ and then seeing it happen quicker than probably anyone thought,” said Ann’s husband, Bill, who travelled with her from Canada to be with her during the study. “It seems like they’re pushing each other to see how far they can go with this.”</p>

<p>Rather than train the AI to recognize whole words, the researchers created a system that decodes words from smaller components called phonemes. These are the sub-units of speech that form spoken words in the same way that letters form written words. “Hello,” for example, contains four phonemes: “HH,” “AH,” “L” and “OW.”</p>

<p>Using this approach, the computer only needed to learn 39 phonemes to decipher any word in English. This both enhanced the system’s accuracy and made it three times faster.</p>

<p>“The accuracy, speed and vocabulary are crucial,” said Sean Metzger, who developed the text decoder with Alex Silva, both graduate students in the joint Bioengineering Program at UC Berkeley and UCSF. “It’s what gives Ann the potential, in time, to communicate almost as fast as we do, and to have much more naturalistic and normal conversations.”</p>

	<p>Ann’s 18-year-old daughter knows “mom’s voice” as a computerized voice with a British accent.</p>

	<p>The BRAVO3 team recreated Ann’s voice using language learning AI, and footage of Ann’s laugh-inducing wedding speech from 2005.</p>

              <h2><br>
Adding a face and a voice</h2>

<p>To synthesize Ann’s speech, the team devised an algorithm for synthesizing speech, which they personalized to sound like her voice before the injury by using a recording of Ann speaking at her wedding.</p>

<p>“My brain feels funny when it hears my synthesized voice,” she wrote in answer to a question. “It’s like hearing an old friend.”</p>

<p>She looks forward to the day when her daughter – who only knows the impersonal, British-accented voice of her current communication device – can hear it too.</p>

<p>“My daughter was 1 when I had my injury, it’s like she doesn’t know Ann … She has no idea what Ann sounds like.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want patients ... to see me and know that their lives are not over now. I want to show them that disabilities don’t need to stop us or slow us down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team animated Ann’s avatar with the help of software that simulates and animates muscle movements of the face, developed by Speech Graphics, a company that makes AI-driven facial animation. The researchers created customized machine-learning processes that allowed the company’s software to mesh with signals being sent from Ann’s brain as she was trying to speak and convert them into the movements on her avatar’s face, making the jaw open and close, the lips protrude and purse and the tongue go up and down, as well as the facial movements for happiness, sadness and surprise.</p>

<p>“We’re making up for the connections between her brain and vocal tract that have been severed by the stroke,” said Kaylo Littlejohn, a graduate student working with Chang and Gopala Anumanchipalli, PhD, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. “When Ann first used this system to speak and move the avatar’s face in tandem, I knew that this was going to be something that would have a real impact.”</p>

<p>An important next step for the team is to create a wireless version that would not require Ann to be physically connected to the BCI.</p>

<p>“Giving people like Ann the ability to freely control their own computers and phones with this technology would have profound effects on their independence and social interactions,” said co-first author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/david.moses">David Moses</a>, PhD, an adjunct professor in neurological surgery.</p>

<p>For Ann, helping to develop the technology has been life changing.</p>

<p>“When I was at the rehab hospital, the speech therapist didn’t know what to do with me,” she wrote in answer to a question. “Being a part of this study has given me a sense of purpose, I feel like I am contributing to society. It feels like I have a job again. It’s amazing I have lived this long; this study has allowed me to really live while I’m still alive!”</p>

<p>
<b>Hacker News Guidelines</b></p><p>
<b>What to Submit</b></p><p>
On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes
more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence,
the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual
curiosity.
</p><p>
Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or
celebrities, unless they're evidence of some interesting new
phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures.
If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.
</p><p>
<b>In Submissions</b>
</p><p>
Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase
or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It's
implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.
</p><p>
Please submit the original source.  If a post reports on
something found on another site, submit the latter.
</p><p>
Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post
your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the site
should be for curiosity.
</p><p>
If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out,
because the site name will be displayed after the link.
</p><p>
If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective,
we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it.  E.g. translate "10 Ways
To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys."  Exception:
when the number is meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."
</p><p>
Otherwise please use the original title, unless it
is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize.
</p><p>
If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending
[video] or [pdf] to the title.
</p><p>
Please don't post on HN to ask or tell us something. Send it
to hn@ycombinator.com.
</p><p>
Please don't delete and repost. Deletion is for things
that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place.
</p><p>
Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should vote and
comment when they run across something they personally find
interesting—not for promotion.
</p><p>
Be kind. Don't be snarky. Converse curiously; don't cross-examine.
Edit out swipes.
</p><p>
Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive,
not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
</p><p>
When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling
names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1
is 2, not 3."
</p><p>
Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of
the community.
</p><p>
Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what
someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good
faith.
</p><p>
Eschew flamebait. Avoid generic tangents. Omit internet tropes.
</p><p>
Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's
work. A good critical comment teaches us something.
</p><p>
Please don't use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. That
tramples curiosity.
</p><p>
Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you
even read the article? It mentions that" can be shortened to "The
article mentions that".
</p><p>
Please don't pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to
complain about in the thread. Find something interesting to respond to
instead.
</p><p>
Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't
create accounts routinely. HN is a community—users should have an
identity that others can relate to.
</p><p>
Please don't use uppercase for emphasis.  If you want to emphasize
a word or phrase, put *asterisks* around it and it will get
italicized.
</p><p>
Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling,
brigading, foreign agents, and the like. It degrades discussion
and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email
hn@ycombinator.com and we'll look at the data.
</p><p>
Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story
is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed egregious comments by
replying; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html#cflag">flag</a> them instead. If you
flag, please don't also comment that you did.
</p><p>
Please don't complain about tangential annoyances—e.g.
article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage.
They're too common to be interesting.
</p><p>
Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any
good, and it makes boring reading.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37250388">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1311656/dl?inline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit today against Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) for discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring. The lawsuit alleges that, from at least September 2018 to May 2022, SpaceX routinely discouraged asylees and refugees from applying and refused to hire or consider them, because of their citizenship status, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>

<p>In job postings and public statements over several years, SpaceX wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as “export control laws,” SpaceX could hire only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, sometimes referred to as “green card holders.” Export control laws impose no such hiring restrictions. Moreover, asylees’ and refugees’ permission to live and work in the United States does not expire, and they stand on equal footing with U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents under export control laws. Under these laws, companies like SpaceX can hire asylees and refugees for the same positions they would hire U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. And once hired, asylees and refugees can access export-controlled information and materials without additional government approval, just like U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.</p>

<p>“Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Our investigation also found that SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged asylees and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company. Asylees and refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives, and unlawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship status should not be one of them. Through this lawsuit we will hold SpaceX accountable for its illegal employment practices and seek relief that allows asylees and refugees to fairly compete for job opportunities and contribute their talents to SpaceX’s workforce.”</p>

<p>The department’s lawsuit alleges that SpaceX discriminated against asylees and refugees based on citizenship status at multiple stages of the hiring process. For example:</p>

<ul><li>SpaceX discouraged asylees and refugees from applying for open positions, through public announcements, job applications and other online recruiting communications that excluded asylees and refugees.</li>
<li>SpaceX failed to fairly consider applications submitted by asylees and refugees.</li>
<li>SpaceX refused to hire qualified asylee and refugee applicants and repeatedly rejected asylee and refugee applicants because of their citizenship status.</li>
<li>SpaceX hired only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, from September 2018 to September 2020.</li>
</ul><p>SpaceX recruits and hires for a variety of positions, including welders, cooks, crane operators, baristas and dishwashers, as well as information technology specialists, software engineers, business analysts, rocket engineers and marketing professionals. The jobs at issue in the lawsuit are not limited to those that require advanced degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asylees and refugees are migrants to the United States who have fled persecution. To obtain their status, they undergo thorough vetting by the United States government. Under the INA, employers cannot discriminate against them in hiring, unless a law, regulation, executive order or government contract requires the employer to do so. In this instance, no law, regulation, executive order or government contract required or permitted SpaceX to engage in the widespread discrimination against asylees or refugees that the department’s investigation found, as explained in the complaint.</p>

<p>Because SpaceX works with certain goods, software, technology and technical data (referred to here as export-controlled items), SpaceX must comply with export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations. Under these regulations, asylees, refugees, lawful permanent residents, U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals working at U.S. companies can access export-controlled items without authorization from the U.S. government. Therefore, these laws do not require SpaceX to treat asylees and refugees differently than U.S. citizens or green card holders. Find more information <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1579981/dl">here</a> on how employers can avoid discrimination when complying with export control requirements.</p>

<p>The United States seeks fair consideration and back pay for asylees and refugees who were deterred or denied employment at SpaceX due to the alleged discrimination. The United States also seeks civil penalties in an amount to be determined by the court and policy changes to ensure it complies with the INA’s nondiscrimination mandate going forward.</p>

<p>Please contact the department’s Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at <a href="mailto:IERSpaceXcase@usdoj.gov">IERSpaceXcase@usdoj.gov</a> or 1-888-473-3845 if you are or were an asylee or refugee who experienced any one of the following at any point in time:</p>

<p>(1) You applied to a job at SpaceX and were rejected.</p>

<p>(2) You were discouraged from applying to SpaceX because you were not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.</p>

<p>(3) A recruiter or other SpaceX employee told you that SpaceX could only hire U.S. citizens and/or lawful permanent residents.</p>

<p>IER is responsible for enforcing the anti-discrimination provision of the INA. Among other things, the statute generally prohibits&nbsp;discrimination based on <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/types-discrimination">citizenship status and national origin</a>&nbsp;in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral for a fee;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/osc/htm/Webtypes2005.php">unfair documentary practices</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/osc/htm/Webtypes2005.php">retaliation; and intimidation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BitLocker partition is encrypted using the Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK). The FVEK itself is encrypted using the Volume Master Key (VMK) and stored on the disk, next to the encrypted data. This permits key rotations without re-encrypting the whole disk.</p>

<p>The VMK is stored in the TPM. Thus the disk can only be decrypted when booted from this computer (there is a recovery mechanism in Active Directory though).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/arch.png" alt="TPM key architecture"></p>

<p>In order to decrypt the disk, the CPU will ask that the TPM sends the VMK over the SPI bus.</p>

<p>The vulnerability should be obvious: at some point in the boot process, the VMK transits unencrypted between the TPM and the CPU. This means that it can be captured and used to decrypt the disk.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-the-tpm-exchange">Capturing the TPM exchange</h2>
<p>We’ll be using a dirt cheap logic analyzer, <a href="https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/dslogic-series/">DSLogic Plus</a>. I bought this for under $100 in 2021 (tax and shipping included).</p>

<p>A note on signal capture: to comfortably acquire a signal the sampling frequency should be 3 to 4 times the bus frequency. This means that for our SPI 33MHz bus we should sample at the very least at 100MHz. Notice that the specs of the analyzer state that it can do <em>up to</em> 400MHz on <em>up to</em> 16 channels. I’ll help you read between the lines here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the more channels you capture at a time (by sets of 3), the lower the sampling frequency</li>
  <li>you have to distinguish stream mode and buffer mode. The first one will send results directly to the host computer and permits capture of large sets, up to a minute but it’s limited to 100MHz on 3 channels. The buffer mode allows sampling at 400MHz but it will only work for a few milliseconds, so there’s no practical use for it here.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that this hardware can <em>barely</em> do the job we’re asking it to do. For a more professional option both hardware and software-wise (but also 10x pricier) have a look at <a href="https://usd.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-16">Saleae</a>. Otherwise there’s <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Logic_analyzers">sigrok’s list of supported hardware</a>.</p>

<p>As for plugging the analyzer to the board, remember that SPI is a shared bus. This means that there’s no need to capture the signal right at the tiny TPM pins if there is a larger SPI component on the board that the hooks can be latched on to. From experience I identified a neighbouring SPI flash, but fortunately all components are marked so it’s rather easy to identify their use by looking up their datasheet.
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/SPI_pin.jpg" alt="Lenovo board"></p>

<p>SPI has several lines but only 3 can be captured using the DSLogic because otherwise the sampling frequency drops. The 3 most important ones are the clock CLK and the two data lines MOSI and MISO.</p>

<p>The threshold voltage (level at which the analyzer decides that the line has changed states) should be around half of the signal’s voltage, here the latter was measured at 3.3V so an appropriate threshold is around 1.6V.</p>

<p>The VMK key we’re looking for is used late in the POST stage. For the Lenovo L13 I worked with it was just after the splash screen, about 14 seconds into the boot process out of a total boot time of about 25 seconds. There are SPI operations before that (mostly to read and verify the early boot stages) but they’re not TPM. You could either start the capture when booting the computer, or safely wait about 7 or so seconds to avoid capturing unnecessary data.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-the-captured-signal">Decoding the captured signal</h2>
<p>There are 3 layers to decode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SPI, which is the physical layer</li>
  <li>TIS</li>
  <li>TPM2.0, which contains the VMK</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spi">SPI</h2>
<p>As far as SPI is concerned any logic analyzer should do this properly, it’s a rather simple protocol:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/spi_frame.PNG" alt="SPI byte"></p>

<p>The blue square wave is the clock, the other two lines (yellow and red) are data lines, respectively used for communications from slave to master (MISO) and master to slave (MOSI).</p>

<p>When the clock signal is going up (transitioning from 0 to 1), the bit value is whatever state the data lines are in at this specific time. In our case the red line sits at 0 for 8 clock cycles, so the byte is 0. The yellow line only has the first bit set, so the decoded value is b10000000 = 0x80.</p>

<p>The logic analyzer correctly decodes SPI so we’ll just trust its output.</p>

<h2 id="tis">TIS</h2>
<p>TIS, which stands for TPM Interface Specification, is another beast entirely and that’s where I had most of my troubles. I couldn’t find a decoder that worked for my capture and decided to do it “manually”. Short of correctly decoding the data, the <a href="https://github.com/sigrokproject/libsigrokdecode/pull/88">libsigrock decoders</a> did at least indicate a rough window for the TPM exchanges which was a welcome tip since each capture has several million bytes of data. Maybe the decoders fail be because the capture is missing Chip Select (CS#) which is required in the TPM specification, maybe because the clock is incorrect, maybe because some bytes are occasionally missing, maybe for some other reason, who knows.</p>

<p>Master to slave request:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_request.PNG" alt="Master to slave request"></p>

<p>Sending a request seems to happen in this order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the slave sends byte 80 to signal that it’s ready</li>
  <li>the master sends a header we don’t care about (<code>D4 00 24</code>) and then sends the TPM byte in a loop (<code>80</code>)</li>
  <li>the slave acknowledges that it has read the byte by sending 01 FF</li>
  <li>at this point the cycle starts anew with the next byte</li>
</ul>

<p>So this whole frame is just to send the byte 0x80 from the master to the slave!</p>

<p>Slave to master response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_response.PNG" alt="Slave to master response"></p>

<p>This is a completely different process that relies on setting and reading registers. The frame is the result of reading one byte from a set address (<code>D4 00 24</code>, meaning register 24). Again the slave seems to start the transaction with byte 80, then writes the size of the followong data which is only 1 byte (or it could be an ACK value to the read request, who knows) and finally the value we care about, here 0x80. The next TPM byte is 0x02.</p>

<h2 id="tpm-20">TPM 2.0</h2>
<p>The TPM command that requests the key be sent back is the <code>TPM2_Unseal</code> command. It is described in <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/">part 3 of the TPM 2.0 specification</a>.</p>

<p>You might ask how I isolated the frames below since no decoder would work. We don’t actually care about the requests happening on MOSI, we’re mostly interested in the responses on the MISO line. As we’ve seen previously the TIS encoding around TPM bytes is rather simple, so the simplest way to isolate all TPM transactions is to filter the raw SPI data using the mask “80 00 00 00 01 ..” and only keep this wildcard last byte. The start of a TPM transaction can then be identified by its own <code>80 01</code> or <code>80 02</code> header. There should only be a few dozens TPM responses, the one with the key inside should be the longer authenticated one (starts with <code>80 02</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/unseal_response.PNG" alt="unseal cmd and response">
There is a 10 milliseconds delay between the unseal command and the response, which is huge. This is probably because the request is authenticated (see below the <code>80 02</code> header indicating a password session as opposed to most requests using the plain <code>80 01</code> header) using a HMAC so the slave has to verify the signature and then reply using a HMAC of its own, which induces a notable delay.</p>

<p>The TPM command and its response are obtained by reassembling bytes one by one using the method previously explained.</p>

<p>Reconstituted Unseal command:</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 5B 00 00 01 5E 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 49 03 00 00 00 00 20 9D F7 05 43 7A 77 AE E4 20 92 66 17 EC DA BB A7 79 D2 47 0D 42 E5 D1 1C EB 4A 6B C1 C8 44 42 BC 00 00 20 D9 AF C7 DF 10 7A D4 30 C1 C5 28 63 5F CE CE 8A 24 1A 19 E5 DD 08 5F 77 AA 28 BE 75 16 16 91 F1

<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_command.PNG" alt="Decode TPM unseal command"></p>

<p>Response (I’ve stripped continuation bytes <code>1F 00</code>, they become apparent if you capture several long frames):</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2E 00 2C 2C 00 05 00 01 00 00 00 03 20 00 00 57 61 A3 91 DF E1 B3 85 28 28 C6 DD A6 F9 A5 FE AC E9 71 A4 AA AE 44 25 18 F7 4A A7 FE D6 E0 FC 00 20 8D DD A1 AE 93 5D 98 E9 DA A8 18 6F D5 64 A8 66 E6 DE AA 56 9E 2F 50 A7 41 E1 27 BF A1 2C 4D 92 00 00 20 00 20 BA C9 8F 34 60 5F 4F D4 76 9B 6B AA 68 C7 6C 79 EF 36 7D 1D D3 19 33 78 55 47 B2 E1 40 D4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Decoded response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_response.PNG" alt="Decoded TPM response"></p>

<p>In the buffer lies our key, it starts with <code>5761</code> and is 32 bytes long.</p>

<h2 id="mounting-and-backdooring-the-disk">Mounting and backdooring the disk</h2>
<p>Mounting the disk live in read/write mode (if you’d rather work offline do a disk copy with dd and then mount this copy using a loop device):</p>
<div><pre><code>echo 5761A391DF1F00E1B3852828C6DDA6F9A5FEACE971A4AAAE442518F74AA7FED6E0FC | xxd -r -p &gt; key
dislocker-fuse -K key /dev/sdd3 ./mnt/
mount ./mnt/dislocker-file ./mnt2/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the simplest backdoor is to just overwrite the sticky keys program with cmd:</p>
<div><pre><code>cp ./mnt2/Windows/System32/cmd.exe ./mnt2/Windows/System32/sethc.exe
</code></pre></div>

<p>Place the disk back in the laptop, boot and press shift 5 times to get a SYSTEM shell:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/system.jpg" alt="sethc"></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>I cannot recommend using the DSLogic for this task:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lot of captures were duds and had to be thrown away</li>
  <li>sampling at 3 times the bus speed was barely enough to have a coherent clock and some bytes were missing</li>
</ul>

<p>This forced me to spend way too much time to understand the protocols in order to decode the capture. In the end time is money, if you’re an employer reading this just buy a professional logic analyzer for your employees.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The use of a discrete (physical) TPM actually decreases the security of the system, using a fTPM would solve the problem.</p>

<p>If the discrete TPM has to be used, then a PIN or passphrase on BitLocker is necessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Recently, I was invited to speak at a <a href="https://www.paleisamsterdam.nl/en/symposia/">symposium organized by the Amsterdam Royal Palace Foundation</a>, who, twice a year, brings in experts to discuss some big topic like the COVID pandemic or the future of work. This summer’s meeting was about the search for extraterrestrial life. While I focused on the search in our own Solar System, <a href="https://www.saraseager.com/">Sara Seager</a> of MIT presented her ideas on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43043384?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">how to look for life on planets circling other stars</a>.</p>
<p>During our talks and the discussions that followed, I dropped a suggestion that some people surely will find provocative: that we <em>already did </em>find <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/is-life-possible-on-mars/">life on Mars</a> nearly 50 years ago—but that we inadvertently killed it.</p>
<h2>The Viking Lander Experiments</h2>
<p>In the mid-1970s, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742875?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">NASA sent two Viking landers to the surface of Mars</a> equipped with instruments that conducted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander_biological_experiments">the only life detection experiments ever conducted on another planet</a>. The results of those tests were very confusing at the time and remain so today. While some of them—particularly the labelled release experiment (which tested for microbial metabolism) and the pyrolytic release experiments (which tested for organic synthesis)—were initially positive for life, the gas exchange experiment was not.</p>

	<div>

<p>The Viking landers also included <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742564?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">an instrument to detect organic compounds</a>. It saw trace amounts of chlorinated organics, which were interpreted at the time to be the result of contamination from Earth. This led Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen to utter his famous words, “No bodies, no life.” In other words, there couldn’t be Martian life without organic compounds. So Soffen concluded, as did most other scientists at the time, that the Viking project was negative as to the presence of life, or at best inconclusive.</p>
<p>In the half century since, the picture has changed a lot. Eight more landers and rovers have explored the Martian surface in greater detail. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27859448?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">Thanks to the 2008 <em>Phoenix</em> lander</a>, and to later confirmation by the <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-meaning-of-methane-on-mars/"><em>Curiosity</em></a> and <em>Perseverance</em> rovers, we know that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aas9185">indigenous organic compounds do, in fact, exist on Mars</a>. They’re in a chlorinated form, however—not what the Viking-era scientists expected—and we don’t know whether they derive from biological processes or from some <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2019.2139">abiotic chemical reactions</a> that have nothing to do with life. Still, one might wonder how Soffen would react today: Would he still say categorically that the Viking results were negative?</p>
<h2>Death by Water</h2>
<p>At the time of those landings, scientists had very little understanding of the Martian environment. Since Earth is a water planet, it seemed reasonable that adding water might coax life to show itself in the extremely dry Martian environment. In hindsight, it is possible that approach was too much of a good thing. What I and other researchers have learned in extremely dry places on Earth, such as Chile’s Atacama Desert, is that there is a gradual progression of life forms as the habitat gets more arid.</p>
<p>At the very end of that progression, you find <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2015.1380">microbes that live entirely within salt rocks</a>. These hardy organisms take advantage of a process we call hygroscopicity, by which certain salts attract water directly from the relative humidity of the air. (This is the same process that makes table salt clumpy when you leave it exposed to air.) For that reason, the microbes living inside salt rocks in the Atacama do not need any rain at all—just a certain amount of moisture in the atmosphere.</p>
		
		
<p>Now let’s ask what would happen if you poured water over these dry-adapted microbes. Might that overwhelm them? In technical terms, we would say that we were hyperhydrating them, but in simple terms, it would be more like drowning them. It would be as if an alien spaceship were to find you wandering half-dead in the desert, and your would-be saviors decide, “Humans need water. Let’s put the human in the middle of the ocean to save it!” That wouldn’t work either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742572?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">Many of the Viking experiments</a> involved applying water to the soil samples, which may explain the puzzling results. Perhaps the putative Martian microbes collected for the labelled release experiments couldn’t deal with that amount of water and died off after a while. Most of the runs for the pyrolytic release experiment were conducted under dry conditions, contrary to the other experiments. The first run was positive for life when compared to a control run conducted later, which was designed so that no biology could have been involved. Interestingly, the only run conducted under wet conditions had less of a signal than the control.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought, we should ask whether the Martian soil tested by Viking did in fact contain hygroscopic salts, and whether the relative humidity at those sites is high enough. The Vikings touched down in the equatorial region of Mars where the salt content of the soil is rather low. But there are a lot of hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates in the soil, and both of those compounds are very hygroscopic. Also, Viking did observe fog on Mars—which means 100 percent humidity. In principle, relative humidities would have been high enough in the morning and evening hours for microbes to suck up the moisture.</p>
<h2>Hope from Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>
<p>More than 15 years ago, my colleague Joop Houtkooper and I <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/possible-biogenic-origin-for-hydrogen-peroxide-on-mars-the-viking-results-reinterpreted/CFC8FE788E40D8A57388D2B35E224742">upped the level of scientific speculation on this topic</a> by taking a different perspective on the puzzling Viking results. We suggested that microbial life on Mars might have hydrogen peroxide in their cells—an evolutionary adaptation that would allow them to draw water directly from the atmosphere. The mixture would have other advantages, too, such as keeping water liquid at freezing Martian temperatures, preventing the formation of ice crystals that would rupture the cells.</p>
<p>While at a high enough concentration hydrogen peroxide is used for cleaning and sterilization, <em>many</em> microbes in your mouth, like <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus,</em> produce hydrogen peroxide naturally, alongside others, like <em>Neisseria sicca and Haemophilus segnis</em>, that use it. The bombardier beetle sprays a 25 percent hydrogen peroxide solution at anything that bothers it. My point is that hydrogen peroxide is not incompatible with life.</p>
<p>If we assume that indigenous Martian life might have adapted to its environment by incorporating hydrogen peroxide into its cells, this could explain the Viking results. The instrument used for detecting organic compounds (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25435929?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">called a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer</a>) heated up soil samples prior to analysis. If the Martian cells contained hydrogen peroxide, that would have killed them. Moreover, it would have caused the hydrogen peroxide to react with any organic molecules in the vicinity to form large amounts of carbon dioxide—which is exactly what the instrument detected.</p>
<h2>A New Mission to Mars</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26017975?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">As I have argued before</a>, we need a new mission to Mars <em>dedicated primarily to life detection</em> to test this hypothesis and others. It should explore potential habitats on Mars like the Southern Highlands, where life could persist in salt rocks close to the surface. We might even be able to access these rocks without drilling—a huge advantage in terms of engineering complication and cost. I cannot wait for such a mission to get under way.</p>

If you are not tech-savvy you are toast. It is so exclusionary.”</p><p>The real cause of Vickery’s ire, however, was a breast cancer clinic she attended that, in her words, turned away “some old ladies … because they did not have an SMS message from an app. They didn’t even have a phone!

Natasha Bright-Wray, the foundation’s associate director of communications, says that “digitally excluded people are largely forgotten” by a government that boasts of making the UK a digital superpower but is apathetic about those left behind and lacks any meaningful digital inclusion strategy.</p><p>The effects are conspicuous in the NHS, where improved digitalisation can bring greater efficiencies but often leaves those, like the women Vickery witnessed, failing to benefit from the services.</p><p>After all, as Bright-Wray says, one in 20 UK households have no home internet access. And in the case of the elderly, even if they do have access, they frequently have limited ability to use it. In much the same way, the notion that everyone has a bank account and a card or phone with money on it does not withstand a visit to your local supermarket, where it’s noticeable how many people avoid the checkouts that are “card only”.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="bfe6da6f-5cbf-4210-bfc2-f535423fa019" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:14,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/18/the-big-idea-should-we-embrace-a-cashless-society&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The big idea: should we embrace a cashless society? &quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;bfe6da6f-5cbf-4210-bfc2-f535423fa019&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The cashless society is effectively already a reality for most of us, but there remains a minority for whom it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/14/fears-uks-cashless-society-will-leave-more-than-just-the-vulnerable-behind" data-link-name="in body link">represents a continuing headache</a>. The government last week told high street banks that they must offer access to cash machines <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/17/uk-banks-will-have-to-ensure-access-to-cash-within-three-miles-ministers-say" data-link-name="in body link">within three miles of customers</a> after the closure of thousands of branches had reduced the number of ATMs.</p><p>There are also an estimated to be 1.3 million adults in this country who are “unbanked” – ie do not have a bank account. For them, something as mundane as parking a car is increasingly fraught – a quarter of London councils have removed pay and display parking machines in favour of smartphone-centred apps.</p><p>This silent trend towards the removal of cash has provided another front for conspiratorial thinking. Go to a demonstration by the sort of people who believe that 5G mobile towers and Covid are linked and the chances are you’ll see placards warning of the evils of electronic money.</p><p>It’s easy to mock such thinking, but it feeds on a sense of disempowerment. Recently in Nottinghamshire I spoke to a woman called Audrey who told me she had worked in the caring profession for 50 years. She and her husband were full of melodramatic warnings about China and “shadowy” powers who controlled politics, but she also said that when it came to removing cash transactions “it’s the poor and marginalised who are forgotten”.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>On 23rd of August 2023 Airlock Digital received reports from customers seeing a sudden increase in file executions that had ‘Invalid Certificate Chains’.</p>
<p>Airlock Digital investigated these reports and found that all occurrences of this certificate status chained trust up to the Verisign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5 Root Certificate (serial: 18dad19e267de8bb4a2158cdcc6b3b4a). Over the coming hours, it was identified that many internet connected Windows 10 &amp; 11 computers within the Airlock Digital environment also began reporting files chained to this root as having ‘Invalid Certificate Chains’.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>This particular root certificate is responsible for chained trust in a significant number of issued digital certificates globally between 2006 – 2018. As PCWorld reports “According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world.” Source: https://www.pcworld.com/article/406198/to-punish-symantec-google-may-distrust-a-third-of-the-webs-ssl-certificates.html</p>
<p>Its downfall however came when browser vendors revoked trust in Verisign’s root certificates in 2018, due to repeated occurrences where Symantec (who owned Verisign at the time) improperly issued SSL certificates from this and other roots to customers and its re-sellers.</p>
<p>As a result of this browser revocation, it effectively pulled the pin on Symantec’s certificate business. Around this time, the business was acquired by DigiCert.</p>
<p><strong>Revocation Event<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Airlock Digital worked throughout the 23rd of August to determine why this revocation was occurring on Microsoft Windows systems. There was little information publicly and no word from Microsoft or DigiCert. The only other information that could be found online, was a discussion by the great folks over at /r/sysadmin stating they were having trouble loading Quickbooks due to an invalid certificate. Analysis of the QuickBooks binary in question showed that it chained to the same Verisign root. Kudos to Intuit (vendor of Quickbooks) for having an application which validates Digital Certificates of its libraries before launching them.</p>
<blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/15ym2jr/quickbooks_application_with_revoked_certificate/">QuickBooks – Application with Revoked Certificate</a><br> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhyPartyPizza">u/WhyPartyPizza</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/">sysadmin</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>This revocation can be easily recreated on any Windows 10 or 11 machine by downloading the PEM certificate from the following site https://crt.sh/?id=93&amp;opt=ocsp and viewing the Certificate in Windows Explorer. In Airlock Digital’s testing, unsupported versions of Windows such as Windows 8 and below are unaffected.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-300x300.png 300w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-150x150.png 150w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>At this point, the question we were unable to answer was how did this certificate become revoked? Its serial was not listed on any online Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL’s) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OSCP) still lists the certificate as valid. So where is this coming from?</p>
<p>The only possibility left was Microsoft, as Windows was indicating that the certificate had a ‘disable’ flag applied as per Microsoft’s ‘Deprecation Definitions’ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/deprecation this explains why this did not show on any publicly available lists.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there is no notice from Microsoft on their trusted root certificate program of this change: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/release-notes</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
<p>On the 24th of August, DigiCert responded to an Airlock Digital support request confirming the revocation by Microsoft:</p>
<p>“Yes, we have received a few reports in regard to the same issue.</p>
<p>After escalating it to our engineering team and they have confirmed with Microsoft that these legacy root certificates were supposed to be distrusted back to 2019 – 2021.</p>
<p>And for VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5 was supposed to be distrusted by Microsoft on May 21st 2019.</p>
<p>Here is the DigiCert link for your reference: https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/symantec_root_distrust.html</p>
<p>However, Microsoft remains trusting this Root certificate until Aug 23rd 2023. And distrusted this root certificate yesterday.</p>
<p>So that our customers who are currently using this root certificate and others listed on that page have experienced the same situation.”</p>
<p>Airlock Digital has reached out to Microsoft Security for confirmation of this change and will update this blog post with more information if it becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>There are many lenses through which this change can be viewed. When it comes to SSL certificates this change entirely makes sense, however for file trust this is problematic, as previously signed files can’t simply have the certificate updated on them in the same way websites can. This is likely why Microsoft trusted this root certificate for much longer in Microsoft Windows than browser vendors did.</p>
<p>I’m also surprised at how little noise this change made even within the information security community. It speaks volumes at how little digital signatures are used to proactively enforce the integrity of software at load time within the majority of the ecosystem (again kudos to Intuit).</p>
<p>Microsoft moved quickly on this one without public notification, was there current threat activity associated with this certificate requiring a whole of ecosystem response? or was this just something Microsoft considered to be a non-event? we can only speculate.</p>
<p><strong>Airlock Digital Customer Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Over the coming months Airlock Digital customers may notice an elevated occurrence of files reporting ‘(invalid certificate chains)’ over the coming months, for software that was signed between 2006 – 2017 with revoked certificate chain.</p>
<p>It is recommended that if customers have a need to continue running these files, that in the short term that affected ‘(invalid certificate chain)’ publishers are be trusted within policy to minimise business impact and then convert the trust for affected applications to hash based trust using Airlock Digital’s ‘trusted logging’ feature. The good news here is that modern version of applications will be signed with newer certificates and this will minimise these occurrences long term.</p>
<p>Additionally, many Airlock Digital customers with existing agents may not immediately notice impact from this issue, due to the certificate caching behavior of the Airlock Digital client to improve runtime performance.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/hugging-face-raises-235m-from-investors-including-salesforce-and-nvidia/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/hugging-face-raises-235m-from-investors-including-salesforce-and-nvidia/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37248895">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">As first reported by The Information, then seemingly verified by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on X (formerly known as Twitter), AI startup <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> has raised $235 million in a Series D funding round.</p>
<p>The tranche, which had participation from Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, IBM, Salesforce and Sound Ventures, values Hugging Face at $4.5 billion. That’s double the startup’s valuation from May 2022 and reportedly more than 100 times Hugging Face’s annualized revenue, reflecting the enormous appetite for AI and platforms to support its development.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has raised a total of $395.2 million to date, placing it among the better-funded AI startups in the space. Those ahead of it are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/openai-gpt5-sam-altman/">OpenAI</a> ($11.3 billion), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/anthropic-raises-350m-to-build-next-gen-ai-assistants/">Anthropic</a> ($1.6 billion),&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/inflection-ai-led-by-linkedin-and-deepmind-co-founders-raises-225m-to-transform-computer-human-interactions/">Inflection AI</a> ($1.5 billion), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/ai-startup-cohere-now-valued-at-over-2-1b-raises-270m/">Cohere</a> ($435 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/adept-a-startup-training-ai-to-use-existing-software-and-apis-raises-350m/">Adept</a> ($415 million).</p>
<p>“AI is the new way of building all software. It’s the most important paradigm shift of the decade and, compared to the software shift, it’s going to be bigger because of new capabilities and faster because software paved the way,” co-founder and CEO Clément Delangue told TechCrunch via email. “<span>Hugging Face intends to be the open platform that empowers this paradigm shift.”</span></p>
<p>Delangue, a French entrepreneur, launched Brooklyn-based Hugging Face in 2016 alongside Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf. The trio originally built a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. But after open sourcing the algorithm behind the app, Hugging Face pivoted to focus on creating a platform for creating, testing and deploying machine learning.</p>
<p>Today, Hugging Face offers a number of data science hosting and development tools, including a GitHub-like hub for AI code repositories, models and data sets as well as web apps to demo AI-powered applications. Hugging Face also provides libraries for tasks like data set processing and evaluating models in addition to an enterprise version of the hub that supports software-as-a-service and on-premises deployments.</p>
<p>Hugging Face’s paid functionality includes AutoTrain, which helps to automate the task of training AI models; Inference API, which allows developers to host models without managing the underlying infrastructure; and Infinity, which is designed to increase the speed with which an in-production model processes data.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has 10,000 customers today, it claims, and more than 50,000 organizations on the platform. And its model hub hosts over 1 million repositories.</p>
<p>Contributing to the growth is the strong, sustained interest in AI from the enterprise. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/how-ai-will-impact-businesses-in-2023">According</a> to a HubSpot poll, 43% of business leaders say that they plan to increase their investment in AI and automation tools over the course of 2023, while 31% say AI and automation tools are very important to their overall business strategy.</p>
<p>Much of what Hugging Face delivers falls into MLOps, a category of tools for streamlining the process of taking AI models to production and then maintaining and monitoring them. The MLOps market is substantial in its own right, with one <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-mlops-market">report</a> estimating that it’ll reach $16.61 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>But Hugging Face dabbles in other areas, too.</p>
<p>In 2021, Hugging Face launched BigScience, a volunteer-led project to produce an open source language model as powerful as OpenAI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/openai-brings-fine-tuning-to-gpt-3-5-turbo/">GPT-3</a>, but free and open for anyone to use. It culminated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/a-year-in-the-making-bigsciences-ai-language-model-is-finally-available/">Bloom</a>, a multilingual model that for more than a year has been available to tinker with on Hugging Face’s model hub.</p>
<p>Bloom is but one of several open source models to which Hugging Face has contributed development resources.</p>
<p>Hugging Face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/">collaborated</a> with ServiceNow, the enterprise software company, to release a free code-generating AI model called StarCoder (a follow-up model, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/safecoder">SafeCoder</a>, debuted this week).

It's early afternoon on a blazing July day, and the sky is a perfect canvas of cobalt blue. Though the river is sheltered on either side by towering cliffs and limestone escarpments up to 300m (980ft) high, the sheer irradiating power of the sun has never been more visible to me. Its rays have turned the surface of the water into a winding path of scintillating light, so bright it blinds you to look at it. And I am taking no chances; I have chosen my outfit with the seriousness of an explorer trekking off into the Sahara.</p>
<p>The ensemble, my boyfriend remarks, is "extraordinary" – and he doesn't mean it as a compliment. My arms, hands and torso are completely covered with a long-sleeved top with built-in SPF protection – ordered over the internet from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220321-what-happened-to-the-worlds-ozone-hole">ozone-depleted-Australia</a>, no less – while my head is shaded beneath a floppy fishing hat complete with its own fabric face shield. The final touches are several coatings of high-factor suncream, so my exposed skin has the pallid, sickly glow of titanium-white, and a pair of sunglasses. As my companion delights in telling me at 10-minute intervals, I am dressed like a large baby.</p>
<p>However, my vanity knows no bounds, and I am determined to avoid further sun-related ageing. But could there be other, hidden benefits to these extreme measures? In fact, is it possible that my obsession with maintaining healthy skin is a stroke of accidental genius? The answer to both these questions, it turns out, is yes.</p>
<p>The latest research suggests that our skin is not just a mirror for our lifestyles – reflecting the effects of years of smoking, drinking, sun and stress – and hinting at our inner health. No, in this new upside-down-world, the body's largest organ is an active participant in our physical wellbeing. This is a strange new reality where wrinkles, dry skin and sunspots cause ageing, instead of the other way around.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A strange revelation</strong></p>
<p>In 1958, the same year the US <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/spaceact.html">passed the law</a> that led to the moon landings and the creation of Nasa, another major project was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/63/12/1416/620761">quietly conceived</a>. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study was to be a scientific investigation of ageing with a <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa/history">daring and rather unorthodox premise</a>.</p>
<p>Before then, it had been standard scientific practice to attempt to glean insights into the physiology of living people from donated cadavers – a practise with roots in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/body-snatching">19th Century tradition of graverobbing</a>. But this time, subjects would be scrutinised somewhat earlier, while their hearts were still beating and their bodies were very much alive. The research followed thousands of adult men (and later, women) for decades, to see how their health developed – and how this was affected by their genes and the environment.</p>
<p>Just two decades in, scientists had already made some intriguing breakthroughs, from the discovery that less emotionally stable men were more likely to be <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610738208258393">diagnosed with heart disease</a> to the revelation that our problem-solving abilities <a href="https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/29/6/650/561698">decline only slightly with age</a>.</p>
<p>But one of the most striking findings confirmed what people had long suspected: how youthful you look is an impressively accurate expression <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0277953682900235">of your inner health</a>. By 1982, those men who had been assessed as looking particularly old for their age at the beginning of the study, 20 years earlier, were more likely to be dead.&nbsp; This is backed up by more recent research, which found that, of patients who were judged to look at least 10 years older than they should, 99% had <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-010-1537-0">health problems</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out skin health can be used to predict a number of seemingly unconnected factors, from your <a href="https://eor.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eor/3/8/2058-5241.3.160088.xml">bone density</a> to your risk of developing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31585299">neurodegenerative diseases</a> or dying from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/suppl_1/ehy565.P1548/5080322">cardiovascular disease</a>. However, as the evidence has begun to add up, the story has taken a surprise twist. Is the skin simply a living tally of the damage we have accumulated, or is it more complicated? Could it, in fact, be keeping healthy people healthy – and dragging unhealthy ones down further?</p></div></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjlw"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.jpg" alt="While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Another kind of birthday </strong></p>
<p>There are two main ways to measure a person's age. The first is the standard method, known as chronological age – the kind tracked by revolutions of the sun. But there is also your biological age, which indicates the rate at which you are ageing physically – the maturity of your organs and cells. It can vary wildly between different people and even within the same body.</p>
<p>As we rack up the years, it's common wisdom that our chronological age will eventually catch up with our looks: skin becomes thinner and less even-toned, with lower elasticity, as the cells responsible for producing pigment and collagen die off or become "senescent" – meaning they stop renewing themselves and continue to exist in a kind of dormant state.</p>
<p>But it is the environment that tends to do the real damage. Though ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation can damage our DNA – leading to sunburn, mutations and skin cancer – 95% of the total UV radiation that makes it to the Earth's surface is ultraviolet A (UVA). This portion of the sun's rays has a longer wavelength, which allows it to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01138.x">penetrate deep into the dermis</a> – where it breaks down collagen and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01138.x">stimulates cells to produce melanin</a>.</p>
<p>At the microscopic level, photoaged skin – skin that has been aged by the sun – is thicker, with tangles of misshapen elastin and collagen fibres. At the visible level, it is often irregularly pigmented and significantly more wrinkled. This is true whether you have very light skin which is incapable of tanning, known as type one on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK481857/table/chapter6.t1/" target="_blank">Fitzpatrick scale</a>, or very <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66072249">dark skin</a>, type six, which the scale <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9060139/" target="_blank">inaccurately describes as never burning</a>. Even deeply pigmented skin can burn and is susceptible to photoaging, though it will <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpp.12688" target="_blank">take longer for wrinkles to kick in</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, it's thought that intrinsic factors are responsible for the tiniest fraction of the classic "aged" look, while UV light is responsible for over <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/effect-of-the-sun-on-visible-clinical-signs-of-aging-in-caucasian-skin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID">80% of visible skin changes</a>. If you spent your whole life indoors with the curtains drawn, it's possible that you might not see significant alterations to this organ <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09m2l58">until you reach your 80s</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially though, along with these effects the skin also undergoes a chemical transformation. And it is this that might be having a profound impact on our overall health.</p>
<p><strong>A chemical cocktail</strong></p>
<p>In 2000, at the birth of a new century, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12016-021-08899-6">radical new concept</a> emerged. By observing the way most organisms respond to stress, a group of scientists at the University of&nbsp;Bologna, Italy suggested a new way to think about ageing.</p>
<p>In a young, healthy person, the immune system is routinely deployed to maintain order – patching up damage and shooing off infections. But as we get older, or when we are in poor health, these inflammatory responses can pass a certain critical threshold – a point beyond which they go into overdrive, releasing a cascade of potent chemicals that rampage around the body, destroying healthy cells and mutilating our DNA. Enter "inflammaging" – the simmering backdrop of inflammation that accompanies the ageing process.</p>
<p>This is where the skin comes in. The latest research suggests that wrinkly, diseased, or damaged skin becomes part of this system of inflammation, releasing a chemical cocktail that leads to yet further damage and inflammation. "Chronologically aged skin exhibits higher expression levels of a whole panel of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines," says Mao-Qiang Man, a research scientist at University of California&nbsp;San Francisco, who says that the same is also true for photoaged skin.</p>
<p>Locally, these chemicals degrade collagen and elastin, causing further skin thinning, wrinkles, and reduced elasticity, explains Tuba Musarrat Ansary, a postdoctoral researcher at Jichi Medical University, Japan. "They [also] disrupt the skin's barrier, increasing water loss and susceptibility to stressors," she says. The feedback loop is further compounded by senescent cells in the skin – either created by natural ageing or UV damage – which also release their own inflammatory chemicals.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. As the largest organ in the body, the skin can have a profound impact. The chemicals released by diseased and dysfunctional skin soon enter the bloodstream, where they wash around, damaging other tissues. Amid the ensuing systemic inflammation, chemicals from the skin can reach and harm organs that seem entirely unrelated, including your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211340/#:~:text=CONCLUSION%3A%20Our%20study%20suggests%20that,should%20undergo%20periodic%20follow%2Dup.">heart</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18360#:~:text=Both%20epidermal%20dysfunction%20and%20inflammatory,the%20development%20of%20cognitive%20dysfunction.">brain</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjsk"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.jpg" alt="People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images" id=""></picture><div><p>People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p>The result is accelerated ageing, and a higher risk of developing the majority of – <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(22)00806-3">or possibly even all</a> – related disorders. So far, aged or diseased skin has been linked to the onset of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211340/#:~:text=CONCLUSION%3A%20Our%20study%20suggests%20that,should%20undergo%20periodic%20follow%2Dup.">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-022-00997-6">type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18360#:~:text=Both%20epidermal%20dysfunction%20and%20inflammatory,the%20development%20of%20cognitive%20dysfunction.">cognitive impairment</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8554316/">Alzheimer's</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5352163/">Parkinson's</a> disease.</p>
<p>Though we're all familiar with the risks of smoking, drinking, overeating and a lack of exercise, you might argue that poor skin health is the elephant in the room – the one factor that we all routinely overlook. The good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>A matter of moisture</strong></p>
<p>The first step to protecting skin – and therefore, this new theory suggests, overall health – is to stay out of the sun. The most famous method is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220321-what-happened-to-the-worlds-ozone-hole">"Slip, Slop, Slap," protocol, first launched in Australia in 1981.</a> Today it has been expanded to include five central tenets: slip on a t-shirt [and ideally, other protective clothing], slop on high-factor suncream, slap on a wide-brimmed hat, slide on some sunglasses, and seek shade from the sun.</p>
<p>Plus, if the relationship between skin damage and age-related diseases isn't compelling enough to convince people to whip out their fishing hats and suncream, there are two very good reasons to try it. The first is that protecting your skin from the sun is extremely effective at preventing the visible signs of ageing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one early study, those who wore a broad-spectrum SPF15 suncream every day for four and a half years did not show any signs of further skin <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/">ageing during this period</a>. That's despite the fact that this low factor typically protects you from sunburn for just <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32749634">15 times longer than it would take to happen without it</a> –&nbsp; so if your skin would usually start to redden in 10 minutes, you should be able to stay in the sun <a href="https://www.americanskin.org/resource/safety.php">for just 150 minutes</a> (two and a half hours).</p>
<p>Moreover, the suncream in the experiment did not specify the level of protection against UVA radiation, the kind that leads to skin ageing. In most parts of the world, to be classified as broad-spectrum, products must demonstrate that they not only absorb or reflect UVB radiation (indicated by the SPF rating), but also UVA. However, the degree to which they achieve this varies substantially. Dermatologists recommend that you always check the label for the UVA rating too, which is usually indicated by <a href="https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(17)30812-5/fulltext">UV-PF or PPD</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second reason is that there is strong evidence suncream can prevent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6852040/">most of the inflammation</a> that occurs when the skin is exposed to the sun – the first step towards developing age-related diseases.</p>
<p>But this is not the only way to keep your skin in good condition. In fact, by far the easiest way to improve the health of this organ is to moisturise. And there is direct evidence that this does <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">reduce inflammation</a> – and that it <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">may help to prevent dementia</a>.</p>
<p>Along with an uneven skin tone and wrinkles, both chronologically and photoaged skin is significantly drier. The humidity levels of human skin peak in the <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/102946/text">40th year of life</a>, after which they plummet, producing lower and lower quantities of its natural moisturisers – lipids, filaggrin, sebum and glycerol. This is a problem, because dehydrated skin is less effective as a barrier between the insides of our bodies and the outside world. When our skin is desiccated and flaky, its usual tasks – of keeping out infectious agents, environmental toxins, and allergens, while keeping in moisture – become significantly more challenging.</p></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjgr"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.jpg" alt="Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>However, adding moisture back is not particularly complicated, whatever <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/moisturizers-do-they-work">cosmetics adverts seem to suggest</a>. And in the field of ageing, this simple intervention is showing remarkable results.</p>
<p>In one study, an international team of researchers – including Man – asked older volunteers to apply a topical moisturiser twice a day for one month. Compared to older participants who had not received any treatment, the subjects' skin was significantly restored, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">lower levels of three different classes of inflammatory chemicals</a>.</p>
<p>These promising results were quickly followed up with another study by the same team, which involved treating adults over 65 years old with a moisturising cream twice a day for three years. The participants' cognitive functioning was measured at the beginning and end of the study – and after three years, though the control group had declined significantly, those who had been hydrating their skin <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442543/">had not deteriorated</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Decreased stratum corneum hydration levels [those in the outer layer of the epidermis] are likely the major contributor to inflammaging," says Man, who explains that because dry skin tends to have higher levels of inflammation, it can feel itchy. And if you yield to the scratching impulse – you guessed it – the inflammation gets worse.</p>
<p>But, Man says, many natural ingredients can help. These include glycerol, petrolatum, hyaluronic acid and lipids that would usually be found in this layer of the skin – normal constituents of even the most basic moisturisers.</p>
<p>It's possible that simply drinking more water might also help to hydrate the skin, though the evidence is murky – some studies suggest there is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620753/">not yet any support for this</a>, while others <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA445751725&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=11787015&amp;p=HRCA&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E79b13aff&amp;aty=open-web-entry">claim it can help</a>. It also hasn't been directly studied as a way to prevent inflammation or related diseases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To visualise the extent to which the skin is able to affect the rest of your body, it helps to think about just how much of it you have – then remember that, as you would expect, all the skin you can see on the outside of your body is matched by the exact same <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9655929/">surface area on the inside</a>. And when your skin is damaged, every inch is capable of releasing toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>So, protecting your skin from the sun really does pay off – but don't forget the moisturiser either. Please excuse me while I fetch my SPF50+, sunglasses, sun umbrella and most outrageously silly fishing hat… I have some gardening to do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<article id="post-39152">
	<div>
		<p>Today, we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.</p>
<p>We believe an open approach to AI is best for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe and responsible, so we’re releasing Code Llama for both research and commercial use under the same <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE">community license as Llama 2</a>.</p>
<p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">Llama 2</a> that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence”). It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more.</p>
<p>We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.</p>
<p>The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.</p>
<p>We also further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Python is a language specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation, and because Python and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/">PyTorch</a> play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a natural language instruction input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what people expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama – Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama – Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.</p>
<p>Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks. We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples’ lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues and fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Code Llama is designed to support software engineers in all sectors — including research, industry, open source projects, NGOs and businesses. But there are still many more use cases to support. We hope Code Llama will inspire others to leverage Llama 2 to create new innovative tools for research and commercial products.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37248781">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.72.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p>
<p>If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.72.0 with:</p>
<pre><code>rustup update stable
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it already, you can <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html">get <code>rustup</code></a> from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.72.0">detailed release notes for 1.72.0</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (<code>rustup default beta</code>) or the nightly channel (<code>rustup default nightly</code>). Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p>
<h2>What's in 1.72.0 stable</h2>
<h3>Rust reports potentially useful <code>cfg</code>-disabled items in errors</h3>
<p>You can conditionally enable Rust code using <code>cfg</code>, such as to provide certain
functions only with certain crate features, or only on particular platforms.
Previously, items disabled in this way would be effectively invisible to the
compiler. Now, though, the compiler will remember the name and <code>cfg</code> conditions
of those items, so it can report (for example) if a function you tried to call
is unavailable because you need to enable a crate feature.</p>
<pre><code>   Compiling my-project v0.1.0 (/tmp/my-project)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rustix::io_uring`
   --&gt; src/main.rs:1:5
    |
1   | use rustix::io_uring;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `io_uring` in the root
    |
note: found an item that was configured out
   --&gt; /home/username/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/rustix-0.38.8/src/lib.rs:213:9
    |
213 | pub mod io_uring;
    |         ^^^^^^^^
    = note: the item is gated behind the `io_uring` feature

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0432`.
error: could not compile `my-project` (bin "my-project") due to previous error
</code></pre>
<h3>Const evaluation time is now unlimited</h3>
<p>To prevent user-provided const evaluation from getting into a compile-time
infinite loop or otherwise taking unbounded time at compile time, Rust
previously limited the maximum number of <em>statements</em> run as part of any given
constant evaluation. However, especially creative Rust code could hit these
limits and produce a compiler error. Worse, whether code hit the limit could
vary wildly based on libraries invoked by the user; if a library you invoked
split a statement into two within one of its functions, your code could then
fail to compile.</p>
<p>Now, you can do an unlimited amount of const evaluation at compile time. To
avoid having long compilations without feedback, the compiler will always emit
a message after your compile-time code has been running for a while, and repeat
that message after a period that doubles each time. By default, the compiler
will also emit a deny-by-default lint (<code>const_eval_long_running</code>) after a large
number of steps to catch infinite loops, but you can
<code>allow(const_eval_long_running)</code> to permit especially long const evaluation.</p>
<h3>Uplifted lints from Clippy</h3>
<p>Several lints from Clippy have been pulled into <code>rustc</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#undropped_manually_drops"><code>clippy::undropped_manually_drops</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#undropped-manually-drops"><code>undropped_manually_drops</code></a> (deny)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ManuallyDrop</code> does not drop its inner value, so calling <code>std::mem::drop</code> on it does nothing. Instead, the lint will suggest <code>ManuallyDrop::into_inner</code> first, or you may use the unsafe <code>ManuallyDrop::drop</code> to run the destructor in-place. This lint is denied by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#invalid_utf8_in_unchecked"><code>clippy::invalid_utf8_in_unchecked</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8-unchecked"><code>invalid_from_utf8_unchecked</code></a> (deny) and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8"><code>invalid_from_utf8</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>The first checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which violates their safety pre-conditions, resulting in undefined behavior. This lint is denied by default.</li>
<li>The second checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which will always return an error. This lint is a warning by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cmp_nan"><code>clippy::cmp_nan</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-nan-comparisons"><code>invalid_nan_comparisons</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for comparisons with <code>f32::NAN</code> or <code>f64::NAN</code> as one of the operands. NaN does not compare meaningfully to anything – not even itself – so those comparisons are always false. This lint is a warning by default, and will suggest calling the <code>is_nan()</code> method instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cast_ref_to_mut"><code>clippy::cast_ref_to_mut</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/allowed-by-default.html#invalid-reference-casting"><code>invalid_reference_casting</code></a> (allow)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for casts of <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>&amp;mut T</code> without using interior mutability, which is immediate undefined behavior, even if the reference is unused. This lint is currently allowed by default due to potential false positives, but it is planned to be denied by default in 1.73 after implementation improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stabilized APIs</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#impl-Sync-for-Sender%3CT%3E"><code>impl&lt;T: Send&gt; Sync for mpsc::Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#impl-TryFrom%3C%26'a+OsStr%3E-for-%26'a+str"><code>impl TryFrom&lt;&amp;OsStr&gt; for &amp;str</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc/string/struct.String.html#method.leak"><code>String::leak</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These APIs are now stable in const contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::from_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes"><code>CStr::to_bytes</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::to_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_str"><code>CStr::to_str</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>Check out everything that changed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.72.0">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-172-2023-08-24">Cargo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-172">Clippy</a>.</p>
<h3>Future Windows compatibility</h3>
<p>In a future release we're planning to increase the minimum supported Windows version to 10. The accepted proposal in compiler <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/651">MCP 651</a> is that Rust 1.75 will be the last to officially support Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. When Rust 1.76 is released in February 2024, only Windows 10 and later will be supported as tier-1 targets. This change will apply both as a host compiler and as a compilation target.</p>
<h2>Contributors to 1.72.0</h2>
<p>Many people came together to create Rust 1.72.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.72.0/">Thanks!</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms
such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary
advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as
an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices,
and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach
enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling
the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback
loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on
different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT,
while simultaneously reducing costs by &gt;31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible
with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new
prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking
or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on code tasks, and has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for current developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.</p><p>The generative AI space is evolving rapidly, and we believe an open approach to today’s AI is the best one for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe, and responsible. We are releasing Code Llama <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">under the same community license as Llama 2</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><p>How Code Llama works</p><div><p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Llama 2</a> that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities, built on top of Llama 2. It can generate code, and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence.”) It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular languages being used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, and Bash (see our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a> for a full list).</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369652058_690162392972818_1173984281354057457_n.gif?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=UFuYmatCAJsAX8yovDh&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfALpbcW05Wqbhwosmlid229VVNSd2_PJuhvW3U9OCKp_A&amp;oe=64EC4B53" alt="" id="u_0_d_xm"></p></div><div><p>We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.</p><p>The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369628374_974402950309179_3355223640107296330_n.gif?_nc_cat=108&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=A-qWWtKKzL4AX_oOxM_&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfABownM2MT-UMjaMYDaSVl3FTyacEnyJyNjiU66d9FDSw&amp;oe=64ECA3CD" alt="" id="u_0_e_rn"></p></div><div><p>The Code Llama models provide stable generations with up to 100,000 tokens of context. All models are trained on sequences of 16,000 tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100,000 tokens.</p><p>Aside from being a prerequisite for generating longer programs, having longer input sequences unlocks exciting new use cases for a code LLM. For example, users can provide the model with more context from their codebase to make the generations more relevant. It also helps in debugging scenarios in larger codebases, where staying on top of all code related to a concrete issue can be challenging for developers. When developers are faced with debugging a large chunk of code they can pass the entire length of the code into the model.</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369634634_298372716122486_560769700771259146_n.gif?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=A7xtUs6ybWgAX_8hEcb&amp;_nc_oc=AQnxvzRZhxLtzLc6idATxr2z_oz24NxZc1fwagRajF63ewHg-tFQJu49FPw1nIV8d1E&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDl0JuHS8zkFkvnqWmlTdCQpyet_Fn2CwjodeCJZZTcxA&amp;oe=64ECDA4B" alt="" id="u_0_f_jw"></p></div><div><p>Additionally, we have further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama - Python and Code Llama - Instruct.</p><p>Code Llama - Python is a language-specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation – and because Python and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">PyTorch</a> play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.</p><p>Code Llama - Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a “natural language instruction” input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what humans expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama - Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama - Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.</p><p>We do not recommend using Code Llama or Code Llama - Python to perform general natural language tasks since neither of these models are designed to follow natural language instructions. Code Llama is specialized for code-specific tasks and isn’t appropriate as a foundation model for other tasks.</p><p>When using the Code Llama models, users must abide by our license and acceptable use policy.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369637790_316524720760615_7953912471035352291_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=Cf6CASObRMAAX9zGhod&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDYqs0HPqm8b8U5YaT7T6CXKWBZC_lF_rBjJvLLxBYYeg&amp;oe=64ED1DBB" alt="" id="u_0_g_5p"></p><p>Evaluating Code Llama’s performance</p><div><p>To test Code Llama’s performance against existing solutions, we used two popular coding benchmarks: <a href="https://github.com/openai/human-eval" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">HumanEval</a> and Mostly Basic Python Programming (<a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">MBPP</a>). HumanEval tests the model’s ability to complete code based on docstrings and MBPP tests the model’s ability to write code based on a description.</p><p>Our benchmark testing showed that Code Llama performed better than open-source, code-specific LLMs and outperformed Llama 2. Code Llama 34B, for example, scored 53.7% on HumanEval and 56.2% on MBPP, the highest compared with other state-of-the-art open solutions, and on par with ChatGPT.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369682932_681515836750953_6337320211215231153_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=ySlliu2C--QAX8yjDPM&amp;_nc_oc=AQkqR8IwnCfw2ThomqZCGvJFPgtE-VQEQ3WcNcTU08iQtcW0HbYPFnYvNtrcuEHI_Xw&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfA_by6dLH0oojnJAfYQ44RJjBQjw9m1t9iyap4PMEooDA&amp;oe=64EC98CF" alt="" id="u_0_h_WH"></p><div><p>As with all cutting edge technology, Code Llama comes with risks. Building AI models responsibly is crucial, and we undertook numerous safety measures before releasing Code Llama. As part of our red teaming efforts, we ran a quantitative evaluation of Code Llama’s risk of generating malicious code. We created prompts that attempted to solicit malicious code with clear intent and scored Code Llama’s responses to those prompts against ChatGPT’s (GPT3.5 Turbo). Our results found that Code Llama answered with safer responses.</p><p>Details about our red teaming efforts from domain experts in responsible AI, offensive security engineering, malware development, and software engineering are available in our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a>.</p></div><p>Releasing Code Llama</p><div><p>Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks, ranging from writing new software to debugging existing code. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient, so they can focus on the most human centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks.</p><p>At Meta, we believe that AI models, but LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples' lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues, and fix vulnerabilities.</p><p>Code Llama’s training recipes are available on our <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Github repository</a>.</p><p><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Model weights</a> are also available.</p></div><p>Responsible use</p><div><p>Our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a> discloses details of Code Llama’s development as well as how we conducted our benchmarking tests. It also provides more information into the model’s limitations, known challenges we encountered, mitigations we’ve taken, and future challenges we intend to investigate.</p><p>We’ve also updated our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Responsible Use Guide</a> and it includes guidance on developing downstream models responsibly, including:</p><ul><li>Defining content policies and mitigations.</li><li>Preparing data.</li><li>Fine-tuning the model.</li><li>Evaluating and improving performance.</li><li>Addressing input- and output-level risks.</li><li>Building transparency and reporting mechanisms in user interactions.</li></ul><p>Developers should evaluate their models using code-specific evaluation benchmarks and perform safety studies on code-specific use cases such as generating malware, computer viruses, or malicious code.

Even well structured codebases are mostly composed of code which is not worth reading.<p>The difference in a well structured codebase is that some of the code prevents you from having to read huge amounts of other code.  All code is bad, it starts out bad just by existing, it's only redeeming quality is preventing you from having to deal with more bad code.</p><p>Everyone thinks they write good "clean" code, and it's never true.  Good programmers are good because of the architecture of their code, not because a single excerpt of code in isolation looks a certain way.</p><p>What you really want to read about are good designs.  Read APIs, models, concepts, schemas, etc.</p><p>Another comment mentioned the Go standard library, and I totally agree.  But stop at the APIs, if you look inside, you'll see that it's also mostly garbage. It's good because the APIs are good, and you don't have to read the rest.

I'm sure people vary, but I've got loads more out of open source contributions to sometimes small projects, and not very much out of trying to do something like read the code for the Glasgow Haskel Compiler or something.</p><p>So for code to read, I think <i>having an in</i> is crucial, at least for me. So I'd say, find a cool, maybe small open source project, look at the issue tracker if it has one, and try to implement something. You'll only really know if it's good code (or why) after you start trying to change it.

For instance,  instead of learning a new programming language,  you should learn how programming languages are made.  Most of the secrets that computer science majors know that you probably don't were learned in compilers class.<p>(Unfortunately many people are chasing the Holy Grail of "functional programming" and never finding it because "functional programming" is a pale shadow of what's possible when you understand how compilers work:  this is how Common LISP and scheme are so much more profound then,  say,  Haskell)</p><p>It's a little out of date but I was lately thinking up about the Scott Adams adventure games of the early 1980s that were written with a specialized interpreter which could be implemented in BASIC but was also implemented in assembly language for better performance.

The thing is that GOTO becomes quite benign and even useful when it is used to implement interpreters.</p><p>So back in the day you would study systems like that to stretch your skills,  today I would look at compilers and related technology,  like the Jena rules engine.

I switched over to the Jena Rules engine</p><p><a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/</a></p><p>which still emits lousy error messages but I quickly was able to understand everything about the Jena Rules Engine,  get really good at writing extensions,  and use it for things the developers said were unsupported such as using it as the control plane of a data processing engine that bridged stream and batch processing:  I'd use Jena rules to control the process of setting up and tearing down reactive streams that would do a data processing job.  That is,  I got good at the Jena Rules Engine that I kept discovering new things I could do with it.</p><p>Clara is very similar to the legendary CLIPS rule engine from the golden age of ai</p><p><a href="https://www.clipsrules.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.clipsrules.net/</a></p><p>and if you find Clara is too small to understand,  CLIPS is even smaller.  The massive reduction in code size comes from being able to lean on the affordances of LISP to develop a DSL for writing rules,  if you have to write a parser and all the stuff that comes with defining an external DSL rules language your code starts to get much more complex.</p><p>Jena Rules Engine is written in Java and I think it is very nice code and you'll learn a lot about RETE engines and other advanced programming concepts by studying it,  you might even get more out of it than you get out of Clara.  It was common at the tail end of the golden age of A.I. for people to write a first draft of a system in Common Lisp and then end up re-writing in it C++ for performance.  Many of the ideas you get out of Lisp programming apply just well to other programming languages but require a huge amount of elbow grease and in-depth understanding of compiler technology whereas you can frequently use macros and similar affordances in Lisp to implement very sophisticated ideas with postage stamp size coded (that granted many people find challenging to understand.)

I stupidly decided to do it in TeX. The stupidity here was that (a) the only laser printer on campus was in another building and (b) the TeXBook didn't exist yet. All I had was a listing of a late prerelease of the Web source of TeX, along with some of Knuth's writings about TeX77, which was a substantially different system. I managed to do it, including formatting much of the manual in the style of Unix man pages (the environment itself lasted for several years, until mainframe timesharing for students went away for good). When I finally got my hands on the TeXBook, I found that I had learned much about TeX, including a few things that weren't so :).<p>Knuth's programming style is highly idiosyncratic, and there are many points with which I'd disagree. Furthermore, the choice of Pascal required all sorts of strange compromises. That said, I highly commend reading the source of TeX, to see how a brilliant computer scientist attacked a problem that is not nicely structured, using very restricted programming tools. You will not get much that you can copy into your programs, but it is an excellent, well-documented attack on an interesting and complex problem. (By the way, Knuth's TeX was written long before modern typesetting things like Unicode, PDF, and OTF fonts; you don't want to use Knuth's TeX for modern work; I use LuaTeX. But Knuth's version remains as a useful subject of study.)</p><p>Another good thing to study is Lions's commentary on Unix V6. This is interesting  because it shows many of Unix's key abstractions implemented in a few thousand lines of code.

The worst code bases I have seen have been the ones with no code plans at all, and the ones that use Clean Code and Gang of Four like a bible, both are equally mazes of spaghetti. Clean Code I really just don't agree with, and I think this author lays it out well. Special design patterns and tons of polymorphism usually end up creating multiples of complexity in the effort to reduce DRY at any cost (and often are abstractions that are only ever used one or two times anyways).<p>Ultimately I think the single most important rule for clean code is: skinny controller, fat model. If you are doing batch data, then this applies still I think. You should have all of the logic you can in the model, avoid data objects. And the code paths that alter things should be as thin as possible. I honestly think it is better to have a 5k line model if it avoids more.</p><p>The most unlcean code I have seen usually falls into the abstracted out processes in financial instutitons where they follow Clean Code advice and everything are a bunch of functions passing around some big fat objects full of getters and setters, and changing any functionality means adding changes somewhere in the process to check state and alter the state, which leads to loops and if statements everywhere to see which account type it is at each point etc.</p><p>But in OOP programming its supposed to be objects sending messages to each other. Every object should know everything about <i>itself</i>, which is what a fat model demands. Any more abstraction than that seems to get in the way.

If you just go to 'good code' how do you know what 'bad' looks like?  Also to your point what is 'good code' can be very subjective.  I have one language I use a decent amount.  There is a particular style that many use that they consider 'good code'.  I think it is a terrible bit of style to do.  I have my reasons for it.  But good/bad is not necessarily a metric you can measure.<p>I would posit that discarding github out of hand is not a great start.  Pick one of the big projects on there and follow what is pushed in.  You will notice how others interact with the code.  You will start to notice who checks in good stuff.  Follow them.  Also pick your language.  As a good style there could be a bad style in another for example C++ vs Python.  Python styles in C++ would drive the C++ guys nuts and the other way around.

<p>18th May 2023</p>
<p>The Logic Lab provides a selection of 12 logic gates that you can interconnect with patch cables to make a variety of different logic circuits, for experimenting with and learning about logic:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclabcables.jpg" alt="LogicLabCables.jpg" width="675" height="450"></p>
<p><em>The Logic Lab allows you to experiment with logic gates by interconnecting them with patch cables.</em></p>
<p>You can enter inputs using switches, and display the outputs on five coloured LEDs. The whole Logic Lab is implemented using a single AVR128DA48 (or ATmega4809) microprocessor and a few LEDs and other passive components, with a total parts cost of under £20 or $25.</p>
<p>I've included nine logic problems that you can try solving with the help of the Logic Lab.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I originally decided to build this for a friend's son who was interested in learning about logic gates, and I thought he would enjoy having something that he could use for practical experiments. I had a design in mind, and searched to see if anything similar already existed; the closest I found was a kit developed by the University of Southampton in the UK <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but it wasn't commercially available.</p>
<p>My first idea was to use 74LVC series logic gates, which are individual logic gates in small surface-mount packages. The nice thing about this is that each drawing of a logic gate on the PCB would be implemented by a single gate.</p>
<p>However, I then thought about using the Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) in the AVR DA-series microcontrollers, which allows you to configure three-input gates that work independently of the processor. The advantage would be that you could reconfigure the selection of gates in software, without needing to resolder the board. However, even the largest 64-pin devices only provide six logic gates, and in the 48-pin packages it seems that only five of these are actually available on I/O pins.</p>
<p>My final design used an ATmega4809 or AVR128DA48 microcontroller, but simulating the gates by polling the inputs, and setting the outputs accordingly, using truth tables stored in the program. With a 48-pin package it would be possible to emulate at least 12 gates of different types, which would be ample for the design I had in mind. This approach would allow you to change the selection of gates available by uploading a new version of the software, and then making stickers to show the new gate symbols.</p>
<p>Even though the logic gates are simulated using a microcontroller, the only detectable difference is the propagation delay. You can even create an oscillator by connecting the output of one of the inverters back to its input.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Logic Lab has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 logic gates: two AND, two NAND, two OR, two NOR, two XOR, and two inverters.</li>
<li>Four slider switches, S1 to S4, with LEDs to show the status, that can provide logic inputs to the gates.</li>
<li>Five coloured LEDs, L1 to L5, that can display the state of the output from a logic circuit. The top three are red, orange, and green, allowing simulation of traffic lights.</li>
<li>Two busses, J1 and J2, that can be used to link patch cables together.</li>
<li>It is powered by two AAA batteries, with an on/off switch and power indicator LED.</li>
<li>The inputs and outputs are connected to header pins, so you can interconnect them with a set of patch cables terminated in header sockets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logic problems</h3>
<p>Here are nine sample logic problems that you can try solving with the Logic Lab. These can each be solved using the twelve gates in the Logic Lab. I've given an approximate difficulty rating out of 100 for each problem.</p>
<p>For the answers to the problems see <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?4FO5">Logic Lab Problem Answers</a>.</p>
<h4>Traffic lights (20%)</h4>
<p>Traffic lights (in the UK) go through the following sequence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Red and Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Design a logic circuit that lights the red, orange, and green LEDs according to that sequence of switches.</p>
<h4>Exclusive-OR (30%)</h4>
<p>Two of the gates in the logic lab are exclusive-OR, or XOR, gates; their output is '1' if either of the inputs is '1', but not both.</p>
<p>Design an&nbsp;exclusive-OR&nbsp;gate without using the XOR gates, by using a combination of the other gates in the Logic Lab.</p>
<h4>Safety switch (40%)</h4>
<p>A school has a fire warning light that lights up in every classroom. To avoid it being accidentally switched on it has four switches, all of which need to be turned on before the warning will light up.</p>
<p>Design a logic circuit that implements this: the red LED, representing the warning, should only turn on if all switches are set to '1'.</p>
<h4><span>Palindrome checker (40%)</span></h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights the green LED if the four switches are set to a binary number that's a palindrome, such as '1001', and the red LED if it's not a palindrome, like '1011'.</p>
<h4>Hotel light switches (60%)</h4>
<p>In a hotel four rooms are on the same corridor, and there's one light in the middle of the corridor. There's a switch outside each room that can be used to control the light.</p>
<p>Design a circuit that allows each of the four switches S1 to S4 to turn the light L5 on or off.</p>
<h4>Binary decoder (70%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights up just one of the four LEDs L1 to L4 for each of the different possible settings of switches S1 and S2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Majority vote (80%)</h4>
<p>When the secret spy club needs to vote on an issue, the three members each have a button that they press to register their vote. If there is a majority vote, the issue is passed.</p>
<p>Use three switches to represent the votes, and design a circuit that will light the green LED if the majority vote '1', or the red LED if they don't.</p>
<h4>Combination switch (90%)</h4>
<p>You have a drawer with an electronic lock, and it can only be opened if you set the correct password on four switches. Design a logic circuit that allows you to choose any of the 16 possible passwords, such as '1011', by changing the position of four patch leads. The circuit should then only light up the green LED if you set the correct password on the switches.</p>
<h4>Binary adder (100%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that will add together two 2-digit binary numbers, and put the answer in binary on the three LEDs L3 to L5.</p>
<p>The first number should be on S1 (high bit) and S2 (low bit), and the second number should be on S3 (high bit) and S4 (low bit). The answer should be on L3 (high bit), L4 (middle bit), and L5 (low bit).</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the full circuit of the Logic Lab:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" alt="LogicLab.gif" width="720" height="264"></a></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Logic Lab, based on an AVR128DA48 or ATmega4809 processor.<br> Click to open a larger version in a new window.</em></p>
<p>There is quite a wide choice of pin-compatible microcontrollers you can use for this project, which should help while many of the most popular parts are still out of stock at time of writing.&nbsp;I built two prototypes, one with an AVR128DA48, and one with the older ATmega4809 which is pin compatible, and their performance was indistinguishable. The program only uses about 1500 bytes, so an ATmega809, ATmega1609, or ATmega3209 should be fine. Likewise, an AVR32DA48 or AVR64DA48 should be fine, or the equivalent AVR32DB parts.</p>
<p>I used 0.1" pitch header pins for the inputs and outputs, and patch leads terminated in header sockets. The advantage of this is that you can buy the header pins in long strips, and then cut them down to the lengths you need; the header sockets are more difficult to divide up.</p>
<p>The five output LEDs are 5mm diffused through-hole LEDs in five different colours. In my first prototype, shown in the photographs, I used a white LED, but found that because white has a higher forward voltage than the other colours, if you connect both white and one of the other LEDs to the same output the white is much dimmer. I therefore replaced white with yellow to avoid the problem.</p>
<p>The other LEDs and resistors are 0805 size SMD types.</p>
<p>The circuit is powered by two 1.5V AAA batteries in series, mounted in through-hole battery clips on the back of the board. Alternatively you could use two PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;which fit in the same mounting holes.</p>
<h4>Short-circuit protection</h4>
<p>The board includes 100Ω current limiting resistors on every output, so if the user inadvertently connects together two outputs at different logic levels, the current will be 3/(100 + 100) or 15mA, which is well within the 50mA per output maximum given on the data sheet.</p>
<h4>Unconnected inputs</h4>
<p>Unconnected inputs are treated as being at logic-level '0'. This is implemented by a 10kΩ pull-down resistor on every input.</p>
<p>If you prefer to have unconnected inputs at logic level '1' (like TTL) you can omit these resistors, and turn on the internal pullup resistors by configuring the inputs as&nbsp;<strong>INPUT_PULLUP</strong> in <strong>setup()</strong>.</p>
<h4>Patch cables</h4>
<p>To use the Logic Lab you'll need a set of at least 20 jumper wires terminated in header sockets. I recommend 150mm long cables; either ribbon cables that you can separate to create a set of jumper wires&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, or slightly more expensive separate cables&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>► Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed a PCB in Eagle and ordered boards from Elecrow <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. The board is 100 x 140mm, using a double-sided PCB. I also created a design for a back panel and ordered this in 2mm thick transparent acrylic <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>. I give links at the end of the article so you can order your own boards.</p>
<p>The only standard I could find for drawing the logic symbols was a USA Department of Defense document from 1962, which describes how to draw them from arcs of circles&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my first attempt at designing the PCB I assigned the logic gate inputs to the microcontroller ports in a systematic way, with all the AND and NAND gate inputs on one port, all the OR and NOR gate inputs to another port, and so on. However, the layout was a nightmare, and I needed a lot of vias to make it work. I decided to have a second attempt simply choosing the nearest I/O pin to each gate input or output, with the idea that I could sort out in software, and I managed to lay it out much more neatly with no vias.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to the assignment of I/O pins to the gate inputs and outputs:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logicgatepins.gif" alt="LogicGatePins.gif" width="392" height="261"></p>
<p>My recommended sequence for assembling the board is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solder the microcontroller on the back of the board using a hot air gun.</li>
<li>Solder the SMD resistors and capacitors to the back of the board, and the SMD LEDs to the front of the board, using the hot air gun.</li>
<li>Fit the the header pins to the front of the board with a conventional soldering iron.</li>
<li>Mount the switches and 5mm LEDs with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Fit the three-pin header socket on the back of the board with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Finally, fit the battery holders with a soldering iron, using a generous amount of solder to hold them firmly in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the SMD components I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 300°C.</p>
<p>When fitting the header pins I did them a column at a time, and found it helpful to push them into something like a 1x36 header socket <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, to keep them correctly aligned and vertical.</p>
<p>When mounting the battery clips I found I had to enlarge the mounting holes with a 2mm drill to get the clips to fit. You won't need to do this if you use the PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>The back of the Logic Lab PCB, showing the ATmega4809 processor and battery holders.</em></p>
<p>I mounted the&nbsp;transparent acrylic back panel with 15mm nylon pillars <sup id="cite_ref10"><a href="#cite_note10">[10]</a></sup> and M3 6mm nylon screws <sup id="cite_ref11"><a href="#cite_note11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>For each gate the program simply reads the inputs, and sets the output according to the truth table for the logic gate.</p>
<p>I thought about using interrupts, but I decided to go with the simpler approach of repeatedly stepping through the gates, processing them in sequence. The program doesn't have anything else to do, so there's no need for interrupts.</p>
<h4>Truth tables</h4>
<p>The truth table for each of the different gate types is defined by an enum:</p>
<pre>enum truthtable_t: uint8_t { AND = 0b1000, NAND = 0b0111,  OR = 0b1110, 
                             NOR = 0b0001,  XOR = 0b0110, NOT = 0b0011 };</pre>
<h4>Logic gate definitions</h4>
<p>The definition of each gate is a struct, <strong>gate_t</strong>:</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
  int inputa;
  int inputb;
  int output;
  truthtable_t truthtable;
} gate_t;</pre>
<p>This defines the pin numbers used for the two inputs and the output, the value to be output, and the type of logic gate.</p>
<p>Here are the definitions of the 12 gates in the Logic Lab:</p>
<pre>gate_t gates[12] = {
  { PIN_PC1, PIN_PC0, PIN_PC5, AND },
  { PIN_PB5, PIN_PB4, PIN_PC4, AND },
  { PIN_PB1, PIN_PB0, PIN_PA3, NAND },
  { PIN_PA6, PIN_PA7, PIN_PA2, NAND },
  { PIN_PC7, PIN_PC6, PIN_PD2, OR },
  { PIN_PC3, PIN_PC2, PIN_PD3, OR },
  { PIN_PA5, PIN_PA4, PIN_PF2, NOR },
  { PIN_PA1, PIN_PA0, PIN_PF3, NOR },
  { PIN_PD4, PIN_PD5, PIN_PE0, XOR },
  { PIN_PD6, PIN_PD7, PIN_PE1, XOR },
  { PIN_PF0, PIN_PF0, PIN_PE2, NOT },
  { PIN_PF1, PIN_PF1, PIN_PE3, NOT },
};</pre>
<p>For simplicity I define the NOT gate as a two input gate where both inputs are the same pin.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change the type of a gate simply change its <strong>truthtable</strong> value in this table. For example, you could change all the two-input gates into NAND gates by changing their definitions to <strong>NAND</strong>, or you could add some XNOR gates by also defining them in <strong>truthtable_t</strong>.</p>
<h4>Configuring the outputs</h4>
<p>In <strong>setup()</strong> the appropriate I/O pins are configured as outputs:</p>
<pre>void setup () {
  // Set outputs
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    pinMode(gates[i].output, OUTPUT);
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Processing the gates</h4>
<p>Finally in&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong>&nbsp;we repeatedly scan through each gate, read the inputs, and set the output according to the gate's truth table:</p>
<pre>void loop () {
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    gate_t gate = gates[i];
    bool ina = digitalRead(gate.inputa);
    bool inb = digitalRead(gate.inputb);
    int val = ina &lt;&lt; 1 | inb;
    bool out = (gate.truthtable &gt;&gt; val) &amp; 1;
    digitalWrite(gate.output, out);
  }
}</pre>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>
<h3>Compiling the program</h3>
<h4>AVR128DA48</h4>
<p>If you're using an AVR128DA48, or anything from the AVR32DA48 or AVR32DB48 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;Spence Konde's <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore" target="_blank">Dx Core</a> on GitHub (I used 1.5.3). Choose the&nbsp;<strong>AVR DA-series (no bootloader)</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>AVR DB-series (no bootloader)</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>DxCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong> menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Chip: "</strong><strong>AVR128DA49</strong><strong>"</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>"</strong><strong>AVR128DB48</strong><strong>"</strong><br><strong>Clock Speed: "4 MHz internal"</strong></p>
<p>Then upload the program to the processor on the breadboard using a UPDI programmer connected to the GND, +5V, and UPDI pins.</p>
<p>The recommended option is to use a USB to Serial board, such as the SparkFun FTDI Basic board&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref12"><a href="#cite_note12">[12]</a></sup>, or a USB to Serial cable <sup id="cite_ref13"><a href="#cite_note13">[13]</a></sup>, connected with&nbsp;a 4.7kΩ resistor as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/serialupdiprogrammer.gif" alt="SerialUPDIProgrammer.gif" width="395" height="147"></p>
<ul>
<li>Set&nbsp;<strong>Programmer</strong>&nbsp;to the first of the&nbsp;<strong>"SerialUPDI - 230400 baud"</strong> options.</li>
<li>Select the USB port corresponding to the USB to Serial board in the <strong>Port</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Upload</strong> from the Arduino IDE <strong>Tools</strong> menu to upload the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a clock speed of 4MHz reduces the processor power consumption from 4.7mA to 1.1mA.</p>
<h4>ATmega4809</h4>
<p>If you're using an ATmega4809, or anything from the ATmega809 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;MCUdude's&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX" target="_blank">MegaCoreX</a>&nbsp;on GitHub. Choose the&nbsp;<strong>ATmega4809</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>MegaCoreX</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Clock: "Internal 4 MHz</strong><strong>"<br>BOD: "BOD disabled"</strong><br><strong>Pinout: "48 pin standard"</strong></p>
<p>On the ATmega4809, choosing a clock speed of 4MHz ensures that the processor will run down to the minimum voltage of 1.8V, for maximum battery life.</p>
<p>Then upload the program using&nbsp;a USB to Serial board, as described above.&nbsp;See the MegaCoreX documentation for further details.</p>

It's fun to see the diversity of ways people sync/backup their Obsidian files. The nice thing about storing all your notes on your device is that it makes it possible to move and edit your Markdown files in many different ways. That diversity of solutions is what makes the ecosystem of Markdown tools resilient over the long term.</p><p>There are already a handful of tools that allow you to sync your notes for free, including Git, Syncthing, and some other options more specialized for Obsidian (see community plugins).</p><p>Obsidian is a small company, we're not VC backed (100% user-supported), so the Sync pricing helps us stay in business and keep the lights on. We also have a 40% educational discount on all our services[1] so you could be paying $4.80 instead of $8 :)</p><p>Reverse engineering things is a fun technical challenge, and also helps us find potential holes in our system. The main problems I see with your solution is 1. it could easily break in a future update to the app, 2. "Obsidian Sync" is a trademark, so you should consider renaming the repo otherwise it can be confused for an official tool — that would be my only request</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Education+and+non-profit+discount" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Education+and+...</a>

I guess you're trying to replace the API/backend similar to Vaultwarden does with BitWarden paid service.</p><p>For me, its not that I can't afford $8 a month, its just that $8 is to me fairly steep for basic file storage and sync I get for free from some services. $12 a year would be a fair price to me. I get some of it goes to support Obsidian development, but still seems steep, $2-3 a month would be something I'd subscribe for.

With Roam, basically any word in your note could immediately link to another note, and you could see backlinks in your notes prominently.</p><p>However, Roam was both expensive and online-only, so when Obsidian came out and it was: a) polished, b) provided most of the functionality of Roam, and c) was offline and plain-text (also unlike Notion), it was an immediate hit.</p><p>The other special feature Obsidian offered was easy and powerful customization. The major settings are actually core plugins that can be enabled or disabled (like daily journal, tagging, or slideshows). Plugins and themes are easily discovered and installed from inside the app, which has led to a vibrant and popular plugin community. All you need is one plugin to be indispensable for users to never leave.

      <h2 id="welcome-to-jacobin-jvm">Welcome to Jacobin JVM</h2>

<p>Jacobin is an implementation of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/">JVM specification for Java 17</a>. It is written entirely in Go with no dependencies.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide a more-than-minimal implementation of the JVM that can run most class files and JARs and deliver the same results as the OpenJDK-based JVMs (that is, the majority of JVM implementations today). A paramount consideration in the design and implementation of Jacobin is the codebase: making it cohesive and containing clear code. The cohesiveness, extensive commenting, and large test suite enable professionals who want to know more about how the JVM works to find the information quickly and in an easily accessible setting. Additional information on the <a href="https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin/wiki/Jacobin-Documentation-Home">Jacobin wiki</a> provides more background and insight. Because Jacobin is strictly a JVM, its code is tightly focused on Java program execution. An important factor in reducing the size of the codebase and executable is that Jacobin relies on Go’s built-in memory management to perform garbage collection, and so it contains no GC code.</p>

<p>Due to our desire for an utterly reliable product, Jacobin is heavily tested during development. As of February 2023, the test code is 231% the size of the production code and consists of more than 400 tests. We’re committed to increasing these numbers. When Jacobin advances some more, we intend to run the OpenJDK test suites against it.</p>

<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>

<p>The current status is shown <a href="https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin">here</a>. Updates are also posted in realtime on the <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobin_jvm">Jacobin Twitter account</a>.There are currently no packaged releases of Jacobin available (although you can always compile the code). We’ll issue releases when Jacobin is mature enough to run classes as expected.</p>

<p>At present, all tasks and defects are logged in an instance of JetBrains’ <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack</a> (kindly provided at no cost). The task numbers appear at the start of the comment for every commit and push. The GitHub ‘issues’ facility is used strictly for issues posted by users. This design allows users to find solutions without needing to dig through numerous unrelated matters.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For almost a complete decade—starting with discovering Haskell in about 2009 and right up until switching to a job where I used primarily Ruby and C++ in about 2019—I would have called myself first and foremost a Haskell programmer.</p>

<p>Not necessarily a dogmatic Haskeller! I was—and still am—proudly a polyglot who bounces between languages depending on the needs of the project. However, Haskell was my default language for new projects, and in the absence of strongly compelling reasons to use other languages I would push for Haskell. I used it for command-line tools, for web services, for graphical applications, for little scripts…</p>

<p>At this point, though, I think of my Haskell days as effectively behind me. I haven't aggressively sworn it off—this isn't a “Haskell is dead to me!” piece—but it's no longer my default language even for personal projects, and I certainly wouldn't deliberately seek out “a job in Haskell” in the same way I once did.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to talk about why <em>I</em> fell away from Haskell. I should say up front: <strong>this is a piece about why I left Haskell, and not about why you should.</strong> I don't think people are wrong for using Haskell, or that Haskell is bad. In fact, if I've written this piece the way I hope to write it, I would hope that people read it and come away with a desire to maybe learn Haskell themselves!</p>

<h2 id="what-drew-me-to-haskell">What drew me to Haskell?</h2>

<p>The absolute biggest pull for me, when first coming to Haskell, wasn't monads or DSLs or even types. The biggest pull was the ability to reason about code symbolically and algebraically.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, that might sound like some pretentious nonsense. Bear with me.</p>

<p>The idea here is that certain transformations in Haskell are always correct, which allows you to reason about code in a mechanical but powerful way. A simple example: in Haskell, we can look at a function call and replace it by the body of that function. Say, if we have a function <code>double n = n + n</code>, and we call it with some expression <code>x</code>, we can replace <code>double x</code> with <code>x + x</code> no matter what <code>x</code> is.</p>

<p>This property isn't true in <em>most</em> other programming languages! For example, in many imperative languages, this transformation will fail if we call <code>double</code> with <code>i++</code> for some variable <code>i</code>: the reason is that <code>i++</code> modifies the value of <code>i</code>, so <code>double(i++)</code> (which increments <code>i</code> once) will of course produce a different value than <code>(i++) + (i++)</code> (which increments <code>i</code> twice.)</p>

<p>“So what?” you might ask, and that's fair. However, this starts to be <em>very</em> appealing in that certain ways of changing your code are always going to be mechanically correct. This is <em>unbelievably</em> liberating. There's a kind of fearless refactoring that it enables, where certain mechanical transformations, each easily verified as correct, can be stacked on top of each other to do wild but ultimately safe changes to your code overall. Doing large refactorings in, say, a Ruby codebase can be <em>deeply</em> harrowing, while doing large refactorings in a Haskell codebase can be a complete breeze.</p>

<p>Or, as the mathematician Hermann Weyl once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>We now come to the decisive step of mathematical abstraction: we forget what the symbols stand for. ...[The mathematician] need not be idle; there are many operations which he may carry out with these symbols, without ever having to look at the things they stand for.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This same approach—forgetting what the code means and yet still being able to transform it in productive and powerful ways—is possible with Haskell more than with any other language I've used<sup id="fnref:abstr"><a href="#fn:abstr" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, the other big pull for Haskell is the type system. There's a lot to be said about the totality of modern Haskell's type system, but the core Haskell language strikes a spectacular balance between having a strict type system without it being <em>too</em> noisy or restrictive. Type inference means that most types are implicit in the code, making the process of writing types significantly less onerous than in something like Java, and the flexibility and convenience of typeclasses means that even when you need to think about the types, they're often not <em>too</em> fussy (compared to, say, OCaml's requirement that you use different versions of the arithmetic operators for integers and floats.) At the same time, the fact that the type system can sometimes get in your way is part of the reason <em>for</em> using Haskell.</p>

<p>I would describe good Haskell code as “brittle”, and I mean that as a compliment. People tend to casually use “brittle” to mean “prone to breakage”, but in materials science what “brittle” means is that something breaks <em>without bending</em>: when a brittle material reaches the limits of its strength, it fractures instead of deforming. Haskell is a language where abstractions do not “bend” (or permit invalid programs) but rather “break” (fail to compile) in the face of problems.</p>

<p>And that's often what you want! For example, Haskell has a <code>NonEmpty</code> type which represents a list which is guaranteed to contain at least one element. Operations on <code>NonEmpty</code> which preserve the same length (like modifying each element with <code>map</code>) or which are guaranteed to add to the length (like combining two <code>NonEmpty</code> lists with <code>append</code>) will return <code>NonEmpty</code>. Other operations which reduce the number of elements potentially to zero, like using <code>filter</code> to remove items that match a predicate, will return a plain list, since there's no guarantee they <em>will</em> be non-empty! In other programming languages, you might informally say, “I know that this thing will always have at least one element,” but in Haskell, it is idiomatic to express this directly in the type system and have the compiler double-check your logic.</p>

<p>So if you have a program where you need to supply, say, a <code>NonEmpty</code> list of file paths to examine, then you <em>can't</em> just pass the command-line args to this function directly, because those might be empty: you <em>must</em> check that they're not empty first and handle the empty case accordingly. If I later on add a filtering step, only keeping the files with a relevant file extension, then I <em>must</em> check for an empty resulting list, because I literally <em>cannot</em> accidentally pass an empty list to the function. This program is “brittle” because it can fail to compile in the face of changes which aren't safe, which is <em>incredibly</em> powerful<sup id="fnref:diach"><a href="#fn:diach" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Over time, writing Haskell means you start building programs in a way that maintains program invariants using types so that the compiler can double-check them. Sometimes people take that to mean stuff like type-level computation, but “express invariants using types” can be much simpler. It can mean something as simple as wrapper types for strings to represent whether they've been SQL-escaped, so that your web API gives you a <code>RawString</code> but your database abstraction only accepts <code>SanitizedString</code> and you can't accidentally introduce a code path which forgets to sanitize it. It can mean converting a surface representation filled with <code>Maybe</code> fields and turning it to an internal representation where information is guaranteed to exist. It can mean something being <em>just</em> generic enough to test in isolation.</p>

<p>And Haskell's other strength is that the language itself is malleable and powerful, which enables terse domain-specific languages without things like macros. Some of the code I'm the proudest of in Haskell has been simple domain specific languages: an example is my <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/config-ini" rel="nofollow">config-ini</a> library, a library for working with INI configuration files. Instead of setting up an imperative interface to convey how to parse an INI file into your application-specific configuration, you set up a <em>declarative</em> interface that maps specific parts of your configuration type (via lenses) to specific parts of the structure of an INI file, which in turn lets you use that interface to do reading, writing, and diff-minimal update<sup id="fnref:upd"><a href="#fn:upd" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>. This is accomplished with a simple monadic DSL:</p>

<pre><code>configParser :: IniSpec Config ()
configParser = do
  section "NETWORK" $ do
    cfHost .=  field "host" string
    cfPort .=  field "port" number
  section "LOCAL" $ do
    cfUser .=? field "user"
</code></pre>

<p>DSLs aren't the right choice for everything, but they can be a powerful tool when applied correctly, and Haskell also minimizes the amount of “magic” necessary to make them work. Unlike the elaborate dynamic metaprogramming which powers DSLs in something like Ruby, the features which power DSLs in Haskell are often just flexible syntax and the ability to overload things like monads. Some Ruby DSLs are “infectious”, since you need to do global monkeypatching to enable constructs like <code>2.days.ago</code>, but Haskell DSLs are often easy to scope to specific files or areas of code and can be clean in their implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, I think a related but understated strength of Haskell is just how natural it makes working with higher-order functions. This is partly syntax, partly semantics, and partly a good synergy between the two. I don't want to overstate the importance of syntax, but I think the fact that you can write <code>(+)</code> in Haskell and that means “a function which takes two numeric arguments and adds them” lets you gravitate towards that rather than other constructs. What's a function to pairwise multiply two lists in Haskell? It's simple:</p>

<pre><code>pairwiseSum = zipWith (*)
</code></pre>

<p>What's the equivalent in Ruby, a language which does have blocks and often permits some aggressive code golfing? It's still terser than, say, Java, but still much less so than the Haskell:</p>

<pre><code># assuming at least Ruby 2.7 for the block syntax
def pairwise_sum(xs, ys)
  xs.zip(ys).map {_1*_2}
end
</code></pre>

<p>I once heard it said that Haskell lets you work with functions the way Perl lets you work with strings. Lots of Haskell idioms, like monads, are perfectly expressible in other languages: Haskell just makes them feel natural, while writing a monad in many other languages feels like you have to do lots of busy-work.</p>

<h2 id="what-pushed-me-away-from-haskell">What pushed me away from Haskell?</h2>

<p>If I had to choose the three big factors that contributed to my gradual loss of interest in Haskell, they were these:</p>
<ul><li>the <strong>stylistic neophilia</strong> that celebrates esoteric code but makes maintenance a chore</li>
<li>the <strong>awkward tooling</strong> that makes working with Haskell in a day-to-day sense clunkier</li>
<li>the <strong>constant changes</strong> that require sporadic but persistent attention and cause regular breakages</li></ul>

<p>What do I mean by <strong>stylistic neophilia</strong> here? The Haskell community, as a whole, is constantly experimenting with and building new abstractions. Some of these are borrowed from abstract algebra or category theory, and permit abstract manipulation of various problem domains, while others result from pushing more computation to the type level in order restrict more invalid states and allow the compiler to enforce more specific invariants.</p>

<p>I think these are cool and I'm happy people are doing them! I'm glad that people are experimenting with things like, say, <a href="https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">expressing web APIs at the type level</a> or <a href="https://arthurxavierx.github.io/RealWorldAppComonadicUI.pdf" rel="nofollow">using comonads to express menu systems</a>. These push at the very boundaries of how to express code and address problem domains in radical new ways, bringing unexpected advantages and giving programmers new levels of expressiveness.</p>

<p>I also… don't really want to deal with them on a day-to-day basis. My personal experience has been that very often these sort-of-experimental approaches, while solving some issues, tend to cause many more issues than is apparent at first. An experience I've had <em>several</em> times throughout my Haskell-writing days—both in personal and professional code—is that we'll start with a fancy envelope-pushing approach, see some early advantages, and then eventually tear it out once we discover that the disadvantages have grown large enough that the approach was a net drag on our productivity.</p>

<p>A good concrete example here is a compiler project I was involved in where our first implementation had AST nodes which used a type parameter to represent their expression types: in effect, this made it impossible to produce a syntax tree with a type error, because if we attempted this, our compiler itself wouldn't compile. This approach <em>did</em> catch a few bugs as we were first writing the compiler! It also made many optimization passes into labyrinthine messes whenever they didn't strictly adhere to the typing discipline that we wanted: masses of casts and lots of work attempting to appease the compiler for what should have been simple rewrites. In that project, we eventually removed the type parameter from the AST, because we'd probably have run out of budget if we finished the compiler <em>and</em> appeased GHC every time we tried to write an optimization.</p>

<p>This wasn't an isolated incident: I'd say that in three-quarters of the projects I worked on where we tried a “fancy types” approach, we ended up finding them not worth it. It's also not just me: the entire <a href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/" rel="nofollow">Simple Haskell</a> movement<sup id="fnref:simple"><a href="#fn:simple" rel="nofollow">4</a></sup> is predicated on the idea that you get the most benefits out of the language by eschewing the fancier experimental features and sticking to minimal extensions.</p>

<p>And yet, fancier type features are pervasive in the broader community. New libraries are often designed around the fancier features, and there's even a cottage industry of alternative takes on the standard library that try to embed more complicated type features directly into the basic operations of the language. This also informs the direction of the language: you start getting into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756" rel="nofollow">linear types</a> and even <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/dependent-haskell" rel="nofollow">a Haskell-ey take on dependent types</a>, and then those start creeping into libraries you might use, as well.</p>

<p>It can also be an uphill battle to hold the line against these fancier type explorations! As my friend and fellow Haskell programmer Trevor once said, <a href="https://twitter.com/moltarx/status/1004401148415991808" rel="nofollow">“The road to hell is paved with well-intentioned GADT usage.”</a> Many of these fancily-typed constructs <em>are</em> appealing and do bring some advantages, and many of the disadvantages are delayed. Often, these features make things difficult to change or maintain, which means it can be weeks or months or even years before the drawbacks become fully apparent. And on various occasions, I've replaced complicatedly-typed abstractions with much simplified versions, only to see subsequent programmers notice the lack of fancy types<sup id="fnref:io"><a href="#fn:io" rel="nofollow">5</a></sup> and try to replace those simple abstractions with various kinds of cutting-edge type-level abstractions, only to see the code blow up in size, drop in performance, and lose much of its readability.</p>

<p>As I said before, I don't fault people for exploring these idioms, and it's not impossible to find examples that <em>do</em> end up pulling their weight. (Using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/11/trees-that-grow.pdf" rel="nofollow">data structures indexed by compiler phase</a> is a good example of a “fancy type-level feature” that I've found remarkably useful in the past.) But keeping up with all of it is alienating and exhausting, and at some point, it wasn't a stretch for me to look at the celebration of type-level exploration and the amount of work it took to keep it <em>away</em> from the code I was writing and consequently think, “Do I really belong here?”</p>

<p>The <strong>awkward tooling</strong> is something that I think is sort of obvious if you've tried writing Haskell for any length of time. We've got multiple standard-ish build systems including <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/" rel="nofollow">Cabal</a> and <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/" rel="nofollow">Stack</a> (and I'm led to believe that <a href="https://rules-haskell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>rules_haskell</code> for Bazel</a> is decent now although I haven't tried it), as well as linters like <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint" rel="nofollow">hlint</a>, editor integrations like <a href="https://github.com/jyp/dante" rel="nofollow">Dante</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" rel="nofollow">Haskell Language Server</a>, autoformatters like <a href="https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany/" rel="nofollow">brittany</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tweag/ormolu" rel="nofollow">ormolu</a>…</p>

<p>All these tools are, well, fine, or at least fine-ish. They usually do what they need to. I am quite confident I have never <em>loved</em> any of them: at best, they did what they needed to do with minimal hassle (which has been my experience with, for example, <code>ormolu</code>) and at worst they've had constant bugs and required regular workarounds but more or less got the job done. It's quite possible that things have changed drastically since I was more involved in Haskell, but during the decade that I was, tooling certainly improved<sup id="fnref:impr"><a href="#fn:impr" rel="nofollow">6</a></sup> but never really shined.</p>

<p>A big problem is the perpetual Not-Invented-Here where people constantly try to build the newest, best thing. This isn't at all unique to Haskell—in fact, complaints about Haskell build systems look petty next to Python's Hieronymous Bosch-esque ecosystem of build tools and environment managers—but it's still frustrating to see people constantly trying to reinvent every little detail (down to the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpack" rel="nofollow">textual format for Haskell packages</a>, one thing I'm reasonably convinced they got perfectly right<sup id="fnref:hpack"><a href="#fn:hpack" rel="nofollow">7</a></sup>) and then leaving it about 95% finished for years.</p>

<p>And if I'm spending my working day with a language, I want the tooling to be <em>great</em>. I want it to be something I can celebrate, something I can brag about. I think <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" rel="nofollow">Rust's cargo</a> is such a tool: I regularly find things about it that are <em>great</em>, and add-ons that make it even better. At least as of 2019 when I was last writing Haskell, there was no Haskell tool that came even close to Cargo's ease-of-use and stability.</p>

<p>Again, I don't think Haskell tools are abysmal, they're just… fine. And at this point, I think my bar for tools has gotten higher than “just fine”.</p>

<p>Finally, I mentioned the <strong>constant changes</strong>, by which I mean the way that the Haskell language itself undergoes regular backwards-incompatible revisions. This has been going for a long time: I mean, just look at this joke I tweeted back in 2015, in response to the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldable_Traversable_In_Prelude" rel="nofollow">Foldable-Traversable Prelude changes</a>, sometimes at the time also called the “Burning Bridges Proposal”.</p>

<p>The way that Haskell-the-language evolves—well, the way that GHC evolves, which is <em>de facto</em> Haskell since it's the only reasonable public<sup id="fnref:public"><a href="#fn:public" rel="nofollow">8</a></sup> implementation—is that it gradually moves to correct its past missteps and inconsistencies even in pretty fundamental parts of the language or standard libraries. This is in many ways good: there's an attitude in some communities that past mistakes are unfortunate but we need to live with them. People in the Haskell community often reject this idea: why not improve things? Why not fix what we see as clunky mistakes in the standard library? These changes move the foundations of Haskell towards a cleaner and more consistent set of primitives, making it a better language overall.</p>

<p>But oh my god they're <em>annoying</em>.</p>

<p>Very few of the changes are particularly onerous—indeed, they often are accompanied by analyses which show that only such-and-such a fraction of Hackage projects will be affected by them—but they all amount to persistent friction. If I grab an old Haskell project, even one without <em>any</em> external dependencies, I can often safely assume that it won't build any more with any recent version of GHC because everything has been changed just a little tiny bit. The fixes are often tiny, but they add up. Things are always just a little different than they used to be, just different enough that they require your attention: adding a superclass there, removing an import there, adding a type signature since this thing turned just polymorphic enough that the code is ambiguous…</p>

<p>And you know what? It <em>doesn't have to be like this</em>. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2052" rel="nofollow">Look at the way Rust does updates with epochs</a>. The Rust language explicitly builds in contracts of backwards-compatibility: if you use things that are stable, then they won't intentionally break. Intentional breaking changes are hidden behind epochs. I've got old Rust projects which I can return to and continue to build and develop without similar tedium from the language itself.</p>

<p>I think there's a common thread between these three things I mentioned: none of them, especially in isolation, are so painful that you can't just deal with them. You <em>can</em> write Haskell without fancy type features, evaluating the worthwhile ones and holding the line against the costly ones. You <em>can</em> use Haskell's perfectly alright tooling if you don't mind the occasional bug or missing feature or clunky workflow. You <em>can</em> follow compiler changelogs and do sporadic codebase updates every other release cycle. They're bumps in the road, but you've still got a road: if the destination is worth it, what's a few bumps?</p>

<p>I still think Haskell is a great language. The only thing that changed is my tolerance for the bumps.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-still-miss-from-haskell">What do I still miss from Haskell?</h2>

<p>All the stuff I said about Haskell above? All that still holds and I genuinely think it's true. I miss being able to write and refactor code algebraically: even when writing Rust, a language which I very much like and which has a <em>lot</em> of the same strengths as Haskell, I miss the ability to do small mechanical refactorings and know that I'm maintaining the meaning of the program.<sup id="fnref:refact"><a href="#fn:refact" rel="nofollow">9</a></sup></p>

<p>And the type-system, too! It's true that other languages have developed more sophisticated type systems—mainstream languages in 2023 have a <em>lot</em> more you can do with static types than they did in 2009—but Haskell's type system still has features that others typically lack, even without the whole menagerie of extensions: abstracting over higher-kinded types is an obvious example here.</p>

<p>The Haskell library ecosystem is a real mixed bag—from the typical half-maintained churn of open source libraries to the weird little kingdoms of individual authors trying to reinvent the universe in their own image to the entire tedious gamut of sadly-necessary-but-all-different string-like types—but there are some pretty spectacular libraries and abstractions in Haskell that are only half-possible in other languages. Lenses, for example, are really cool in a way that's hard to grasp if you haven't used them much. I look forward to seeing them poorly half-implemented in mainstream languages in the 2030's.</p>

<p>Haskell libraries also are often declarative by necessity, but those APIs end up being a pleasure to use: a favorite example here is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick" rel="nofollow">the Brick terminal UI library</a>, whose simple declarative building blocks end up producing by far the best TUI library I've ever used, but the diagram-creation library <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams" rel="nofollow">diagrams</a> or the music-writing library <a href="https://music-suite.github.io/docs/ref/" rel="nofollow">music-suite</a> are other great examples. In these cases, there's often nothing preventing similar libraries from existing in other languages, but they tend to get built in Haskell first by pure functional necessity.</p>

<p>A thing that seems small, but which I miss a ton, is <code>do</code>-notation. Or, well, I don't care as much about <code>do</code> notation specifically as “any notation which lets you add more bindings without adding indentation for each level of binding”, which Haskell lets you do with both <code>do</code>-notation and with terse lambda syntax and optional operators. There are many abstractions—monadic and not—where nesting lambdas <em>would</em> be a convenient way of expressing APIs, but in most languages nesting callbacks like this ends up being a big ugly hassle of rightward drift. Consider this Ruby usage of <code>flat_map</code> to come up with a list of possible ice cream servings, where each additional axis adds yet another layer of indentation:</p>

<pre><code>def all_flavors =
  [:vanilla, :chocolate, :strawberry].flat_map do |flavor|
    [:cone, :cup].flat_map do |container|
      [:sprinkles, :nuts, :fudge].flat_map do |topping|
        ["a #{container} of #{flavor} ice cream with #{topping} on top"]
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent Haskell here?</p>

<pre><code>allFlavors :: [String]
allFlavors = do
  flavor &lt;- ["vanilla", "chocolate", "strawberry"]
  container &lt;- ["cone", "cup"]
  topping &lt;- ["sprinkles", "nuts", "fudge"]
  pure ("a " &lt;&gt; container &lt;&gt; " of " &lt;&gt; flavor &lt;&gt;
        " ice cream with " &lt;&gt; topping &lt;&gt; "on top")
</code></pre>

<p>…yes, I know this is a cartoon example. However, there are plenty of places where having Haskell's sugar can be <em>incredibly</em> powerful. You can, for example, build a convenient and good-looking library for <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>-style structured concurrency on top of <code>do</code>-notation by yourself in an afternoon, while most other mainstream languages had to deal with vicious bikeshedding for years before finally coming up with a halfway-usable <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax<sup id="fnref:async"><a href="#fn:async" rel="nofollow">10</a></sup>, to say nothing of the ability to trivially embed <a href="https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/software-transactional-memory.html" rel="nofollow">concurrent transactions</a> or <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/PFP_JFP06.pdf" rel="nofollow">probabilistic programs</a> in Haskell code using the exact same lightweight sugar.</p>

<p>So when I say say that I've fallen out of love with Haskell, it is <em>definitely</em> not because there's nothing in Haskell to love!</p>

<h2 id="so-should-i-use-haskell-or-not">So should I use Haskell or not?</h2>

<p>Regardless of what programming language you're talking about, there is always a single correct response to the question, “Should I learn or use this programming language?” And that answer is, “It ultimately depends on your goals.”</p>

<p>Are you trying to become a better programmer in general? Then yes, absolutely, learn Haskell! I think this article should make it clear that Haskell is a fascinating and powerful language, and I think the learning experience is <em>more</em> than worth it. Haskell made me a better programmer, and I will continue to think so even if I never write another line of Haskell in my life<sup id="fnref:scargot"><a href="#fn:scargot" rel="nofollow">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Are you trying to <em>use</em> it for something? Well, my answer is more restrained, but I don't think the answer is a clear “no”. I think you should be honest about the advantages you get from Haskell—and those advantages are real!—and weigh them against your personal or organizational tolerance for the bumps I've described. I know for a fact that it's not impossible to either individually or as a group get enough benefit out of Haskell that the paper-cuts I've described stay just that: tiny paper-cuts. I know this both because I've worked at such organizations, because I've <em>been</em> such a person, and have many friends who remain Haskell people even as I've drifted away from it.</p>

<p>However, if you pressed me further for a commitment to a yes-or-no answer, my answer would be: no, don't use Haskell. If I were tasked with building an engineering organization, I'd personally stay away from establishing Haskell as the default language, because I know both the value of good tooling and the cost of bad tooling, and I'd rather find a language where I could offer programmers some of the best tooling with a stable language and a clear code ecosystem right away. But even then, I'm not 100% confident in that answer: after all, Haskell does offer some remarkable tools for program safety and correctness, and suffering through poor tooling and linting against unnecessary type families <em>might</em>—maybe, in the right contexts—be worth it for that extra safety<sup id="fnref:glib"><a href="#fn:glib" rel="nofollow">12</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It's kind of a bittersweet conclusion! I'm incredibly happy for the time I've spent learning and writing Haskell, and I think the world would be worse if Haskell wasn't in it. And in all honesty, I think part of the value we get out of Haskell is <em>because</em> of—and not in spite of—some of the rough edges above. I'm glad that people experiment with type system features I don't want to use, because with effort and research and time (and no small amount of obtuse error messages) those features will become the powerful type system features of tomorrow that underlie safer, more expressive, more powerful tools and languages! This, after all, is why Haskell's old motto was “Avoid success at all costs.”</p>

<p>It's just not for me any more.</p>

The combination of strict schema, ACID transactions, and strong integrity makes it still the best storage choice for many apps even today. Although sounding unfathomable and dull, database systems have been a highly vibrant domain in the past few years. Many talents are devoted to it, open source projects are created one after another, companies have been striving to build profitable businesses, and VCs have been making bets on those who look like the next unicorns.</p><p id="122f">Under the flourishing surface, the new generation of modern SQL databases is renovating this 50-year-old technology and gradually reshaping how we use it to build web applications — what we do with it, how we manage it, and how we program against it. This series of articles tries to explore this topic from multiple fronts, including:</p><ul><li id="9046">Serverless &amp; Edge</li><li id="9496">Programmability</li><li id="0cc5">Integration with Development Flow</li><li id="7e97">AI Capabilities</li></ul><p id="8a51">Let’s talk about “Serverless” and “Edge-Ready” today.</p></div><div><p id="0a81">“Serverless” is a broad term and can mean many different things in different contexts. It generally means a system manages itself (doesn’t require low-level operations) and automatically scales resources up and down based on needs. More specifically, for databases, you don’t need to worry about version upgrades, security patching, backup &amp; restore, monitoring, failover, etc. The system is resilient and appears to have an elastic amount of computation power and storage capacity.</p><p id="1a34">Besides the simplicity of operation, serverless databases also differ in their cost model. Since there’re “no servers” anymore, you end up paying for the “logical” usage instead of physical hardware. Beware, this doesn’t necessarily mean a reduction in overall cost, though.</p><p id="1ada">Serverless databases are not a new thing. AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Aurora</a> back in 2017, and since then, cloud-native database services have allowed developers to provision, configure, and scale their databases all via APIs without caring about the underlying infrastructure details. However, the new challengers, like <a href="https://planetscale.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PlanetScale</a> and <a href="https://neon.tech/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Neon</a>, are pushing the “serverless-ness” to a new level, and some of the improvements have made them a much more natural fit into the “moving to the edge” architecture trend.</p><p id="931c">Let’s see how.</p><h2 id="ac27">Connection Pooling</h2><p id="a619">One of the top headaches of using SQL databases is hitting its connection limit. Connections are heavy-weighted database constructs — each comes with a non-trivial cost of allocating memory reservations for sessions, transactions, etc. Traditionally, developers have two choices to deal with it. One is to do connection pooling on the application side (either with application code or with the help of frameworks). It requires careful planning of the pool sizing, and the application code also needs to avoid holding a connection for an extended period of time when processing requests (usually due to long-running transactions), as it may result in the exhaustion of the pool. The other choice is to use tools like <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pgbouncer</a> to put a proxy in front of the database, which internally manages a pool of connections. The downside is obvious, too — you have one more service to operate.</p><p id="6093">The connection pool management problem is not so bad in a traditional app hosting environment with long-running Node.js processes serving client requests. However, it can become prohibitive in edge environments because, for every incoming request, a new runtime is spawned to serve it, creating a new database connection. Such high-frequency churning can very quickly degrade the performance of a database.</p><p id="a80b">The new generation of databases is baking connection pooling into their systems, so you don’t need to worry about it anymore. PlanetScale, thanks to the support from underlying Vitess, proudly announced that they’d tested one million concurrent connections in a real-world environment.</p><p id="8faa">Neon, the latest Postgres hoster, has a built-in pgbouncer service, and you can simply use the “pool-enabled” connection string to leverage it.</p><h2 id="538e">Edge-Ready Drivers</h2><p id="d6f6">Regarding supporting connections from the edge, having connection pooling only solves half of the problem. The other half is unsophisticated — many edge environments don’t support making arbitrary TCP outbound connections; only HTTP(s) and WebSocket are allowed. Most SQL databases use a custom TCP-based network protocol. It means you can’t connect to them from the edge at all. You can probably use an HTTP → TCP proxy to tunnel the traffic or an API wrapping service like PostgREST to make it (partly) work, but they’re either brittle or result in unnecessary performance costs.</p><p id="b512">Things have been changing fast. PlanetScale announced its “Fetch API-compatible” database driver a few months ago, making it fully useable from Vercel Edge Runtime and Cloudflare Workers. Neon also <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/serverless-driver-for-postgres" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">released an edge-ready driver</a> by the end of 2022, allowing you to query with HTTP fetch (best for single-shot queries) or WebSocket (for sessions and transactions).</p><p id="c52b">On a separate spectrum, <a href="https://prisma.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Prisma</a> — the most popular Node.js ORM, also opened its “Accelerate” service (previously known as Data Proxy) to everyone (still in the Preview stage) a few days ago. Among all its features, one of its key offerings is acting as a managed proxy in front of traditional databases and making them “edge ready” by providing built-in connection pooling and exposing HTTP-based endpoints. The only change you need to make is using a new connection string, and your entire code base stays the same.</p><h2 id="7ba6">Separation of Compute and Storage</h2><p id="4bc4">Another fascinating progress in the serverless SQL database world is the separation of “Compute” and “Storage”. Yes, I’m explicitly talking about Neon here since it was the first to pioneer the concept and did it exceptionally well.</p><p id="340c">You may argue that it’s not a new thing. With AWS RDS, if you use EBS as storage, your Compute and Storage are already “separated”. However, it’s important to mention that the RDS scenario is “physical separation”. What Neon did was “logical separation” — Compute and Storage are distinct components at the architecture level, and this has enabled many interesting new capabilities.</p><figure><figcaption>By <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/architecture-overview" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neon.tech</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a28a">There’re some apparent benefits of this architectural choice:</p><ul><li id="b44e"><strong>Independent scaling<br></strong>Compute can be independently scaled up and down, even to zero. For workloads with different characteristics, you can allocate dedicated Compute endpoints and scale them independently while, underlyingly, they share the same unified storage.</li><li id="e430"><strong>Effortless branching<br></strong>Neon’s storage system uses a non-overwriting format, meaning that writes are stored as delta, and historical data can be preserved for as long a period of time as needed. It makes it very cheap to create “branches” for your databases (for the same reason why branching in GIT is cheap) and assign separate compute endpoints to them. How is that useful? For every feature branch, you can branch your database together with source code for development and testing. Isn’t that a very cool thing?</li></ul><p id="89a5">It is an excellent example of a complete rethinking of what a “serverless” database can mean!</p><h2 id="c799">Storing on The Edge</h2><p id="68a2">A big dilemma of “moving to the edge” is that although the computation happens close to the user, the data it needs to fetch still resides in data centers. The slow fetching process can largely cancel the performance gain and sometimes result in a negative net improvement. It’s all because data is not stored on the edge. Or can they?</p><p id="716d"><a href="https://turso.tech/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Turso</a> is an interesting new database service that wraps SQLite into a cloud database distributed directly on the edge for both Storage and Compute. SQLite has a very low footprint and is an ideal choice to run on the commodity hardware of edge nodes. The idea is to replicate entire databases from a central primary location to a selected set of edge regions (hosted by Fly.io). It provides the best possible performance for the end users because Compute and Storage are colocated close to the user.</p><p id="296c">Of course, the benefit doesn’t come without a downside. Turso is essentially a globally distributed single-write multi-read database. All writes must be made to a central primary instance and replicated to edge nodes. Before the replication completes, readers can see inconsistent results.

<p>United States Patent 3,216,423 APPARATUS FGR FACJILITATING THE BIRTH 9F A CHILD BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE George B. Blonsky and Charlotte E. Blonsky, both of 2440 Sedgwick Ave., New York 68, N.Y. Filed Jan. 15, 1963, Ser. No. 251,516 14 Claims. (Cl. 128361) The present invention relates to apparatus which utilizes centrifugal force to facilitate the birth of a child at less stress to the mother. </p>
<p> It is known, that due to natural anatomical conditions, the fetus needs the application of considerable propelling force to enable it to push aside the constricting vaginal walls, to overcome the friction of the uteral and vaginal surfaces and to counteract the atmospheric pressure opposing the emergence of the child. In the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, as is common with all more primitive peoples, nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case, however, with more civilized Women who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement. </p>
<p> It is the primary purpose of the present invention to provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts. </p>
<p> In accordance with the invention, there is provided rotatable apparatus capable of subjecting the mother and the fetus to a centrifugal force directed to assist and supplement the efforts of the mother so that such centrifugal force and her efforts act in concert to overcome the action of resisting forces and facilitate the delivery of the child. </p>
<p> For a better understanding of such apparatus, as well as the advantages and novel features thereof, reference is made to the following description which should be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a top plan view of apparatus embodying the invention and showing the expectant mother in position thereon; </p>
<p> FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1; </p>
<p>FIG. 3 is an end view taken from the left of FIG. 2; </p>
<p> FIG. 4 is a side elevational view of a modified form of the means for supporting the mother on the apparatus; and </p>
<p> FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 4 showing another embodiment of such means. </p>

<div><p> When the gynecologist decides that the most opportune time for childbirth has arrived, he instructs the operator to start the machine. When the operator moves the controller handle 21 from zero position the motor is started and through the speed reducer l7 and the associated set of sheaves and belts, including the sheaves l9 and 20, the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beam frame" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beam frame</figure-callout><p> 26 and everything supported thereby are revolved horizontally about the vertical axis of </p><figure-callout id="14" label="shaft" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">shaft</figure-callout><p> 14. As the operator moves the controller handle 21 to feed more and more current to the motor 15, the rotational speed of the machine progressively increases and so does the centrifugal force.

However, there are no external means present which will interfere with the fetus tendency to respond to the action of the centrifugal force. Only those forces which oppose normal childbirth i.e. the frictional and constrictional forces within the mother, are to be overcome by the combined action of the mothers muscles and the centrifugal force created by the rotation of the fetus in the machine. The physicians estimate of how much of this centrifugal force will be needed to assist the mother in achieving the birth of the child and the maximum gs that can be used with safety on the particular patient, are decided upon before the operation. During the operation, the operator gradually speeds up the machine to the predetermined force which is expected to produce the birth of the child, and if such force does not accomplish this, he does not exceed it, unless the physician decides to go the higher gs. He cannot, however, go beyond the maximum gs for which the machine has been set without causing the governor to shut down the machine. When in the operation of the machine, the operator reaches a rate of rotation at which the combination of pressures produced both by the created centrifugal force and by the mother exceed the childbirth resisting forces (friction and constriction), the movement of the fetus occurs and the child is delivered into the net 88. While in the net, the child is still subjected to the action of centrifugal force and is caused by such force to firmly press against the elastic bottom of the net 88. As the </p><figure-callout id="89" label="elastic cables" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">elastic cables</figure-callout><p> 89 and the net give somewhat to this force Which is equal to the weight of the child multiplied by the number of gs it is subjected to, the </p><figure-callout id="97" label="cotton Wad" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">cotton Wad</figure-callout><p> 97 in the net is pressed by the child against the </p><figure-callout id="93" label="switch lever" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">switch lever</figure-callout><p> 93 which is actuated to cut the power from the motor 15 and may be utilized to activate an electric bell, announcing the event. The operator then applies the handbrake 18 to gently bring the machine to a complete stop. Thereupon, the stretcher with the mother on it is detached from the machine and transported to her room. </p></div>
<div><p> As has been above indicated, the apparatus depicted in FIGS. 1-3 of the drawings is shown by way of example and it is within the contemplation of the invention to include other embodiments containing the essential features thereof. Thus, instead of mounting the stretcher horizontally on the machine which is the preferred condition where the number of gs employed in accomplishing the birth of the child is relatively high (say above 8 gs), the machine may be constructed as is indicated in FIG. 4, to take care of births which may be brought about at much lower gs. In this connection, and before entering into a description of FIG. 4, it might be said that the centrifugal force carried by rotation of an object about a vertical axis has a horizontal direction, but due to the always present gravitational force, the actual force exerted on such object is a resultant of these two forces. The influence of the gravitational force on the direction of action of the resultant force is greatest at the lower rotational speeds, and its effect becomes progressively less and less important at the higher gs so that the direction of the resultant progressively approaches the horizontal. Therefore, in order to obtain the maximum elfect of the resultant on the fetus, especially at the lower rotational speeds, the mother should be placed in such a position on the machine as to obtain the nearest possible parallelism between the direction of action of the resultant and the line connecting the center of gravity of the fetus and the center point of the opening of the pelvis through which the fetus has to travel on its way out. To enable this to be accomplished at the lower rotational speeds, at which the gravitational force is of increasingly greater importance, it is necessary that the stretcher be given an inclination corresponding to the pre-diagnosed gs at which it is expected that delivery will take place. This may be accomplished by modifying the above described embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 3 of the drawings to the extent that the </p><figure-callout id="28" label="deck" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">deck</figure-callout><p> 28 of such embodiment is: dispensed with, and instead supporting the </p><figure-callout id="24" label="stretcher" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">stretcher</figure-callout><p> 24 directly on the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 and two </p><figure-callout id="120" label="standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">standards</figure-callout><p> 120 as is shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings.

Like the </p><figure-callout id="122" label="rod" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">rod</figure-callout><p> 122, the </p><figure-callout id="124" label="rod" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">rod</figure-callout><p> 124 extends through openings provided in the </p><figure-callout id="31" label="side channels" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">side channels</figure-callout><p> 31 of the stretcher.

<div><p> As is shown in FIG. of the drawings, it is also possible to have the stretcher automatically adjust its slope to the optimum direction at whatever rate of rotation it happens to be spinning at a given moment. This is achieved by hinging the stretcher at its head end on the </p><figure-callout id="120" label="standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">standards</figure-callout><p> 120 by means of a removable rod extending through openings provided in the </p><figure-callout id="31" label="side channels" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">side channels</figure-callout><p> 31 of the stretcher and </p><figure-callout id="125" label="openings" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">openings</figure-callout><p> 125 provided in </p><figure-callout id="120" label="such standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">such standards</figure-callout><p> 120" at a moderate height above the main I beams 26 of the machine, and letting the foot end of the stretcher rest freely on the outer ends of such I-beams. If, for example, the height of the </p><figure-callout id="125" label="openings" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">openings</figure-callout><p> 125 in standards 120' is selected so that the angle of repose of the stretcher corresponds to the angle of inclination the stretcher would assume when subjected to a centrifugal acceleration of two gs, no elevation of the foot end of the stretcher will occur before the speed of rotation is high enough to cause a horizontal component of two gs. As soon as that minimum is exceeded, the foot end of the stretcher will leave the surfaces of the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 and rise high-er and higher as the speed of rotation is increased, to provide the stretcher with a slope which corresponds to the resultant of the gravitational and acceleration forces at any given speed of rotation of the machine. Thus, as the physican slowly increases the gs to the value at which the travel of the fetus begins, the centrifugal and gravitational forces automatically adjust the inclination of the mothers body to the optimum position for efiicient application of the accelerating forces. This assures that the patient will be submitted to the very minimum acceleration which is necessary to produce the dislodgement of the fetus. When the child has been delivered and the mother cut out in the manner described in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, the foot of the stretcher willreturn to a gentle landing on the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 as the machine decelerates. It will be understood, that in all of the embodiments of the invention it is the primary purpose of the apparatus disclosed to accomplish delivery of the fetus by providing the necessary gs required in any particular instance and this even though the supplementary forces supplied by the patient are zero either because she is too weak to render any assistance at all, or has lost consciousness. </p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>M</span></span>EXICO CITY — Kellogg’s is waging a war here over Tigre Toño and Sam el Tucán.</p>
<p>A 2019 policy requires companies that make unhealthy foods to include warning labels on the front of any boxes they sell in Mexico to educate consumers about things like excess sugar and fat. Any food with a warning label — like Kellogg’s Fruit Loops or its Frosted Flakes, which typically contain more than 37 grams of added sugar in a 100-gram serving — is also banned from including a mascot on its packaging.</p>
<p>Kellogg’s, the company behind the mascots known in the United States as Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam, has already sued the Mexican government over the labeling policy. And now, it’s ratcheting up its marketing to keep Toño and Sam alive: Toño has <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Zg14OyztlZcGTr5F4Xw4y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">curated</a> a Spotify playlist, starred in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHgYw39myo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial</a> alongside a famous Mexican soccer announcer, and even has seen his likenesses illuminated in the sky by drones, in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com.mx/forbes-life/ad-amigos-kelloggs-sorprenden-espectaculo-drones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light show</a> high above Mexico City.</p>
<p>In supermarkets, you’ll still see Toño and Sam on the shelves. They’re advertising new versions of Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes that claim to be low in added sugar; the nutrition facts for both products say they have roughly one gram per serving. The company replaced sugar with the sweetener allulose.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities expected this. They included a provision in the policy that required companies to also warn when products contained artificial sweeteners. But, according to <a href="https://thefoodtech.com/normatividad-y-certificaciones/alulosa-y-sus-regulaciones-ante-los-cambios-de-la-nom-051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media reports</a>, the food industry successfully lobbied the Mexican government to not classify allulose as a sweetener. “We fully comply with the regulation requirements, while at the same time we developed different new food options for our consumers,” Kellogg’s said in a statement, adding that “allulose is clearly labeled and fully meets the regulatory requirement in Mexico.”</p>
<p>Kellogg’s isn’t the only company throwing everything they have at fighting Mexico’s policy, and finding loopholes to exploit. Companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz have begun designing their products so that their packages don’t have a true front or back, but rather two nearly identical labels — except for the fact that only one side has the required warning. As a result, supermarket clerks often place the products with the warning facing inward, effectively hiding it. Dozens of companies have also sued; several cases have already made it up to the Mexican Supreme Court.</p>
		
		
<p>Now, U.S. regulators are considering a similar policy, because they say it will help consumers make healthier decisions. The details haven’t been ironed out yet — the Food and Drug Administration just announced it is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/20/fda-nutrition-labels/">studying</a> the idea. The reforms seem likely to be more modest; the FDA already appears to have rejected the stark, stop-sign-like warnings on Mexican packages and hasn’t mentioned banning mascots. But advocates in both Mexico and the United States say that U.S. regulators should prepare for a years-long political fight.</p>
<p>“We are defending this on a daily basis,” said Simón Barquera, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Center at Mexico’s National Institute of Public Health. (Barquera, like STAT, receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies.) While there are “very good arguments in terms of health, productivity, well being, even economic growth” for a front-of-package label policy, he said, regulators “should be worried about industry response.”</p>
<p>“They never stop,” said Eric Crosbie, an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. “They will fight like hell to disrupt anything [aimed at] making that policy successful.”</p>
<p>Below are four lessons U.S. regulators could take from Mexico’s fight over food labels.</p>
		
		
<h2>There will be lawsuits, lots of them</h2>
<p>The food industry has filed dozens of legal challenges against the Mexican labeling policy. But the challenges — known as amparos — aren’t public, so no one knows for sure how many have actually been filed. Some groups peg the number at 70, while others say it’s over 100.</p>
<p>However, advocates and journalists have gathered that several of the largest food makers have filed these challenges, including <a href="https://expansion.mx/empresas/2021/04/01/amparos-y-el-adios-del-tigre-tono-el-saldo-del-etiquetado-frontal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unilever</a>, <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/agribusiness/news/coca-cola-femsa-files-amparo-against-labeling-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/2023/05/23/sabritas-gana-amparo-para-incluir-animaciones-en-sus-productos-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frito-Lay.</a></p>
<p>Several challenges are already pending before the Mexican Supreme Court. So far, it looks like Mexico’s policy will survive those challenges. Mexico’s court releases public discussion drafts of the court’s opinions before they are finalized, and three public drafts all reject the food industry’s arguments against the policy.</p>
<p>It seems inevitable that a U.S. labeling policy will end up being challenged in the courts as well. Food companies here have already indicated they believe mandatory food labels would likely violate the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>“There is a strong argument that, to the extent FDA were to impose the schemes it is testing as mandatory labeling requirements, they would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge,” FMI, The Food Industry Association wrote in recent comments to the FDA.</p>
		
		
<p>One legal expert emphasized that the food companies suing over a policy is generally the mark of a strong law.</p>
<p>“It’s a good sign when we see that the industry is very uncomfortable and angry about something. Because that generally is a sign that it was well done,” said Isabel Barbosa, a senior associate for the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>But Barbosa acknowledged that the U.S. will have a harder time defending a mandatory labeling policy in the courts, because the U.S. is far more conservative in its approach toward regulating so-called commercial speech.</p>
<p>“It’s an uphill battle,” acknowledged Barbosa, the Georgetown professor. “What I wouldn’t want is for this … to keep [regulators] from taking any action.”</p>
		
		
<h2>The policy could prompt an international trade dispute</h2>
<p>If the U.S. moves forward with mandatory front-of-package labeling, it could land itself in front of an international trade tribunal being threatened with millions — if not billions — in retaliatory tariffs.</p>
<p>Because so many food companies are multinational, they have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32801219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that elements of Mexico’s policy created unfair trade barriers. A coalition of food lobbies, including the American Bakers Association and the American Frozen Food Institute has argued, for example, that the ban on cartoon characters “runs counter to Mexico’s obligations in trade agreements.”</p>
<p>So far it appears that there haven’t been any formal challenges in international tribunals against Mexico’s policy, but there are a number of ways food companies could pursue such a challenge.The first is asking the United States or another nation to file a complaint at the World Trade Organization, where an international tribunal would hear the case and then authorize sanctions against Mexico if the country was found to have violated trade rules. Companies themselves could also bring lawsuits in so-called investor state dispute settlement tribunals, international arbitration bodies that allow companies that invest in a company to challenge that country’s laws.</p>
		
		
<p>It wouldn’t be the first time that food companies used trade treaties to challenge U.S. food and nutrition policy. When the U.S. passed a law in 2002 requiring that meat packages include the country of origin on the label, Canada and Mexico challenged it at the behest of their domestic meat industries. One billion dollars in sanctions were authorized by the WTO and Congress finally folded and repealed the law in 2015.</p>
<h2>Every detail of the policy will be contested</h2>
<p>The food industry pushed Mexican regulators for countless changes to its packaging policy, and while most of their suggestions were ignored, the effort foreshadows how food makers might push U.S. regulators to tweak an eventual labeling policy.</p>
<p>The food industry pushed back, for example, on a provision in the Mexican policy that would prevent foods bearing warning labels from also including endorsements from professional health associations. The juice company Jumex <a href="https://cofemersimir.gob.mx/expediente/23561/recibido/63394/B000195897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that provision would hurt regulators’ credibility because those associations have ties to the ministry of health.</p>
<p>The meat industry also <a href="https://cofemersimir.gob.mx/expediente/23561/recibido/63308/B000195701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Mexico’s warnings should state that foods are “high in” certain nutrients, like sugars and fats, rather than warning that the foods have “excessive” fats and sugars.</p>
		
		
<p>Both of those requests were ultimately denied.</p>
<p>Already, the U.S. food industry is pushing for tweaks to the FDA’s plan, which hasn’t even been unveiled yet.</p>
<p>Groups like the National Confectioners Association, for example, have argued that the FDA shouldn’t consider color-coded labels because “consumers may find it difficult to understand traffic light labeling when a combination of colors is used on the same package.”</p>
<p>Crosbie, the University of Nevada professor who has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/implementing-frontofpack-nutrition-warning-labels-in-mexico-important-lessons-for-low-and-middleincome-countries/76960F4ACAC11351CD0FE7AAEA3598DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> industry’s efforts to change Mexico’s policy, said that U.S. officials need to lean on regulators and civil society groups in countries like Mexico that have implemented their own front-of-package law to understand what changes are actually helpful for public health, and which are simply efforts to weaken the rules.</p>
<p>“Industry is just lightyears ahead, they’re very crafty,” said Crosbie. “As each country adopts this we learn, ‘Okay, that is what you don’t do … but this is also what you do do.’”</p>
<h2>Any loophole will be exploited</h2>
<p>While most food companies, by and large, appear to be complying with Mexico’s new front-of-package labeling policy, companies like Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, and Kraft have gotten remarkably creative at finding ways to minimize its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Full sugar sodas sold in Mexico, for example, should carry a label warning of the products’ high calorie and sugar content. Most do, but they’re easy to miss — soda companies are printing similar labels on the front and back of their bottles, but only printing the warning on one side so they are easily hidden on shelves.</p>
<p>STAT visited three supermarkets in August. At each, we observed large displays where a significant percentage of soda products had their warning labels hidden. At a Walmart in the Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City, for example, warnings were visible on just one-third of the Coke bottles and cans arranged in a display that was roughly 7 feet by 5 feet. At another supermarket, just 10 cans in a display of more than 60 Fanta sodas displayed the required warning labels.</p>
		
		
<p>Soda companies aren’t the only ones using this strategy. Philadelphia Cream Cheese, which is made by Kraft, also used labels on two sides of the containers. So did Yoplait yogurt and Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.</p>
<p>Eva Greenthal, senior policy scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, argued that the tactic “points to the need for guidance for retailers about how to display products.”</p>
<p>Other companies have gotten creative in finding ways to keep their mascots, even without reformulating their foods, as is required by law. Bimbo, the international bread company that owns brands in the United States such as Entenmann’s and Takis, for example, technically removed its mascot from its packaging. It instead <a href="https://www.informabtl.com/bimbo-burla-nom-51-e-internautas-lo-hacen-viral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">printed the mascot</a> on the actual food product — a ready to eat pancake — and made the packaging clear, so the mascot is still visible to consumers.</p>
<p>Already, U.S. advocates are bracing for the food industry to use similar tactics in the U.S. and are urging the FDA to write their rules in a way that closes the existing loopholes in the Mexican policy.</p>
<p>“The food industry will be looking for every loophole, and the FDA needs to have the foresight to prevent this,” said Greenthal.</p>

<p>Following up on the work from our <a href="https://blog.abacus.ai/blog/2023/07/27/treating-attention-deficit-disorder-in-llms/">previous blog post</a>, we are releasing today an arXiv paper titled <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10882">“Giraffe: Adventures in Expanding Context Lengths in LLMs”</a>.</p>



<p>Giraffe is a new family of models that are finetuned from base LLaMA and LLaMA2 that we release. We include a <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v1-delta-13b-scaled-4">4k Giraffe</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v1-delta-13b-scaled-16">16k Giraffe</a> finetuned from LLaMA, and a <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v2-13b-32k">32k Giraffe</a> finetuned from LLaMA2 and release their weights on HuggingFace. We also release our <a href="https://github.com/abacusai/Long-Context">training code, evaluation datasets, and evaluation scripts</a> to the research community.</p>



<p>This paper explores the topic of <em>context length extrapolation</em> of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been highly successful in natural language modelling tasks in recent years. Context length extrapolation is the use of a LLM that is trained on a short context length for evaluation on longer context lengths, without any further training on the long context being involved. Having a model that is capable of extrapolating to longer contexts is important for a range of tasks. For example, if you wanted to ask an LLM to retrieve information from a large corpus of data that you own, having a larger context capacity allows the model to attend to more of the corpus (or maybe even all of it!) at once, so it can do more complex retrievals with fewer mistakes. This could also be important for maintaining long conversations (think with an AI-powered chatbot), or for asking an LLM to help with coding on a large existing codebase.</p>



<p>Why can’t we just train the model on longer contexts though? The primary reason for this is that a key component of modern LLM architecture – called self-attention – scales quadratically in both memory and compute as context length increases, so there will quickly be a point where you don’t have sufficient GPUs, time or money to train for longer contexts. Hence having a method that can zero-shot extrapolate to context lengths never seen before is key.</p>



<p>There have been many methods proposed in recent work on context length extrapolation. In this paper we collate together what we believe are the most prominent approaches and test them thoroughly to determine which are the most effective. We also propose a couple of new approaches, one of which we call <em>truncation</em> and which shows some promising results.</p>



<p>One of the difficulties of assessing LLM performance is choosing the right evaluation methodology. The most commonly used metric in the literature is next-token perplexity, which measures how good the model is at predicting the next token given the preceding context. However, we believe that documents on which perplexity are measured often permit for a good performance simply by producing reasonably coherent text distributions conditional on a small subset of the entire available context. We show in this paper that perplexity is less sensitive for distinguishing long context performance between models for this reason than the new tasks that we introduced that are focused more strongly on <em>accuracy</em> of model recall than general text coherence.</p>



<p>These new tasks are <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/LongChat-Lines">LongChat-Lines</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/WikiQA-Free_Form_QA">FreeFormQA</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/WikiQA-Altered_Numeric_QA">AlteredQA</a>. The first extends a key-value retrieval task introduced by <a href="https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat/tree/longeval">LongChat</a> to longer contexts. FreeFormQA and AlteredQA are formed from the <a href="https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/">Natural Questions Dataset</a> and are question-answering datasets based on Wikipedia. We release all three tasks as HuggingFace datasets.</p>



<p>There are still many open questions in the space of context length extrapolation of LLMs. As we show in the paper, none of the methods we investigate currently fully satisfies the brief of being able to truly extrapolate without some element of degradation in performance starting to creep in. We are interested in researching further on this topic and finding ways to resolve some of these issues; watch this space!</p>

This, in turn, invokes the branch predictor. What’s that? Here is ChatGPT’s explanation:</p><blockquote><p id="973d">Branch prediction is a technique used in modern microprocessors to improve the throughput of their instruction pipelines by guessing the outcome of a conditional branch instruction before it’s actually executed. Let’s delve deeper into why it’s needed and how it works.</p><p id="badd">The Need for Branch Prediction:</p><p id="ec4a">Microprocessors use pipelines to process multiple instructions simultaneously at different stages. Think of this like an assembly line in a factory, where different stages of a product are being worked on simultaneously. Each instruction goes through various stages like fetching, decoding, executing, and writing results.</p><p id="df3a">When a conditional branch instruction (like “if A is greater than B, jump to instruction X”) comes into the pipeline, the CPU needs to know which instruction to fetch next: the one right after the branch or the one at the target of the jump (instruction X in the example). If the CPU waits until the branch instruction is fully executed to know the outcome, the entire pipeline would stall, leading to inefficiencies.</p><p id="3f31">How Branch Prediction Works:</p><p id="f73f">To avoid these stalls, the CPU makes an educated guess or “predicts” the outcome of the branch. This prediction allows the CPU to speculatively fetch and execute subsequent instructions.</p><p id="8c1d">Challenges:</p><p id="cab5">The main challenge with branch prediction is ensuring accuracy. An incorrect prediction (a “misprediction”) causes the pipeline to be flushed, leading to wasted cycles and reduced performance. As such, a significant amount of research and engineering effort is dedicated to improving branch predictor accuracy. Despite these efforts, no predictor is perfect, especially in the face of complex software behaviors.</p></blockquote><p id="5a74">In this case, the array is increasing. As long as the predictor guesses “true” <code>if v &gt; maxV</code>, it predicts with perfect accuracy. This allows it to keep its pipeline full and execute the next instruction without delay, maximizing its efficiency.</p><p id="a69f"><code>cheat_max()</code>is a function that drops the <code>if v &gt; maxV </code>comparison altogether. It takes a shortcut by explicitly avoiding the work of comparison.</p><pre><span id="792b">func cheat_max(values []int) int {<br>    maxV := values[0]<br>    for _, v := range values[1:] {<br>        maxV = v<br>    }<br>    return maxV<br>}</span></pre><pre><span id="9aae">goos: darwin<br>goarch: arm64<br>pkg: github.com/ludi317/max/blog<br>      │ if_max_lol  │          cheat_max           │<br>      │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base         │<br>Fn-10   31.70µ ± 3%   31.62µ ± 1%  ~ (p=0.145 n=6)</span></pre><p id="79ee">As the results show, <code>if_max_lol()</code> is about as fast as if it had no if-statement at all. Branch prediction effectively removes the if-statement.</p><p id="3359">Of course, this is just a toy example. If you wanted to know the max value of an increasing array, simply return the last element. These benchmarks serve to illustrate that very one-sided if-statements are where branching performance shines.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>It's been over three years since my last blog post. I think that
the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog
posts became onerous. But I've taken the time to redo this website
using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, so it's quite easy to add blog
posts now, and plus I added
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">dark mode</a>.</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

<p>Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting
screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It
felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in
the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>However, I always knew that it would need to end. It's not really possible to use Twitter
without at least a little bit of doomscrolling, and that activity took a toll on me emotionally.
I think that the core concept of a "tweet" is fundamentally unhealthy, because by design it
promotes angry and extreme content. Nuance and subtlety is impossible to distinguish from
dog whistling. Most users don't understand that by "dunking" on someone, they are actually
promoting the content. In summary, it gave me a darker feeling about the world in general,
and in exchange, did not offer much to enrich my life.</p>

<p>So, when the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/enshittification">enshittification</a>
process kicked into high gear with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk</a>,
this was the perfect opportunity for me to make my exit.</p>

<p>It has now been a few months since I downloaded all my data and deleted my
account, and in retrospect it was so, so worth it. I feel more optimistic about
the world and human society in general. I interact with people around me with fewer preconceived
judgements about their belief systems. And finally, I have more nuanced conversations with my wife
and friends about politics and other hot topics, without worrying that I'm going to come off
as dog whistling or naysaying.</p>

<p>One thing I do miss is to have the ability to correct misinformation that I stumble upon in
the wild. For example, somebody linked me to <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1681343593208856576">this tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I cannot stop thinking about this.  Andrew created Zig and ~15 years ago asked on SO how to open a file in C++
</blockquote>

<p>(screenshot of this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7880/how-do-you-open-a-file-in-c">StackOverflow question</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
if you take this in any other way than this is incredible and motivating that you can accomplish anything with time + effort then you nuts/sad
</blockquote>

<p>It's a sweet sentiment! Unfortunately it's based on a bit of a misunderstanding.
If you look at the date the question was asked, it was August 11th, 2008.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow">According to Wikipedia</a>, StackOverflow launched on September 15th, 2008. How is this possible?</p>

<p>I'll tell you - if you look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow#cite_note-launches-1">the citation</a>,
it's a link to
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">the launch announcement</a> on <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky's blog</a> -
a blog that I was a huge fan of when I was 20 years old. The fact is that Stack Overflow actually was annouced before that, on a podcast episode with
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a>.</p>

<p>Being a bored intern at Lockheed Martin, because they failed to find me anything to do besides "learn XML", I enthusiastically participated in the launch of Stack Overflow, including asking basic questions such as "How do you open a file in C++?" in order to farm karma points. And it definitely worked! I have edit powers on that website now, and you can bet your ass I use them to clean up
misleading suggestions and stinky opinions whenever I see them.</p>

<p>Now, I don't want to poop on ThePrimeagen's parade, so I can find him some replacement lore.
Here you go, enjoy!
<a href="https://programmersheaven.com/discussion/142689/binary-files">Binary files - Programmers Heaven</a></p>

<blockquote>
 I don't have a clue about binary files. I'm a good programmer, have read more programming books than I can count, but still have no knowlege about binary files. Can you read them? Will they look like text? Is it good to use them? How can I print to a binary file, and then retreive from a binary file?
</blockquote>

<p>I was 14 years old when I wrote <em>this</em> cringefest. I think ThePrimeagen's take can survive transplanted from the Stack Overflow question to this forum post.</p>

<h2>Reddit</h2>

<p>Unlike Twitter, where I find the elemental unit of socializing problematic in and of itself,
I think the Reddit formula is solid gold. This one is a case of malevolent platform stewards.
I expect this from every platform run by for-profit entities, where the goal is not to serve
the users, but to milk them for capital gains. The grim reaper of capitalism has come
for Reddit.</p>

<p>Right now, venture capitalists are freaking out about "AI". Publicly-traded
businesses with access to structured user speech that can be used as
training data are rushing to build a moat around that data. That's why Twitter
prevented viewing tweets from logged out users, and Reddit locked down its APIs
despite it causing a massive protest from the moderators who do the actual
labor to keep the website running.</p>

<p>Detecting that Reddit enshittification was reaching terminal levels, I decided that during
these protests was the ideal time to close the /r/zig subreddit, which I was
currently a moderator of. I closed the subreddit, downloaded all my
user data, and permanently deleted my reddit account, leaving moderation to
<a href="https://kristoff.it/">Loris Cro</a>, VP of Community of
<a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">Zig Software Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Once Loris was the sole moderator, he decided to change the subreddit to read-only mode.
However, this was thwarted today when a troll (check their comment history)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/15rtit7/requesting_rzig/">performed a hostile takeover in broad daylight</a> and
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/15yoxok/rzig_is_reopened/">reopened the sub</a>.
It appears that Reddit admins are perfectly willing to forcibly replace moderators
in an effort to keep the system churning out user data. Those Large Language Models are hungry!</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't consider this to be a problem; it is outside of my control what Reddit does
with its own data. I just want to make it crystal clear that
<strong>Zig, Zig Software Foundation, and myself are not in any way affiliated
with /r/zig</strong>. That subreddit is now run by a third party and all signs
point to a high likelihood of problematic behavior happening there
which I definitely want to avoid being associated with.</p>

<p>If you want an alternative to a zig subreddit, give <a href="https://ziggit.dev/">Ziggit</a>
a try. This is the <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse forum
software</a> run by dude_the_builder,
a friendly Zig community member, and I find it to be a healthy and rewarding way of socializing
with other community members.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I have a Mastodon account, but I don't love it, for the same reasons I
didn't like Twitter. In addition, I think that way of consuming content
is generally like watching mainstream TV or listening to radio with ads. You're
letting a bunch of people who aren't really that important to you, or qualified
to do the job, be the content curators for you.</p>

<p>Discord has been decent for a while. I suspect enshittification will commence soon, so we
should be on the lookout for an alternative over the next five years.</p>

<p>I'm going to look into setting up an RSS reader for myself and start hunting for
high quality blogs.</p>

<p>And finally, I will be redirecting my micro-blogging energy that was previously wasted on
Twitter into actual-blogging energy here.</p>
