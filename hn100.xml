        <p>Have you ever been told that the company’s data on laptops is protected thanks to BitLocker? Well it turns out that this depends on BitLocker’s configuration…</p>

<h2 id="architecture-of-a-passwordless-bitlocker-with-a-discrete-tpm">Architecture of a passwordless BitLocker with a discrete TPM</h2>
<p>The BitLocker partition is encrypted using the Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK). The FVEK itself is encrypted using the Volume Master Key (VMK) and stored on the disk, next to the encrypted data. This permits key rotations without re-encrypting the whole disk.</p>

<p>The VMK is stored in the TPM. Thus the disk can only be decrypted when booted from this computer (there is a recovery mechanism in Active Directory though).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/arch.png" alt="TPM key architecture"></p>

<p>In order to decrypt the disk, the CPU will ask that the TPM sends the VMK over the SPI bus.</p>

<p>The vulnerability should be obvious: at some point in the boot process, the VMK transits unencrypted between the TPM and the CPU. This means that it can be captured and used to decrypt the disk.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-the-tpm-exchange">Capturing the TPM exchange</h2>
<p>We’ll be using a dirt cheap logic analyzer, <a href="https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/dslogic-series/">DSLogic Plus</a>. I bought this for under $100 in 2021 (tax and shipping included).</p>

<p>A note on signal capture: to comfortably acquire a signal the sampling frequency should be 3 to 4 times the bus frequency. This means that for our SPI 33MHz bus we should sample at the very least at 100MHz. Notice that the specs of the analyzer state that it can do <em>up to</em> 400MHz on <em>up to</em> 16 channels. I’ll help you read between the lines here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the more channels you capture at a time (by sets of 3), the lower the sampling frequency</li>
  <li>you have to distinguish stream mode and buffer mode. The first one will send results directly to the host computer and permits capture of large sets, up to a minute but it’s limited to 100MHz on 3 channels. The buffer mode allows sampling at 400MHz but it will only work for a few milliseconds, so there’s no practical use for it here.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that this hardware can <em>barely</em> do the job we’re asking it to do. For a more professional option both hardware and software-wise (but also 10x pricier) have a look at <a href="https://usd.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-16">Saleae</a>. Otherwise there’s <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Logic_analyzers">sigrok’s list of supported hardware</a>.</p>

<p>As for plugging the analyzer to the board, remember that SPI is a shared bus. This means that there’s no need to capture the signal right at the tiny TPM pins if there is a larger SPI component on the board that the hooks can be latched on to. From experience I identified a neighbouring SPI flash, but fortunately all components are marked so it’s rather easy to identify their use by looking up their datasheet.
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/SPI_pin.jpg" alt="Lenovo board"></p>

<p>SPI has several lines but only 3 can be captured using the DSLogic because otherwise the sampling frequency drops. The 3 most important ones are the clock CLK and the two data lines MOSI and MISO.</p>

<p>The threshold voltage (level at which the analyzer decides that the line has changed states) should be around half of the signal’s voltage, here the latter was measured at 3.3V so an appropriate threshold is around 1.6V.</p>

<p>The VMK key we’re looking for is used late in the POST stage. For the Lenovo L13 I worked with it was just after the splash screen, about 14 seconds into the boot process out of a total boot time of about 25 seconds. There are SPI operations before that (mostly to read and verify the early boot stages) but they’re not TPM. You could either start the capture when booting the computer, or safely wait about 7 or so seconds to avoid capturing unnecessary data.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-the-captured-signal">Decoding the captured signal</h2>
<p>There are 3 layers to decode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SPI, which is the physical layer</li>
  <li>TIS</li>
  <li>TPM2.0, which contains the VMK</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spi">SPI</h2>
<p>As far as SPI is concerned any logic analyzer should do this properly, it’s a rather simple protocol:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/spi_frame.PNG" alt="SPI byte"></p>

<p>The blue square wave is the clock, the other two lines (yellow and red) are data lines, respectively used for communications from slave to master (MISO) and master to slave (MOSI).</p>

<p>When the clock signal is going up (transitioning from 0 to 1), the bit value is whatever state the data lines are in at this specific time. In our case the red line sits at 0 for 8 clock cycles, so the byte is 0. The yellow line only has the first bit set, so the decoded value is b10000000 = 0x80.</p>

<p>The logic analyzer correctly decodes SPI so we’ll just trust its output.</p>

<h2 id="tis">TIS</h2>
<p>TIS, which stands for TPM Interface Specification, is another beast entirely and that’s where I had most of my troubles. I couldn’t find a decoder that worked for my capture and decided to do it “manually”. Short of correctly decoding the data, the <a href="https://github.com/sigrokproject/libsigrokdecode/pull/88">libsigrock decoders</a> did at least indicate a rough window for the TPM exchanges which was a welcome tip since each capture has several million bytes of data. Maybe the decoders fail be because the capture is missing Chip Select (CS#) which is required in the TPM specification, maybe because the clock is incorrect, maybe because some bytes are occasionally missing, maybe for some other reason, who knows.</p>

<p>Master to slave request:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_request.PNG" alt="Master to slave request"></p>

<p>Sending a request seems to happen in this order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the slave sends byte 80 to signal that it’s ready</li>
  <li>the master sends a header we don’t care about (<code>D4 00 24</code>) and then sends the TPM byte in a loop (<code>80</code>)</li>
  <li>the slave acknowledges that it has read the byte by sending 01 FF</li>
  <li>at this point the cycle starts anew with the next byte</li>
</ul>

<p>So this whole frame is just to send the byte 0x80 from the master to the slave!</p>

<p>Slave to master response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_response.PNG" alt="Slave to master response"></p>

<p>This is a completely different process that relies on setting and reading registers. The frame is the result of reading one byte from a set address (<code>D4 00 24</code>, meaning register 24). Again the slave seems to start the transaction with byte 80, then writes the size of the followong data which is only 1 byte (or it could be an ACK value to the read request, who knows) and finally the value we care about, here 0x80. The next TPM byte is 0x02.</p>

<h2 id="tpm-20">TPM 2.0</h2>
<p>The TPM command that requests the key be sent back is the <code>TPM2_Unseal</code> command. It is described in <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/">part 3 of the TPM 2.0 specification</a>.</p>

<p>You might ask how I isolated the frames below since no decoder would work. We don’t actually care about the requests happening on MOSI, we’re mostly interested in the responses on the MISO line. As we’ve seen previously the TIS encoding around TPM bytes is rather simple, so the simplest way to isolate all TPM transactions is to filter the raw SPI data using the mask “80 00 00 00 01 ..” and only keep this wildcard last byte. The start of a TPM transaction can then be identified by its own <code>80 01</code> or <code>80 02</code> header. There should only be a few dozens TPM responses, the one with the key inside should be the longer authenticated one (starts with <code>80 02</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/unseal_response.PNG" alt="unseal cmd and response">
There is a 10 milliseconds delay between the unseal command and the response, which is huge. This is probably because the request is authenticated (see below the <code>80 02</code> header indicating a password session as opposed to most requests using the plain <code>80 01</code> header) using a HMAC so the slave has to verify the signature and then reply using a HMAC of its own, which induces a notable delay.</p>

<p>The TPM command and its response are obtained by reassembling bytes one by one using the method previously explained.</p>

<p>Reconstituted Unseal command:</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 5B 00 00 01 5E 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 49 03 00 00 00 00 20 9D F7 05 43 7A 77 AE E4 20 92 66 17 EC DA BB A7 79 D2 47 0D 42 E5 D1 1C EB 4A 6B C1 C8 44 42 BC 00 00 20 D9 AF C7 DF 10 7A D4 30 C1 C5 28 63 5F CE CE 8A 24 1A 19 E5 DD 08 5F 77 AA 28 BE 75 16 16 91 F1
</code></pre></div>

<p>Decoded frame using <a href="https://joholl.github.io/tpmstream-web/">this awesome tool</a>:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_command.PNG" alt="Decode TPM unseal command"></p>

<p>Response (I’ve stripped continuation bytes <code>1F 00</code>, they become apparent if you capture several long frames):</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2E 00 2C 2C 00 05 00 01 00 00 00 03 20 00 00 57 61 A3 91 DF E1 B3 85 28 28 C6 DD A6 F9 A5 FE AC E9 71 A4 AA AE 44 25 18 F7 4A A7 FE D6 E0 FC 00 20 8D DD A1 AE 93 5D 98 E9 DA A8 18 6F D5 64 A8 66 E6 DE AA 56 9E 2F 50 A7 41 E1 27 BF A1 2C 4D 92 00 00 20 00 20 BA C9 8F 34 60 5F 4F D4 76 9B 6B AA 68 C7 6C 79 EF 36 7D 1D D3 19 33 78 55 47 B2 E1 40 D4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Decoded response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_response.PNG" alt="Decoded TPM response"></p>

<p>In the buffer lies our key, it starts with <code>5761</code> and is 32 bytes long.</p>

<h2 id="mounting-and-backdooring-the-disk">Mounting and backdooring the disk</h2>
<p>Mounting the disk live in read/write mode (if you’d rather work offline do a disk copy with dd and then mount this copy using a loop device):</p>
<div><pre><code>echo 5761A391DF1F00E1B3852828C6DDA6F9A5FEACE971A4AAAE442518F74AA7FED6E0FC | xxd -r -p &gt; key
dislocker-fuse -K key /dev/sdd3 ./mnt/
mount ./mnt/dislocker-file ./mnt2/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the simplest backdoor is to just overwrite the sticky keys program with cmd:</p>
<div><pre><code>cp ./mnt2/Windows/System32/cmd.exe ./mnt2/Windows/System32/sethc.exe
</code></pre></div>

<p>Place the disk back in the laptop, boot and press shift 5 times to get a SYSTEM shell:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/system.jpg" alt="sethc"></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>I cannot recommend using the DSLogic for this task:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lot of captures were duds and had to be thrown away</li>
  <li>sampling at 3 times the bus speed was barely enough to have a coherent clock and some bytes were missing</li>
</ul>

<p>This forced me to spend way too much time to understand the protocols in order to decode the capture. In the end time is money, if you’re an employer reading this just buy a professional logic analyzer for your employees.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The use of a discrete (physical) TPM actually decreases the security of the system, using a fTPM would solve the problem.</p>

<p>If the discrete TPM has to be used, then a PIN or passphrase on BitLocker is necessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">As first reported by The Information, then seemingly verified by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on X (formerly known as Twitter), AI startup <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> has raised $235 million in a Series D funding round.</p>
<p>The tranche, which had participation from Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, IBM, Salesforce and Sound Ventures, values Hugging Face at $4.5 billion. That’s double the startup’s valuation from May 2022 and reportedly more than 100 times Hugging Face’s annualized revenue, reflecting the enormous appetite for AI and platforms to support its development.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has raised a total of $395.2 million to date, placing it among the better-funded AI startups in the space. Those ahead of it are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/openai-gpt5-sam-altman/">OpenAI</a> ($11.3 billion), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/anthropic-raises-350m-to-build-next-gen-ai-assistants/">Anthropic</a> ($1.6 billion),&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/inflection-ai-led-by-linkedin-and-deepmind-co-founders-raises-225m-to-transform-computer-human-interactions/">Inflection AI</a> ($1.5 billion), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/ai-startup-cohere-now-valued-at-over-2-1b-raises-270m/">Cohere</a> ($435 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/adept-a-startup-training-ai-to-use-existing-software-and-apis-raises-350m/">Adept</a> ($415 million).</p>
<p>“AI is the new way of building all software. It’s the most important paradigm shift of the decade and, compared to the software shift, it’s going to be bigger because of new capabilities and faster because software paved the way,” co-founder and CEO Clément Delangue told TechCrunch via email. “<span>Hugging Face intends to be the open platform that empowers this paradigm shift.”</span></p>
<p>Delangue, a French entrepreneur, launched Brooklyn-based Hugging Face in 2016 alongside Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf. The trio originally built a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. But after open sourcing the algorithm behind the app, Hugging Face pivoted to focus on creating a platform for creating, testing and deploying machine learning.</p>
<p>Today, Hugging Face offers a number of data science hosting and development tools, including a GitHub-like hub for AI code repositories, models and data sets as well as web apps to demo AI-powered applications. Hugging Face also provides libraries for tasks like data set processing and evaluating models in addition to an enterprise version of the hub that supports software-as-a-service and on-premises deployments.</p>
<p>Hugging Face’s paid functionality includes AutoTrain, which helps to automate the task of training AI models; Inference API, which allows developers to host models without managing the underlying infrastructure; and Infinity, which is designed to increase the speed with which an in-production model processes data.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has 10,000 customers today, it claims, and more than 50,000 organizations on the platform. And its model hub hosts over 1 million repositories.</p>
<p>Contributing to the growth is the strong, sustained interest in AI from the enterprise. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/how-ai-will-impact-businesses-in-2023">According</a> to a HubSpot poll, 43% of business leaders say that they plan to increase their investment in AI and automation tools over the course of 2023, while 31% say AI and automation tools are very important to their overall business strategy.</p>
<p>Much of what Hugging Face delivers falls into MLOps, a category of tools for streamlining the process of taking AI models to production and then maintaining and monitoring them. The MLOps market is substantial in its own right, with one <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-mlops-market">report</a> estimating that it’ll reach $16.61 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>But Hugging Face dabbles in other areas, too.</p>
<p>In 2021, Hugging Face launched BigScience, a volunteer-led project to produce an open source language model as powerful as OpenAI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/openai-brings-fine-tuning-to-gpt-3-5-turbo/">GPT-3</a>, but free and open for anyone to use. It culminated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/a-year-in-the-making-bigsciences-ai-language-model-is-finally-available/">Bloom</a>, a multilingual model that for more than a year has been available to tinker with on Hugging Face’s model hub.</p>
<p>Bloom is but one of several open source models to which Hugging Face has contributed development resources.</p>
<p>Hugging Face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/">collaborated</a> with ServiceNow, the enterprise software company, to release a free code-generating AI model called StarCoder (a follow-up model, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/safecoder">SafeCoder</a>, debuted this week). And the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/hugging-face-releases-its-own-version-of-chatgpt/">made available</a>&nbsp;its own free version of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, OpenAI’s viral AI-powered chatbot, in partnership with the German nonprofit LAION.</p>
<p>Hugging Face’s team-ups extend to major cloud providers, some of which are strategic investors.</p>
<p>Hugging Face recently worked with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-teams-up-with-hugging-face-to-offer-cloud-based-ai-training/">Nvidia</a> to expand access to cloud compute via Nvidia’s DGX computing platform. It has a partnership with Amazon to extend its products to AWS customers and everage Amazon’s custom Trainium chips to train the next generation of Bloom. And Hugging Face collaborated with Microsoft on <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/huggingfaceinc1651727610968.huggingface?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugging Face Endpoints</a> on Azure, a way to turn Hugging Face-developed AI models into scalable production solutions hosted through Azure.</p>
<p>With this latest investment, Delangue says that Hugging Face plans to “<span>double down” on its supportive efforts in many domains, including research, enterprise and startups. It has 170 employees, but plans on recruiting new talent over the coming months.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<article id="post-39152">
	<div>
		<p>Today, we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.</p>
<p>We believe an open approach to AI is best for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe and responsible, so we’re releasing Code Llama for both research and commercial use under the same <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE">community license as Llama 2</a>.</p>
<p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">Llama 2</a> that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence”). It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more.</p>
<p>We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.</p>
<p>The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.</p>
<p>We also further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Python is a language specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation, and because Python and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/">PyTorch</a> play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a natural language instruction input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what people expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama – Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama – Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.</p>
<p>Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks. We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples’ lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues and fix vulnerabilities.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37248781">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.72.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p>
<p>If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.72.0 with:</p>
<pre><code>rustup update stable
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it already, you can <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html">get <code>rustup</code></a> from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.72.0">detailed release notes for 1.72.0</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (<code>rustup default beta</code>) or the nightly channel (<code>rustup default nightly</code>). Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p>
<h2>What's in 1.72.0 stable</h2>
<h3>Rust reports potentially useful <code>cfg</code>-disabled items in errors</h3>
<p>You can conditionally enable Rust code using <code>cfg</code>, such as to provide certain
functions only with certain crate features, or only on particular platforms.
Previously, items disabled in this way would be effectively invisible to the
compiler. Now, though, the compiler will remember the name and <code>cfg</code> conditions
of those items, so it can report (for example) if a function you tried to call
is unavailable because you need to enable a crate feature.</p>
<pre><code>   Compiling my-project v0.1.0 (/tmp/my-project)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rustix::io_uring`
   --&gt; src/main.rs:1:5
    |
1   | use rustix::io_uring;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `io_uring` in the root
    |
note: found an item that was configured out
   --&gt; /home/username/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/rustix-0.38.8/src/lib.rs:213:9
    |
213 | pub mod io_uring;
    |         ^^^^^^^^
    = note: the item is gated behind the `io_uring` feature

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0432`.
error: could not compile `my-project` (bin "my-project") due to previous error
</code></pre>
<h3>Const evaluation time is now unlimited</h3>
<p>To prevent user-provided const evaluation from getting into a compile-time
infinite loop or otherwise taking unbounded time at compile time, Rust
previously limited the maximum number of <em>statements</em> run as part of any given
constant evaluation. However, especially creative Rust code could hit these
limits and produce a compiler error. Worse, whether code hit the limit could
vary wildly based on libraries invoked by the user; if a library you invoked
split a statement into two within one of its functions, your code could then
fail to compile.</p>
<p>Now, you can do an unlimited amount of const evaluation at compile time. To
avoid having long compilations without feedback, the compiler will always emit
a message after your compile-time code has been running for a while, and repeat
that message after a period that doubles each time. By default, the compiler
will also emit a deny-by-default lint (<code>const_eval_long_running</code>) after a large
number of steps to catch infinite loops, but you can
<code>allow(const_eval_long_running)</code> to permit especially long const evaluation.</p>
<h3>Uplifted lints from Clippy</h3>
<p>Several lints from Clippy have been pulled into <code>rustc</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#undropped_manually_drops"><code>clippy::undropped_manually_drops</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#undropped-manually-drops"><code>undropped_manually_drops</code></a> (deny)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ManuallyDrop</code> does not drop its inner value, so calling <code>std::mem::drop</code> on it does nothing. Instead, the lint will suggest <code>ManuallyDrop::into_inner</code> first, or you may use the unsafe <code>ManuallyDrop::drop</code> to run the destructor in-place. This lint is denied by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#invalid_utf8_in_unchecked"><code>clippy::invalid_utf8_in_unchecked</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8-unchecked"><code>invalid_from_utf8_unchecked</code></a> (deny) and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8"><code>invalid_from_utf8</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>The first checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which violates their safety pre-conditions, resulting in undefined behavior. This lint is denied by default.</li>
<li>The second checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which will always return an error. This lint is a warning by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cmp_nan"><code>clippy::cmp_nan</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-nan-comparisons"><code>invalid_nan_comparisons</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for comparisons with <code>f32::NAN</code> or <code>f64::NAN</code> as one of the operands. NaN does not compare meaningfully to anything – not even itself – so those comparisons are always false. This lint is a warning by default, and will suggest calling the <code>is_nan()</code> method instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cast_ref_to_mut"><code>clippy::cast_ref_to_mut</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/allowed-by-default.html#invalid-reference-casting"><code>invalid_reference_casting</code></a> (allow)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for casts of <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>&amp;mut T</code> without using interior mutability, which is immediate undefined behavior, even if the reference is unused. This lint is currently allowed by default due to potential false positives, but it is planned to be denied by default in 1.73 after implementation improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stabilized APIs</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#impl-Sync-for-Sender%3CT%3E"><code>impl&lt;T: Send&gt; Sync for mpsc::Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#impl-TryFrom%3C%26'a+OsStr%3E-for-%26'a+str"><code>impl TryFrom&lt;&amp;OsStr&gt; for &amp;str</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc/string/struct.String.html#method.leak"><code>String::leak</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These APIs are now stable in const contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::from_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes"><code>CStr::to_bytes</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::to_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_str"><code>CStr::to_str</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Windows compatibility</h3>
<p>In a future release we're planning to increase the minimum supported Windows version to 10. The accepted proposal in compiler <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/651">MCP 651</a> is that Rust 1.75 will be the last to officially support Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. When Rust 1.76 is released in February 2024, only Windows 10 and later will be supported as tier-1 targets. This change will apply both as a host compiler and as a compilation target.</p>
<h2>Contributors to 1.72.0</h2>
<p>Many people came together to create Rust 1.72.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.72.0/">Thanks!</a></p>

<p>18th May 2023</p>
<p>The Logic Lab provides a selection of 12 logic gates that you can interconnect with patch cables to make a variety of different logic circuits, for experimenting with and learning about logic:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclabcables.jpg" alt="LogicLabCables.jpg" width="675" height="450"></p>
<p><em>The Logic Lab allows you to experiment with logic gates by interconnecting them with patch cables.</em></p>
<p>You can enter inputs using switches, and display the outputs on five coloured LEDs. The whole Logic Lab is implemented using a single AVR128DA48 (or ATmega4809) microprocessor and a few LEDs and other passive components, with a total parts cost of under £20 or $25.</p>
<p>I've included nine logic problems that you can try solving with the help of the Logic Lab.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I originally decided to build this for a friend's son who was interested in learning about logic gates, and I thought he would enjoy having something that he could use for practical experiments. I had a design in mind, and searched to see if anything similar already existed; the closest I found was a kit developed by the University of Southampton in the UK <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but it wasn't commercially available.</p>
<p>My first idea was to use 74LVC series logic gates, which are individual logic gates in small surface-mount packages. The nice thing about this is that each drawing of a logic gate on the PCB would be implemented by a single gate.</p>
<p>However, I then thought about using the Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) in the AVR DA-series microcontrollers, which allows you to configure three-input gates that work independently of the processor. The advantage would be that you could reconfigure the selection of gates in software, without needing to resolder the board. However, even the largest 64-pin devices only provide six logic gates, and in the 48-pin packages it seems that only five of these are actually available on I/O pins.</p>
<p>My final design used an ATmega4809 or AVR128DA48 microcontroller, but simulating the gates by polling the inputs, and setting the outputs accordingly, using truth tables stored in the program. With a 48-pin package it would be possible to emulate at least 12 gates of different types, which would be ample for the design I had in mind. This approach would allow you to change the selection of gates available by uploading a new version of the software, and then making stickers to show the new gate symbols.</p>
<p>Even though the logic gates are simulated using a microcontroller, the only detectable difference is the propagation delay. You can even create an oscillator by connecting the output of one of the inverters back to its input.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Logic Lab has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 logic gates: two AND, two NAND, two OR, two NOR, two XOR, and two inverters.</li>
<li>Four slider switches, S1 to S4, with LEDs to show the status, that can provide logic inputs to the gates.</li>
<li>Five coloured LEDs, L1 to L5, that can display the state of the output from a logic circuit. The top three are red, orange, and green, allowing simulation of traffic lights.</li>
<li>Two busses, J1 and J2, that can be used to link patch cables together.</li>
<li>It is powered by two AAA batteries, with an on/off switch and power indicator LED.</li>
<li>The inputs and outputs are connected to header pins, so you can interconnect them with a set of patch cables terminated in header sockets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logic problems</h3>
<p>Here are nine sample logic problems that you can try solving with the Logic Lab. These can each be solved using the twelve gates in the Logic Lab. I've given an approximate difficulty rating out of 100 for each problem.</p>
<p>For the answers to the problems see <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?4FO5">Logic Lab Problem Answers</a>.</p>
<h4>Traffic lights (20%)</h4>
<p>Traffic lights (in the UK) go through the following sequence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Red and Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Design a logic circuit that lights the red, orange, and green LEDs according to that sequence of switches.</p>
<h4>Exclusive-OR (30%)</h4>
<p>Two of the gates in the logic lab are exclusive-OR, or XOR, gates; their output is '1' if either of the inputs is '1', but not both.</p>
<p>Design an&nbsp;exclusive-OR&nbsp;gate without using the XOR gates, by using a combination of the other gates in the Logic Lab.</p>
<h4>Safety switch (40%)</h4>
<p>A school has a fire warning light that lights up in every classroom. To avoid it being accidentally switched on it has four switches, all of which need to be turned on before the warning will light up.</p>
<p>Design a logic circuit that implements this: the red LED, representing the warning, should only turn on if all switches are set to '1'.</p>
<h4><span>Palindrome checker (40%)</span></h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights the green LED if the four switches are set to a binary number that's a palindrome, such as '1001', and the red LED if it's not a palindrome, like '1011'.</p>
<h4>Hotel light switches (60%)</h4>
<p>In a hotel four rooms are on the same corridor, and there's one light in the middle of the corridor. There's a switch outside each room that can be used to control the light.</p>
<p>Design a circuit that allows each of the four switches S1 to S4 to turn the light L5 on or off.</p>
<h4>Binary decoder (70%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights up just one of the four LEDs L1 to L4 for each of the different possible settings of switches S1 and S2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Majority vote (80%)</h4>
<p>When the secret spy club needs to vote on an issue, the three members each have a button that they press to register their vote. If there is a majority vote, the issue is passed.</p>
<p>Use three switches to represent the votes, and design a circuit that will light the green LED if the majority vote '1', or the red LED if they don't.</p>
<h4>Combination switch (90%)</h4>
<p>You have a drawer with an electronic lock, and it can only be opened if you set the correct password on four switches. Design a logic circuit that allows you to choose any of the 16 possible passwords, such as '1011', by changing the position of four patch leads. The circuit should then only light up the green LED if you set the correct password on the switches.</p>
<h4>Binary adder (100%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that will add together two 2-digit binary numbers, and put the answer in binary on the three LEDs L3 to L5.</p>
<p>The first number should be on S1 (high bit) and S2 (low bit), and the second number should be on S3 (high bit) and S4 (low bit). The answer should be on L3 (high bit), L4 (middle bit), and L5 (low bit).</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the full circuit of the Logic Lab:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" alt="LogicLab.gif" width="720" height="264"></a></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Logic Lab, based on an AVR128DA48 or ATmega4809 processor.<br> Click to open a larger version in a new window.</em></p>
<p>There is quite a wide choice of pin-compatible microcontrollers you can use for this project, which should help while many of the most popular parts are still out of stock at time of writing.&nbsp;I built two prototypes, one with an AVR128DA48, and one with the older ATmega4809 which is pin compatible, and their performance was indistinguishable. The program only uses about 1500 bytes, so an ATmega809, ATmega1609, or ATmega3209 should be fine. Likewise, an AVR32DA48 or AVR64DA48 should be fine, or the equivalent AVR32DB parts.</p>
<p>I used 0.1" pitch header pins for the inputs and outputs, and patch leads terminated in header sockets. The advantage of this is that you can buy the header pins in long strips, and then cut them down to the lengths you need; the header sockets are more difficult to divide up.</p>
<p>The five output LEDs are 5mm diffused through-hole LEDs in five different colours. In my first prototype, shown in the photographs, I used a white LED, but found that because white has a higher forward voltage than the other colours, if you connect both white and one of the other LEDs to the same output the white is much dimmer. I therefore replaced white with yellow to avoid the problem.</p>
<p>The other LEDs and resistors are 0805 size SMD types.</p>
<p>The circuit is powered by two 1.5V AAA batteries in series, mounted in through-hole battery clips on the back of the board. Alternatively you could use two PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;which fit in the same mounting holes.</p>
<h4>Short-circuit protection</h4>
<p>The board includes 100Ω current limiting resistors on every output, so if the user inadvertently connects together two outputs at different logic levels, the current will be 3/(100 + 100) or 15mA, which is well within the 50mA per output maximum given on the data sheet.</p>
<h4>Unconnected inputs</h4>
<p>Unconnected inputs are treated as being at logic-level '0'. This is implemented by a 10kΩ pull-down resistor on every input.</p>
<p>If you prefer to have unconnected inputs at logic level '1' (like TTL) you can omit these resistors, and turn on the internal pullup resistors by configuring the inputs as&nbsp;<strong>INPUT_PULLUP</strong> in <strong>setup()</strong>.</p>
<h4>Patch cables</h4>
<p>To use the Logic Lab you'll need a set of at least 20 jumper wires terminated in header sockets. I recommend 150mm long cables; either ribbon cables that you can separate to create a set of jumper wires&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, or slightly more expensive separate cables&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>► Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed a PCB in Eagle and ordered boards from Elecrow <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. The board is 100 x 140mm, using a double-sided PCB. I also created a design for a back panel and ordered this in 2mm thick transparent acrylic <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>. I give links at the end of the article so you can order your own boards.</p>
<p>The only standard I could find for drawing the logic symbols was a USA Department of Defense document from 1962, which describes how to draw them from arcs of circles&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my first attempt at designing the PCB I assigned the logic gate inputs to the microcontroller ports in a systematic way, with all the AND and NAND gate inputs on one port, all the OR and NOR gate inputs to another port, and so on. However, the layout was a nightmare, and I needed a lot of vias to make it work. I decided to have a second attempt simply choosing the nearest I/O pin to each gate input or output, with the idea that I could sort out in software, and I managed to lay it out much more neatly with no vias.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to the assignment of I/O pins to the gate inputs and outputs:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logicgatepins.gif" alt="LogicGatePins.gif" width="392" height="261"></p>
<p>My recommended sequence for assembling the board is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solder the microcontroller on the back of the board using a hot air gun.</li>
<li>Solder the SMD resistors and capacitors to the back of the board, and the SMD LEDs to the front of the board, using the hot air gun.</li>
<li>Fit the the header pins to the front of the board with a conventional soldering iron.</li>
<li>Mount the switches and 5mm LEDs with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Fit the three-pin header socket on the back of the board with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Finally, fit the battery holders with a soldering iron, using a generous amount of solder to hold them firmly in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the SMD components I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 300°C.</p>
<p>When fitting the header pins I did them a column at a time, and found it helpful to push them into something like a 1x36 header socket <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, to keep them correctly aligned and vertical.</p>
<p>When mounting the battery clips I found I had to enlarge the mounting holes with a 2mm drill to get the clips to fit. You won't need to do this if you use the PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclabback.jpg" alt="LogicLabBack.jpg" width="675" height="450"></p>
<p><em>The back of the Logic Lab PCB, showing the ATmega4809 processor and battery holders.</em></p>
<p>I mounted the&nbsp;transparent acrylic back panel with 15mm nylon pillars <sup id="cite_ref10"><a href="#cite_note10">[10]</a></sup> and M3 6mm nylon screws <sup id="cite_ref11"><a href="#cite_note11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>For each gate the program simply reads the inputs, and sets the output according to the truth table for the logic gate.</p>
<p>I thought about using interrupts, but I decided to go with the simpler approach of repeatedly stepping through the gates, processing them in sequence. The program doesn't have anything else to do, so there's no need for interrupts.</p>
<h4>Truth tables</h4>
<p>The truth table for each of the different gate types is defined by an enum:</p>
<pre>enum truthtable_t: uint8_t { AND = 0b1000, NAND = 0b0111,  OR = 0b1110, 
                             NOR = 0b0001,  XOR = 0b0110, NOT = 0b0011 };</pre>
<h4>Logic gate definitions</h4>
<p>The definition of each gate is a struct, <strong>gate_t</strong>:</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
  int inputa;
  int inputb;
  int output;
  truthtable_t truthtable;
} gate_t;</pre>
<p>This defines the pin numbers used for the two inputs and the output, the value to be output, and the type of logic gate.</p>
<p>Here are the definitions of the 12 gates in the Logic Lab:</p>
<pre>gate_t gates[12] = {
  { PIN_PC1, PIN_PC0, PIN_PC5, AND },
  { PIN_PB5, PIN_PB4, PIN_PC4, AND },
  { PIN_PB1, PIN_PB0, PIN_PA3, NAND },
  { PIN_PA6, PIN_PA7, PIN_PA2, NAND },
  { PIN_PC7, PIN_PC6, PIN_PD2, OR },
  { PIN_PC3, PIN_PC2, PIN_PD3, OR },
  { PIN_PA5, PIN_PA4, PIN_PF2, NOR },
  { PIN_PA1, PIN_PA0, PIN_PF3, NOR },
  { PIN_PD4, PIN_PD5, PIN_PE0, XOR },
  { PIN_PD6, PIN_PD7, PIN_PE1, XOR },
  { PIN_PF0, PIN_PF0, PIN_PE2, NOT },
  { PIN_PF1, PIN_PF1, PIN_PE3, NOT },
};</pre>
<p>For simplicity I define the NOT gate as a two input gate where both inputs are the same pin.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change the type of a gate simply change its <strong>truthtable</strong> value in this table. For example, you could change all the two-input gates into NAND gates by changing their definitions to <strong>NAND</strong>, or you could add some XNOR gates by also defining them in <strong>truthtable_t</strong>.</p>
<h4>Configuring the outputs</h4>
<p>In <strong>setup()</strong> the appropriate I/O pins are configured as outputs:</p>
<pre>void setup () {
  // Set outputs
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    pinMode(gates[i].output, OUTPUT);
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Processing the gates</h4>
<p>Finally in&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong>&nbsp;we repeatedly scan through each gate, read the inputs, and set the output according to the gate's truth table:</p>
<pre>void loop () {
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    gate_t gate = gates[i];
    bool ina = digitalRead(gate.inputa);
    bool inb = digitalRead(gate.inputb);
    int val = ina &lt;&lt; 1 | inb;
    bool out = (gate.truthtable &gt;&gt; val) &amp; 1;
    digitalWrite(gate.output, out);
  }
}</pre>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>
<h3>Compiling the program</h3>
<h4>AVR128DA48</h4>
<p>If you're using an AVR128DA48, or anything from the AVR32DA48 or AVR32DB48 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;Spence Konde's <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore" target="_blank">Dx Core</a> on GitHub (I used 1.5.3). Choose the&nbsp;<strong>AVR DA-series (no bootloader)</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>AVR DB-series (no bootloader)</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>DxCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong> menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Chip: "</strong><strong>AVR128DA49</strong><strong>"</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>"</strong><strong>AVR128DB48</strong><strong>"</strong><br><strong>Clock Speed: "4 MHz internal"</strong></p>
<p>Then upload the program to the processor on the breadboard using a UPDI programmer connected to the GND, +5V, and UPDI pins.</p>
<p>The recommended option is to use a USB to Serial board, such as the SparkFun FTDI Basic board&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref12"><a href="#cite_note12">[12]</a></sup>, or a USB to Serial cable <sup id="cite_ref13"><a href="#cite_note13">[13]</a></sup>, connected with&nbsp;a 4.7kΩ resistor as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/serialupdiprogrammer.gif" alt="SerialUPDIProgrammer.gif" width="395" height="147"></p>
<ul>
<li>Set&nbsp;<strong>Programmer</strong>&nbsp;to the first of the&nbsp;<strong>"SerialUPDI - 230400 baud"</strong> options.</li>
<li>Select the USB port corresponding to the USB to Serial board in the <strong>Port</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Upload</strong> from the Arduino IDE <strong>Tools</strong> menu to upload the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a clock speed of 4MHz reduces the processor power consumption from 4.7mA to 1.1mA.</p>
<h4>ATmega4809</h4>
<p>If you're using an ATmega4809, or anything from the ATmega809 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;MCUdude's&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX" target="_blank">MegaCoreX</a>&nbsp;on GitHub. Choose the&nbsp;<strong>ATmega4809</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>MegaCoreX</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Clock: "Internal 4 MHz</strong><strong>"<br>BOD: "BOD disabled"</strong><br><strong>Pinout: "48 pin standard"</strong></p>
<p>On the ATmega4809, choosing a clock speed of 4MHz ensures that the processor will run down to the minimum voltage of 1.8V, for maximum battery life.</p>
<p>Then upload the program using&nbsp;a USB to Serial board, as described above.&nbsp;See the MegaCoreX documentation for further details.</p>

      <h2 id="welcome-to-jacobin-jvm">Welcome to Jacobin JVM</h2>

<p>Jacobin is an implementation of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/">JVM specification for Java 17</a>. It is written entirely in Go with no dependencies.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide a more-than-minimal implementation of the JVM that can run most class files and JARs and deliver the same results as the OpenJDK-based JVMs (that is, the majority of JVM implementations today). A paramount consideration in the design and implementation of Jacobin is the codebase: making it cohesive and containing clear code. The cohesiveness, extensive commenting, and large test suite enable professionals who want to know more about how the JVM works to find the information quickly and in an easily accessible setting. Additional information on the <a href="https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin/wiki/Jacobin-Documentation-Home">Jacobin wiki</a> provides more background and insight. Because Jacobin is strictly a JVM, its code is tightly focused on Java program execution. An important factor in reducing the size of the codebase and executable is that Jacobin relies on Go’s built-in memory management to perform garbage collection, and so it contains no GC code.</p>

<p>Due to our desire for an utterly reliable product, Jacobin is heavily tested during development. As of February 2023, the test code is 231% the size of the production code and consists of more than 400 tests. We’re committed to increasing these numbers. When Jacobin advances some more, we intend to run the OpenJDK test suites against it.</p>

<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>

<p>The current status is shown <a href="https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin">here</a>. Updates are also posted in realtime on the <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobin_jvm">Jacobin Twitter account</a>.There are currently no packaged releases of Jacobin available (although you can always compile the code). We’ll issue releases when Jacobin is mature enough to run classes as expected.</p>

<p>At present, all tasks and defects are logged in an instance of JetBrains’ <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack</a> (kindly provided at no cost). The task numbers appear at the start of the comment for every commit and push. The GitHub ‘issues’ facility is used strictly for issues posted by users. This design allows users to find solutions without needing to dig through numerous unrelated matters.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For almost a complete decade—starting with discovering Haskell in about 2009 and right up until switching to a job where I used primarily Ruby and C++ in about 2019—I would have called myself first and foremost a Haskell programmer.</p>

<p>Not necessarily a dogmatic Haskeller! I was—and still am—proudly a polyglot who bounces between languages depending on the needs of the project. However, Haskell was my default language for new projects, and in the absence of strongly compelling reasons to use other languages I would push for Haskell. I used it for command-line tools, for web services, for graphical applications, for little scripts…</p>

<p>At this point, though, I think of my Haskell days as effectively behind me. I haven't aggressively sworn it off—this isn't a “Haskell is dead to me!” piece—but it's no longer my default language even for personal projects, and I certainly wouldn't deliberately seek out “a job in Haskell” in the same way I once did.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to talk about why <em>I</em> fell away from Haskell. I should say up front: <strong>this is a piece about why I left Haskell, and not about why you should.</strong> I don't think people are wrong for using Haskell, or that Haskell is bad. In fact, if I've written this piece the way I hope to write it, I would hope that people read it and come away with a desire to maybe learn Haskell themselves!</p>

<h2 id="what-drew-me-to-haskell">What drew me to Haskell?</h2>

<p>The absolute biggest pull for me, when first coming to Haskell, wasn't monads or DSLs or even types. The biggest pull was the ability to reason about code symbolically and algebraically.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, that might sound like some pretentious nonsense. Bear with me.</p>

<p>The idea here is that certain transformations in Haskell are always correct, which allows you to reason about code in a mechanical but powerful way. A simple example: in Haskell, we can look at a function call and replace it by the body of that function. Say, if we have a function <code>double n = n + n</code>, and we call it with some expression <code>x</code>, we can replace <code>double x</code> with <code>x + x</code> no matter what <code>x</code> is.</p>

<p>This property isn't true in <em>most</em> other programming languages! For example, in many imperative languages, this transformation will fail if we call <code>double</code> with <code>i++</code> for some variable <code>i</code>: the reason is that <code>i++</code> modifies the value of <code>i</code>, so <code>double(i++)</code> (which increments <code>i</code> once) will of course produce a different value than <code>(i++) + (i++)</code> (which increments <code>i</code> twice.)</p>

<p>“So what?” you might ask, and that's fair. However, this starts to be <em>very</em> appealing in that certain ways of changing your code are always going to be mechanically correct. This is <em>unbelievably</em> liberating. There's a kind of fearless refactoring that it enables, where certain mechanical transformations, each easily verified as correct, can be stacked on top of each other to do wild but ultimately safe changes to your code overall. Doing large refactorings in, say, a Ruby codebase can be <em>deeply</em> harrowing, while doing large refactorings in a Haskell codebase can be a complete breeze.</p>

<p>Or, as the mathematician Hermann Weyl once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>We now come to the decisive step of mathematical abstraction: we forget what the symbols stand for. ...[The mathematician] need not be idle; there are many operations which he may carry out with these symbols, without ever having to look at the things they stand for.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This same approach—forgetting what the code means and yet still being able to transform it in productive and powerful ways—is possible with Haskell more than with any other language I've used<sup id="fnref:abstr"><a href="#fn:abstr" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, the other big pull for Haskell is the type system. There's a lot to be said about the totality of modern Haskell's type system, but the core Haskell language strikes a spectacular balance between having a strict type system without it being <em>too</em> noisy or restrictive. Type inference means that most types are implicit in the code, making the process of writing types significantly less onerous than in something like Java, and the flexibility and convenience of typeclasses means that even when you need to think about the types, they're often not <em>too</em> fussy (compared to, say, OCaml's requirement that you use different versions of the arithmetic operators for integers and floats.) At the same time, the fact that the type system can sometimes get in your way is part of the reason <em>for</em> using Haskell.</p>

<p>I would describe good Haskell code as “brittle”, and I mean that as a compliment. People tend to casually use “brittle” to mean “prone to breakage”, but in materials science what “brittle” means is that something breaks <em>without bending</em>: when a brittle material reaches the limits of its strength, it fractures instead of deforming. Haskell is a language where abstractions do not “bend” (or permit invalid programs) but rather “break” (fail to compile) in the face of problems.</p>

<p>And that's often what you want! For example, Haskell has a <code>NonEmpty</code> type which represents a list which is guaranteed to contain at least one element. Operations on <code>NonEmpty</code> which preserve the same length (like modifying each element with <code>map</code>) or which are guaranteed to add to the length (like combining two <code>NonEmpty</code> lists with <code>append</code>) will return <code>NonEmpty</code>. Other operations which reduce the number of elements potentially to zero, like using <code>filter</code> to remove items that match a predicate, will return a plain list, since there's no guarantee they <em>will</em> be non-empty! In other programming languages, you might informally say, “I know that this thing will always have at least one element,” but in Haskell, it is idiomatic to express this directly in the type system and have the compiler double-check your logic.</p>

<p>So if you have a program where you need to supply, say, a <code>NonEmpty</code> list of file paths to examine, then you <em>can't</em> just pass the command-line args to this function directly, because those might be empty: you <em>must</em> check that they're not empty first and handle the empty case accordingly. If I later on add a filtering step, only keeping the files with a relevant file extension, then I <em>must</em> check for an empty resulting list, because I literally <em>cannot</em> accidentally pass an empty list to the function. This program is “brittle” because it can fail to compile in the face of changes which aren't safe, which is <em>incredibly</em> powerful<sup id="fnref:diach"><a href="#fn:diach" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Over time, writing Haskell means you start building programs in a way that maintains program invariants using types so that the compiler can double-check them. Sometimes people take that to mean stuff like type-level computation, but “express invariants using types” can be much simpler. It can mean something as simple as wrapper types for strings to represent whether they've been SQL-escaped, so that your web API gives you a <code>RawString</code> but your database abstraction only accepts <code>SanitizedString</code> and you can't accidentally introduce a code path which forgets to sanitize it. It can mean converting a surface representation filled with <code>Maybe</code> fields and turning it to an internal representation where information is guaranteed to exist. It can mean something being <em>just</em> generic enough to test in isolation.</p>

<p>And Haskell's other strength is that the language itself is malleable and powerful, which enables terse domain-specific languages without things like macros. Some of the code I'm the proudest of in Haskell has been simple domain specific languages: an example is my <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/config-ini" rel="nofollow">config-ini</a> library, a library for working with INI configuration files. Instead of setting up an imperative interface to convey how to parse an INI file into your application-specific configuration, you set up a <em>declarative</em> interface that maps specific parts of your configuration type (via lenses) to specific parts of the structure of an INI file, which in turn lets you use that interface to do reading, writing, and diff-minimal update<sup id="fnref:upd"><a href="#fn:upd" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>. This is accomplished with a simple monadic DSL:</p>

<pre><code>configParser :: IniSpec Config ()
configParser = do
  section "NETWORK" $ do
    cfHost .=  field "host" string
    cfPort .=  field "port" number
  section "LOCAL" $ do
    cfUser .=? field "user"
</code></pre>

<p>DSLs aren't the right choice for everything, but they can be a powerful tool when applied correctly, and Haskell also minimizes the amount of “magic” necessary to make them work. Unlike the elaborate dynamic metaprogramming which powers DSLs in something like Ruby, the features which power DSLs in Haskell are often just flexible syntax and the ability to overload things like monads. Some Ruby DSLs are “infectious”, since you need to do global monkeypatching to enable constructs like <code>2.days.ago</code>, but Haskell DSLs are often easy to scope to specific files or areas of code and can be clean in their implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, I think a related but understated strength of Haskell is just how natural it makes working with higher-order functions. This is partly syntax, partly semantics, and partly a good synergy between the two. I don't want to overstate the importance of syntax, but I think the fact that you can write <code>(+)</code> in Haskell and that means “a function which takes two numeric arguments and adds them” lets you gravitate towards that rather than other constructs. What's a function to pairwise multiply two lists in Haskell? It's simple:</p>

<pre><code>pairwiseSum = zipWith (*)
</code></pre>

<p>What's the equivalent in Ruby, a language which does have blocks and often permits some aggressive code golfing? It's still terser than, say, Java, but still much less so than the Haskell:</p>

<pre><code># assuming at least Ruby 2.7 for the block syntax
def pairwise_sum(xs, ys)
  xs.zip(ys).map {_1*_2}
end
</code></pre>

<p>I once heard it said that Haskell lets you work with functions the way Perl lets you work with strings. Lots of Haskell idioms, like monads, are perfectly expressible in other languages: Haskell just makes them feel natural, while writing a monad in many other languages feels like you have to do lots of busy-work.</p>

<h2 id="what-pushed-me-away-from-haskell">What pushed me away from Haskell?</h2>

<p>If I had to choose the three big factors that contributed to my gradual loss of interest in Haskell, they were these:</p>
<ul><li>the <strong>stylistic neophilia</strong> that celebrates esoteric code but makes maintenance a chore</li>
<li>the <strong>awkward tooling</strong> that makes working with Haskell in a day-to-day sense clunkier</li>
<li>the <strong>constant changes</strong> that require sporadic but persistent attention and cause regular breakages</li></ul>

<p>What do I mean by <strong>stylistic neophilia</strong> here? The Haskell community, as a whole, is constantly experimenting with and building new abstractions. Some of these are borrowed from abstract algebra or category theory, and permit abstract manipulation of various problem domains, while others result from pushing more computation to the type level in order restrict more invalid states and allow the compiler to enforce more specific invariants.</p>

<p>I think these are cool and I'm happy people are doing them! I'm glad that people are experimenting with things like, say, <a href="https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">expressing web APIs at the type level</a> or <a href="https://arthurxavierx.github.io/RealWorldAppComonadicUI.pdf" rel="nofollow">using comonads to express menu systems</a>. These push at the very boundaries of how to express code and address problem domains in radical new ways, bringing unexpected advantages and giving programmers new levels of expressiveness.</p>

<p>I also… don't really want to deal with them on a day-to-day basis. My personal experience has been that very often these sort-of-experimental approaches, while solving some issues, tend to cause many more issues than is apparent at first. An experience I've had <em>several</em> times throughout my Haskell-writing days—both in personal and professional code—is that we'll start with a fancy envelope-pushing approach, see some early advantages, and then eventually tear it out once we discover that the disadvantages have grown large enough that the approach was a net drag on our productivity.</p>

<p>A good concrete example here is a compiler project I was involved in where our first implementation had AST nodes which used a type parameter to represent their expression types: in effect, this made it impossible to produce a syntax tree with a type error, because if we attempted this, our compiler itself wouldn't compile. This approach <em>did</em> catch a few bugs as we were first writing the compiler! It also made many optimization passes into labyrinthine messes whenever they didn't strictly adhere to the typing discipline that we wanted: masses of casts and lots of work attempting to appease the compiler for what should have been simple rewrites. In that project, we eventually removed the type parameter from the AST, because we'd probably have run out of budget if we finished the compiler <em>and</em> appeased GHC every time we tried to write an optimization.</p>

<p>This wasn't an isolated incident: I'd say that in three-quarters of the projects I worked on where we tried a “fancy types” approach, we ended up finding them not worth it. It's also not just me: the entire <a href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/" rel="nofollow">Simple Haskell</a> movement<sup id="fnref:simple"><a href="#fn:simple" rel="nofollow">4</a></sup> is predicated on the idea that you get the most benefits out of the language by eschewing the fancier experimental features and sticking to minimal extensions.</p>

<p>And yet, fancier type features are pervasive in the broader community. New libraries are often designed around the fancier features, and there's even a cottage industry of alternative takes on the standard library that try to embed more complicated type features directly into the basic operations of the language. This also informs the direction of the language: you start getting into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756" rel="nofollow">linear types</a> and even <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/dependent-haskell" rel="nofollow">a Haskell-ey take on dependent types</a>, and then those start creeping into libraries you might use, as well.</p>

<p>It can also be an uphill battle to hold the line against these fancier type explorations! As my friend and fellow Haskell programmer Trevor once said, <a href="https://twitter.com/moltarx/status/1004401148415991808" rel="nofollow">“The road to hell is paved with well-intentioned GADT usage.”</a> Many of these fancily-typed constructs <em>are</em> appealing and do bring some advantages, and many of the disadvantages are delayed. Often, these features make things difficult to change or maintain, which means it can be weeks or months or even years before the drawbacks become fully apparent. And on various occasions, I've replaced complicatedly-typed abstractions with much simplified versions, only to see subsequent programmers notice the lack of fancy types<sup id="fnref:io"><a href="#fn:io" rel="nofollow">5</a></sup> and try to replace those simple abstractions with various kinds of cutting-edge type-level abstractions, only to see the code blow up in size, drop in performance, and lose much of its readability.</p>

<p>As I said before, I don't fault people for exploring these idioms, and it's not impossible to find examples that <em>do</em> end up pulling their weight. (Using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/11/trees-that-grow.pdf" rel="nofollow">data structures indexed by compiler phase</a> is a good example of a “fancy type-level feature” that I've found remarkably useful in the past.) But keeping up with all of it is alienating and exhausting, and at some point, it wasn't a stretch for me to look at the celebration of type-level exploration and the amount of work it took to keep it <em>away</em> from the code I was writing and consequently think, “Do I really belong here?”</p>

<p>The <strong>awkward tooling</strong> is something that I think is sort of obvious if you've tried writing Haskell for any length of time. We've got multiple standard-ish build systems including <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/" rel="nofollow">Cabal</a> and <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/" rel="nofollow">Stack</a> (and I'm led to believe that <a href="https://rules-haskell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>rules_haskell</code> for Bazel</a> is decent now although I haven't tried it), as well as linters like <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint" rel="nofollow">hlint</a>, editor integrations like <a href="https://github.com/jyp/dante" rel="nofollow">Dante</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" rel="nofollow">Haskell Language Server</a>, autoformatters like <a href="https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany/" rel="nofollow">brittany</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tweag/ormolu" rel="nofollow">ormolu</a>…</p>

<p>All these tools are, well, fine, or at least fine-ish. They usually do what they need to. I am quite confident I have never <em>loved</em> any of them: at best, they did what they needed to do with minimal hassle (which has been my experience with, for example, <code>ormolu</code>) and at worst they've had constant bugs and required regular workarounds but more or less got the job done. It's quite possible that things have changed drastically since I was more involved in Haskell, but during the decade that I was, tooling certainly improved<sup id="fnref:impr"><a href="#fn:impr" rel="nofollow">6</a></sup> but never really shined.</p>

<p>A big problem is the perpetual Not-Invented-Here where people constantly try to build the newest, best thing. This isn't at all unique to Haskell—in fact, complaints about Haskell build systems look petty next to Python's Hieronymous Bosch-esque ecosystem of build tools and environment managers—but it's still frustrating to see people constantly trying to reinvent every little detail (down to the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpack" rel="nofollow">textual format for Haskell packages</a>, one thing I'm reasonably convinced they got perfectly right<sup id="fnref:hpack"><a href="#fn:hpack" rel="nofollow">7</a></sup>) and then leaving it about 95% finished for years.</p>

<p>And if I'm spending my working day with a language, I want the tooling to be <em>great</em>. I want it to be something I can celebrate, something I can brag about. I think <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" rel="nofollow">Rust's cargo</a> is such a tool: I regularly find things about it that are <em>great</em>, and add-ons that make it even better. At least as of 2019 when I was last writing Haskell, there was no Haskell tool that came even close to Cargo's ease-of-use and stability.</p>

<p>Again, I don't think Haskell tools are abysmal, they're just… fine. And at this point, I think my bar for tools has gotten higher than “just fine”.</p>

<p>Finally, I mentioned the <strong>constant changes</strong>, by which I mean the way that the Haskell language itself undergoes regular backwards-incompatible revisions. This has been going for a long time: I mean, just look at this joke I tweeted back in 2015, in response to the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldable_Traversable_In_Prelude" rel="nofollow">Foldable-Traversable Prelude changes</a>, sometimes at the time also called the “Burning Bridges Proposal”.</p>

  — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211114020858/https://twitter.com/aisamanra/status/654715266283147267" rel="nofollow">getty (@aisamanra), 2015-10-15</a></blockquote>

<p>The way that Haskell-the-language evolves—well, the way that GHC evolves, which is <em>de facto</em> Haskell since it's the only reasonable public<sup id="fnref:public"><a href="#fn:public" rel="nofollow">8</a></sup> implementation—is that it gradually moves to correct its past missteps and inconsistencies even in pretty fundamental parts of the language or standard libraries. This is in many ways good: there's an attitude in some communities that past mistakes are unfortunate but we need to live with them. People in the Haskell community often reject this idea: why not improve things? Why not fix what we see as clunky mistakes in the standard library? These changes move the foundations of Haskell towards a cleaner and more consistent set of primitives, making it a better language overall.</p>

<p>But oh my god they're <em>annoying</em>.</p>

<p>Very few of the changes are particularly onerous—indeed, they often are accompanied by analyses which show that only such-and-such a fraction of Hackage projects will be affected by them—but they all amount to persistent friction. If I grab an old Haskell project, even one without <em>any</em> external dependencies, I can often safely assume that it won't build any more with any recent version of GHC because everything has been changed just a little tiny bit. The fixes are often tiny, but they add up. Things are always just a little different than they used to be, just different enough that they require your attention: adding a superclass there, removing an import there, adding a type signature since this thing turned just polymorphic enough that the code is ambiguous…</p>

<p>And you know what? It <em>doesn't have to be like this</em>. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2052" rel="nofollow">Look at the way Rust does updates with epochs</a>. The Rust language explicitly builds in contracts of backwards-compatibility: if you use things that are stable, then they won't intentionally break. Intentional breaking changes are hidden behind epochs. I've got old Rust projects which I can return to and continue to build and develop without similar tedium from the language itself.</p>

<p>I think there's a common thread between these three things I mentioned: none of them, especially in isolation, are so painful that you can't just deal with them. You <em>can</em> write Haskell without fancy type features, evaluating the worthwhile ones and holding the line against the costly ones. You <em>can</em> use Haskell's perfectly alright tooling if you don't mind the occasional bug or missing feature or clunky workflow. You <em>can</em> follow compiler changelogs and do sporadic codebase updates every other release cycle. They're bumps in the road, but you've still got a road: if the destination is worth it, what's a few bumps?</p>

<p>I still think Haskell is a great language. The only thing that changed is my tolerance for the bumps.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-still-miss-from-haskell">What do I still miss from Haskell?</h2>

<p>All the stuff I said about Haskell above? All that still holds and I genuinely think it's true. I miss being able to write and refactor code algebraically: even when writing Rust, a language which I very much like and which has a <em>lot</em> of the same strengths as Haskell, I miss the ability to do small mechanical refactorings and know that I'm maintaining the meaning of the program.<sup id="fnref:refact"><a href="#fn:refact" rel="nofollow">9</a></sup></p>

<p>And the type-system, too! It's true that other languages have developed more sophisticated type systems—mainstream languages in 2023 have a <em>lot</em> more you can do with static types than they did in 2009—but Haskell's type system still has features that others typically lack, even without the whole menagerie of extensions: abstracting over higher-kinded types is an obvious example here.</p>

<p>The Haskell library ecosystem is a real mixed bag—from the typical half-maintained churn of open source libraries to the weird little kingdoms of individual authors trying to reinvent the universe in their own image to the entire tedious gamut of sadly-necessary-but-all-different string-like types—but there are some pretty spectacular libraries and abstractions in Haskell that are only half-possible in other languages. Lenses, for example, are really cool in a way that's hard to grasp if you haven't used them much. I look forward to seeing them poorly half-implemented in mainstream languages in the 2030's.</p>

<p>Haskell libraries also are often declarative by necessity, but those APIs end up being a pleasure to use: a favorite example here is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick" rel="nofollow">the Brick terminal UI library</a>, whose simple declarative building blocks end up producing by far the best TUI library I've ever used, but the diagram-creation library <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams" rel="nofollow">diagrams</a> or the music-writing library <a href="https://music-suite.github.io/docs/ref/" rel="nofollow">music-suite</a> are other great examples. In these cases, there's often nothing preventing similar libraries from existing in other languages, but they tend to get built in Haskell first by pure functional necessity.</p>

<p>A thing that seems small, but which I miss a ton, is <code>do</code>-notation. Or, well, I don't care as much about <code>do</code> notation specifically as “any notation which lets you add more bindings without adding indentation for each level of binding”, which Haskell lets you do with both <code>do</code>-notation and with terse lambda syntax and optional operators. There are many abstractions—monadic and not—where nesting lambdas <em>would</em> be a convenient way of expressing APIs, but in most languages nesting callbacks like this ends up being a big ugly hassle of rightward drift. Consider this Ruby usage of <code>flat_map</code> to come up with a list of possible ice cream servings, where each additional axis adds yet another layer of indentation:</p>

<pre><code>def all_flavors =
  [:vanilla, :chocolate, :strawberry].flat_map do |flavor|
    [:cone, :cup].flat_map do |container|
      [:sprinkles, :nuts, :fudge].flat_map do |topping|
        ["a #{container} of #{flavor} ice cream with #{topping} on top"]
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent Haskell here?</p>

<pre><code>allFlavors :: [String]
allFlavors = do
  flavor &lt;- ["vanilla", "chocolate", "strawberry"]
  container &lt;- ["cone", "cup"]
  topping &lt;- ["sprinkles", "nuts", "fudge"]
  pure ("a " &lt;&gt; container &lt;&gt; " of " &lt;&gt; flavor &lt;&gt;
        " ice cream with " &lt;&gt; topping &lt;&gt; "on top")
</code></pre>

<p>…yes, I know this is a cartoon example. However, there are plenty of places where having Haskell's sugar can be <em>incredibly</em> powerful. You can, for example, build a convenient and good-looking library for <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>-style structured concurrency on top of <code>do</code>-notation by yourself in an afternoon, while most other mainstream languages had to deal with vicious bikeshedding for years before finally coming up with a halfway-usable <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax<sup id="fnref:async"><a href="#fn:async" rel="nofollow">10</a></sup>, to say nothing of the ability to trivially embed <a href="https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/software-transactional-memory.html" rel="nofollow">concurrent transactions</a> or <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/PFP_JFP06.pdf" rel="nofollow">probabilistic programs</a> in Haskell code using the exact same lightweight sugar.</p>

<p>So when I say say that I've fallen out of love with Haskell, it is <em>definitely</em> not because there's nothing in Haskell to love!</p>

<h2 id="so-should-i-use-haskell-or-not">So should I use Haskell or not?</h2>

<p>Regardless of what programming language you're talking about, there is always a single correct response to the question, “Should I learn or use this programming language?” And that answer is, “It ultimately depends on your goals.”</p>

<p>Are you trying to become a better programmer in general? Then yes, absolutely, learn Haskell! I think this article should make it clear that Haskell is a fascinating and powerful language, and I think the learning experience is <em>more</em> than worth it. Haskell made me a better programmer, and I will continue to think so even if I never write another line of Haskell in my life<sup id="fnref:scargot"><a href="#fn:scargot" rel="nofollow">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Are you trying to <em>use</em> it for something? Well, my answer is more restrained, but I don't think the answer is a clear “no”. I think you should be honest about the advantages you get from Haskell—and those advantages are real!—and weigh them against your personal or organizational tolerance for the bumps I've described. I know for a fact that it's not impossible to either individually or as a group get enough benefit out of Haskell that the paper-cuts I've described stay just that: tiny paper-cuts. I know this both because I've worked at such organizations, because I've <em>been</em> such a person, and have many friends who remain Haskell people even as I've drifted away from it.</p>

<p>However, if you pressed me further for a commitment to a yes-or-no answer, my answer would be: no, don't use Haskell. If I were tasked with building an engineering organization, I'd personally stay away from establishing Haskell as the default language, because I know both the value of good tooling and the cost of bad tooling, and I'd rather find a language where I could offer programmers some of the best tooling with a stable language and a clear code ecosystem right away. But even then, I'm not 100% confident in that answer: after all, Haskell does offer some remarkable tools for program safety and correctness, and suffering through poor tooling and linting against unnecessary type families <em>might</em>—maybe, in the right contexts—be worth it for that extra safety<sup id="fnref:glib"><a href="#fn:glib" rel="nofollow">12</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It's kind of a bittersweet conclusion! I'm incredibly happy for the time I've spent learning and writing Haskell, and I think the world would be worse if Haskell wasn't in it. And in all honesty, I think part of the value we get out of Haskell is <em>because</em> of—and not in spite of—some of the rough edges above. I'm glad that people experiment with type system features I don't want to use, because with effort and research and time (and no small amount of obtuse error messages) those features will become the powerful type system features of tomorrow that underlie safer, more expressive, more powerful tools and languages! This, after all, is why Haskell's old motto was “Avoid success at all costs.”</p>

<p>It's just not for me any more.</p>

The combination of strict schema, ACID transactions, and strong integrity makes it still the best storage choice for many apps even today. Although sounding unfathomable and dull, database systems have been a highly vibrant domain in the past few years. Many talents are devoted to it, open source projects are created one after another, companies have been striving to build profitable businesses, and VCs have been making bets on those who look like the next unicorns.</p><p id="122f">Under the flourishing surface, the new generation of modern SQL databases is renovating this 50-year-old technology and gradually reshaping how we use it to build web applications — what we do with it, how we manage it, and how we program against it. This series of articles tries to explore this topic from multiple fronts, including:</p><ul><li id="9046">Serverless &amp; Edge</li><li id="9496">Programmability</li><li id="0cc5">Integration with Development Flow</li><li id="7e97">AI Capabilities</li></ul><p id="8a51">Let’s talk about “Serverless” and “Edge-Ready” today.</p></div><div><p id="0a81">“Serverless” is a broad term and can mean many different things in different contexts. It generally means a system manages itself (doesn’t require low-level operations) and automatically scales resources up and down based on needs. More specifically, for databases, you don’t need to worry about version upgrades, security patching, backup &amp; restore, monitoring, failover, etc. The system is resilient and appears to have an elastic amount of computation power and storage capacity.</p><p id="1a34">Besides the simplicity of operation, serverless databases also differ in their cost model. Since there’re “no servers” anymore, you end up paying for the “logical” usage instead of physical hardware. Beware, this doesn’t necessarily mean a reduction in overall cost, though.</p><p id="1ada">Serverless databases are not a new thing. AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Aurora</a> back in 2017, and since then, cloud-native database services have allowed developers to provision, configure, and scale their databases all via APIs without caring about the underlying infrastructure details. However, the new challengers, like <a href="https://planetscale.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PlanetScale</a> and <a href="https://neon.tech/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Neon</a>, are pushing the “serverless-ness” to a new level, and some of the improvements have made them a much more natural fit into the “moving to the edge” architecture trend.</p><p id="931c">Let’s see how.</p><h2 id="ac27">Connection Pooling</h2><p id="a619">One of the top headaches of using SQL databases is hitting its connection limit. Connections are heavy-weighted database constructs — each comes with a non-trivial cost of allocating memory reservations for sessions, transactions, etc. Traditionally, developers have two choices to deal with it. One is to do connection pooling on the application side (either with application code or with the help of frameworks). It requires careful planning of the pool sizing, and the application code also needs to avoid holding a connection for an extended period of time when processing requests (usually due to long-running transactions), as it may result in the exhaustion of the pool. The other choice is to use tools like <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pgbouncer</a> to put a proxy in front of the database, which internally manages a pool of connections. The downside is obvious, too — you have one more service to operate.</p><p id="6093">The connection pool management problem is not so bad in a traditional app hosting environment with long-running Node.js processes serving client requests. However, it can become prohibitive in edge environments because, for every incoming request, a new runtime is spawned to serve it, creating a new database connection. Such high-frequency churning can very quickly degrade the performance of a database.</p><p id="a80b">The new generation of databases is baking connection pooling into their systems, so you don’t need to worry about it anymore. PlanetScale, thanks to the support from underlying Vitess, proudly announced that they’d tested one million concurrent connections in a real-world environment.</p><p id="8faa">Neon, the latest Postgres hoster, has a built-in pgbouncer service, and you can simply use the “pool-enabled” connection string to leverage it.</p><h2 id="538e">Edge-Ready Drivers</h2><p id="d6f6">Regarding supporting connections from the edge, having connection pooling only solves half of the problem. The other half is unsophisticated — many edge environments don’t support making arbitrary TCP outbound connections; only HTTP(s) and WebSocket are allowed. Most SQL databases use a custom TCP-based network protocol. It means you can’t connect to them from the edge at all. You can probably use an HTTP → TCP proxy to tunnel the traffic or an API wrapping service like PostgREST to make it (partly) work, but they’re either brittle or result in unnecessary performance costs.</p><p id="b512">Things have been changing fast. PlanetScale announced its “Fetch API-compatible” database driver a few months ago, making it fully useable from Vercel Edge Runtime and Cloudflare Workers. Neon also <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/serverless-driver-for-postgres" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">released an edge-ready driver</a> by the end of 2022, allowing you to query with HTTP fetch (best for single-shot queries) or WebSocket (for sessions and transactions).</p><p id="c52b">On a separate spectrum, <a href="https://prisma.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Prisma</a> — the most popular Node.js ORM, also opened its “Accelerate” service (previously known as Data Proxy) to everyone (still in the Preview stage) a few days ago. Among all its features, one of its key offerings is acting as a managed proxy in front of traditional databases and making them “edge ready” by providing built-in connection pooling and exposing HTTP-based endpoints. The only change you need to make is using a new connection string, and your entire code base stays the same.</p><h2 id="7ba6">Separation of Compute and Storage</h2><p id="4bc4">Another fascinating progress in the serverless SQL database world is the separation of “Compute” and “Storage”. Yes, I’m explicitly talking about Neon here since it was the first to pioneer the concept and did it exceptionally well.</p><p id="340c">You may argue that it’s not a new thing. With AWS RDS, if you use EBS as storage, your Compute and Storage are already “separated”. However, it’s important to mention that the RDS scenario is “physical separation”. What Neon did was “logical separation” — Compute and Storage are distinct components at the architecture level, and this has enabled many interesting new capabilities.</p><figure><figcaption>By <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/architecture-overview" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neon.tech</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a28a">There’re some apparent benefits of this architectural choice:</p><ul><li id="b44e"><strong>Independent scaling<br></strong>Compute can be independently scaled up and down, even to zero. For workloads with different characteristics, you can allocate dedicated Compute endpoints and scale them independently while, underlyingly, they share the same unified storage.</li><li id="e430"><strong>Effortless branching<br></strong>Neon’s storage system uses a non-overwriting format, meaning that writes are stored as delta, and historical data can be preserved for as long a period of time as needed. It makes it very cheap to create “branches” for your databases (for the same reason why branching in GIT is cheap) and assign separate compute endpoints to them. How is that useful? For every feature branch, you can branch your database together with source code for development and testing. Isn’t that a very cool thing?</li></ul><p id="89a5">It is an excellent example of a complete rethinking of what a “serverless” database can mean!</p><h2 id="c799">Storing on The Edge</h2><p id="68a2">A big dilemma of “moving to the edge” is that although the computation happens close to the user, the data it needs to fetch still resides in data centers. The slow fetching process can largely cancel the performance gain and sometimes result in a negative net improvement. It’s all because data is not stored on the edge. Or can they?</p><p id="716d"><a href="https://turso.tech/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Turso</a> is an interesting new database service that wraps SQLite into a cloud database distributed directly on the edge for both Storage and Compute. SQLite has a very low footprint and is an ideal choice to run on the commodity hardware of edge nodes. The idea is to replicate entire databases from a central primary location to a selected set of edge regions (hosted by Fly.io). It provides the best possible performance for the end users because Compute and Storage are colocated close to the user.</p><p id="296c">Of course, the benefit doesn’t come without a downside. Turso is essentially a globally distributed single-write multi-read database. All writes must be made to a central primary instance and replicated to edge nodes. Before the replication completes, readers can see inconsistent results. Given that the replication needs to go through very long distances and many network hops, the time it takes to complete can be long and fluctuant. Nonetheless, not every application requires immediate consistency, and Turso can be an excellent choice for some.</p></div><div><h2 id="e66c">Wrap Up</h2><p id="e65a">I hope you find the advances of these serverless and edge-ready databases as exciting as I do. They’re making developers focus more on building the applications instead of managing the infrastructure and, at the same time enabling new opportunities for better performance.</p><p id="e97f">Meanwhile, being able to query from the edge doesn’t mean you should just do it. “User-perceived performance” is an intricate topic, and you should always make a tailored decision based on your application’s specific traits and, most importantly, thoroughly test it out in the real world.</p><pre><span id="5f9d"><strong>Want to Connect?<br></strong><br>I'm the creator of <a href="https://zenstack.dev/?utm_campaign=medium&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=modern-sql-serverless" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ZenStack</a>, a toolkit that supercharges<br>Prisma ORM with a powerful access control layer and<br>unleashes its full potential for full-stack development.<br>Our goal is to let you save time writing boilerplate code<br>and focus on building what matters—the user experience.</span></pre></div></div>]]></description>

<p>United States Patent 3,216,423 APPARATUS FGR FACJILITATING THE BIRTH 9F A CHILD BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE George B. Blonsky and Charlotte E. Blonsky, both of 2440 Sedgwick Ave., New York 68, N.Y. Filed Jan. 15, 1963, Ser. No. 251,516 14 Claims. (Cl. 128361) The present invention relates to apparatus which utilizes centrifugal force to facilitate the birth of a child at less stress to the mother. </p>
<p> It is known, that due to natural anatomical conditions, the fetus needs the application of considerable propelling force to enable it to push aside the constricting vaginal walls, to overcome the friction of the uteral and vaginal surfaces and to counteract the atmospheric pressure opposing the emergence of the child. In the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, as is common with all more primitive peoples, nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case, however, with more civilized Women who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement. </p>
<p> It is the primary purpose of the present invention to provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts. </p>
<p> In accordance with the invention, there is provided rotatable apparatus capable of subjecting the mother and the fetus to a centrifugal force directed to assist and supplement the efforts of the mother so that such centrifugal force and her efforts act in concert to overcome the action of resisting forces and facilitate the delivery of the child. </p>
<p> For a better understanding of such apparatus, as well as the advantages and novel features thereof, reference is made to the following description which should be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a top plan view of apparatus embodying the invention and showing the expectant mother in position thereon; </p>
<p> FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1; </p>
<p>FIG. 3 is an end view taken from the left of FIG. 2; </p>
<p> FIG. 4 is a side elevational view of a modified form of the means for supporting the mother on the apparatus; and </p>
<p> FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 4 showing another embodiment of such means. </p>

When the operator moves the controller handle 21 from zero position the motor is started and through the speed reducer l7 and the associated set of sheaves and belts, including the sheaves l9 and 20, the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beam frame" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beam frame</figure-callout><p> 26 and everything supported thereby are revolved horizontally about the vertical axis of </p><figure-callout id="14" label="shaft" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">shaft</figure-callout><p> 14. As the operator moves the controller handle 21 to feed more and more current to the motor 15, the rotational speed of the machine progressively increases and so does the centrifugal force. The relationship of speed of rotation and of acceleration at three feet distance from the center of rotation is illustrated by the following table: </p></div>
<p> 1 Acceleration gs is equal to that caused by the gravitational force of the Earth. </p>
<div><p>Both the body of the mother and the fetus are subjected to centrifugal forces which are functions of distance from the center of rotation and the speed of rotation. The body of the mother is firmly held in position against movement as a whole under such forces by the </p><figure-callout id="73" label="boot members" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}"> <figure-callout id="73" label="boot members" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">boot members</figure-callout> </figure-callout><p> 73, 73, the </p><figure-callout id="68" label="thigh holders" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">thigh holders</figure-callout><p> 63, 68, the </p><figure-callout id="61" label="girdle" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">girdle</figure-callout><p> 61, the hand grips 79, 79, and the </p><figure-callout id="82" label="belts" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}"> <figure-callout id="83" label="belts" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}"> <figure-callout id="84" label="belts" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">belts</figure-callout> </figure-callout> </figure-callout><p> 82 ,83 and 84. However, there are no external means present which will interfere with the fetus tendency to respond to the action of the centrifugal force. Only those forces which oppose normal childbirth i.e. the frictional and constrictional forces within the mother, are to be overcome by the combined action of the mothers muscles and the centrifugal force created by the rotation of the fetus in the machine. The physicians estimate of how much of this centrifugal force will be needed to assist the mother in achieving the birth of the child and the maximum gs that can be used with safety on the particular patient, are decided upon before the operation. During the operation, the operator gradually speeds up the machine to the predetermined force which is expected to produce the birth of the child, and if such force does not accomplish this, he does not exceed it, unless the physician decides to go the higher gs. He cannot, however, go beyond the maximum gs for which the machine has been set without causing the governor to shut down the machine. When in the operation of the machine, the operator reaches a rate of rotation at which the combination of pressures produced both by the created centrifugal force and by the mother exceed the childbirth resisting forces (friction and constriction), the movement of the fetus occurs and the child is delivered into the net 88. While in the net, the child is still subjected to the action of centrifugal force and is caused by such force to firmly press against the elastic bottom of the net 88. As the </p><figure-callout id="89" label="elastic cables" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">elastic cables</figure-callout><p> 89 and the net give somewhat to this force Which is equal to the weight of the child multiplied by the number of gs it is subjected to, the </p><figure-callout id="97" label="cotton Wad" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">cotton Wad</figure-callout><p> 97 in the net is pressed by the child against the </p><figure-callout id="93" label="switch lever" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">switch lever</figure-callout><p> 93 which is actuated to cut the power from the motor 15 and may be utilized to activate an electric bell, announcing the event. The operator then applies the handbrake 18 to gently bring the machine to a complete stop. Thereupon, the stretcher with the mother on it is detached from the machine and transported to her room. </p></div>
<div><p> As has been above indicated, the apparatus depicted in FIGS. 1-3 of the drawings is shown by way of example and it is within the contemplation of the invention to include other embodiments containing the essential features thereof. Thus, instead of mounting the stretcher horizontally on the machine which is the preferred condition where the number of gs employed in accomplishing the birth of the child is relatively high (say above 8 gs), the machine may be constructed as is indicated in FIG. 4, to take care of births which may be brought about at much lower gs. In this connection, and before entering into a description of FIG. 4, it might be said that the centrifugal force carried by rotation of an object about a vertical axis has a horizontal direction, but due to the always present gravitational force, the actual force exerted on such object is a resultant of these two forces. The influence of the gravitational force on the direction of action of the resultant force is greatest at the lower rotational speeds, and its effect becomes progressively less and less important at the higher gs so that the direction of the resultant progressively approaches the horizontal. Therefore, in order to obtain the maximum elfect of the resultant on the fetus, especially at the lower rotational speeds, the mother should be placed in such a position on the machine as to obtain the nearest possible parallelism between the direction of action of the resultant and the line connecting the center of gravity of the fetus and the center point of the opening of the pelvis through which the fetus has to travel on its way out. To enable this to be accomplished at the lower rotational speeds, at which the gravitational force is of increasingly greater importance, it is necessary that the stretcher be given an inclination corresponding to the pre-diagnosed gs at which it is expected that delivery will take place. This may be accomplished by modifying the above described embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 3 of the drawings to the extent that the </p><figure-callout id="28" label="deck" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-2.png" state="{{state}}">deck</figure-callout><p> 28 of such embodiment is: dispensed with, and instead supporting the </p><figure-callout id="24" label="stretcher" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-2.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">stretcher</figure-callout><p> 24 directly on the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 and two </p><figure-callout id="120" label="standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">standards</figure-callout><p> 120 as is shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings.

Like the </p><figure-callout id="122" label="rod" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">rod</figure-callout><p> 122, the </p><figure-callout id="124" label="rod" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">rod</figure-callout><p> 124 extends through openings provided in the </p><figure-callout id="31" label="side channels" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">side channels</figure-callout><p> 31 of the stretcher.

<div><p> As is shown in FIG. of the drawings, it is also possible to have the stretcher automatically adjust its slope to the optimum direction at whatever rate of rotation it happens to be spinning at a given moment. This is achieved by hinging the stretcher at its head end on the </p><figure-callout id="120" label="standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">standards</figure-callout><p> 120 by means of a removable rod extending through openings provided in the </p><figure-callout id="31" label="side channels" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">side channels</figure-callout><p> 31 of the stretcher and </p><figure-callout id="125" label="openings" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">openings</figure-callout><p> 125 provided in </p><figure-callout id="120" label="such standards" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">such standards</figure-callout><p> 120" at a moderate height above the main I beams 26 of the machine, and letting the foot end of the stretcher rest freely on the outer ends of such I-beams. If, for example, the height of the </p><figure-callout id="125" label="openings" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-4.png" state="{{state}}">openings</figure-callout><p> 125 in standards 120' is selected so that the angle of repose of the stretcher corresponds to the angle of inclination the stretcher would assume when subjected to a centrifugal acceleration of two gs, no elevation of the foot end of the stretcher will occur before the speed of rotation is high enough to cause a horizontal component of two gs. As soon as that minimum is exceeded, the foot end of the stretcher will leave the surfaces of the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 and rise high-er and higher as the speed of rotation is increased, to provide the stretcher with a slope which corresponds to the resultant of the gravitational and acceleration forces at any given speed of rotation of the machine. Thus, as the physican slowly increases the gs to the value at which the travel of the fetus begins, the centrifugal and gravitational forces automatically adjust the inclination of the mothers body to the optimum position for efiicient application of the accelerating forces. This assures that the patient will be submitted to the very minimum acceleration which is necessary to produce the dislodgement of the fetus. When the child has been delivered and the mother cut out in the manner described in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, the foot of the stretcher willreturn to a gentle landing on the I-</p><figure-callout id="26" label="beams" filenames="US3216423-drawings-page-1.png,US3216423-drawings-page-3.png" state="{{state}}">beams</figure-callout><p> 26 as the machine decelerates. It will be understood, that in all of the embodiments of the invention it is the primary purpose of the apparatus disclosed to accomplish delivery of the fetus by providing the necessary gs required in any particular instance and this even though the supplementary forces supplied by the patient are zero either because she is too weak to render any assistance at all, or has lost consciousness. </p></div>

<p>Following up on the work from our <a href="https://blog.abacus.ai/blog/2023/07/27/treating-attention-deficit-disorder-in-llms/">previous blog post</a>, we are releasing today an arXiv paper titled <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10882">“Giraffe: Adventures in Expanding Context Lengths in LLMs”</a>.</p>



<p>Giraffe is a new family of models that are finetuned from base LLaMA and LLaMA2 that we release. We include a <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v1-delta-13b-scaled-4">4k Giraffe</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v1-delta-13b-scaled-16">16k Giraffe</a> finetuned from LLaMA, and a <a href="https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Giraffe-v2-13b-32k">32k Giraffe</a> finetuned from LLaMA2 and release their weights on HuggingFace. We also release our <a href="https://github.com/abacusai/Long-Context">training code, evaluation datasets, and evaluation scripts</a> to the research community.</p>



<p>This paper explores the topic of <em>context length extrapolation</em> of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been highly successful in natural language modelling tasks in recent years. Context length extrapolation is the use of a LLM that is trained on a short context length for evaluation on longer context lengths, without any further training on the long context being involved. Having a model that is capable of extrapolating to longer contexts is important for a range of tasks. For example, if you wanted to ask an LLM to retrieve information from a large corpus of data that you own, having a larger context capacity allows the model to attend to more of the corpus (or maybe even all of it!) at once, so it can do more complex retrievals with fewer mistakes. This could also be important for maintaining long conversations (think with an AI-powered chatbot), or for asking an LLM to help with coding on a large existing codebase.</p>



<p>Why can’t we just train the model on longer contexts though? The primary reason for this is that a key component of modern LLM architecture – called self-attention – scales quadratically in both memory and compute as context length increases, so there will quickly be a point where you don’t have sufficient GPUs, time or money to train for longer contexts. Hence having a method that can zero-shot extrapolate to context lengths never seen before is key.</p>



<p>There have been many methods proposed in recent work on context length extrapolation. In this paper we collate together what we believe are the most prominent approaches and test them thoroughly to determine which are the most effective. We also propose a couple of new approaches, one of which we call <em>truncation</em> and which shows some promising results.</p>



<p>One of the difficulties of assessing LLM performance is choosing the right evaluation methodology. The most commonly used metric in the literature is next-token perplexity, which measures how good the model is at predicting the next token given the preceding context. However, we believe that documents on which perplexity are measured often permit for a good performance simply by producing reasonably coherent text distributions conditional on a small subset of the entire available context. We show in this paper that perplexity is less sensitive for distinguishing long context performance between models for this reason than the new tasks that we introduced that are focused more strongly on <em>accuracy</em> of model recall than general text coherence.</p>



<p>These new tasks are <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/LongChat-Lines">LongChat-Lines</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/WikiQA-Free_Form_QA">FreeFormQA</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/abacusai/WikiQA-Altered_Numeric_QA">AlteredQA</a>. The first extends a key-value retrieval task introduced by <a href="https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat/tree/longeval">LongChat</a> to longer contexts. FreeFormQA and AlteredQA are formed from the <a href="https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/">Natural Questions Dataset</a> and are question-answering datasets based on Wikipedia. We release all three tasks as HuggingFace datasets.</p>



<p>There are still many open questions in the space of context length extrapolation of LLMs. As we show in the paper, none of the methods we investigate currently fully satisfies the brief of being able to truly extrapolate without some element of degradation in performance starting to creep in. We are interested in researching further on this topic and finding ways to resolve some of these issues; watch this space!</p>

This, in turn, invokes the branch predictor. What’s that? Here is ChatGPT’s explanation:</p><blockquote><p id="973d">Branch prediction is a technique used in modern microprocessors to improve the throughput of their instruction pipelines by guessing the outcome of a conditional branch instruction before it’s actually executed. Let’s delve deeper into why it’s needed and how it works.</p><p id="badd">The Need for Branch Prediction:</p><p id="ec4a">Microprocessors use pipelines to process multiple instructions simultaneously at different stages. Think of this like an assembly line in a factory, where different stages of a product are being worked on simultaneously. Each instruction goes through various stages like fetching, decoding, executing, and writing results.</p><p id="df3a">When a conditional branch instruction (like “if A is greater than B, jump to instruction X”) comes into the pipeline, the CPU needs to know which instruction to fetch next: the one right after the branch or the one at the target of the jump (instruction X in the example). If the CPU waits until the branch instruction is fully executed to know the outcome, the entire pipeline would stall, leading to inefficiencies.</p><p id="3f31">How Branch Prediction Works:</p><p id="f73f">To avoid these stalls, the CPU makes an educated guess or “predicts” the outcome of the branch. This prediction allows the CPU to speculatively fetch and execute subsequent instructions.</p><p id="8c1d">Challenges:</p><p id="cab5">The main challenge with branch prediction is ensuring accuracy. An incorrect prediction (a “misprediction”) causes the pipeline to be flushed, leading to wasted cycles and reduced performance. As such, a significant amount of research and engineering effort is dedicated to improving branch predictor accuracy. Despite these efforts, no predictor is perfect, especially in the face of complex software behaviors.</p></blockquote><p id="5a74">In this case, the array is increasing. As long as the predictor guesses “true” <code>if v &gt; maxV</code>, it predicts with perfect accuracy. This allows it to keep its pipeline full and execute the next instruction without delay, maximizing its efficiency.</p><p id="a69f"><code>cheat_max()</code>is a function that drops the <code>if v &gt; maxV </code>comparison altogether. It takes a shortcut by explicitly avoiding the work of comparison.</p><pre><span id="792b">func cheat_max(values []int) int {<br>    maxV := values[0]<br>    for _, v := range values[1:] {<br>        maxV = v<br>    }<br>    return maxV<br>}</span></pre><pre><span id="9aae">goos: darwin<br>goarch: arm64<br>pkg: github.com/ludi317/max/blog<br>      │ if_max_lol  │          cheat_max           │<br>      │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base         │<br>Fn-10   31.70µ ± 3%   31.62µ ± 1%  ~ (p=0.145 n=6)</span></pre><p id="79ee">As the results show, <code>if_max_lol()</code> is about as fast as if it had no if-statement at all. Branch prediction effectively removes the if-statement.</p><p id="3359">Of course, this is just a toy example. If you wanted to know the max value of an increasing array, simply return the last element. These benchmarks serve to illustrate that very one-sided if-statements are where branching performance shines.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>It's been over three years since my last blog post. I think that
the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog
posts became onerous. But I've taken the time to redo this website
using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, so it's quite easy to add blog
posts now, and plus I added
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">dark mode</a>.</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

<p>Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting
screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It
felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in
the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>However, I always knew that it would need to end. It's not really possible to use Twitter
without at least a little bit of doomscrolling, and that activity took a toll on me emotionally.
I think that the core concept of a "tweet" is fundamentally unhealthy, because by design it
promotes angry and extreme content. Nuance and subtlety is impossible to distinguish from
dog whistling. Most users don't understand that by "dunking" on someone, they are actually
promoting the content. In summary, it gave me a darker feeling about the world in general,
and in exchange, did not offer much to enrich my life.</p>

<p>So, when the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/enshittification">enshittification</a>
process kicked into high gear with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk</a>,
this was the perfect opportunity for me to make my exit.</p>

<p>It has now been a few months since I downloaded all my data and deleted my
account, and in retrospect it was so, so worth it. I feel more optimistic about
the world and human society in general. I interact with people around me with fewer preconceived
judgements about their belief systems. And finally, I have more nuanced conversations with my wife
and friends about politics and other hot topics, without worrying that I'm going to come off
as dog whistling or naysaying.</p>

<p>One thing I do miss is to have the ability to correct misinformation that I stumble upon in
the wild. For example, somebody linked me to <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1681343593208856576">this tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I cannot stop thinking about this.  Andrew created Zig and ~15 years ago asked on SO how to open a file in C++
</blockquote>

<p>(screenshot of this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7880/how-do-you-open-a-file-in-c">StackOverflow question</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
if you take this in any other way than this is incredible and motivating that you can accomplish anything with time + effort then you nuts/sad
</blockquote>

<p>It's a sweet sentiment! Unfortunately it's based on a bit of a misunderstanding.
If you look at the date the question was asked, it was August 11th, 2008.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow">According to Wikipedia</a>, StackOverflow launched on September 15th, 2008. How is this possible?</p>

<p>I'll tell you - if you look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow#cite_note-launches-1">the citation</a>,
it's a link to
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">the launch announcement</a> on <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky's blog</a> -
a blog that I was a huge fan of when I was 20 years old. The fact is that Stack Overflow actually was annouced before that, on a podcast episode with
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a>.</p>

<p>Being a bored intern at Lockheed Martin, because they failed to find me anything to do besides "learn XML", I enthusiastically participated in the launch of Stack Overflow, including asking basic questions such as "How do you open a file in C++?" in order to farm karma points. And it definitely worked! I have edit powers on that website now, and you can bet your ass I use them to clean up
misleading suggestions and stinky opinions whenever I see them.</p>

<p>Now, I don't want to poop on ThePrimeagen's parade, so I can find him some replacement lore.
Here you go, enjoy!
<a href="https://programmersheaven.com/discussion/142689/binary-files">Binary files - Programmers Heaven</a></p>

<blockquote>
 I don't have a clue about binary files. I'm a good programmer, have read more programming books than I can count, but still have no knowlege about binary files. Can you read them? Will they look like text? Is it good to use them? How can I print to a binary file, and then retreive from a binary file?
</blockquote>

<p>I was 14 years old when I wrote <em>this</em> cringefest. I think ThePrimeagen's take can survive transplanted from the Stack Overflow question to this forum post.</p>

<h2>Reddit</h2>

<p>Unlike Twitter, where I find the elemental unit of socializing problematic in and of itself,
I think the Reddit formula is solid gold. This one is a case of malevolent platform stewards.
I expect this from every platform run by for-profit entities, where the goal is not to serve
the users, but to milk them for capital gains. The grim reaper of capitalism has come
for Reddit.</p>

<p>Right now, venture capitalists are freaking out about "AI". Publicly-traded
businesses with access to structured user speech that can be used as
training data are rushing to build a moat around that data. That's why Twitter
prevented viewing tweets from logged out users, and Reddit locked down its APIs
despite it causing a massive protest from the moderators who do the actual
labor to keep the website running.</p>

<p>Detecting that Reddit enshittification was reaching terminal levels, I decided that during
these protests was the ideal time to close the /r/zig subreddit, which I was
currently a moderator of. I closed the subreddit, downloaded all my
user data, and permanently deleted my reddit account, leaving moderation to
<a href="https://kristoff.it/">Loris Cro</a>, VP of Community of
<a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">Zig Software Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Once Loris was the sole moderator, he decided to change the subreddit to read-only mode.
However, this was thwarted today when a troll (check their comment history)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/15rtit7/requesting_rzig/">performed a hostile takeover in broad daylight</a> and
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/15yoxok/rzig_is_reopened/">reopened the sub</a>.
It appears that Reddit admins are perfectly willing to forcibly replace moderators
in an effort to keep the system churning out user data. Those Large Language Models are hungry!</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't consider this to be a problem; it is outside of my control what Reddit does
with its own data. I just want to make it crystal clear that
<strong>Zig, Zig Software Foundation, and myself are not in any way affiliated
with /r/zig</strong>. That subreddit is now run by a third party and all signs
point to a high likelihood of problematic behavior happening there
which I definitely want to avoid being associated with.</p>

<p>If you want an alternative to a zig subreddit, give <a href="https://ziggit.dev/">Ziggit</a>
a try. This is the <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse forum
software</a> run by dude_the_builder,
a friendly Zig community member, and I find it to be a healthy and rewarding way of socializing
with other community members.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I have a Mastodon account, but I don't love it, for the same reasons I
didn't like Twitter. In addition, I think that way of consuming content
is generally like watching mainstream TV or listening to radio with ads. You're
letting a bunch of people who aren't really that important to you, or qualified
to do the job, be the content curators for you.</p>

<p>Discord has been decent for a while. I suspect enshittification will commence soon, so we
should be on the lookout for an alternative over the next five years.</p>

<p>I'm going to look into setting up an RSS reader for myself and start hunting for
high quality blogs.</p>

<p>And finally, I will be redirecting my micro-blogging energy that was previously wasted on
Twitter into actual-blogging energy here.</p>

</div><p>Back in 2019, Princeton University’s Arvind Narayanan, a professor of computer science and expert on algorithmic fairness, AI and privacy, shared a set of slides on Twitter called “AI Snake Oil.” The presentation, which claimed that “much of what’s being sold as ‘AI’ today is snake oil. It does not and cannot work,”&nbsp;quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1196870349574623232?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went viral</a>. </p>



<p>Narayanan, who was recently named director of Princeton’s <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>, went on to start an <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“AI Snake Oil” Substack</a> with his Ph.D. student Sayash Kapoor, previously a software engineer at Facebook, and the pair snagged a book deal to “explore what makes AI click, what makes certain problems resistant to AI, and how to tell the difference.” </p>



<p><strong><em>&gt;&gt;Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> coverage&lt;&lt;</em></strong></p>



<p>Now, with the generative AI craze, Narayanan and Kapoor are about to hand in a book draft that goes beyond their original thesis to tackle today’s gen AI hype, some of which they say has “spiraled out of control.”&nbsp;</p>

                        </p></div><p>I drove down the New Jersey Turnpike to Princeton University a few weeks ago to chat with Narayanan and Kapoor in person. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat: The AI landscape has changed so much since you first started publishing the AI Snake Oil Substack and announced the future publication of the book. Has your outlook on the idea of “AI snake oil” changed?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Narayanan: </strong>When I first started speaking about AI snake oil, it was almost entirely focused on predictive AI. In fact, one of the main things we’ve been trying to do in our writing is make clear the distinction between generative and predictive and other types of AI — and why the rapid progress in one might not imply anything for the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were very clear as we started the process that we thought the progress in gen AI was real. But like almost everybody else, we were caught off guard by the extent to which things have been progressing — especially the way in which it’s become a consumer technology. That’s something I would not have predicted.</p>



<p>When something becomes a consumer tech, it just takes on a massively different kind of significance in people’s minds. So we had to refocus a lot of what our book was about. We didn’t change any of our arguments or positions, of course, but there’s a much more balanced focus between predictive and gen AI now.</p>



<p><strong>Kapoor: </strong>Going one step further, with consumer technology there are also things like product safety that come in, which might not have been a big concern for companies like OpenAI in the past, but they become huge when you have 200 million people using your products every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the focus on AI has shifted from debunking predictive AI — pointing out why these textures cannot work in any possible domain, no matter no matter what models you use, no matter how much data you have — to gen AI, where we feel that they need more guardrails, more responsible tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat: </strong>W<strong>hen we think of snake oil, we think of salespeople. So in a way, that is a consumer-focused idea. So when you use that term now, what is your biggest message to people, whether they’re consumers or businesses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Narayanan: </strong>We still want people to think about different types of AI differently — that is our core message. If somebody is trying to tell you how to think about all types of AI across the board, we think they’re definitely oversimplifying things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to gen AI, we clearly and repeatedly acknowledge in the book that this is a powerful technology and it’s already having useful impacts for a lot of people. But at the same time, there’s a lot of hype around it. While it’s very capable, some of the hype has spiraled out of control. </p>



<p>There are many risks. There are many harmful things already happening. There are many unethical development practices. So we want people to be mindful of all of that and to use their collective power, whether it’s in the workplace when they make decisions about what technology to adopt for their offices, or whether it’s in their personal life, to use that power to make change.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat:</strong> <strong>What kind of pushback feedback do you get from the wider community, not just on Twitter, but among other researchers in the academic community</strong>? </p>



<p><strong>Kapoor: </strong>We started the blog last August and we did not expect it to become as big as it has. More importantly, we did not expect to receive so much good feedback, which has helped us shape many of the arguments in our book. We still receive feedback from academics, entrepreneurs or in some cases large companies have reached out to us to talk about how they should be shaping their policy. In other cases, there has been some criticism, which has also helped us reflect on how we’re presenting our arguments, both on the blog but also in the book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, when we started writing about large language models (LLMs) and security, we had this blog post out when the original LLaMA model came out — people were taken aback by our stance on some incidents where we argued that AI was not uniquely positioned to make disinformation worse. Based on that feedback, we did a lot more research and engagement with current and past literature, and talked to a few people, which really helped us refine our thinking. </p>



<p><strong>Narayanan</strong>: We’ve also had pushback on ethical grounds. Some people are very concerned about the labor exploitation that goes into building gen AI. We are as well, we very much advocate for that to change and for policies that force companies to change those practices. But for some of our critics, those concerns are so dominant, that the only ethical course of action for someone who’s concerned about that is to not use gen AI at all. I respect that position. But we have a different position and we accept that people are going to criticize us for that.&nbsp;I think individual abstinence is not a solution to exploitative practices. A company’s policy change should be the response. </p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat: As you lay out your arguments in “AI Snake Oil,” what would you like to see happen with gen AI in terms of action steps? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Kapoor: </strong>At the top of the list for me is usage transparency around gen AI, how people actually use these platforms.&nbsp;Compared to say, Facebook, which puts out a quarterly transparency report saying, “Oh, these many people use it for hate speech and this is what we’re doing to address it.” For gen AI, we have none of that — absolutely nothing.&nbsp;I think something similar is possible for gen AI companies, especially if they have a consumer product at the end of the pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Narayanan:</strong> Taking it up a level from specific interventions to what might need to change structurally when it comes to policymaking. There need to be more technologists in government. So better funding of our enforcement agencies would help. People often think about AI policy as an issue where we have to start from scratch and figure out some silver bullet. That’s not at all the case. Something like 80% of what needs to happen is just enforcing laws that we already have and avoiding loopholes. </p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat: What are your biggest pet peeves as far as AI hype? Or what do you want people, individuals, enterprise companies using AI to keep in mind? For me, for example, it’s the anthropomorphizing of AI. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Kapoor:</strong> Okay, this might turn out to be a bit controversial, but we’ll see. In the last few months, there has been this increasing so-called rift between the AI ethics and AI safety communities. There is a lot of talk about how this is an academic rift that needs to be resolved, how these communities are basically aiming for the same purpose. I think the thing that annoys me most about the discourse around this is that people don’t recognize this as a power struggle. </p>



<p>It is not really about intellectual merit of these ideas. Of course, there are lots of bad intellectual and academic claims that have been made on both sides. But that isn’t what this is really about. It’s about who gets funding, which concerns are prioritized. So looking at it as if it is like a clash of individuals or a clash of personalities just really undersells the whole thing, makes it sound like people are out there bickering, whereas in fact, it’s about something much deeper.</p>



<p><strong>Navanayar: </strong>In terms of what everyday people should keep in mind when they’re reading a press story about AI, is to not be too impressed by numbers. We see all kinds of numbers and claims around AI — that ChatGPT scored 70% accurate on the bar exam, or let’s say there’s an earthquake detection AI that’s 80% accurate, or whatever. </p>



<p>Our view in the book is that these numbers mean virtually nothing. Because really, the whole ballgame is in how well the evaluation that someone conducted in the lab matches the conditions that AI will have to operate in the real world. And it’s because those can be so different. We’ve had, for instance, very promising proclamations on how close we are to self driving. But when you put cars out in the world, you start noticing these problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VentureBeat: How optimistic are you that we can deal with “AI Snake Oil”?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>Narayanan:</strong> I’ll speak for myself: I approach all of this from a place of optimism. The reason I do tech criticism is because of the belief that things can be better. And if we look at all kinds of past crises, things worked out in the end, but that’s because people worried about them at key moments. </p>
<p><strong>VentureBeat's mission</strong> is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact. <a href="https://info.venturebeat.com/website-preference-center.html?utm_source=VBsite&amp;utm_medium=bottomBoilerplate" data-type="URL" data-id="https://info.venturebeat.com/website-preference-center.html">Discover our Briefings.</a></p><!-- Boilerplate CSS for "after" -->				</div><!-- .article-content -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tornado Cash developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm have been charged with three conspiracy counts in an indictment unsealed today. Storm has been arrested and Semenov remains at large, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations">a statement from the Southern District of New York</a>.</p><p>Tornado Cash is a so-called “mixer,” a privacy service meant to obscure the trail of ownership for cryptocurrency that passes through it. The mixer “knowingly violated” US sanctions and “laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds,” according to a statement from US Attorney Damian Williams. “While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes.”</p><div><p>The two are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter. The mixer itself was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-backs-u-s-sanctions-on-crypto-platform-tornado-cash-fd3a85af">sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control last year</a>; today, <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20230823">Semenov was specifically sanctioned by OFAC as well</a>. A third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, will be tried <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/20/tornado-cash-developer-pertsev-can-be-freed-pending-trial-dutch-court-rules/">in the Netherlands</a> and isn’t mentioned by name in the indictment.</p></div><p>The indictment alleges that Tornado Cash was used by North Korea’s Lazarus Group to launder hundreds of millions of dollars. Mixers such as Tornado Cash <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks">are also used to launder funds from ransomware</a>, security experts have said.</p><div><p>“It would be unlikely as a fund that we’d use a ‘compliant mixer.’”</p></div><p>It wasn’t just criminals using Tornado Cash; privacy is a real concern for cryptocurrency. Once an identity is linked to a wallet, it’s possible to trace every transaction. That makes privacy tools popular among those who aren’t engaged in wrongdoing. But Tornado Cash was also allegedly used by North Korean hackers to launder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/ronin-hack-north-korea-linked-to-615-million-crypto-heist-us-says.html">$615 million in stolen tokens from the Ronin Network</a>. </p><p>Tornado Cash operated without know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) programs as required by US law, the document alleges. It also did not register with FinCEN as a money-transmitting business, the indictment says. Semenov and Storm also created a document called “Tips to Remain Anonymous,” which advised customers to consider using Tor or a VPN, delete data from their web browsers, and leave their money in Tornado for longer periods of time to better anonymize their transactions. They also advised users to employ different IP addresses for deposit and withdrawal.</p><p>Storm suggested creating a version of Tornado with KYC / AML enabled, but Tornado’s unnamed venture capital investors were dismissive, saying, “I just don’t know if anyone will actually want this.” The investor added, “It would be unlikely as a fund that we’d use a ‘compliant mixer.’”</p><p>Besides the Ronin hack, two other incidents were referenced, one in 2020 and one in 2021. This appears to line up with the KuCoin hack in 2020 and the BitMart hack in 2021, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/23/tornado-cash-devs-arrested-on-money-laundering-sanctions-violation-grounds-over-alleged-1b-moved/">according to <em>CoinDesk</em></a>. </p><p>“Despite knowing full well that the Tornado Cash service was being used to launder criminal proceeds, and that the Tornado Cash pools contained large amounts of ETH representing criminal proceeds that were commingled with other customer deposits for the purpose of concealment, the Tornado Cash founders took no steps to implement effective AML or KYC programs,” the indictment said. Rather, the developers took steps to increase anonymity so they could profit from the volume of transactions they were processing, according to the indictment. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>'J</span></span>ust don't be in the toilet when we dive deep," executive officer David "Bing" Crosby advises me. "The bulkheads bend and you can't open the doors." Forget all the technical stuff about monitoring "the Bubble" when you dive – I never quite understand the role of that mysterious piece of equipment – this is&nbsp;the kind of practical guidance I need. I vow to stick close to Bing, second-in-command on the nuclear submarine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Triumph_(S93)" data-link-name="in body link">HMS Triumph</a>, and a funny, down-to-earth bloke. "It's like having children," he says as the younger officers grapple for space at the first morning briefing I&nbsp;attend. "I've got children, and sometimes I think they're worse." This seems to be meant affectionately.</p><p>I have been on the boat – submarines are always called boats, never ships – for less than 24 hours and am writing this log at a depth of 60m. Sorry, I spoke too soon. We are just rising to periscope depth – 18m below the surface – and the tall desk on which I am typing has started to list. At least I'm not in the toilet. I joined HMS Triumph in Crete for the final week of its 10-month deployment. I had never been on a submarine before and don't especially like confined spaces. I plan to get off at Gibraltar six days from now, though the captain warns me this may not be possible if there is fog as the launch can't come alongside.</p><p>HMS Triumph distinguished itself last year in Libya, firing missiles at Gaddafi's key installations, including the one which hit the colonel's compound. The submarine's captain, Robert Dunn, feels they have been largely written out of the Libyan campaign and is keen his crew get their due. "If it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive," he tells me over breakfast, quoting Henry V. "Faint hearts never fucked a pig" is another of his maxims, which may be a translation from Clausewitz's On War. The book sits on a&nbsp;narrow shelf in his small cabin beside the control room.</p><p>This is Capt Dunn's final command; in fact his very last week at sea. At 48, and after three years in charge of HMS Triumph, he will be getting a desk job. It is also Chief Petty Officer Simon Johnson's final week at sea. There is a nice moment during my week aboard when the submarine (never sub, an egregious Americanism) has to surface to pass through the Straits of Messina. We go through at sunrise and Chief Johnson, who is up on the bridge, tells me it's the first time he has sailed past Stromboli since he was on the frigate HMS Leander at the start of his naval career 30 years ago. The volcano has bookended his life at sea.</p><p>I ask Chief Johnson why he switched from surface ships to submarines. "I got drafted in 1983 and didn't have any choice," he says. "I tried to get out of it. I didn't want to be a submariner. If you ask a general service chap what they think about submarines, they'll say: 'Horrible, dirty, noisy, you can't have a shower, you're always stinking.' Well, in the old days that might have been the case – water was very restricted – but you can see yourself; conditions are not that bad. On my first boat, Spartan, at the back end of 1983, it all clicked – it was a completely different way of life from general service."</p><p>He goes on to cite what most submariners say is what they like about life beneath the waves: the relative informality. There are, of course, distinctions between officers and ranks, but in so confined a space nothing like the rigidities of surface ships; the sense of being an elite, what one able seaman calls a "brotherhood"; the camaraderie that comes from knowing they rely entirely on each other. When a man, whether officer or rating, becomes a submariner, he is awarded a badge formed from two dolphins and a crown. The badge admits you to an exclusive club – there are around 3,500&nbsp;operational submariners in the UK. It means that, in the event of an emergency, you will be a help, rather than a hindrance. Until then, in the uncompromising language of submariners, you are an "oxygen thief".</p><p>"Everyone who wears the dolphins badge has a common ethos, common training and a common focus," says Lieutenant Stuart Keillor, an impressive 31-year-old Scot who will one day command a submarine. "No one does this job unless they want to. There's a lot of willpower in putting yourself into this environment for a long period. There's a lot of loyalty; and for that reason I'm very comfortable with my shipmates. There's a high expectation of the trainees that come on here. They've got a lot to prove, but once they're in the club, you&nbsp;can be confident they've reached a&nbsp;certain standard."</p><p>I know I will never be in the club. Climbing the ladders between decks exhausts me; I am forever hitting my head on protruding bits of metal; and once in the control room, while leaning against the periscope, I stumble backwards and accidentally press a button. Luckily, it is the button that says "search" and not the one next to it that says "attack". I don't want to be responsible for a missile assault on Algeria, to which we happen to be close at the time.</p><p>The submarine is two separate worlds: the front half, where the men (and at the moment it is all men, though there are likely to be female submariners from next year) sleep and eat and make war; and the back half, where the nuclear reactor sits beneath the tunnel that separates for'ard from back'aft and where the engines are. I don't spent much time back'aft, but I do visit for a back'afties' treat – potatoes baked on the engine throttle. At a crude level, a submarine crew is divided into those who make war and those who make the engines work. "We push, they fight," as one back'aftie explains succinctly.</p><p>The engineers call the nuclear reactor "the big kettle". It is what enables one of these fast-attack submarines to go on long operations, with no need to come into port for refuelling. Having it on board is a huge responsibility, as HMS Triumph's marine engineering officer, Lieutenant Commander Andy Sharp, makes clear. "It's never going to explode," he says when I ask him what's the worst thing that could happen, "but it could melt. If a nuclear submarine had an accident that caused it to have a slump and melt and drop out the bottom of the boat, I don't think we'd have a nuclear fleet any more. That would be the end of nuclear submarines. It's that level of responsibility." That pressure is enormous, but it works: to its credit, the navy has managed, over half a century, to run a fleet of submarines without a major incident.</p><figure id="4c8984b5-5857-4bc7-add4-922428827017" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="HMS Triumph's cramped conditions" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>HMS Triumph's cramped conditions add to the claustrophia. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span></figcaption></figure><p>A key distinction to grasp is between fast-attack submarines such as HMS Triumph, which are armed with conventional cruise missiles (the UK has seven such boats in varying degrees of readiness), and the four nuclear-armed submarines, one of which is always on patrol, ready to unleash its Trident nuclear missiles if apocalypse beckons. The latter – called ballistic submarines or bombers – are, at 180m long, almost twice the size of Triumph, have bigger crews and are, according to the men who have served on them, deadly boring. "Their job is to stay silent," says one petty officer. "You have no contact with the outside world." The bombers stay at a constant depth, move very slowly and do everything to avoid detection. It is three months of suspended animation; 180 men aspiring to the life of a flat fish, though a highly educated one – many are doing Open University degrees to pass the time and improve themselves.</p><p>Another man tells me the crew on board one bomber used to amuse themselves by pretending to be motorbikes, and this rings true. "Spinning a dit" is a phrase you hear a lot on board HMS Triumph. It means telling a tale – a tale that grows with the telling. Even on a fast-attack sub, if there is nothing to attack and you grow tired of listening to passing whales and pretending to target nearby destroyers, life can get repetitive, so the men slip into other worlds. One of the crew has a large tattoo on his back: "Never stop me dreaming," which might stand as a motto for all of them.</p><p>One evening, I wander into the control room at about midnight. The watch officer and sonar operators are discussing an important philosophical question: would it be more painful to be struck by a whole tuna or a tin of tuna? This is never resolved. These epistemological issues can be sustained over weeks.</p><p>On my fourth day aboard, I make my greatest discovery: that a badger, washed into the bilge tank in Bahrain, is being kept back'aft. There is a roster to feed it, and somehow it is being kept alive. I insist on seeing it – what a wonderful story! Of course, say the back'afties, come by this evening. After&nbsp;a couple of hours, even in my dim-witted, mind-clouded, headachy state, I realise I have been conned. Do they even have badgers in Bahrain?</p><p>But the fantasy has become important to some of the crew. "It helps pass the time," the head badger-keeper tells me. "It takes the edge off the situation," says one of the senior ratings. "If you get into a situation that's a bit tense, mentioning the badger brings everything back down to earth. If you tried to remain alert 100% of the time it would fatigue you. The ability to relax allows you, when required, to be on the ball." It's the ability to switch instantly from badger mode to potential nuclear meltdown mode that defines a good crew.</p><p>This is a highly segregated society, yet also a very organic one. There are three separate messes, for officers, senior ratings and junior ratings, each situated on the short corridor that serves as the men's living space. The separate messes with their different atmospheres – the Xbox is never off in the junior rates mess – suggest division, yet everything else implies unity. The pay structure is relatively flat: Capt Dunn earns around £85,000; the most junior rating gets £30,000. What other organisation has that sort of ratio between top and bottom? And every crew member, officer or rating, has to know everything about the boat – the function of every one of the thousands of valves. There are half a dozen trainees on the boat studying for their dolphin badges, and they are forgoing all sleep to memorise the handbook they have been given in time for a test that could be sprung on them at any time.</p><p>Chief Petty Officer Paul "Jakie" Foran, the likable but occasionally terrifying Scot who oversees these tests, expects dedication, and woe betide any trainee (AKA oxygen thief) who is discovered having a cup of tea in the junior rates' mess when he could be unearthing the secret of the magazine spray drench system. "To me you're useless until you're qualified," says Chief Foran. "I'm a bastard, but in a nice way."</p><p>You learn early whether you will&nbsp;survive in this world. One young officer who wants to transfer from surface ships is aboard studying for his dolphins, and is reckoned to have too many airs and graces. The crew are merciless in mocking this affront to their democratic values. He expects to be shown where every valve is and what it's for; don't be absurd (or words to that effect), says Chief Foran, you must find out for yourself. Forget sleep.</p><p>Forgetting sleep is easy. The crew work 12 hours a day, split into six-hour watches, with changeovers at 1 and 7. Back'afties, because of the heat in which they're working, have shorter but more frequent shifts. When they're not working, most men will be in their "rack", but sleeping on a submarine is no fun. The captain, alone on the boat, gets his own cabin; the senior officers share; and everyone else is in hot, cramped, fetid dormitories. Bed space is so limited that some of the most junior ratings have to "hot bunk", sleeping in the bed vacated by a man who has just gone on watch.</p><p>You can hardly move in the bunk – sitting up is impossible – and if you turn over you are likely to tip out and end up on the floor. You have to share your rack with a gas mask and various other bits of safety equipment, plus a lot of your own gear. There are small lockers, but I am never offered one, so sleep with bag, clothes and shoes in the bed. Each bunk has an air vent, which does offer some respite from the&nbsp;heat but also blows a blast of cold air into your right ear. "If the air stops&nbsp;blowing, it means something bad&nbsp;has happened," one of the men tells me reassuringly. One morning I&nbsp;am woken by a sudden thud and fear&nbsp;the worst. Later, I discover it was&nbsp;just air being released – a routine&nbsp;operation.</p><figure id="7d5d89ec-5a02-40f0-b27a-c1b11b96b0cd" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="TCPO 'Tug' Wilson in sleeping quaters in the weapons room" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>TCPO ‘Tug’ Wilson in the weapons room (AKA ‘bomb shop’). Crew members often hug the cruise missiles to stay cool while they sleep. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several men mention "coffin dreams" – nightmares in which the sleeper shouts out that the control room is flooding or he is being pursued by a torpedo. I sympathise: though I have no nightmares – I don't sleep deeply enough for that – the racks do feel like coffins. A better option is to sleep in the "bomb shop", where the missiles and torpedoes are kept. It is the quietest, most spacious room on the boat and hugging an 18ft cruise missile keeps you cool.</p><p>A few men go "wibble" after years under water; they just can't stand it any more – the lack of proper sleep, the&nbsp;absence of privacy, the endlessly repeated conversations, the cycle of meals (it's Wednesday so it must be curry), the unspoken dangers. How do you know when someone has gone wibble? "The noisy ones go quiet, and&nbsp;the quiet ones suddenly become noisy," one man tells me. Chief Johnson recalls one experienced submariner who went wibble and started keeping a&nbsp;book of shipmates he thought had wronged him. "You're on my list as well," he told Johnson before being taken off the boat. He only agreed to leave as long as he could be designated captain of the rescue vessel.</p><p>The men who go doolally are, however, the exceptions. Most get into&nbsp;a routine – working, sleeping (as best they can), reading (Kindles are a&nbsp;godsend in this confined world), watching films, spinning dits and dripping. Dripping is another key part of the submariner's lexicon: it means moaning, usually in a lighthearted way&nbsp;and often about the food. "Ah, you&nbsp;found the one mushroom in the mushroom soup," says Lieutenant Gareth Batsford, who as well as being the resident film buff in the officers' mess is also one of the boat's aphorists. "You wouldn't believe the inability of well-educated, well-trained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-navy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Royal Navy</a> officers to change bloody toilet rolls," he drips at one point.</p><p>I penetrate many aspects of submarine life in my six days aboard, but&nbsp;sex remains elusive. "There's a saying – what happens at sea stays at sea," says medical assistant Richard Bastianpulle teasingly. "I've not really thought about it, except when I'm in bed … by myself. People let off steam when they come alongside. I'll let you&nbsp;read between the lines on that." The boat will usually come into port every two months or so to pick up provisions, and the men – the single men at least – can get quite frisky.</p><p>There is one openly gay man on board. "They don't treat me any different to anyone else," he says. "I&nbsp;didn't tell anyone at first. I let them ask me rather than me tell them. But it's better to be open and honest than to try and deny it. People will catch you out and they'll start spreading malicious rumours." He gets ribbed about his sexuality, but says everyone gets ribbed about something. "Ribbing doesn't bother me. I let it go over my head. Some days it'll get to you, but you have to brush it off and forget about it."</p><p>The key thing is that bantering must never turn into bullying. The navy, which has become alert to equality and&nbsp;diversity in the past decade, is now good at stamping out bullying, which would destroy the esprit de corps in a community this small and close-knit. Christopher Herbert, a 34-year-old from St Vincent, who I discover up in the dry provisions store mixing his own rap song (The Vagina Rap) on a computer, says he has never suffered racial abuse on the boat. "It's zero tolerance," he says.</p><p>On my last night in the officers' mess we watch Operation Petticoat, an&nbsp;old submarine film with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. They must have seen&nbsp;it a dozen times, but love it. The&nbsp;officers – especially Lieutenant Commander Crosby, who misses his young children hugely – cry easily during movies. Andy Sharp gives his recipe for the sort of movie that plays well on board, especially with the back'afties: "Some token violence, some top bollocks on view from time to time, definitely some love interest, a&nbsp;car chase, and it must have a happy ending." Most of these teak-like submariners, even Chief Foran, are softies at heart.</p><p>I do manage to get off at Gibraltar, two miles off the coast in a heavyish swell. A dinghy comes alongside, bashing against the side of the submarine, and one of the crew pushes me&nbsp;into it. The timing of the leap is crucial. Get it wrong and you will be dripping in a literal sense. I end up upside down in the dinghy and wrench my shoulder. I'm just not built to be a&nbsp;submariner, and seem to lack Cary Grant's swagger. I am loaded on to a small patrol vessel, which pipes its salutation to the departing submarine. I am relieved to be breathing fresh air, yet sad not to be heading home with HMS Triumph. As a parting gift, the captain has given me an honorary dolphins badge, and I will treasure it always. Despite all my shortcomings, I&nbsp;feel I was starting to become part of the life of the boat. Me and the badger.</p></div></div>]]></description>

	<li>Record revenue of $13.51 billion, up 88% from Q1, up 101% from year ago</li>
	<li>Record Data Center revenue of $10.32 billion, up 141% from Q1, up 171% from year ago</li>
</ul>

<p>NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 30, 2023, of $13.51 billion, up 101% from a year ago and up 88% from the previous quarter.</p>

<p>GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $2.48, up 854% from a year ago and up 202% from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.70, up 429% from a year ago and up 148% from the previous quarter.</p>

<p>“A new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.</p>

<p>“NVIDIA GPUs connected by our Mellanox networking and switch technologies and running our CUDA AI software stack make up the computing infrastructure of generative AI.</p>

<p>“During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI,” he said.</p>

<p>During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA returned $3.38 billion to shareholders in the form of 7.5 million shares repurchased for $3.28 billion, and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $3.95 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an additional $25.00 billion in share repurchases, without expiration. NVIDIA plans to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.</p>

<p>NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on September 28, 2023, to all shareholders of record on September 7, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>CFO Commentary</strong><br>

<p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br>
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">https://investor.nvidia.com</a>. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Non-GAAP Measures</strong><br>
To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p>

<p dir="auto">Dataherald is a natural language-to-SQL engine built for enteprise-level question answering over structured data. It allows you to set up an API from your database that can answer questions in plain English. You can use Dataherald to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Allow business users to get insights from the data warehouse without going through a data analyst</li>
<li>Enable Q+A from your production DBs inside your SaaS application</li>
<li>Create a ChatGPT plug-in from your proprietary data</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This project is undergoing swift development, and as such, the API may be subject to change at any time.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Background</h3>
<p dir="auto">The latest LLMs have gotten remarkably good at writing SQL. However we could not get existing frameworks to work with our structured data at a level which we could incorporate into our application. That is why we built and released this engine.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h3>
<p dir="auto">Dataherald is built to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Be modular, allowing different implementations of core components to be plugged-in</li>
<li>Come batteries included: Have best-in-class implementations for components like text to SQL, evaluation</li>
<li>Be easy to set-up and use with major data warehouses</li>
<li>Get better with usage</li>
<li>Be fast</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Get Started</h2>
<p dir="auto">The simplest way to set up Dataherald is to use the hosted version. We are rolling this service to select customers. Sign up for the <a href="https://www.dataherald.com/contact" rel="nofollow">waitlist</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also self-host the engine locally using Docker. By default the engine uses Mongo to store application data.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to Run Dataherald (with local Mongo) using Docker</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create <code>.env</code> file, you can use the <code>.env.example</code> file as a guide. You must set these fields for the engine to start.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Specifically the following 5 fields must be manually set before the engine is started.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#OpenAI credentials and model 
OPENAI_API_KEY = 
LLM_MODEL =      
ORG_ID =

#Encryption key for storing DB connection data in Mongo
ENCRYPT_KEY = "><pre><code>#OpenAI credentials and model 
OPENAI_API_KEY = 
LLM_MODEL =      
ORG_ID =

#Encryption key for storing DB connection data in Mongo
ENCRYPT_KEY = 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">While not strictly required, we also strongly suggest you change the MONGO username and password fields as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">Follow the next commands to generate an ENCRYPT_KEY and paste it in the .env file like
this <code>ENCRYPT_KEY = 4Mbe2GYx0Hk94o_f-irVHk1fKkCGAt1R7LLw5wHVghI=</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install the package cryptography in the terminal

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Connecting to and Querying your SQL Databases</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once the engine is running, you will want to use it by:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Connecting to you data warehouses</li>
<li>Adding context about the data to the engine</li>
<li>Querying the data in natural language</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Connecting to your data warehouses</h3>
<p dir="auto">We currently support connections to PostGres, BigQuery, Databricks and Snowflake. You can create connections to these warehouses through the API or at application start-up using the envars.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Connecting through the API</h4>
<p dir="auto">You can define a DB connection through a call to the following API endpoint <code>/api/v1/database</code>. For example</p>
<p dir="auto">Example 1. Without a SSH connection</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'POST' \
  '<host>/api/v1/database' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  &quot;db_alias&quot;: &quot;my_db_alias_identifier&quot;,
  &quot;use_ssh&quot;: false,
  &quot;connection_uri&quot;: &quot;sqlite:///mydb.db&quot;
}'"><pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \
  '&lt;host&gt;/api/v1/database' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "db_alias": "my_db_alias_identifier",
  "use_ssh": false,
  "connection_uri": "sqlite:///mydb.db"
}'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Example 2. With a SSH connection</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost/api/v1/database' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  &quot;db_alias&quot;: &quot;my_db_alias_identifier&quot;,
  &quot;use_ssh&quot;: true,
  &quot;ssh_settings&quot;: {
    &quot;db_name&quot;: &quot;db_name&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;remote_host&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;remote_db_name&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;remote_db_password&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;private_key_path&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;private_key_password&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;db_driver&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
  }
}'"><pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost/api/v1/database' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "db_alias": "my_db_alias_identifier",
  "use_ssh": true,
  "ssh_settings": {
    "db_name": "db_name",
    "host": "string",
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "remote_host": "string",
    "remote_db_name": "string",
    "remote_db_password": "string",
    "private_key_path": "string",
    "private_key_password": "string",
    "db_driver": "string"
  }
}'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">With a SSH connection fill out all the ssh_settings fields</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, DB credentials are stored in <code>database_connection</code> collection in MongoDB. Connection URI information is encrypted using the ENCRYPT_KEY you provided as an environment variable</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">Once you have connected to the data warehouse, you should add context to the engine to help improve the accuracy of the generated SQL. While this step is optional, it is necessary for the tool to generate accurate SQL. Context can currently be added in one of three ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Scanning the Database tables and columns</li>
<li>Adding verified SQL (golden SQL)</li>
<li>Adding string descriptions of the tables and columns</li>
</ol>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scanning the Database</h4>
<p dir="auto">The database scan is used to gather information about the database including table and column names and identifying low cardinality columns and their values to be stored in the context store and used in the prompts to the LLM. You can trigger a scan of a database from the <code>POST /api/v1/scanner</code> endpoint. Example below</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'POST' \
  '<host>/api/v1/scanner' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    &quot;db_alias&quot;: &quot;db_name&quot;,
    &quot;table_name&quot;: &quot;table_name&quot;
  }'"><pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \
  '&lt;host&gt;/api/v1/scanner' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "db_alias": "db_name",
    "table_name": "table_name"
  }'
</code></pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding verified SQL</h4>
<p dir="auto">Sample NL&lt;&gt;SQL pairs (golden SQL) can be stored in the context store and used for few-shot in context learning. In the default context store and NL 2 SQL engine, these samples are stored in a vector store and the closest samples are retrieved for few shot learning. You can add golden SQL to the context store from the <code>POST /api/v1/golden-record</code> endpoint</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'POST' \
  '<host>/api/v1/golden-record' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
        {
            &quot;nl_question&quot;:&quot;what was the most expensive zip code to rent in Los Angeles county in May 2022?&quot;, 
            &quot;sql&quot;: &quot;SELECT location_name, metric_value FROM table_name WHERE dh_county_name = '\''Los Angeles'\'' AND dh_state_name = '\''California'\''   AND period_start='\''2022-05-01'\'' AND geo_type='\''zip'\'' ORDER BY metric_value DESC LIMIT 1;&quot;, 
            &quot;db&quot;:&quot;db_name&quot;
        }
  ]'"><pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \
  '&lt;host&gt;/api/v1/golden-record' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
        {
            "nl_question":"what was the most expensive zip code to rent in Los Angeles county in May 2022?", 
            "sql": "SELECT location_name, metric_value FROM table_name WHERE dh_county_name = '\''Los Angeles'\'' AND dh_state_name = '\''California'\''   AND period_start='\''2022-05-01'\'' AND geo_type='\''zip'\'' ORDER BY metric_value DESC LIMIT 1;", 
            "db":"db_name"
        }
  ]'
</code></pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding string descriptions</h4>
<p dir="auto">In addition to database table_info and golden_sql, you can add strings describing tables and/or columns to the context store manually from the <code>PATCH /api/v1/scanned-db/{db_name}/{table_name}</code> endpoint</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'PATCH' \
  '<host>/api/v1/scanned-db/db_name/table_name' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Tabla description&quot;,
  &quot;columns&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;column1&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Column1 description&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;column2&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Column2 description&quot;
    }
  ]
}'"><pre><code>curl -X 'PATCH' \
  '&lt;host&gt;/api/v1/scanned-db/db_name/table_name' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Tabla description",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "column1",
      "description": "Column1 description"
    },
    {
      "name": "column2",
      "description": "Column2 description"
    }
  ]
}'
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Querying the Database in Natural Language</h3>
<p dir="auto">Once you have connected the engine to your data warehouse (and preferably added some context to the store), you can query your data warehouse using the <code>POST /api/v1/question</code> endpoint.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X 'POST' \
  '<host>/api/v1/question' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        &quot;question&quot;: &quot;what was the most expensive zip code to rent in Los Angeles county in May 2022?&quot;&quot;,
        &quot;db_alias&quot;: &quot;db_name&quot;
    }'"><pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \
  '&lt;host&gt;/api/v1/question' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "question": "what was the most expensive zip code to rent in Los Angeles county in May 2022?"",
        "db_alias": "db_name"
    }'
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Replacing core modules</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Dataherald engine is made up of replaceable modules. Each of these can be replaced with a different implementation that extends the base class. Some of the main modules are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>SQL Generator -- The module that generates SQL from a given natural language question.</li>
<li>Vector Store -- The Vector DB used to store context data such as sample SQL queries</li>
<li>DB -- The DB that persists application logic. By default this is Mongo.</li>
<li>Evaluator -- A module which evaluates accuracy of the generated SQL and assigns a score.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">In some instances we have already included multiple implementations for testing and benchmarking.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">For detailed information on how to contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/Dataherald/dataherald/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mongo errors</h3>
<p dir="auto">The Mongo installation is configured to store application data in the <code>/dbdata</code> folder. In case you want to wipe the local DB, try completely deleting <code>/dbdata</code> before rebuilding the databases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Oh you like SSH? Name every flag. </p><div>  
            <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>We’ve all seen <a href="https://iximiuz.com/ssh-tunnels/ssh-tunnels.png">these great diagrams</a> of how SSH port forwarding works but if your brain is anything like mine, these diagrams leave you with a lot of unanswered questions. If you’re on a red team, understanding how to traverse a network better than the people who designed it gives you immense power to do evil things. SSH is such a powerful tool but sometimes the syntax and other concepts can get in the way of us accomplishing our goals. In an effort to do more evil things in a timely fashion I’ve put together a massive list of SSH <em>things</em> that I find useful. You can read it too, but if I’m being honest, this is mostly for me. I’ve learned that I really don’t grasp concepts unless I have hands on keyboard time doing them. This post is essentially just everything I learned while doing so. Also I should point out that in all of these examples I am using a websever to demonstrate port forwarding but this can be done with almost any service including RDP, SQL, etc.</p>
<h2 id="local-port-forwarding--l">Local Port Forwarding (-L)</h2>
<p>Like the name implies, local port forwarding allows you to create a local port that is forwarded to a remote port. Let’s assume that the server <code>internal-web.int</code> is hosting a webpage that is only accessible on the loopback interface. This means that in order for us to access that webpage, we must be on <code>internal-web.int</code>. One way that we can get around this is by using an SSH local port forward. Assuming we SSH access to <code>internal-web.int</code>, on the host machine <code>campfire.int</code>, we can create a local forward that will allow us to access the remote webserver via a local port.</p>
<p>The command to do this is: <code>ssh -N -f -L 1337:127.0.0.1:80 root@internal-web.int</code>. This command is ran on <code>campfire.int</code>. That’s a complicated command, as always, breaking it down by flag will allow us to figure out what exactly is happening.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-N</code>: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on <code>root@internal-web.int</code></li>
<li><code>-f</code>: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it.</li>
<li><code>-L</code> Tells SSH to forward a local port</li>
<li><code>1337:127.0.0.1:80</code>: This tells SSH to bind the local port 1337 to the remote port of 80 (the port our webserver is on).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way I found to remember this is <code>-L</code>  means local is on the left-hand side of the address. <code>-R</code> means the local port is on the right-hand side of the address.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>root@internal-web.int</code> This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel. Remember, port 1337 on our local machine is going to be bound to port 80 on the remote server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have established the local port forward, we can interact with port 80 on <code>internal-web.int</code> by sending requests to port 1337 on our local machine( <code>campfire.int</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820003129.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="remote-port-forwarding--r">Remote Port Forwarding (-R)</h2>
<p>Remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port forwarding.
Lets assume that we have access to <code>internal-web.int</code> and it is hosting a webpage that is only accessible on the loopback interface. Lets also assume that <code>campfire.int</code> cannot directly access <code>internal-web.int</code>. In this scenario we’d like to access <code>internal-web.int</code> from <code>campfire.int</code>. The problem is that we cannot directly communicate between <code>campfire.int</code> and <code>internal-web.int</code> due to a firewall. To get around this, we identify that <code>vuln-server.int</code> is reachable by both <code>campfire.int</code> and <code>internal-web.int</code>. The solution in this case is to use remote port forwarding SSH option to forward the port 80 from <code>internal-web.int</code>  to an arbitrary port on <code>vuln-server.int</code>. Once we complete the remote port forward, we should be able to access the <code>internal-web.int</code>’s internal web page running on port 80 by issuing a curl command to <code>vuln-server.int</code>.</p>
<p>The command to do this is: <code>ssh -N -f -R 3000:127.0.0.1:80 root@vuln-server.int</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-N</code>: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on <code>root@internal-web.int</code></li>
<li><code>-f</code>: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it.</li>
<li><code>-R</code> Tells SSH to forward a remote port</li>
<li><code>3000:127.0.0.1:80</code>: This tells SSH to bind the remote port 3000 to the local port of 80.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way I found to remember this is local forwarding with<code>-L</code>  means local is on the left-hand side of the address. Remote forwarding with<code>-R</code> means the local port is on the right-hand side of the address.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>root@vuln-server.int</code>: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel. Remember, port 3000 (on <code>vuln-server.int</code>) is going to be bound to port 80 on this server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have established the remote port forward, we can access port 80 on <code>internal-web.int</code> by sending a curl request to <code>vuln-server.int:3000</code></p>

<h2 id="dynamic-port-forwarding--d">Dynamic Port Forwarding (-D)</h2>
<p>Dynamic port forwarding with the <code>-D</code> option is an interesting option for proxying traffic over a SOCKS proxy. Lets assume that <code>internal-web.int</code> is hosting a web application that is only accessible on the internal network. We will assume that we have SSH access to <code>vuln-server.int</code>  and it is on the same internal network and able to reach <code>internal-web.int</code>. What we would like to accomplish is accessing the webserver running on <code>internal-web.int</code> by proxying all of our traffic from <code>campfire.int</code> through <code>vuln-server.int</code> using both proxychains and our local web browser. First, we must ensure the <code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code> configuration file is set correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Socks5</code>: Tells proxychains to use socks5 (instead of socks4)</li>
<li><code>127.0.0.1</code>: Tells proxychains to use our localhost</li>
<li><code>8080</code>: Is the port we will use for our dynamic forward. This must match the port you specify with <code>-D</code> in your SSH command.
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230822204719.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>The command to do this is <code>ssh -N -f -D 8080 root@vuln-server.int</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-N</code>: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on <code>root@vuln-server.int</code></li>
<li><code>-f</code>: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it.</li>
<li><code>-D 8080</code> Tells SSH to create a dynamic local port to send our traffic through.</li>
<li><code>root@vuln-server.int</code>: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel so that we can proxy our traffic through it.</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating the dynamic port forward over port 8080 and setting <code>socks5 127.0.0.1 8080</code> in <code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code>, we can now run <code>proxychains curl 192.168.1.185</code> and see our webpage hosted on 192.168.1.185. Additionally, DNS over SOCKS is hit or miss for me which is why I’ve used the IP address in the below curl command.</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820222328.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, we can configure Firefox to browse the internal web server via our SOCKS proxy by configuring the proxy settings within firefox itself. To get to the settings in firefox go to: Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Network Settings. Once there select Manual proxy configuration and check the “Proxy DNS when using SOCKS V5”. Finally, tell firefox about the SOCKS proxy we just set up by setting SOCKS host to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080 (Or whatever you set your port to in your SSH command).</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820012652.png" alt="">
Now that we’ve set up our proxy, we can now access the webpage on <code>internal-web.int</code> since all of our traffic is being proxied from our local machine through <code>vuln-server.int</code>. Pretty cool.
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820012725.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="jumphosts--j">Jumphosts (-J)</h2>
<p>Compared to the previous commands, jumping through hosts with SSH is fairly straight forward. In this scenario we will proxy our traffic through two hosts to reach a destination host that is not reachable by our current host <code>campfire.int</code>.  Our jump chain will look like this: <code>campfire.int</code> -&gt; <code>vuln-server.int</code> -&gt; <code>internal-web.int</code> -&gt; <code>dns.int</code>.</p>
<p>The command to do this is <code>ssh -J root@vuln-server.int,root@internal-web.int root@dns.int</code>. Note that multiple jumps are separated by commas.
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230822205116.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="agent-forwarding--a">Agent Forwarding (-A)</h2>
<p>SSH Agent forwarding is an interesting concept that I’ve written about about in my post <a href="https://grahamhelton.com/blog/ssh_agent/">Zero Effort Private Key Compromise: Abusing SSH-Agent for Lateral Movement</a> which I encourage you to read if you’re considering using agent forwarding. To summarize that post,  The SSH agent allows you to add private keys/identities to the agent running on your local machine using <code>ssh-add &lt;private_key_file&gt;</code>. These keys can then be listed with <code>ssh-add -l</code>. After adding a key to the ssh-agent utility, you can then SSH to a server using the key without having to re-enter the password. This is useful for both humans and service accounts. The <code>-A</code> option allows you to forward your key agent to the machine you’re connecting to, allowing you to use your private keys from the machine you’re connected to. Again, if you want more information about this, check out my previous post on the topic as there are some security concerns with this.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, lets assume we want to jump through <code>vuln-server.int</code> into <code>internal-web.int</code> while also forwarding the keys in our ssh-agent so that we can utilize them once on <code>internal-web.int</code>.</p>
<p>The command to do this is: <code>ssh -A -J root@vuln-server.int root@internal-web.int</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-A</code> Tells SSH to forward the keys in our SSH agent to the remote machine <code>internal-web.int</code></li>
<li><code>-J root@vuln-server.int</code> Tells SSH to proxy our traffic through <code>vuln-server.int</code> before accessing <code>internal-web.int</code></li>
<li><code>root@internal-web.int</code>: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, after executing <code>ssh -A -J root@vuln-server.int root@internal-web.int</code>, we can use <code>ssh root@dns.int</code> without having to specify a private key or enter any credentials. This is because our local machine <code>campfire.int</code> has the ssh key for <code>dns.int</code> loaded into the ssh-agent. We confirm this by running <code>ssh-agent -l</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820220930.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="tty-command-allocation--t">TTY Command Allocation (-t)</h2>
<p>This option is super simple but very helpful for quickly running commands on a remote server that require some sort of interaction such as <code>Vim</code> or <code>top</code>. My favorite use case for this is when I need to quickly edit a file on a remote server. All you need to do is run the command <code>ssh root@internal-web.int -t top</code> and you will be greeted with a TTY containing the <code>top</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820223227.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="global-port--g">Global port (-g)</h2>
<p>This one is a bit less common, but it allows us to define a locally forwarded port as a “global port” (my terminology, not official) that will allow us to proxy and traffic coming in on a local port to a port on an external server. This is similar to the <code>-L</code> option mentioned previously, but it will allow us to access the “Local” ports from an external machine. In the scenario below we have shell access to <code>vuln-server.int</code> and we would like to proxy any connection hitting port 2222 to port 22 on <code>internal-web.int</code>.</p>
<p>The command to do this is: <code>ssh -N -f -g -L 2222:localhost:22 root@internal-web.int</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-N</code>: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on <code>root@internal-web.int</code></li>
<li><code>-f</code>: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it.</li>
<li><code>-g</code> This tells SSH to allow remote hosts to connect to locally forwarded ports</li>
<li><code>-L</code> Tells SSH to forward a local port</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, even though our initial SSH command was to port 2222 on <code>vuln-server.int</code>, our shell tells us that we are actually on <code>internal-web.int</code> because of the <code>ssh -N -f -g -L 2222:localhost:22 root@internal-web.int</code></p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230820225237.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="ssh-console-">SSH Console (~?)</h2>
<p>The SSH console is a “hidden” feature of SSH that allows you to exert some control over SSH without having to interact with the remote system. This is useful if you’re trying to control SSH itself but your shell is broken. To access the help menu for the console press <code>~?</code>. If you’re familiar with vim, this is similar to using the leader character.  This will bring up the help console. There are two options that I find very useful. First is the <code>~.</code> option which will kill your session (very useful if you’ve broken something).
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821171158.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The second is the “Console” option which can be accessed with  <code>~C</code>. This console has a few options for forwarding. If you find that you’ve SSH’d into a server and would like to begin using this session as  a port forward session (such as a dynamic forward with the <code>-D</code> option mentioned previously), you can forward this session with the <code>-D 8080</code> option to create a forward-on-the-fly out of this session. In this example, I’ve connected to <code>vuln-server.int</code> via a normal <code>ssh</code> command. After pressing <code>~C</code> and typing <code>-D 8080</code> and pressing enter twice, a normal prompt is returned to me. However, upon utilizing proxychains on the host machine <code>campfire.int</code> (and ensuring the <code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code> file is set to use port <code>8080</code>), we can utilize the SSH session as if we had initiated it using <code>ssh -D</code>. Nifty.</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821231653.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="ssh-config">SSH Config</h2>
<p>The SSH config file is located at <code>~/.ssh/config</code>  and can be utilized to save you time when making connections over SSH. The config file uses a very easy to follow syntax that allows you to save your SSH configuration instead of having to type out all the options you want in the command line each time. SSH will parse this file when making an SSH connection. If the server you’re connecting to has an configuration defined in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, it will use that configuration. Note that command line parameters take precedence over the configuration file. This means that if your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file says that the user for <code>internal-web.int</code> should be <code>root</code>, but you run the SSH command <code>ssh graham@internal-web.int</code>, SSH will attempt to log you in as <code>graham</code>, not <code>root</code>.  Below is an example of a very basic <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>1</span><span><span># You can put comments with a `#` at the beginning of the line only. </span>
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>host internal-web.int
</span></span><span><span>3</span><span>    User root
</span></span><span><span>4</span><span>    IdentityFile /home/smores/ssh_agent/internal-web-no-pw
</span></span><span><span>5</span><span>	Port <span>2222</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The way SSH parses this file when running <code>ssh internal-web.int</code> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>It attempts to match <code>internal-web.int</code>  in the command line invocation with a <code>host</code> keyword matching <code>internal-web.int</code>  in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></li>
<li>If <code>internal-web.int</code> is found in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, any of the options under host will be utilized if they’re not specified in the command line invocation</li>
<li>If no match is found, SSH will only use options you’ve defined in your command line invocation of SSH.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ssh-config-keywords">SSH Config Keywords</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config">many keywords</a> you can utilize in your SSH config file but here are a few of the common ones I use that aren’t self explanatory (such as <code>Port</code> and <code>User</code>) .</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>IdentityFile /path/to/private_key</code>:  Allows you to specify the private key you wish to use for the host.  Same as using <code>-i</code>
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821213028.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ForwardAgent</code>: This is the same as running <code>ssh -A</code> (Once again, please see  <a href="https://grahamhelton.com/blog/ssh_agent/">Zero Effort Private Key Compromise: Abusing SSH-Agent for Lateral Movement</a>  before using this.)
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821172533.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ProxyJump root@internal-web.int</code>: Specify a server to proxy traffic through. Same as the <code>-J</code> option mentioned above. Note that in the below example we are asked to authenticate to <code>root@vuln-server.int</code>. This demonstrates that our traffic is indeed being routed through <code>vuln-server.int</code> before giving us a shell on <code>internal-web.int</code> like we asked for in the SSH command.
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821213441.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Match</code>: This one is a bit more complex. The <code>Match</code> keyword allows you to define conditions in your SSH config. In the below example,  SSH executes the command <code>export | grep PROXYME=TRUE</code>. If the program returns with a status code of <code>0</code> (in this case, meaning grep found a match), it will utilize the SSH  keywords defined under the <code>Match</code> block (In this case, <code>ProxyJump</code>). Otherwise only the normal <code>host internal-web.int</code> block is used.</p>
<p>In the below example, we first run <code>ssh internal-web.int</code> which successfully connects us to the server using the private key denoted with the <code>IdentityFile</code> keyword. Since <code>export | grep PROXYME=TRUE</code> returns with a status code of <code>1</code> (meaning grep did not find a match), we do not execute the <code>ProxyJump</code> keyword under the match statement.</p>
<p>Next, we set the <code>PROXYME</code>  environment variable to <code>TRUE</code>  using <code>export PROXYME=TRUE</code> and re-run the same <code>ssh internal-web.int</code>. This time we are asked to authenticate to <code>vuln-server.int</code> before we get a shell on <code>internal-web.int</code>. This is because SSH evaluated the <code>Match</code> block and executed <code>export | grep PROXYME=TRUE</code> which returned status code <code>0</code> (meaning grep found the match). Since it returned true, it executed the <code>ProxyJump</code> keyword defined under the <code>Match</code> block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821214524.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also point out that <code>scp</code> (and some other SSH based utilities) can use your SSH config file! Typically it does this by default, but I’ve had instances where it does not. If you’re on a system where <code>scp</code> does not automatically utilize your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file, you can explicitly define it with the <code>-F ~/.ssh/config</code> argument.</p>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230822214438.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="ssh-copy-id">ssh-copy-id</h2>
<p>The ssh-copy-id utility is a small tool that allows us to quickly upload our public key to a server.</p>
<p>The command to do this is: <code>ssh-copy-id -i internal-web root@internal-web.int</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-i internal-web</code>: Specify the name of the private key we wish to use to authenticate and copy to the server.</li>
<li><code>root@internal-web.int</code> Specify the server we wish to upload the private key to.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821212039.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen</h2>
<p>This utility is used to generate private/public key pairs. It is typically recommended that you specify a larger key size using the <code>-b</code>  option. Although I’m not a crypto expert, longer is generally better and the default keysize is 3072 (At least on my machine). <code>ssh-keygen</code> defaults to RSA, however, other (preferably stronger) algorithms can be used by specifying the <code>-t</code> flag. IE <code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521</code> Additionally, you can inspect keys to see their fingerprint and byte size using <code>ssh-keygen -lf &lt;file-name&gt;</code>.
<img src="https://grahamhelton.com/Pasted-image-20230821234857.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>So there you have it, my personal SSH cheatsheet for SSH. Go forth and SSH into machines like you know what you’re doing.  If you have any questions, feel free to let me <a href="https://grahamhelton.com/pages/links/">know on any of these sites</a> or shoot me an email via <code>blog[AT]grahamhelton.com</code>.</p>

        <p><strong>Published:</strong> Aug 23, 2023
        </p>
        <p><strong>By:</strong> Sid Sijbrandij
        </p>
        
        <p>In recent years, several high-profile open source companies have made headlines by shifting their licensing agreements away from purely open source models. MariaDB was first with its <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2016/08/applying-business-source-licensing-bsl.html">introduction of the Business Source License (BSL)</a> in 2016 and was closely followed by MongoDB, Confluent, Redis Labs, and others. Now, HashiCorp is the latest company to follow this trend and <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license">announce its switch from an open source to a non-compete license</a>.</p>
<p>Non-compete licenses mimic open source by allowing users to copy, modify, and redistribute code but only for specific purposes. Unlike open source, non-compete licenses restrict code redistribution to non-competitive use. Adopting a non-compete license isn’t problematic in itself, it’s the trend of switching from an open source to a non-compete license after gaining significant success that is causing distrust in commercial open source software.</p>
<p>HashiCorp is just the latest company to switch its licensing model and probably won’t be the last. As OSS companies gain commercial success the financial benefit of being open source diminishes. Open source companies generally have a low rake, creating more value than they capture, and high growth. Over time, growth slows, prompting the need for a higher rake. Companies seek to cut off “freeloaders’’ to gain more market share. They then adopt open source-adjacent licenses in an attempt to cut off competition. From a shareholder perspective, the short-term benefit is clear: capturing more value can quickly offset a growth slowdown. Whether or not it’s good for the company in the long term depends on how much growth was still ahead for the project compared to the rake increase.</p>
<p><img src="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-08-23-hashicorp-switching-bsl-shows-need-for-open-charter-companies/avg-time-ipo-switch.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>However, there’s a negative impact on commercial open source software. The more companies do this, the more the community loses trust. Fewer people will contribute to or adopt commercial open source. The only way to solve this is to hold companies accountable from the start. One way to hold companies accountable is through an open charter, which is a legal adoption of a company’s commitment to an open source license.</p>
<p>Since licensing can be changed, open source companies that adopt an open charter will be more trustworthy than those that don’t. Adopting an open charter won’t make sense for everyone but it will separate companies that are 100% committed to remaining open source from those who want to reserve the right to change their business model at a later time.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-switch-to-non-compete">Why the switch to non-compete</h2>
<p>Companies that have switched licensing models from open source to non-compete often defend the decision by claiming that asserting more control over the project’s commercialization is a natural and necessary evolution of open source. From the perspective of a company that has thousands of employees and shareholders to answer to, it’s a defensible position. As a company gains success, and especially if it becomes a public company, there’s shareholder pressure to generate higher revenues, and ultimately, an important goal of a business is to maximize shareholder value.</p>
<p>The commonly applied BSL and Server-Side Public License (SSPL) effectively limit competitive use to shut out “freeloaders” and protect the company against hyper scalers while continuing to allow non-competitive use of the source code. For companies that find themselves in the position of needing to balance their open source origins with business needs, these licenses can provide a happy medium. In an ideal scenario, a company would start with a non-compete license rather than switch to one later in its lifecycle.</p>
<p>In HashiCorp’s announcement, the company attributes its adoption of the BSL license to “vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS projects, for their own commercial goals, without providing material contributions back.” It’s the same argument Red Hat recently used to <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-08-redhat-gets-around-gplv2-license-intention-with-contract-law/">defend its decision to wall off RHEL code</a>. Unsurprisingly, HashiCorp is facing a similar backlash as Red Hat received from the community. Opponents of the change argue that OSS companies signed up for unrestricted competition when they chose to be open source, and they can’t exclude themselves from the “freeloader” status when they have also benefited from community development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Competition in services on top of Terraform has recently driven much innovation as many of our own concepts eventually found their way to Terraform Cloud. It’s also worth remembering that Terraform itself is built on top of multiple open source libraries and an open source ecosystem. Without the volunteer work of hundreds of unpaid individuals, HashiCorp products would not be successful, there would be no ecosystem, and the company would not exist.” <a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/hashicorps-license-change">Spacelift response to HashiCorp</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many HashiCorp competitors and ecosystem partners also released statements in response to the news: <a href="https://medium.com/@DiggerHQ/diggers-statement-on-the-hashicorp-license-change-to-bsl-983bf184e7d7">Digger</a>, <a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/hashicorps-license-change">Spacelift</a>, <a href="https://terrateam.io/blog/opentf-pledge">Terrateam</a>, <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/the-future-of-terraform-must-be-open-ab0b9ba65bca">Gruntwork</a>, <a href="https://blog.terramate.io/what-does-hashicorps-bsl-busl-adoption-mean-for-terramate-81cdb18b12b0">Terramate</a>. Spacelift’s response directly addresses HashiCorp’s claim that companies such as themselves were taking advantage, reminding everyone that Terraform itself has benefitted from other open source technologies.</p>

<p>Shortly after HashiCorp’s announcement, the community reacted by publishing the <a href="https://opentf.org/">OpenTF Manifesto</a> and demanding HashiCorp switch Terraform back to an open source license or the community will fork it into a foundation. The letter describes the impact of changing the license of critical infrastructure technology on the overall community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Overnight, tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from one-person shops to the Fortune 500, woke up to a new reality where the underpinnings of their infrastructure suddenly became a potential legal risk.” - <a href="https://opentf.org/">OpenTF Foundation</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It describes one of the glaring issues with the business source license: the non-compete language used is vague and non-specific. <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl">HashiCorp’s BSL states</a>: <em>“You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided such use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted or embedded basis which is competitive with HashiCorp’s products.”</em> The license doesn’t define what qualifies as competition and leaves users open to potential violations based on how the company interprets its business. A company using the software could be limited in how they expand their own product offerings for fear of legal repercussions. What happens if HashiCorp changes its business and enters a new technology category? Users of the software that were once in compliance can suddenly be redefined as competitors. If a company is going to change its license from open source to non-compete, it should at the very least define the business in the license.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time a community has reacted to a licensing switch with a fork. A similar approach was taken when Elastic switched its Elasticsearch and Kibana products from Apache to SSPL. After Elastic switched Elasticsearch’s license, Amazon forked the project and created OpenSearch as an open source alternative. However, Amazon’s fork has <a href="https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-an-up-to-date-comparison-5c1c71#opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-codebase-and-releases">significantly fewer contributions</a> and has <a href="https://sematext.com/blog/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-which-one-is-better-sematext/#community">yet to eclipse Elasticsearch on Google trends</a> suggesting the fork had little overall impact on Elastic.</p>
<p>OpenSearch was forked and is mostly maintained by a single company and the SSPL license language is more specific than the BSL language. The BSL is far more ambiguous, and the OpenTF Manifesto has been signed by more than 90 companies, 9 projects, and 300+ individuals suggesting that a fork of Terraform could have the support to seriously compete with HashiCorp.</p>
<p>However, users who have no interest in commercializing HashiCorp software have come to the company’s defense <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37081817">saying open source does need to evolve</a>: “Source should be about a mutually beneficial partnership between builders and users, not ‘give it all away for free or you’re not legit.’” Whether or not the definition of open source is or needs to evolve is for the community to decide but the reason we’re even having these conversations is because more companies are starting as open source instead of proprietary and that’s a good thing.</p>
<h2 id="open-charters-protect-open-source-as-a-public-benefit">Open charters protect open source as a public benefit</h2>
<p>Companies that are committed to open source can choose to incorporate as a public benefit corporation (PBC). A PBC is a for-profit company that has committed to spending some of its resources and profits in support of a public benefit, like open source software. When a company incorporates as a PBC, it must include a corporate charter specifying its goals and commitments to its chosen public benefit. A corporate charter that commits a company to open source is called an “open charter.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open Charter:</strong> <em>A legally binding corporate formation document stating a company’s commitment to open source and includes a series of objectives for meeting its open source commitment.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way a company can completely <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2022-10-preventing-the-bait-and-switch-open-core/">prevent relicensing code that was previously open source</a> is to adopt an open charter in addition to the open source license. Open Core Ventures (OCV) has started numerous companies as public benefit companies using the <a href="https://github.com/OpenCoreVentures/ocv-public-benefit-company/blob/main/ocv-public-benefit-company-charter.md">OCV Public Benefit Company Charter (OPC)</a>. Our charter protects a company’s open source mission by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring the majority of new features added in a calendar year are made available under an open source license</li>
<li>Not withholding or intentionally delaying the release of security fixes for open source features</li>
<li>Not allowing the removal of any software products that were previously open source</li>
<li>Not allowing constraints or limitations such as user or performance limits, size, or number of repositories to projects the company has made available under an open source license</li>
<li>Open sourcing testing frameworks used for open source features</li>
<li>Explicitly communicating which code is open source and which is not.</li>
</ol>
<p>The approach ensures that a company can’t switch to solely creating proprietary software or relicensing all of its software to a non-open source license. The OPC is open source and available for anyone to use. An open charter plus an open source license is how open source software companies will express their open source commitment in the future. It signals to users that they are serious about their open source status and lets investors and shareholders know that removing open source from the company is not an option in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note: If you’d like a practical primer on negotiation, read my <a href="https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter">previous post on negotiation first</a> — it tells you exactly what to say in a bunch of situations. This post is longer and more academic, but of course I include some practical tips and teach you what to say in a few situations, as well.</em></p>
<p>At interviewing.io, we’ve coached hundreds of people through salary negotiation. We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate.</p>
<p>Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Our advice is applicable to everyone, but I wrote this post primarily to share with interviewing.io’s user base, so that future clients of our negotiation service don’t shoot themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>These are the two things you <strong>must</strong> avoid. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer:</p>
<ol depth="0">
<li index="0">Revealing information too early in the game</li>
<li index="1">Negotiating before you’re ready</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I’ll explain why these two mistakes routinely sabotage salary negotiation efforts and what to say to recruiters instead. In a nutshell, if you can just be in “passive information gathering” mode (more on that later) for most of your recruiter interactions, you’ll be golden. It’s hard to not to share info about your job search with your recruiter, especially as you build more rapport with them, but we’ll tell you exactly what to say instead.</p>
<p>Before we get into all of that, I want to go over two foundational things about negotiation.</p>

<h2 level="2">Recruiters are not your friend, and they don’t work for you</h2>
<p><em>“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.</em>” <br>
-Upton Sinclair</p>
<p>I used to be a recruiter. I ran my own agency, and I also worked in-house before starting interviewing.io. That means that I’ve had to <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/if-youre-an-engineer-who-wants-to-start-a-recruiting-business-read-this-first">struggle with the tangled incentive structure that comes with being a recruiter</a> (see the section called “You should write down your principles”). There’s always a tension — recruiters are, by and large, good human beings who genuinely want to help their candidates, but they also have an employer they’re beholden to, as well as a comp/bonus structure that rewards certain behaviors, some of which run counter to candidates’ best interests.</p>
<p>There’s some distinction between in-house recruiters and third-party recruiters (recruiters who work for an agency that does placement, rather than a specific company that’s hiring engineers).</p>
<h3 level="3">Third party recruiters</h3>
<p>My general policy with third-party recruiters is to not tell them ANYTHING and to always deal directly with the companies they introduce you, once you establish a point of contact there. You should assume that anything you tell your recruiter is going to get back to every company you’re working with. Why? Because their primary objective is to place your butt in the seat of one of the companies they’re working with, and they will do whatever they need to do to make the deal happen. Often, those things will run counter to your interests.</p>
<p>A big misconception that many candidates labor under is the idea that because third-party recruiters get paid every time they make a placement, their interests are fundamentally aligned. At a high level, this is kind of true, but once you dig into the details you'll see a lot of nuance.</p>
<p>A recruiter, depending on market conditions, gets anywhere from 8%-25% of the candidate’s base salary when they make a placement. In the current climate, it’s around 10%. However, that cut is going to the recruiting agency as a whole rather than to the individual recruiter — you will almost always end up working with large agencies rather than a sole-proprietor shop where the owner gets to take all of it home.</p>
<p>Let's say that you get an offer with a base salary of $150,000. You talk to your third-party recruiter and tell them that you would like more money. The recruiter may go to the hiring manager and try to advocate for you, but they're not going to push very hard because the incremental difference in their cut is going to be pretty small and to them the thing that matters most is getting butts in seats. After all, they're evaluated on the number of hires they make, first and foremost, independent of comp. Understanding that, let's do the math anyway. Say that they’re able to risk closing the deal and get you $165k. Before, the agency would have gotten paid $15k. Now the agency gets paid $16.5k. That incremental $1.5k isn’t worth risking a deal over (even a few thousand dollars would not justify jeopardizing the deal). On top of that, the individual recruiter is only going to maybe get a few hundred dollars total from that increase. So for them the difference really isn’t worth it. <strong>Third party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, because they’re incentivized to get the deal done, you should assume that your recruiter will share anything you share with them with the company or companies they’ve introduced you to. If you tell them that a company is your first choice and that you’re tempted to accept, they will likely share that with the company and may even recommend that they not raise your comp, since you’re already so enthusiastic. If you share that you’re not very interested in a company, and the recruiter has other candidates they’re presenting, they will prioritize those candidates’ experience over yours and will possibly tell the company not to invest in you as hard.</p>
<h3 level="3">In-house recruiters</h3>
<p>What about in-house recruiters? In-house recruiters may or may not get a bonus for hires that happen on their watch; it depends on the company. But if they do, that bonus is generally NOT tied to your compensation, and in some cases, they may get a bigger bonus if they’re able to negotiate you down. At big companies, in particular, in-house recruiters follow a playbook. They’re trained to make offers within specific bands, and they’re trained to mobilize such that they don’t lose candidates to other big companies — if you wave a Facebook counteroffer in front of Google, they will act. If you tell them you’re interviewing at a startup, they will not, because they know that startups don’t pay as much. They’re actually evaluated on how well they follow the playbook. Because of that, there is no reason to assume that their incentives align with yours. They’re incentivized, first and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it’s definitely true for how they negotiate.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in peeking behind the curtain on how recruiters think, I interviewed three of the best ones in the industry recently. You can watch that below:</p>

<p>
I’ll close this section the way I began it. Recruiters want to help, and many are rooting for their candidates. But they’re also operating inside a box, and that box isn’t set up to put your interests first.
</p><h2 level="2">What negotiation is and what it’s not</h2>
<p>Probably because of bad books and airplane magazine ads (for those of you old enough to remember those), people often think that negotiation is all about saying the right thing, or how firm your handshake is, or any other amount of silly nonsense. <strong>The reality is that negotiation is all about preparation and leverage.</strong></p>
<p>Preparation and leverage means doing the work to make sure that you have multiple offers, that all your offers come in at the same time, and that you don’t tip your hand too early. Laying this foundation is 80% of the work. You’ll need to slow some companies down, speed some companies up, and hold off questions from recruiters until you’re ready to negotiate, and not before. If you do this right, the actual negotiation part will be easy and almost a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Is it possible to negotiate when you don’t have multiple offers and when you haven’t done the foundational work? Sure, it is, and we’ve sometimes had success with our users doing that. But it’s much harder, and the ceiling on how much more money you can get is lower.</p>
<p>With all that out the way, let’s talk about how the two biggest mistakes people make and how to not make them!</p>
<h2 level="2">Mistake #1: Revealing information before you’re ready to negotiate</h2>
<p>You’ve probably never been arrested, but if you’re like me, you’ve watched a lot of police procedurals on TV. You know the bit where they read the suspect their Miranda rights? They start like this:</p>
<p><em>You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law…</em></p>
<p>Talking to recruiters is exactly the same, and one of the biggest mistakes we see our users make is sharing information too early. This is generally the only mistake we can’t walk back — once you share information, you can’t undo it, and sharing information actually has no upside, only downside. When you’re ready to negotiate, you’re doing so deliberately because you already <em>know</em>
the state of the world, and you’re choosing to reveal the parts that set you up for success. Before that, you’re just revealing stuff that can be used against you.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically, do not share with recruiters anything about your salary history (though it’s illegal in many states to ask this directly, there are indirect ways of asking, and many still do), your salary expectations, where else you’re interviewing, and how far along in the process you are with other companies. In short, don’t share any information about money or other interviews.</strong></p>
<p>The main question recruiters ask up front about money is: “What are your compensation expectations?” They claim that it’s because they want to make sure that you’re not so far off in your expectations that interviewing with that company would be a waste of time. This is a nonsense reason — <em>very few</em> companies pay so much below market that it would be a nonstarter. Those companies know who they are, and they know to give you a heads up that they pay below market. Moreover, with the recent advent of companies sharing salary bands, you’ll have some idea if they're grossly below market before you interview. The real reason recruiters ask about compensation expectations is so that they can use it against you later in negotiations.</p>
<p>As such, if you answer this question with a number, you set an artificial ceiling on your offer. Do not even utter a single number to a recruiter until you’re ready to bargain. Do not go on levels.fyi and comment on the ranges listed for your level, even if you’re currently underpaid and an average offer from them would be life changing. <strong>Do not say a number first — ever.</strong></p>
<p>You can see exactly what to say when you get asked about compensation expectations in the section called “How to handle recruiter calls” below.</p>
<p>The most obvious way to lose leverage is revealing information about money. The other way to lose leverage is by sharing information about where else you’re interviewing. If you share this information, you risk prematurely scaring off smaller companies because they don’t think they can win in a bidding war with FAANG. You also risk cornering yourself into a situation where the company knows your options are limited, and they might be inclined to lowball you as a result. Finally, you risk getting an exploding offer to try to force you to make a decision before you’re ready.</p>
<p>Below are some examples that I hope will drive these points home.</p>
<h3 level="3">Example #1: You’re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups</h3>
<p>Let’s say that you’re currently interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups (let’s call them A and B). You’re at the onsite stage with Google, you’re doing technical phone screens at both startups, and you’re just doing your first recruiter call with Meta. This is actually a very strong position to be in!</p>
<p>Of course, your Meta recruiter asks you about your comp expectations and where else you’re interviewing.</p>
<p><strong>If you reveal your comp expectations, it will be hard to walk them back:</strong></p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0">Let’s say that you currently work at a startup and make $150k in cash with some amount of equity. You go to levels.fyi or a similar site and look up Facebook’s salary bands for the role you’re targeting. Let’s say those bands for total comp are $250k-$350k. Hell, that’s way more cash than you’re making now, so you decide to share that range, thinking that if those are their bands already, it does no harm. That’s reasonable, except that let’s say Google ends up making you an offer, and it’s $400k (we’ve seen this scenario happen to a bunch of our users). Now you have to walk back what you said, in which case your recruiter will invariably ask why. And now you have to reveal, before you’re ready, that you have a Google offer, which means you’ll probably end up revealing that it’s for $400k. Now you’ve set an artificial ceiling for your Facebook counteroffer to be $400k as well, when in reality that ceiling may have been closer to $450k or even $500k.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you reveal that you’re at the onsite stage with Google and talking to some startups, here's what will happen:</strong></p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0">Your recruiter will do the math and start asking you in a few weeks if you got to team matching.</li>
<li index="1">Now Meta knows that Google is the only possible offer on the table that they should be worried about. They (and other big companies) don’t take startup offers nearly as seriously because equity is monopoly money 'til it’s not… and even if you don’t reveal the cash portion of your comp, they’ll assume it’s smaller than what they’re offering.</li>
<li index="2">If you didn’t pass the onsite, it’s going to be hard to not share that when you’re persistently asked about it, unless you lie (which I absolutely do not condone). Now you’ve lost leverage because Meta knows that you cannot possibly have any other big tech company offers.</li>
<li index="3">If you DO perform well in your Google onsite, that’s great, but team matching can take a while (yes, I know Google is changing their process such that you’re now interviewing for a specific team at the outset, but the broader point still stands). So now if Meta is about to make you an offer, they can set an artificially fast expiration date to run out the clock.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Though you started in a strong position with multiple interviews, including at companies that are known to pay well, you’ve now weakened that position by sharing details.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s another thing that could happen in this scenario. Let’s say that it’s the same set of companies as above, but this time you’re talking to the recruiter from startup A. The recruiter asks you where else you’re interviewing.</p>
<p><strong>If you mention that you’re interviewing at both Google and Meta, they might get spooked.</strong></p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0">I’ve seen this happen a bunch. Dropping FAANG names can be a good power move, or it can shoot you in the foot, and which it’ll be really depends on the situation. Many small startups view FAANG candidates as risky because they know they can’t compete on comp and are worried that you’re going to walk the moment that you get a FAANG offer. This may or may not be true (not everyone is motivated just by comp!), but it’s not to your advantage to reveal it. YOU should be in control of if and when we play the FAANG card.</li>
</ul>
<h3 level="3">Example #2: You’re interviewing at one company and are also up for a promotion</h3>
<p>Here’s a different example. Let’s say that you work at a startup, and you’re up for a promotion soon. You figured it’d make sense to see what’s out there as well, so you’ve started interviewing with another startup.</p>
<p>Your recruiter asks you in your first call about where else you’re interviewing and what your comp expectations are. You may be tempted to mention that you’re up for a promotion because that feels like it’ll give you leverage — if you get a promotion, the startup will have to work harder to entice you to leave, after all. Not so fast!</p>
<p><strong>If you mention that you’re up for a promotion:</strong></p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0">Your recruiter will start checking in consistently on whether you got it. Promotions always take longer than you think, and the increase in your comp may not be what you expect. At some point, if you haven’t gotten it yet, the recruiter will assume it’s not coming, and then you actually lose leverage because they know that you’re going to be more likely to walk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you mention that you’re not interviewing anywhere else, that’s just a giveaway that you have no leverage:</strong></p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0">Promotion or not, many of our users assume that they have leverage because, “I don’t have to leave my job, so my current job is leverage.” That’s not true, though — even in this climate, and definitely in a hiring boom, an engineer having another job is table stakes. Almost every candidate you’re competing with will be currently employed. So even if having a job gives you a little bit of leverage, it gets canceled out when everyone has the same exact thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The details may differ in your case, but the fundamental mechanics are the same. When you reveal information before you know what hand you’ve been dealt, it can only hurt you. I’m struggling to think of a scenario where revealing something has been beneficial.</p>
<p>I suppose the one exception to revealing information is this: Sometimes it can be useful to give your recruiter a rough estimate for when you’ll be collecting offers, e.g., “I’ve just started interviewing. I expect to get through all my interviews and onsites in the next 6 weeks and start collecting offers 2 months from now. Does that timeline work for you?”</p>
<p>This technique can be helpful for aligning expectations up front and then keeping recruiters off your back, as they won’t need to chronically text you to make sure you haven’t taken another offer yet (we’ll talk more about texting with recruiters in the next section). But note that even in this example, we’re not actually revealing any information about where you’re interviewing, how long it’s taking, or compensation. You’re just setting a timeline based on <em>hypotheticals</em> without giving out any details that can be used against you later. When you share the actual timeline you’re working with, you no longer control the timing of your job search, and a huge part of negotiation is controlling timing so you can make all your offers come in at the same time.</p>
<h2 level="2">Mistake #2: Premature negotiation</h2>
<p><em>“Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!</em>”<br>
-Unknown officer at the Battle of Bunker Hill</p>
<p>Just like not revealing information too early, you also want to avoid negotiating too early. They’re two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Think of it like a hand of cards. At the beginning, you have no idea what you’re going to draw. The longer you wait to negotiate, assuming you’ve timed things correctly, the more information you have. Then, when you’re ready to negotiate, you can look at your hand and selectively share information that puts you in the strongest position. For instance, if you have a high base salary from one company, a great equity package from a public company, and a signing bonus from a third company, you can strategically share those portions of the offers without sharing the weaker parts. Each negotiation is different, and it’s hard to give catch-all advice, but that’s generally the situation you should set yourself up to be in.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’m a firm believer in negotiating when you’re ready and not before. Until you know what else is on the table, it’s really hard to 1) have the bravado that comes with actually having multiple offers (this is possible to fake, but trust me, it’s hard) and 2) negotiate effectively — you will never know as well as your recruiter what salary bands are like, what market comp is, and so on. They do this all day. This may be your first or fifth time doing it, but there’s massive experience and information asymmetry. There are two ways to combat this power imbalance: have as many of your interactions be asynchronous as possible (we discussed that earlier) and do everything you can to negotiate when you’re at the point of maximum information, and not before. Daniel Biales, one of our former negotiation clients, <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/learn-how-to-negotiate-your-salary-with-expert-help-5afedd11a178">explained the latter really well</a>.</p>
<p><em>When I received a low offer, my first inclination was to start the negotiating process. Aline helped me to realize that this was not the best course of action. The problem with this approach is that I wanted to start negotiating before receiving my highest offer. If I negotiated an increase then, I would have had to renegotiate when I received the higher offer. This will cause negotiating fatigue for you and the company. They will be less likely to negotiate a second time because they don’t know how many times you will ask them for more. First, focus on strategies to draw out your decision. Then, when you have all your offers, start negotiating. There may be a couple of back and forth communications, but they will be over a short time span rather than drawn out.</em></p>
<h3 level="3">Example #1 revisited: You're interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups</h3>
<p>Let’s review our first example again. Imagine that you’re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups, A and B, just like before. Startup A makes you an offer: $160k base, 0.1% of the company in options over four years, no signing bonus. You react to it and say that you were hoping for a signing bonus. The recruiter comes back with a $10k signing bonus quickly and pressures you to make a decision, saying that they have other candidates waiting.</p>
<p>By starting to negotiate, you accelerated their timeline, and this is going to make it hard to go back and ask for more signing bonus.</p>
<p>You try to stall, and then a few days later, Google makes you an offer that includes a $25k signing bonus. You’re still excited about the startup for reasons other than compensation, but now you have to go back to them and say that you actually got a $25k signing bonus at Google. They are unlikely to move again.</p>
<p>So, don’t negotiate until you’re ready. It’s hard to walk things back.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s not possible to negotiate in stages and gradually start bringing up all your offers. In my experience, however, this is a much more difficult maneuver, takes way more experience, is much more stressful for the candidate, and often ends up with the same results as laying a solid foundation and just negotiating once at the end.</p>
<p>So what do you say when you get asked pointed questions by your recruiter about your comp expectations or where you’re interviewing? And how do you delay negotiation until you’re ready?</p>
<h2 level="2">How to handle recruiter <strong>calls:</strong> “passive information gathering” mode and exactly what to say</h2>
<p>Until you’re ready to negotiate, your default mode should be “passive information gathering.” This means that you listen rather than talk. I coach all of our negotiation clients to be in this mode when they get on a call with a recruiter.</p>
<ul depth="0">
<li index="0"><strong>Be polite and gracious to a fault.</strong> If it’s an offer call, thank them for the work they did to put your offer together and for advocating for you. If it’s earlier in the process, thank them for their help so far.</li>
<li index="1"><strong>Express genuine enthusiasm.</strong> If it’s an early call, express excitement about the company or the interview process if there’s something idiosyncratically cool about it. If it’s an offer call, express excitement for the team, the projects, the hiring manager, whatever it is. And be genuine. Every offer will have something exciting about it.</li>
<li index="2">If the recruiter is making an offer, do not react to what you’re being told beyond expressing enthusiasm. <strong>Say that you need some time to process and/or talk to your {family, partner, spouse}.</strong> Why should you not react? Because recruiters do this a lot, and you don’t. Negotiating on the phone on the fly is really hard. You’re going to need time to think, and you need a way to level the playing field. Email is the great leveler in these interactions because it’s asynchronous, and it gives you time to think and plan. No one is realistically expecting you to react to major life decisions on the fly!</li>
<li index="3"><strong>Use email (not phone when possible and <em>DEFINITELY</em> not texts) to interact with recruiters.</strong> You will have to get on the phone eventually, of course, but you never have to text – if they text you, just wait a few hours to respond, and then respond over email (you can always say that you don’t have notifications enabled during work hours). The casual nature of texting lulls you into a false sense of security. Moreover, the fact that texts interrupt you from something else puts you at a disadvantage — when you get interrupted, your instinct is to quickly respond to make the interruption go away. But knee-jerk responses are rarely the right ones, and you’ll find yourself giving away information you shouldn’t have.</li>
<li index="4">If a recruiter asks you pointed questions about comp expectations or where else you’re interviewing, refer to the section called “Exactly what to say” right below!</li>
</ul>
<h3 level="3">Exactly what to say</h3>
<p>In all the snippets below, you’ll notice that they end with the same sentence: <em>I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.</em></p>
<p>This is deliberate, and it’s there because it’s disarming. Fundamentally, recruiters ask you all of these questions because they don’t want to lose out on you and have you go to another company. If you can speak to that worry head-on, there’s not much they can say back.</p>
<p><strong><u>For questions about comp expectations at the beginning of the process:</u></strong> <br>
<em>At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first – right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>For questions about comp expectations at the end of the process:</u></strong> <br>
<em>It sounds like there’s an offer coming, and I’m really excited about it. I’m not sure exactly what number I’m looking for, but if you’d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the beginning of the process:</u></strong><br>
<em>I’m currently speaking with a few other companies and am at various stages with them. I’ll let you know if I get to the point where I have an exploding offer, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the end of the process:</u></strong><br>
<em>I’m wrapping things up with a few companies and in process with a few more. I promise to keep you in the loop, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.</em></p>
<h2 level="2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I said it in the beginning, and I’ll say it again. Negotiation isn’t about saying the right thing. It’s about laying a foundation: not revealing anything until you’re ready to negotiate, not negotiating too early, and making sure that you’ve set yourself up to have multiple offers.</p>
<p>Then, once those offers come in, you swoop in with sharp precision, negotiate once (possibly with just your top choice company), and be done with it.</p>
<p>If you’ve set yourself up for success, done the foundational work, and haven’t made the mistakes in this post, the negotiation will feel like a foregone conclusion.</p>
