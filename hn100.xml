        <tr>
    <td>
        <p dir="auto">My opiniated writeup on how such a roller coaster of emotions the video was for me and my questions on why not C#, Rust and even JavaScript? (I'm not against Go! I don't even have any experience with it, my questions are more about why not the others which seem to me more logical choices based on the experience I had.)</p>
<h3 dir="auto">1. Oh, "A 10x faster TypeScript" with Anders Hejlsberg, that must be interesting, let's watch it!</h3>
<p dir="auto">Anders has a lot of (maybe the most) experience building programming languages starting from Delphi, and his experience was inevitable to build such great programming languages as C# and TypeScript (and Bicep). I have always been interested in this area, so I was following his work. I also missed his public appearances, so I was excited to watch this video.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">2. JavaScript is not optimized for performance, so we are porting it to native</h3>
<p dir="auto">Finally, it was nice to hear that statement from him at this level in the industry. Great to hear performance is becoming a thing again - at least in same places! Hopefully others follow. So, let's?</p>
<h3 dir="auto">3. But "...in Go" What??</h3>
<p dir="auto">People who don't like JavaScript could say anything is better than JavaScript. But in this case, I'm not sure. So, my train of thoughts was the following:</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Why not C#?</h3>
<p dir="auto">One thing is how capable C# is today (easy to read/maintain, pattern matching, record types, lots of native but safe optimizations, has a tool for all needs, AOT, truly platform independent, ...). But another thing is the compiler <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a> behind it. It was from the beginning truly a state of the art piece of technology, probably the best ever built (two layer immutable/mutable trees, diff editing, analyzers/refactoring infrastructure, operation abstraction, one tech for editor/analyzer/compiler, etc.). I remember how much research went into it (even from the Channel9 and MSR era). And the TypeScript compiler was based on the same learnings, probably even the team was borrowed to implement the basics for TypeScript by looking at the concepts and the names of people working on both projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, in this sense, while C#/.NET is a first class Microsoft technology, with decades of research (even more than Go), with decades of research building not only a compiler but the full suite of language services in it, led by Anders himself, I don't really get it why it was not a viable alternative. Even if it would be only 0.9x of the performance of Go, the tradeoffs are better overall. And Microsoft especially Anders himself also has the power to drive C# if something would make it easier for such a use case. The tradeoffs of language capabilities, maintainability and experience in compilers and choosing Go over C# are unclear to me.</p>
<p dir="auto">And the message Anders sends with this choice for the .NET/C# community is worrying.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Why not Rust then?</h3>
<p dir="auto">If not C#, but "native" native, then why not Rust? Microsoft announced in the recent years that they are transitioning from C/C++ to Rust in all places, for both Azure and Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">If accessibility matters, Rust could have been a better choice, because it is becoming a standard inside Microsoft. If performance matters most (and not accessibility because compilers are a niche area), maybe Rust is a better choice even in that aspect. (although, I don't have too much experience with any of them)</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Why anything other than JavaScript?</h3>
<p dir="auto">But looking at the bigger picture, I'm not convinced it is worth to transition to anything, because:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>VS Code is an extreme example with 1+ million lines of code. Although there are big frameworks, most people have small or moderately large apps where it won't matter whether it is 1 sec or 0.2 sec</li>
<li>The compiler won't solve the I/O performance issues with thousands of small JS files from NPM packages</li>
<li>The tool chain consists of many other tools other than the compiler (analyzers/linters, bundlers, framework specific extensions), which either run still in JavaScript which won't benefit from the speedup</li>
<li>Even for large projects where build time was 60 seconds and now 5-10, probably not TSC is the only bottleneck, so while it will definitely speed up the developer loop, it will still be far from instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And on the other side:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>JavaScript (and in this context including TypeScript) is the most popular language of all time</li>
<li>In fact LSP (Anders again) made it possible to write language services for each language in its own language. So, write JavaScript language services in JavaScript.</li>
<li>It was easy to extend the analyzers ("linters"), or the language, or the language service capabilities, because everything was in JavaScript which JavaScript developers obviously know.</li>
<li>If somebody wants to extend it in JavaScript, interop and marshaling is going to have its own performance huge hit, that may not make it a viable alternative</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And also, with the transition:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Maintaining two stacks for a year is a large investment. Usually maintaining only one, the main one is more than enough.</li>
<li>How about libraries being supported on long term in Go?</li>
<li>How about taking such an external dependency and the future of Go? (don't get me wrong, it would apply to any other language)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While the performance gain can be promising, transitioning from JavaScript (TS) for such a fundamental tool like the TypeScript compiler and language services is maybe even more worrying for the future of the TypeScript ecosystem, because people who know and use JavaScript won't be able to contribute and use the platform.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Conclusion</h3>
<p dir="auto">So, overall, I'm not convinced whether although the speed up with such a large project as VS Code is impressive, most devs (including especially the whole toolchain) may not benefit that much in perception of build times, while sacrificing the accessibility/extensibility from the most popular language (JavaScript) to a much less popular "non-native" (to the language) language with such an investment worth these tradeoffs.</p>

As a formal definition, a covariance matrix gives a measure of how pairs of random variables change together.</p><p id="f860">In the left subplot, the covariance matrix for the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/olivetti_faces.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Olivetti faces dataset</a> is shown. In this case, each entry in the covariance matrix indicates how the intensity of any two pixels varies. In the right subplot is the reconstructed row image from the currently selected row of the covariance matrix. We can easily change what row of the covariance matrix we are looking at by simply moving the selector.</p><p id="6bdf">It is very clear visually that looking at the reconstructed image for each row of the covariance matrix is much more informative than having a static plot of just the covariance matrix by itself. By looking at the reconstructed row image, we can get a sense of how the pixel intensity is changing across faces in the dataset.</p><p id="832b">The purpose of displaying this plot is not to conduct a detailed analysis of the covariance matrix but to demonstrate how even a small degree of interactivity can enhance our understanding of the data, ultimately transforming the types of analysis we may pursue in the future.</p><p id="ca66">The goal of <code>fastplotlib</code> is to expand the field of scientific visualization by providing a mechanism that allows the creation of high-level interactive plots, ultimately driving scientific discovery.</p></div><div><h2 id="9405">API design matters</h2><p id="d229">The ecosystem for scientific visualization has come a long way since the early 2000s.</p><figure><figcaption>Scientific Python visualization ecosystem timeline</figcaption></figure><p id="c471">These days, there are many open-source Python visualization tools available. However, one limiting factor for scientists and other users is the high barrier to entry in learning how to use some of these libraries. Often, users are forced to learn complicated APIs that make it difficult to focus on their data or research questions.</p><p id="93fa">In <code>fastplotlib</code>, we aim to provide fast interactive visualization via an easy-to-use and intuitive API.</p><p id="e288"><strong>1) Data interaction</strong></p><p id="a621">The premise behind our API design is that you should never have to think of your data as anything but an array.</p><p id="4d5c">If the data in our visualization maintains an array-like structure we are familiar with, interacting with the visualization becomes much easier.</p><p id="c5e7">Consider the following example:</p><p id="871b">Suppose we want to plot a simple sine wave.</p><pre><span id="0360">import fastplotlib as fpl<br>import numpy as np<p># generate some data <br>xs = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)<br>ys = np.sin(xs)<br>data = np.dstack([xs, ys])[0]</p><p># create a figure<br>figure = fpl.Figure()</p><p># add the data to the figure<br>sine_wave = figure[0, 0].add_line(data=data, thickness=10)</p><p>figure.show()</p></span></pre><figure><figcaption>simple sine wave</figcaption></figure><p id="af07">Now, say we wanted to change every third point of our sine wave to have the color red. If the data in our visualization can be thought of as an array, then doing this kind of fancy indexing isn’t any different than usual NumPy array manipulation.</p><pre><span id="3d06">sine_wave.colors[::3] = "red"</span></pre><figure><figcaption>fancy index sine wave colors</figcaption></figure><p id="09c1">With this framework, we can perform all sorts of dynamic manipulations to different features of our graphic (e.g., color maps, colors, data, etc.) after we have initially plotted something.</p><p id="2463">The goal of taking this approach to the API design is to limit the amount of mental overhead required to use <code>fastplotlib</code>, ultimately making the library flexible, intuitive, and easy to use.</p><p id="bafe"><strong>2) Events</strong></p><p id="6261">Another area of our API that we have tried to simplify for users is our events system. Using simple callback functions, we can define events between graphics or plots, which allows for the generation and build-up of interactive visualizations.</p><p id="ace9">For example, suppose we wanted to define a simple click event. Let’s first generate some data.</p><pre><span id="8946">import fastplotlib as fpl<br>import numpy as np<p># generate some circles<br>def make_circle(center, radius: float, n_points: int = 75) -&gt; np.ndarray:<br>    theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n_points)<br>    xs = radius * np.sin(theta)<br>    ys = radius * np.cos(theta)</p><p>    return np.column_stack([xs, ys]) + center</p><p>circles = list()<br>for x in range(0, 50, 10):<br>    circles.append(make_circle(center=(x, 0), radius=4, n_points=100))</p><p># create figure<br>fig = fpl.Figure()</p><p># add circles to plot<br>circles_graphic = fig[0,0].add_line_collection(data=circles, cmap="tab10", thickness=10)</p><p>fig.show()</p></span></pre><figure><figcaption>simple plot of circles</figcaption></figure><p id="dd71">Now that we have generated our data, we can define a click event so that when we click on the plot, we get the closest circle and “highlight” it.</p><pre><span id="71ef"># get the nearest graphic that is clicked and change the color<br>@fig.renderer.add_event_handler("click")<br>def click_event(ev):<br>    # reset colors<br>    circles_graphic.cmap = "tab10"<p>    # map the click position to world coordinates<br>    xy = fig[0, 0].map_screen_to_world(ev)[:-1]</p><p>    # get the nearest graphic to the position<br>    nearest = fpl.utils.get_nearest_graphics(xy, circles_graphic)[0]</p><p>    # change the closest graphic color to white<br>    nearest.colors = "w"</p></span></pre><figure><figcaption>simple click event</figcaption></figure><p id="f29e">In <code>fastplotlib</code>, specifying an event is as simple as defining how we want to handle the event and then adding our handler to the appropriate graphic or plot the event corresponds to. The beauty of this approach is that it doesn’t require users to learn new, complicated, library-specific API features (knowing how to define functions is sufficient).</p><p id="21ed">The streamlined design of our API for data interaction and event handling is a key strength of the library, making <code>fastplotlib</code> both intuitive and easy to master.</p></div><div><h2 id="006b">Leveraging new hardware is critical</h2><p id="fdb8">These days, having a GPU is practically a prerequisite to doing science, and visualization is no exception.</p><p id="f57a">Maximizing the computational resources on the GPU is a key factor in making high-resolution performant visualizations.</p><p id="58f1">Depicted below is an example of plotting 3 million points using <code>fastplotlib</code>. Not only are we plotting the lines, but we are also easily zooming in and out, changing the color map of the lines, and even further, individually changing the color of specific points.</p><figure><figcaption>fastpotlib 3 million points line example</figcaption></figure><p id="e690">Plotting this many points at once and having fine-grained control over the colors of the points is impossible in many other Python scientific visualization libraries.</p><p id="b921">What makes the performance capabilities of <em>fastplotlib</em> so powerful is the underlying graphics technology on which it is built.</p><p id="ba6a"><strong>The nitty gritty details</strong></p><p id="24e5"><code>fastplotlib</code> is abstracted on top of the <a href="https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pygfx</a> rendering engine. <code>pygfx</code>, in turn, is powered by <a href="https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WGPU</a>, a cross-platform graphics API that targets Vulkan (Linux), Metal (Mac), and DX12 (Windows).</p><figure><figcaption>fastplotlib software stack</figcaption></figure><p id="dfb3">In essence, these new graphics APIs (Vulkan, Metal, and DX12) are very <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, and <strong>leverage GPU hardware better than OpenGL</strong>, the old graphics standard.</p><p id="178c">The reason we built <code>fastplotlib</code> on top of <code>pygfx</code> is to abstract away some of the lower-level rendering engine details (e.g., the camera, renderer, scene, etc.) that are boilerplate code for many visualizations. This allows users to focus primarily on their data!</p></div><div><h2 id="8c7f"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="dad0">It is one thing for it to be easy to see your data and explore different dimensions, but being able to interact with your data after it is initially plotted, we believe, is the key to driving scientific discovery. However, the ability to create these interactive plots that allow you to explore and analyze your data easily and intuitively is not trivial.</p><p id="254f">Many prominent Python visualization libraries force you to learn complicated APIs, making the barrier to entry high. Furthermore, many of these libraries are built on <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>, an older graphics API that <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Vulkan</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Metal</a>, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">DX12</a> are slowly replacing. These new graphics APIs leverage the GPU better, allowing for more powerful and expressive visualizations.</p><p id="ff35"><code>fastplotlib</code> seeks to address current challenges in Python scientific visualization by providing an easy-to-use array-like API that leverages modern graphics hardware to provide GPU-accelerated fast interactive visualization.</p></div><div><h2 id="b0f9"><strong>Documentation &amp; Examples</strong></h2><p id="03f9">Our documentation and examples can be found <a href="https://www.fastplotlib.org/ver/dev/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>Gary Schildhorn received <a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/terms-of-service-with-clare-duffy/episodes/9fe98d50-96cf-11ef-aa1b-07ca04432229" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a call</a> that no parent wants to receive. When Schildhorn picked up the phone, the voice of his panicked son told him that he had been in a car accident and was in jail. A second call, moments later, purportedly from a lawyer, gave Schildhorn instructions on how to pay the $9,000 bond. Schildhorn was preparing payment when he received a call from his real son, who was not, in fact, in jail. Schildhorn nearly fell victim to the growing trend of&nbsp;<a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes" data-sf-ec-immutable="">artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice scams</a>. AI-generated voices are a problem not only for fraud but also for the legal system. Indeed, accusations of AI-generated voice clones have now made their way into the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/pikesville-high-school-principal-sues-baltimore-county-schools-racist-ai-recording/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">courts</a>, and the way the courts deal with audio recording evidence needs to catch up.<br></p><p>Under the current Federal Rules of Evidence, someone trying to introduce an audio recording of a voice can satisfy the authentication standard for admissibility merely by putting a witness on the stand who says they are familiar with the person’s voice and the recording sounds like them. Specifically,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Rule 901</a> states that the following evidence “satisfies the requirement [for admissibility]: ... An opinion identifying a person’s voice—whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording—based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances that connect it with the alleged speaker.” The rule presumes that this evidence will be “sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.”<br></p><p>In the age of artificial intelligence, this presumption is no longer tenable. The Evidence Rulemaking Committee should amend the rules to make the enumerated examples in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Rule 901(b)</a> permissive, not mandatory. The examples should illustrate circumstances that <em>may </em>satisfy the authentication requirement while still leaving judges discretion to exclude an item of evidence if there is other proof that it is a fake.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Realism of AI-Powered Voice Clones</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few years, AI-powered voice synthesis and cloning has improved at an impressive clip, culminating this past year in dramatic breakthroughs. Perhaps most striking is the ability to convincingly clone a person’s voice from as little as 30 seconds of reference audio using easily-accessible and low-cost <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">commercial services</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, a recent suite of perceptual studies highlights the current realism of voice cloning. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03791" data-sf-ec-immutable="">large-scale online study</a>, we asked 300 people to listen to pairs of audio clips of people speaking. We then asked them a simple question: Were these clips from the same person, or a different person? People were actually quite good at performing this discrimination when presented with audio clips of real human beings. When the two clips came from the same person, listeners correctly detected this fact with a median accuracy of 100 percent. At the same time, they were fooled only about 10 percent of the time into thinking two similar-sounding voices from different identities were the same.<br></p><p>The issue, however, arises when listeners hear a pair of voices comprising one real person and an AI clone of that person (generated with ElevenLabs, a voice-cloning service that is easy for anyone to use). In this case, listeners judged the real person and their AI clone to be the same person about 80 percent of the time, with one in four participants tricked by every single AI clone used in the study.<br></p><p>The upshot is clear: People can no longer reliably distinguish between a real voice of someone and the person’s AI clone. In a second study, we also asked listeners to explicitly make a real versus AI-generated judgment on audio clips. While they performed above chance (50 percent), the average performance across listeners (64 percent) was still well below what might be desired for definitive evidence. We are not the only researchers to find evidence of this deficiency. Others have reported similar issues, although performance can vary depending on the study details. For example, two other research groups recently reported accurate real/AI discrimination&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3552466.3556531" data-sf-ec-immutable="">superior to our findings</a> (although still <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0285333" data-sf-ec-immutable="">falling short</a> of 100 percent, with rates around 70-80 percent). However, these studies did not employ current state-of-the-art AI-clone technology, which is constantly improving.</p><p>There are, of course, caveats to these conclusions because no perceptual study perfectly recreates the real-world experience pertinent to criminal law. For example, the length and quality (in terms of audio compression rates or background noise) can impact people’s ability to discern the identity and naturalness of a voice. Similarly, while Schildhorn was taken in by his scammer, people may be generally better at this task for voices of individuals they know.<br></p><p><strong>Policy Recommendation</strong></p><p>Given these technological developments, it should not be the case that parties are entitled to introduce a voice recording to a jury merely by calling a witness to the stand who says they can identify the speaker because they are familiar with the voice. Even a witness, like Gary Schildhorn—who really thinks they know the speaker—might be wrong. Yet, under the current, mandatory version of Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(5), even if the party opposing that evidence were to introduce reliable forensic proof that the audio is an AI-generated fake, the rules would arguably require the judge to admit the recording. That’s ridiculous.<br></p><p>The Evidence Rulemaking Committee should fix this problem by adding the word “may” to Rule 901(b) so that it reads: “The following are examples only—not a complete list—of evidence that <em>may satisfy </em>the requirement [of authenticity]” (emphasis added). This would shift admissibility for all the enumerated examples, including the option to authenticate the identity of a person’s voice by calling a witness to the stand who says they recognize the speaker, to a permissive rule rather than a mandatory one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other aspects of the authentication rule need not change for AI specifically. To be sure, one might criticize the low sufficiency standard that makes it easy to admit all kinds of physical evidence as long as you have <em>some </em>basis to think it is authentic, the lack of a distinct reliability analysis for expert “<a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04_agenda_book_for_evidence_rules_meeting_final.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable="">machine-generated evidence</a><a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04_agenda_book_for_evidence_rules_meeting_final.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable="">,</a>” or the fact that—as with evidence law generally—it is the opposing party’s burden to object in a timely fashion or forever hold their peace. Yet, if these other aspects of the rules are problematic, then they are problematic for lots of physical evidence, not just AI-generated content.<br></p><p>What recent perceptual studies of AI-powered voice clones do show is that a mandatory route to authentication can quickly become outdated.<br></p><p>Hence, it would be better for authenticating all kinds of evidence to give judges discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the party offering the evidence has made a sufficient showing that it is what they claim it is. Judges would still apply the low sufficiency standard, so they would not be substituting their judgment for that of the jury, raising the burden on parties seeking to introduce evidence, or opening the floodgates to a morass of evidentiary disputes. But the rules would no longer force judges to admit evidence when there is compelling proof that the evidence is fake.<br></p><p>This is not a recommendation to future-proof the law: It is a need to present-proof it.<br></p>

Now, NIST has <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8545/final">selected a backup algorithm</a> that can provide a second line of defense for the task of general encryption, which safeguards internet traffic and stored data alike.</p><p>Encryption protects sensitive electronic information, including internet traffic and medical and financial records, as well as corporate and national security secrets. But a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, if one is ever built, would be able to break that defense. NIST has been working for more than eight years on encryption algorithms that even a quantum computer cannot break.</p><p>Last year, NIST <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">published an encryption standard</a> based on a quantum-resistant algorithm called ML-KEM. The new algorithm, called HQC, will serve as a backup defense in case quantum computers are someday able to crack ML-KEM. Both these algorithms are designed to protect stored information as well as data that travels across public networks.</p><p><h2>What is post-quantum cryptography? <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/what-post-quantum-cryptography" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f2f6ed0-b8b5-4d2a-bd0b-ead8906fd5fd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="What Is Post-Quantum Cryptography?&nbsp; ">Read an explainer.</a>&nbsp;</h2></p><p>HQC is not intended to take the place of ML-KEM, which will remain the recommended choice for general encryption, said Dustin Moody, a mathematician who heads NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography project.&nbsp;</p><p>“Organizations should continue to migrate their encryption systems to the standards we finalized in 2024,” he said. “We are announcing the selection of HQC because we want to have a backup standard that is based on a different math approach than ML-KEM. As we advance our understanding of future quantum computers and adapt to emerging cryptanalysis techniques, it’s essential to have a fallback in case ML-KEM proves to be vulnerable.”</p><h2>Encryption Based on Two Math Problems</h2><p>Encryption systems rely on complex math problems that conventional computers find difficult or impossible to solve. A sufficiently capable quantum computer, though, would be able to sift through a vast number of potential solutions to these problems very quickly, thereby defeating current encryption.</p><p>While the ML-KEM algorithm is built around a mathematical idea called structured lattices, the HQC algorithm is built around another concept called <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-errors6">error-correcting codes</a>, which have been used in information security for decades. Moody said that HQC is a lengthier algorithm than ML-KEM and therefore demands more computing resources. However its clean and secure operation convinced reviewers that it would make a worthy backup choice.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Organizations should continue to migrate their encryption systems to the standards NIST finalized in 2024. We are announcing the selection of HQC because we want to have a backup standard that is based on a different math approach than ML-KEM.” —Dustin Moody, NIST mathematician and project head</em></p><h2>Present and Future Standards</h2><p>HQC is the latest algorithm chosen by NIST’s <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Cryptography project</a>, which has overseen efforts since 2016 to head off potential threats from quantum computers.

This guidance, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/227/ipd"><em>Recommendations for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms</em> (NIST Special Publication 800-227)</a>, describes the basic definitions, properties and applications of KEMs. It also provides recommendations for implementing and using KEMs in a secure manner.

            <p>Today I’m excited to announce the next steps we’re taking to radically improve TypeScript performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="A 10x Faster TypeScript" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNlq-EVld70?si=OaEgTg6ROtfYDYLt" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The core value proposition of TypeScript is an excellent developer experience.
As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.</p>
<p>To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will <strong>drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage</strong>.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of <code>tsc</code> capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.</p>
<p>You can <strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go">build and run the Go code from our new working repo</a></strong>, which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run <code>tsc</code> and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-faster">How Much Faster?</h2>
<p>Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/src/compiler">the TypeScript compiler itself</a>.
Here are times to run <code>tsc</code> on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:</p>

<p>While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.</p>
<p>We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.</p>
<h2 id="editor-speed">Editor Speed</h2>
<p>Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.</p>
<p>Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an <strong>8x improvement in project load time</strong> in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.</p>
<p>Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.</p>
<h2 id="versioning-roadmap">Versioning Roadmap</h2>
<p>Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.</p>
<p>When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as <strong>TypeScript 7.0</strong>.
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.</p>
<p>While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.</p>
<p>Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/categories/faqs">FAQs</a> on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the <a href="https://discord.gg/typescript">TypeScript Community Discord</a> at <strong>10 AM PDT | 5 PM UTC</strong> on March 13th.</p>
<p>A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!</p>

The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be "mommucked".<!-- --></p><p>In an effort to put his "America first" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgq5pzpllo">English the country's official language<!-- --></a>. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country – and many Americans don't understand it.<!-- --></p><p>As the island's <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/with%20origins%20dating%20back%20to%20the%201600s,%20Ocracoke%20Brogue%20is%20about%20as%20American%20as%20it%20gets.https://www.visitocracokenc.com/island-brogue/">official website<!-- --></a> proudly proclaims: "With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets."<!-- --></p><p>Located 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can’t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.<!-- --></p><p>William Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard’s ship Queen Anne’s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard’s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for £105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.<!-- --></p><p>Howard settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking. &nbsp;<!-- --></p><p>"It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American," said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State’s <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://languageandlife.org/">Language and Life Project<!-- --></a>. "That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America."<!-- --></p><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>VIDEO: Click the play button above to watch "The last British accent in the US"<!-- --></figcaption></p><p>Howard's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/north-carolina/ocracoke">676 residents<!-- --></a> than on mainland North Carolina.<!-- --></p><p>"You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here," said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blackbeardslodge.com/">Blackbeard's Lodge<!-- --></a>. "There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle."<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><p><span>With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets</span></p></div><p>Yes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.<!-- --></p><p>"It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country," Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. "You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that."<!-- --></p><p>And they've still – just – maintained their unique way of speaking.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="William Graham/Alamy The island’s isolation preserved the Hoi Toider dialect, a mix of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents, and pirate slang (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)"><span>William Graham/Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The island’s isolation preserved the Hoi Toider dialect, a mix of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents, and pirate slang (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>When older Ocracoke natives, or "O'cockers" as they call themselves, speak, the "I" sound is an "oi", so they say "hoi" instead of "high". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say "high tide".<!-- --></p><p>Then there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might "mommuck a buck before going up the beach", which means "to tease a friend before going off the island".<!-- --></p><p>"We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own," said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs the <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.villagecraftsmen.com/">Village Craftsmen<!-- --></a>, a local arts and crafts store. "[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word "pizer" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch."<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><p><span>Coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country</span></p></div><p>There's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. "Quamish", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word "qualm". Then there's "buck", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.<!-- --></p><p>Locals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out "meehonkey" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's "dingbatter", which is used for anyone who isn’t a native.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Ocracoke is home to a British cemetery and some residents still speak with an Elizabethan-esque brogue (Credit: Alamy)"><span>Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Ocracoke is home to a British cemetery and some residents still speak with an Elizabethan-esque brogue (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.<!-- --></p><p>"What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past," said Dr Wolfram. "They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now it’s an exception."<!-- --></p><p>In the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.<!-- --></p><p>"Within one to two generations, it'll be gone," said Dr Wolfram.

In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.<!-- --></p><p>"Ocracoke is really good at adapting," said Amy. "I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you won’t have everything you need."<!-- --></p><p>That's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.<!-- --></p><p>"She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves," Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. "She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes."<!-- --></p><p>Now every year in August, the island holds a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitocracokenc.com/calendar-event/ocracoke-fig-festival/">Fig Festival<!-- --></a>, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgbp.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="William Graham/Alamy As Ocracoke has more interaction with the mainland, experts foresee the Hoi Toider dialect disappearing within the next few generations (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)"><span>William Graham/Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>As Ocracoke has more interaction with the mainland, experts foresee the Hoi Toider dialect disappearing within the next few generations (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.<!-- --></p><p>New York native Daphne Bennink&nbsp;came to the island 35 years ago and never left.

"On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. It’s a little bit of a melting pot."<!-- --></p><p>As for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem. The dialect may change, but the intent behind those words will remain the same.<!-- --></p><p>--<!-- --></p><p><i id="if-you-liked-this-story,">If you liked this story,&nbsp;<!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;"><i id="sign-up-for-the-essential-list-newsletter">sign up for The Essential List newsletter<!-- --></i></a><i id="–-a-handpicked-selection-of-features,-videos-and-can't-miss-news,-delivered-to-your-inbox-twice-a-week.">&nbsp;– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.<!-- --></i></p><p><i id="for-more-travel-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on">For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on&nbsp;<!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/"><i id="facebook">Facebook<!-- --></i></a><i id=",">,&nbsp;<!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel"><i id="x">X<!-- --></i></a><i id="and">&nbsp;and&nbsp;<!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/"><i id="instagram">Instagram<!-- --></i></a>.<!-- --></p></article></div>]]></description>

                        As the University of Chicago has expanded its property
                        footprint on the South Side, conflicting priorities,

                        a historically fraught “town and gown” relationship with
                        the surrounding neighborhoods. Setting the stage for

                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly saturating existing benchmarks, necessitating new open-ended evaluations.
                                We introduce the <b>Factorio Learning Environment (FLE)</b>, based on the game of Factorio, that tests agents in long-term planning, program synthesis, and resource optimization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                FLE provides open-ended and exponentially scaling challenges - from basic automation to complex factories processing millions of resource units per second.
                                We provide two settings:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Lab-play</b> consisting of 24 structured tasks with fixed resources.</li>
                                <li><b>Open-play</b> with the unbounded task of building the largest factory from scratch on a procedurally generated map.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                We demonstrate across both settings that models still lack strong spatial reasoning.
                                In lab-play, we find that LLMs exhibit promising short-horizon skills, yet are unable to operate effectively in constrained environments, reflecting limitations in error analysis.
                                In open-play, while LLMs discover automation strategies that improve growth (e.g electric-powered drilling), they fail to achieve complex automation (e.g electronic-circuit manufacturing).
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
          <div>
                <h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>

                <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex question-answer (QA) problems, saturating benchmarks in factual recollection, reasoning and code generation.
                    Benchmark saturation presents a critical challenge for the AI research community: how do we meaningfully evaluate and differentiate increasingly capable models?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We introduce the <b>Factorio Learning Environment (FLE)</b>: a novel framework built upon the game of Factorio that addresses this challenge by enabling <i>unbounded</i> agent evaluation. FLE provides the infrastructure, API, and metrics for assessing frontier LLM agents in code generation, spatial reasoning and long-term planning.
                    In this environment, agents must navigate rapidly scaling challenges—from basic resource extraction producing ~30 units/minute to sophisticated production chains processing millions of units/second. This dramatic growth in complexity, driven by geometric increases in research costs and the combinatorial expansion of interdependent production chains, creates natural curricula for evaluating increasingly capable agents.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Within FLE, we define two complementary evaluation protocols: (1) <b>lab-play</b> with structured, goal-oriented tasks that have clear completion criteria, allowing targeted assessment of specific capabilities, and (2) <b>open-play</b> with no predetermined end-state, supporting truly unbounded evaluation of an agent's ability to autonomously set and achieve increasingly complex goals.
                </p>

                                    <b>Agents in FLE aim to optimise factories programmatically.</b> Left: Agents aim to create increasingly efficient factories, advancing through technological tiers to produce more resources per second. Middle: We provide a Python API to Factorio which enables direct interaction with the environment through code. Right: Agents submit programs to the game server and receive rich feedback, enabling them to refine their strategies through an iterative process of exploration and refinement.

                                    <b>Agents develop policies through an interactive feedback loop.</b>
                                    Using 23 core API tools, agents compose programs that interact with the environment and observe the results through <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> streams.
                                    The Python namespace allows agents to store variables and define functions for later use, enabling increasingly sophisticated strategies as experience grows.
                                    This approach mirrors the way human programmers learn - through iteration, debugging, and refinement based on direct feedback.
                                    Agent programs yield both a Production Score (PS) representing the economic value of all items produced, and milestones that reflect technological advancements.

                <p>
                    To systematically evaluate agent capabilities in the Factorio Learning Environment, we introduce two complementary experimental settings that test different aspects of planning, automation, and resource management; namely <i>open-play</i> and <i>lab-play</i>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We evaluate six frontier language models across both settings: Claude 3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini, Deepseek-v3, Gemini-2-Flash, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.
                    Each model interacts with the environment through a consistent prompting approach, receiving the API schema, a guide describing common patterns, and memory of past actions and observations.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Open-Play</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Agents begin in a procedurally generated world with instruction to "build the largest possible factory". This setting tests agents' ability to set appropriate goals, balance short-term production against long-term research, and navigate the complex tech tree and game map without external guidance.
                </p>
                <div>

                                <span>
                            <b>Agent capabilities are clearly differentiated by their production scores in open-play.</b>
                                    Left: By plotting Production Score (PS) against steps on a log/log scale, we can observe distinct performance trajectories for each model.
                                    More capable models not only achieve higher scores but demonstrate steeper growth curves, indicating better long-term planning.
                                    Milestone annotations show when the median agent first created key entities, revealing how quickly each model progresses through the tech tree.

                                <b>Production strategies reveal differences in agent planning and capabilities.</b>
                                    We track how various models produce items with multiple antecedent ingredients in open-play, showing not just what they build but how they approach factory design.
                                    Claude 3.5-Sonnet demonstrates sophisticated strategy by immediately beginning complex crafting and investing in research and automation, ultimately unlocking <code>electric-mining-drills</code> around step 3k - a decision that boosts <code>iron-plate</code> production by 50% thereafter.
                                    In contrast, less advanced models like GPT-4o-Mini produce minimal quantities of multi-ingredient items, revealing limitations in planning horizons.
                                    Interestingly, Deepseek showed stronger capabilities in lab-play than open-play, suggesting that its general capabilities exceed its objective-setting abilities in open-ended environments.

                <p>
                    Agents are provided with resources and given a time-limit to achieve an objective.
                    We task agents to build production lines of 24 distinct target entities of increasing complexity, starting from a single resource mine requiring at most 2 machines (making <code>iron-ore</code>) to a late game entity requiring the coordination of close to 100 machines (making <code>utility-science-pack</code>).
                    The target entities cover items from early to late game, requiring agents to use a wide variety of machines present in Factorio (drills, furnaces, assembling machines, oil refineries, chemical plants). As the task difficulty naturally increases with resource requirements, this provides a measure of the complexity that agents are capable of creating in a limited number of steps.
                    All tasks provide the agent with sufficient resources to complete the task with all technologies unlocked.

Even the most capable models struggle with coordinating more than six machines when producing items with three or more ingredients. Bottom: Production progress over time shows a pattern of initial rapid advancement followed by stagnation or regression. This reveals a key limitation in current agents' abilities: they often break existing functional structures when attempting to scale production or add new factory sections. The high variance in task progress across runs further demonstrates the challenge of consistent performance in complex automation tasks.

                                    The factory consists of a electricity steam generator (top-left), a coal mine with storage buffer (top), a crude-oil to petroleum gas pipeline (bottom) and a chemical plant  (bottom-right).
                                    The chemical plant creates plastic bars using the coal and petroleum gas as inputs. By themselves, the cumulative raw resources generate a production score of $224$.
                                    With this specific layout, the factory creates $40$ plastic bars per $60$ in-game seconds, for a production score of $352$.
                                    This factory was created by Claude Sonnet 3.5.

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>
                Our experiments revealed several key patterns that highlight both the capabilities and limitations of current AI agents when faced with open-ended industrial challenges:
                </p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                                <h4>1. Coding skill predicts performance</h4>
                                <p>Models with stronger coding abilities (Claude 3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o) achieved higher Production Scores and completed more lab tasks. Claude outperformed others with a PS of 293,206 and 28 milestones, progressing beyond early-game resource extraction.</p>
                            </div>

                        <div>
                                <h4>2. Technology investment drives growth</h4>
                                <p>Only Claude consistently invested resources in researching new technologies, despite their importance for long-term progression. After deploying electric mining drills at step 3k, Claude's PS grew by 50% (from 200k to 300k), demonstrating the value of strategic investment.</p>
                            </div>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <div>
                                <h4>3. Planning is essential in open-play</h4>
                                <p>In open-play, agents frequently pursue short-sighted objectives — like Gemini-2.0 manually crafting 300+ wooden chests over 100 steps — rather than investing in research or scaling existing production. This reveals a telling discrepancy: while Gemini-2 and Deepseek demonstrate early-game automation capabilities in structured lab-play, they rarely attempt to create cohesive factories during open-ended exploration, resulting in poorer overall performance.</p>
                            </div>

                       <div>
                                <h4>4. Spatial reasoning is a major limitation</h4>
<!--                                <p>Models struggled with spatial planning when building multi-section factories. Common failures included placing entities too close together, not leaving room for connections, or incorrect inserter placement, leading to significant underperformance in complex tasks.</p>-->
<!--                            -->
                                <p>All models exhibited limitations in spatial planning when constructing multi-section factories. Common failures included placing entities too close together, not allocating space for connections, or incorrect inserter placement - issues that severely impacted performance in complex tasks requiring coordination of multiple production lines.</p>

                                <h4>5. Error recovery poses a significant challenge</h4>
                                <p>Models frequently become trapped in repetitive error patterns, attempting the same invalid operations repeatedly rather than exploring alternative solutions. For instance, GPT-4o repeated the same API method incorrectly for 78 consecutive steps despite identical error messages.</p>
                            </div>
                        <div>
                                <h4>6. Programming styles vary significantly</h4>
                                <p>Models exhibited distinct coding approaches: Claude favored a REPL style with extensive print statements (43.3% of code lines) but few assertions (2.0%), while GPT-4o used a defensive style with more validation checks (12.8% assertions) and fewer prints (10.3%).</p>

<p>This is a Call for Action for the United States of America and the West. We are in the early precipice of a nonlinear transformation in industrial society, but the bedrock the US is standing on is shaky. Automation and robotics is currently undergoing a revolution that will enable full-scale automation of all manufacturing and mission-critical industries. These intelligent robotics systems will be the first ever additional industrial piece that is not supplemental but fully additive– 24/7 labor with higher throughput than any human—, allowing for massive expansion in production capacities past adding another human unit of work. The only country that is positioned to capture this level of automation is currently China, and should China achieve it without the US following suit, the production expansion will be granted only to China, posing an existential threat to the US as it is outcompeted in all capacities.</p>



<p>This is the manufacturing playing field that China has dominated for years now. The country has one of the most competitive economies in the world internally, where they will naturally achieve economies of scale and have shown themselves to be one of most skilled in high-volume manufacturing, at the same time their engineering quality has grown to be competitive in several critical industries at the highest level. This has already happened in batteries, solar, and is well underway in EVs. With these economies of scale, they are able to supply large developing markets, like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and others, allowing them to extend their advantage and influence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact of this in robotics will be exponential compared to their last strategic industry captures. These will be robotics systems manufacturing more robotics systems, and with each unit produced the cost will be driven down continuously and the quality will improve, only strengthening their production flywheel. This will repeat ad infinitum and as quality inevitably increases it will make it extraordinarily difficult for other countries to compete. Due to the fact that robotics is a general purpose technology, this will have horizontal impacts on all manufacturing sectors and all other currently advantaged industries as well–textiles, electronics, consumer goods, etc. At the moment, the West is caught flatfooted: South Korea and Japan have a birth rate crisis that is throttling their manufacturing capabilities, European industrial sectors are being eaten alive by China and their inability to generate power, and the US is focused on other markets and procuring cheap overseas production, all the while China’s manufacturing capacity has gotten stronger and robotics is catching fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China’s robotics localization effort is well underway. Local firms are taking over the world’s largest market, approaching a 50% market share, compared to just 30% in 2020. While Chinese manufacturers are currently on par with Western giants in the low-end market, our supply chain review leads us to believe that local firms are beginning to take over the higher-end market segments. The rise of Unitree exemplifies this shift: the only viable humanoid robot on the market, the Unitree G1, is now entirely decoupled from American components.<br></p>

<p>Today, building an identical robot arm (modeled after the Universal Robots UR5e) in the US<strong> is ~2.2x more expensive than in China</strong>. Under the hood, the situation is even more alarming. Even if those components are labeled “Made in USA”, they rely <em>heavily </em>upon China-made parts and materials – with no viable scalable alternative.</p>

<p>The commercial drone market exemplifies China’s scale/oversupply playbook in every strategic industry it has entered, however, this is the first example of the strategy in a robotics-adjacent market. Local leader DJI today accounts for over <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/a-global-strategy-to-secure-uas-supply-chains/">80%</a> of the global commercial drone market… and 90% in the <strong>American consumer market</strong>! While the company was a first-mover, it maintained and consolidated its market position for over a decade thanks to China’s manufacturing dominance and economies of scale/oversupply strategy.</p>

<p>Let us explain how. To properly develop a functional and robust piece of hardware, the creation + recreation (i.e. manufacturing) must be iterated repeatedly and rapidly to work out the kinks and perfect the product before competitors. However, the most challenging thing for Western competitors is that Chinese markets are built to reward the company that can scale the fastest, so before a Chinese competitor ever enters the Western market it has already outclassed them in cost, all that’s left is for the quality to refine over the coming iterations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GoPro tried to compete in the consumer drone market despite having most of its manufacturing based in China, Malaysia, and Japan, which meant that each iteration of their drone took several weeks – likely starting the design in California, sending over the details to the manufacturers in China and having them build it, and shipping it back to the USA before ever finding out what needed to be ironed out in this attempt. Contrast this with DJI, which was based in Shenzhen, meaning the company could get any needed part from any factory in Shenzhen within hours of ordering and iterate at an unreal speed.</p>



<p>As a result, in 2016, GoPro’s Karma Drone + Hero5 were outclassed by DJI’s drones. At $999 vs $1,099, DJI was slightly cheaper, had a battery life 50% longer, had obstacle avoidance already implemented, and the launch of the Karma was plagued with hardware issues and a <a href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/GoPro-Announces-Karma-Recall-and-Refund-Program/default.aspx">recall/refund program</a> for their faulty product, which sometimes lost power during operation. GoPro likely could have solved these problems through enough work, but the company simply didn’t have the time, as DJI had already surpassed them in every way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quickly after entering the Western markets, DJI’s incredible cost advantage and sheer production capacity quickly led to oversupplying the market, and capturing a massive amount of market share. Every other major drone company was quickly undercut heavily by DJI’s aggressive pricing. GoPro cited “<a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/01/08/gopro-kills-karma-exits-drone-business/">margin challenges</a>” being a reason for disbanding their Karma program, and many other <a href="https://www.open-electronics.org/behind-the-crash-of-3d-robotics-north-americas-most-promising-drone-company/">companies crashed</a> alongside. DJI was the only one to understand that this was a competition of scale and had long been prepared before entering the Western markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the world of Robotics, manufacturing dominance is key. To build a complete and functional robot means recreating the robot countless times and fine-tuning each minor mistake until a solid, scalable, and cost-effective product. This luxury is readily available to those who have the manufacturing capacity nearby and at an affordable cost, and its absence means a disadvantage. With a share of GDP three times higher than that of the US, China’s industrial base outcompetes that of America’s in every possible way.</p>

<p>Our goal with this multi-part Robotics series is to illuminate landscape of the robotics and manufacturing industry, and convey the magnitude of the labor transformation it is poised to unleash. In Part One, we examine the current state of the market and take a deep dive into the hardware architecture of commercially available industrial robots. Our analysis demonstrates that China is rapidly taking over the market, leaving competing nations behind and preparing to capture a revolutionary technology. We also explore the broader repercussions for the Western trailing-edge semiconductor ecosystem.</p>



<p>China’s ascendancy positions it perfectly to lead next-generation robotics—a field we anticipate will generate significantly higher macroeconomic benefits. In Parts Two and Three of our series, we will delve into the intricate hardware and software architectures of next-generation systems and address the remaining challenges on the path to achieving “Robotics AGI” across form factors. We will also pinpoint the likely frontrunners in this emerging market.</p>



<p>For now, let’s start with some basics and explain how why robots are more difficult to build than most understand.</p>



<h2 id="more-than-just-a-robot">More Than Just A “Robot”</h2>



<p><strong></strong>Robotics is a systems engineering problem with the end goal being a machine, or multiple machines, that can produce one or more human unit of work at equal or lower cost than that of a human. The feat is designing both a system of hardware with many many interconnected individual parts integrated with the software layer, where the software layer understands how to move and plan with the hardware. Repeated iterations are <strong>necessary </strong>to identify the discrepancies between the two systems and resolve them toward perfect accuracy. In essence, this is a delicate dance between two systems, with each iteration of choreography carving synchronicity from complexity. What happens as each etch gets closer to resolution?</p>



<p>Engineering reliability into a system that is low-cost, performant, and scalable achieves a new type of system that has never existed. Comparing a robotic system to a human, the current labor force is lower skilled, lower ability, and a much higher attrition rate. Fusing mechanical capability with a software intelligence brings the world closer and closer to fully expanding the capacities of an industrial economy beyond the constraints of human labor. Similar to humans integrating sensory inputs and cognitive processing to understand and interact with the world, an embodied AI would perform the same actions and operate autonomously, allowing a new group of systems to contribute to all sectors. The imminent robotics transformation is promising to solve all of these and create a new labor force that only movies have been able to depict, but there’s more depth to the field and the industry than the words “embodied AI” might entail.</p>



<p>Operating in this industry has historically been traumatic, from manufacturing capabilities being subpar, to managing a business with a product that is a nightmare to scale, with many bottlenecks constantly in place:</p>



<ul>
<li>Limited innovation in hardware throttling accuracy and efficiency in mobility and manipulation</li>



<li>Software/AI capabilities that never enabled variety among capabilities and real-time understanding&nbsp;</li>



<li>Exorbitant upfront CapEx for installation</li>



<li>Elevated OpEx for maintenance of the systems&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>These have historically combined together to make automation a problem more than a solution. However, breakthroughs in hardware and AI models have finally unlocked the floodgates for early stages of rapid progress and unlocked the potential for general-purpose robotics.</p>



<h2 id="towards-general-purpose-robotics"><strong>Towards General Purpose Robotics</strong></h2>



<p>General purpose robotics is the holy grail of robotics: a robot that can do any task in any environment, replacing the need for a human in the industrial process. Every step along the way the world will see massive unlocks for whoever steps toward general purpose robotics first. The robots currently implemented at scale across the world are rigid and fragile: environments must be predefined and tasks must be static, and any minute change in one factor means the robot will destroy the process. The bottlenecks in place have been impossible to break and stifled the whole industry of robotics for generations, intelligent or not. This meant the only improvements possible have been small, iterative, and incremental developments, and any company who tried to equip robots with anything above the current level of capabilities failed, leaving many researchers and investors sidelined and scarred, especially in Western markets. The only people who tried to cross the chasm into general-purpose robotics have been researchers in a lab. Building a functional replacement for a human that can achieve the same level accuracy as a human, often requiring ~99.99%, and making sure it was worth it in cost over a long enough timespan was a pipedream. Why would anyone believe it?</p>



<p>Not even Google was able to overcome the data scarcity problem, having famously constructed an “arm farm” of 14 robots running continuously for 3,000 hours simply to achieve reliable grasping. This never left the lab. Data scarcity was a crippling challenge. Researchers were forced to build jerry-rigged robots due to the absence of hardware standardization, and then manually gather training data, a process that consumed vast amounts of time and resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, unlike the freely-available textual data on the internet that fueled LLMs, robotics demanded multimodal data, which did not exist. Every person trying to train a robot had to collect all data themselves in physical space with a functional robot. Hardware limitations compounded the issue. It was incredibly difficult to build a system of strong enough actuators that could fine-tune movements, all interconnected with non-standardized parts that don’t understand each other, into a robot that could perform one task with slight variations, and much less one that could perform a wide array of actions.</p>



<p>However, we’re in the early precipice of this nonlinear transformation, but the bedrock the US is standing on is shaky. Significant research and funding across the entire robotics stack have yielded a cascade of breakthroughs. Advances in realistic simulated data, the ability to scale up real world training on multiple robots, and the rise of foundation models have opened the door for a more intelligent system. Simultaneously, advancements in hardware, like electric actuators, have brought down costs greatly and given robots better efficiency to operate at the desired accuracy level, unlocking new actions that were impossible before. <strong>General-purpose robotics has finally been unlocked as a potential real world solution.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first movement toward general-purpose robotics will be the entrance into “partially unstructured” domains – initially within their usual environments. In factories, this means operating outside of their isolated predefined environment and handling more than one task. As robots slide across the spectrum toward general purpose, they will replace more and more difficult and diverse tasks in factory settings until they can automate every step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An even more difficult domain for robots is the human-populated domain, in which robots are considered intelligent/safe enough to operate in wholly unstructured and dynamic environments. Since human behavior is unpredictable, robots will need to adapt to avoid safety risks. In addition to full automation of industry, these robots will ease staffing shortages in elder care, improve hospital efficiency, enhance surgical accuracy, and automate dangerous construction tasks, thereby capturing nearly all labor demand.</p>



<h2 id="china-is-already-living-in-another-world">China Is Already Living In Another World</h2>



<p>Due to Chinese governmental investment and strategic declaration to accelerate robotics, the country has created incredible processes all while still under the usual rigid and fragile constraints of robotics systems. While still requiring perfectly structured environments and static tasks, China has implemented fully “lights-out” factories. Xiaomi’s “<a href="https://itc.ua/en/news/xiaomi-s-new-smart-factory-will-operate-24-7-without-people-and-produce-60-smartphones-per-minute/">lights-out</a>” factory operates round-the-clock producing one smartphone per second – with zero humans employed. This is not the only <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/u-joy-cities-the-worlds-largest-5-5g-native-lights-out-factory/">one</a> <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/internet-of-things/digital-industries-20/benefits-use-case/foxconn-lights-off-factory/">either</a>, China is able to achieve this level of automation without general purpose robotics, and the implications for their production capacity when general-purpose arrives cannot be understated. This is not a statement that the US is losing, this is to demonstrate an absurd difference in manufacturing proficiency. This has nothing to do with cheap Chinese labor, this is a manufacturing country with a robust industrial base that has now created one single machine that can produce goods entirely autonomously. General purpose robotics would make this indistinguishable from a living organism, with mobile robots constantly moving around and solving tasks to support and keep the organism alive and functional.</p>

<p>This is only the first step in creating entirely automated machines to produce goods, and they will evolve as AI foundation models become more reliable and accurate. The country has already enabled robots to build robots at their KUKA <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/robots-build-robots-at-kukas-guangdong-facility-producing-one-every-half-hour">factory</a> in Guangdong, and a director at KUKA said that they should be able to cut times from one robot every half hour to one robot every one minute. They’re right. All of these aforementioned factories are running on either minimal levels of AI or the usual structured environment with static tasks and basic programming. General purpose robotics will turn this business into one single machine, and soon after, any complex manufacturing task could be completed by a general purpose robotic system.</p>



<h2 id="from-industrial-robots-to-cobots"><strong>From Industrial Robots to Cobots</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s take a step back and first understand the current state of the industry. There are many types of robots and form factors that have become much more diverse and feasible in the last few years. The robots that have been most compelling for implementing automation at scale for the past decades however have been the industrial robots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditional industrial robots, like an articulated robot arm, prioritize speed, precision, and payload capacity. Equipped with high-torque actuators and finely tuned high-frequency control systems for precision, they are typically found in heavy industry environments that require repetition and high throughput, i.e. automotive factories or electronics manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are required to work in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBlGe12UGVI">isolated cells</a> for two reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>Human safety,</li>



<li>Their lack of flexibility.</li>
</ol>



<p>These robots are not capable of adaptation: any small deviation in the environment can break their process. For example,<strong> </strong>in automotive industries, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWwNsgw24NE">spot welding metal panels</a> together is often automated. This task requires remarkable accuracy to ensure the panels are correctly positioned next to each other, the spot weld is exactly over the designated points, and the weld is applied with the same consistent force and duration <strong>every time.</strong> Due to the accurate nature of the task, any slight deviation in the positioning or timing can affect the weld, and consequently the structural integrity of the vehicle</p>

<p>Collaborative robots (cobots) are the proposed solution to a human populated environment subject to the inherent dynamism of the world – enabling a higher level of automation inside a factory. Similar looking to an industrial robot but a bit smaller, they trade-off payload capacity with higher safety, flexibility and programmability – and can easily be restaked and moved around a factory when necessary. These are often the robots that are given higher levels of AI capabilities for some tasks today (higher variability pick and place and sorting).</p>

<p>Cobots sacrifice payload capacity and speed with weaker actuators and adding some type of safety hardware in place such as force-torque sensors to understand collision, additional vision sensors to build a more comprehensive view, and more onboard controllers for redundancy. They can be hand-guided or taught via some interface (tablet typically) so that programming an action requires less expertise and enabling them to easily change simple tasks.</p>



<p>Typically given the tasks that require less force and more finesse, cobots (collaborative robots) might be tasked with lightweight materials handling in between processes in a factory where the industrial robot would take the materials and perform the heavier tasks. Cobots can also work as a companion to other industrial machines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">CNCs</a> (Computer Numerical Control) – where they can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNeRrsu4s3Y">load</a> the CNC with raw materials, retrieve the finished parts, and even perform routine supporting tasks like cleaning or quality checking. We show below an example of a robotic arm interacting with a CNC machine.</p>

<p>Naturally, the share of cobots of all industrial robot installations has been rising fast, as they enable higher automation settings and improved factory ROI. Cobots are financially viable in industrial settings, as the environment can be structured enough to make sure the robot’s accuracy on tasks remains high. At the moment, there are <strong>over four million robots installed and operating around the world</strong>, with 90% of annual shipments being standard industrial robots and <a href="https://ifr.org/img/worldrobotics/Press_Conference_2024.pdf">10%</a> cobots. Industrial robots are usually implemented in automotive sectors, packaging in food and consumer goods, and electronics manufacturing. Cobots are seen in the same industries performing more complex tasks that require great precision, but under the guidance and instruction of human workers</p>

<p>While the scale of automation is impressive, there are reasons these robots are nearly always found in factory settings. Not all manufacturing is easy for these robots, high-mix low-volume production where frequent changes are common make it difficult to fully automate tasks and most tasks that require fine motor skills and dexterity require levels of manipulation not developed yet. Cobots are posed as the solution for this as well, but in practice, automation entails much more flexibility and capability than any of the current robots can provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mobile robots have been the newest addition to the robotic fleet of automation, leveraging mobility to conduct transportation tasks and coordinating with other robots, however, all have different difficulties, domains, and advantages in their mobility capabilities. Autonomous Guided Vehicles were the first foray into mobility around the same time as cobots. Their job is simple: transport objects, like a package inside of an Amazon fulfillment center, to another location. These are still rigid as most other robots, requiring that some guidance be placed on the floor for the AGV to follow. </p>

<p>Mobile manipulators are often wheeled manipulators that are found in factories, where floors are legally required to be flat, and will be used for grasping and moving objects from station to station on a very strict and short navigation horizon. Quadrupeds are four legged mobile robots and are more often found in more open-world environments, typically found inspecting various areas of a construction site or similar, however, they are still in the prototyping phase as well. Finally, humanoids are able to be in the same environments as the others, but are poised to be functional in human-populated domains. These are currently in production with the aim of being an evolved and more capable mobile form factor with more degrees of freedom, range in tasks, and domains, but have yet to be integrated into any formal setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, all of these form factors still only function in static structured environments. At the moment, mobile manipulators are still in the early deployment phase in factories, and quadrupeds will soon begin deployment onto construction sites. Currently, only AGVs are widely deployed and integrated, and mobile manipulators, quadrupeds, and humanoids are still in early formats of more open-world domains, benefitted by the current progress in AI.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="hardware-what-goes-into-a-robot"><strong>Hardware: What Goes Into a Robot?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Robot component markets are dominated by a few key players, and the US is noticeably absent in many. The industrial capacity necessary for entry—high volume, high quality, and low cost—is largely concentrated elsewhere, particularly in China. It will be a challenge for the US to carve a position, especially when most of the materials come from China.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, actuators, motors, and drives are the pieces that will physically generate motion by converting an electrical input into either a hydraulic, pneumatic, or, more often, electrical output to generate this motion.</p>



<p>At the higher-level in a factory, a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) determines how a production line will be automated, sequencing each operation properly to ensure the entire automated process is functional. Within each robot, regardless of form factor, there is a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), or embedded systems with multiple MCUs, that is the dedicated processor handling low-level real-time tasks like reading sensor inputs, generating motor control signals, and running fast control loops. These systems are effectively the “brain” for most robotic systems.</p>

<p>In the world of robotics, high-precision motors are required to ensure the proper torque is applied to avoid damaging its surroundings. Servo motors are the most common option – they are self-contained systems that include a motor, a control circuit, and a feedback mechanism. This overhead enables the motor to actively adjust itself and maintain a desired position or motion. Servo motors are one of the few components in a robot where the market is not dominated by China and fairly well distributed across countries. </p>

<p>The control circuit is referred to as “drive”. This is a power electronics box designed to regulate the voltage sent to the motor, through an AC-DC-AC conversion (or AC-DC for a DC motor). Its main component is a power electronics switch such as a MOSFET or IGBT, which combined with a rectifier and capacitors can electronically modify the electrical signal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gearboxes are also a common component found in servo motors. They are able to increase the force/torque of a motor, and increase accuracy. In essence, gearboxes reduce the speed of a motor, leading to a proportional increase in torque, which also enables the motor to make finer movements. Most gearboxes found in robotic systems have been largely produced by Japan’s Nabtesco.</p>

<p>Cameras and sensors are pivotal for the robot as well, as this has been the primary medium by which it knows both its own positioning and the steps required to complete the task it faces. Most industrial robots use standard machine vision 2D cameras, 3D depth cameras, or a combination of both to create a full spatial understanding of its environment. Though they are trending toward mounted, lighter-duty, cheaper cameras with stronger software to fill the gaps. Some form factors, typically those in a more human-populated environment, may use LiDAR to gain a much more detailed view of its surroundings, albeit usually at a higher cost. Most LiDAR, automotive specifically, comes from Hesai (China), and China has advanced enough in LiDAR innovation that Unitree has already developed a proprietary <a href="https://www.unitree.com/L2">LiDAR</a> system at a slightly higher price point than the Intel RealSense depth camera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Industrial and precise robots are equipped with joint encoders, which allow the robot to understand the angle, position, or rotation speed of its joints. A broad set of sensors can be included such as touch and tactile sensors to understand pressure, texture, and more, proprioceptive sensors to understand physical internal states like balance, force-torque sensors to understand how much force-torque is being applied by a joint, etc. This market is a bit small/disjointed because the products are newer developments; however, most Western companies that are able to design and assemble these sensors will still typically buy the base materials from China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there are the “end-effectors”, which are whatever the robot may have at the end of its arm, typically a tool or a very basic gripper for most robots. Each end-effector has its own use-case and payload capacity, or the amount of weight it is able to “hold”, so whatever the purpose of the robot will dictate the end-effector it has installed. This is one part of the robot that China is not very involved in at all, most end-effector producers are German (Schunk, Zimmer Group, Festo, Schmalz) and some are even American (ATI Industrial Automation, Destaco). However, it’s likely that Chinese companies are simply producing their own end-effectors and not exporting them yet, as vertical integration is their main strategy. While “hands” are catching much of the spotlight right now, these are not widely implemented and are far from achieving sufficient dexterity.

<h2 id="supply-chain-woes"><strong>Supply Chain Woes</strong></h2>



<p>In the US, the “Made in America” label is misleading at best, and downright harmful at worst. The substantial transformation principle allows for significant processing of foreign materials, notably from China, in intermediary countries, before final assembly in the US. This means a product can be labeled “Made in USA” even if its core components originated in China, obfuscating the true extent of foreign dependence. Consequently, many US companies will purchase cheap materials from China, transform them into robotics hardware packaged with Country of Origin (COO) America, and undercut the US firms that are actually extracting from the ground and manufacturing in the US. This is hard to talk about, but it’s even harder to solve.</p>



<p>It is far more difficult and time consuming than many people think to bring manufacturing capacity online and mass produce industrial robots to introduce automation, and worse, it’s <em>very </em>time consuming. Supply chains for many industrial robots are very complex, coming from many corners of the world where component production is typically already dominated through competitive cost advantages. There have been many cases of supply chain disruptions that have rattled Western economies. For example, in 2020-2022 during COVID the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach experienced a line of over 100 ships waiting outside the port for their turn to disembark. In stark contrast to this debacle, during the same time period (2020-2021), China pivoted and increased their robotics installation by <a href="https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/china-robot-installations-grew-by-44-percent">44%</a> from 2020-2021 in order to implement automation to make up for the lack of a workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t the US follow suit? COVID was the largest wake up call in years regarding the supply chain dependencies, yet the country refused to open its eyes. As explained below, the US has no significant market share in <strong>any </strong>of the relevant manufacturing nodes for robotics, and in most it’s essentially absent.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="mechanical-components-gearbox-motors-actuators"><strong>Mechanical Components: Gearbox, Motors, Actuators</strong></h2>



<p>On the hardware side, we will focus on what actually goes into generating locomotion in a robot: actuators/motors and their respective components. <strong>There are many types of motors available for generating motion, steppers with precise angular control in open-loop systems typically found in 3D printers or CNC machines, brushless DC motors with high power-to-weight ratios to propel drones and EVs, but the most important in robotics tends to be the servo motor. </strong>Most robotics companies, especially those of the Big 4, produce their own servo motors in-house and sell them individually as well. These are not terribly difficult to build, but manufacturing them at scale does create a bit of a moat for the aforementioned reasons: actuators must have incredible reliability and performance, so scaling up requires advanced manufacturing techniques to be nearly perfectly replicated. As such, the long-standing manufacturers of robotics components with the necessary expertise hold the largest market share are Yaskawa (Japan), Panasonic (Japan), Bosch (Germany), KUKA (now China), and Siemens (Germany). Rockwell (USA) must be named here as well because it holds some 7% of the servo motor market share, but this is also the only segment of the supply chain that is not dominated by any one player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 60% of the world’s gearboxes for medium-to-large industrial robots are supplied by Japan’s Nabtesco. Their difficulty to manufacture arises from the fact that almost every order is likely to be highly customized and tailored to the customer’s hardware specifications, yet must still meet the 99.99% accuracy threshold to replace a human.<strong> </strong>Gearboxes are absolutely pivotal for ensuring this precision, and therefore make up the largest % of COGS on an industrial robot at <a href="https://www.controleng.com/industrial-robot-value-comes-from-servo-motors-servo-drives-and-gearboxes/">14%</a>. The manufacturing of these gearboxes must be accurate to an unreal degree, and as such, typically only long-standing and established players with years of experience building them have refined their process and process technology enough to achieve this quality, hence the Nabtesco dominance. They manufactured their first cycloidal gear in 1980.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are even special types of gearboxes like Harmonic Drive (Japan), founded in 1970, which uses a patented strain-wave design for incredible precision. These are more expensive but a must-have in superprecise settings (like semiconductor fabrication) and as such have a strong presence at <a href="https://roboticpaint.com/how-japanese-speed-reducer-monopolize-the-industry/">15%</a> of the gearbox market. However, to demonstrate what a proper industrial base and rapid iteration is capable of, Leaderdrive was founded in China in 2003 with the aim of manufacturing their own superprecise strain-wave gearbox. In just 14 years, the company had produced over 100,000 units and captured <a href="https://www.leaderdrive.com/about-us.asp">90%</a> of the Chinese domestic market for strain-wave gearboxes.</p>

<h2 id="magnets-and-materials-manufacturing-dependence"><strong>Magnets and Materials – Manufacturing Dependence</strong></h2>



<p>Motors and gearboxes are not in short supply and are fairly cheap; however, motors nowadays have undergone a breakthrough. Most high-quality high-speed motors are now developed with permanent magnets (PM motors) to achieve higher power efficiency and power-to-weight ratio — perfect for robots. Without getting into too much detail, permanent magnets effectively add more magnetism into the electromagnetic field of a motor, meaning less electricity is required to magnetize and can instead go toward generating motion. There remains one issue though, the process and elements that go into creating your typical Neodymium permanent magnet (NdFeB) is nearly entirely dominated by China with 90% of the market share. Of that 90%, roughly three producers in China hold a near-monopoly on it: Jingci, JL MAG, and Ningbo Yungsheng.</p>

<p>While “rare earth” is a misnomer — they are just as abundant as most other elements– the process needed to refine Neodymium and produce a final permanent magnet requires around ~12 complex steps and a strong industrial capacity. China dominates this process as well at 93%. After the trade restrictions on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/">Chinese strategic minerals</a>, there are attempts to try to minimize this dependency on Chinese permanent magnets. For instance, MP Materials in the US to become the only fully vertically integrated rare earths company in all of North America. Australia’s Lynas, the world’s largest non-Chinese producer, is expanding and building another separation plant in the US with US DoD support of <a href="https://lynasrareearths.com/lynas-awarded-us120m-contract-to-build-commercial-heavy-rare-earths-facility/">USD$120M</a>. BMW and Yamaha have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bmw-yamaha-motor-back-us-rare-earths-startup-phoenix-tailings-2024-12-31/">backed</a> a new US-based rare earths startup, Phoenix Tailings, to try to create another supplier.&nbsp;With MP Materials we have seen the process go from construction to early production in just a few years, but establishing a high-volume capacity would likely require a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-10-617r.pdf">5-10 year timeframe</a>.</p>

<p>However, it’s likely that these companies will not catch up in scale without <em>significant </em>government subsidy to match the lower cost of capital in China. We’ve heard rumblings that China has some 250-275K tons of installed capacity for refining NdFeB magnets, and this will likely double in the next five years. For comparison, the USD$120M investment from the DoD in Lynas will likely produce somewhere around ~4,200 tons of NdFeB. At the moment, China’s economies of scale has given the country a nearly unshakable monopoly on the rare earths market.</p>



<p>Mining and materials beyond rare earth elements are just as — if not more essential, and while this is not typically bottlenecked, they are largely under the control of China. Additionally, having raw ore deposits or being capable of mining doesn’t imply too much for many of these elements. Many economies struggle to process these elements whereas China excels in this endeavor due to its advanced industrial economy. Stemming from two main initiatives in China, the Belt and Road initiative and Made in China 2025 initiative, the country has invested and built a well-paved path to absolute dominance over nearly the entire minerals processing industry.</p>

<h2 id="lithium-and-batteries"><strong>Lithium and Batteries</strong></h2>



<p>All of the ore may come from other countries rich in deposits, but this means nothing without the capacity to refine them at scale and with high enough grade. In fact, China is only rich in deposits in <em>two </em>of these minerals, lithium and graphite, but countries rely on Chinese processing to refine them into usable materials. The Belt and Road initiative came up with clever ways to circumvent the lack of mineral deposits.</p>



<ul>
<li>Copper typically comes from Chile and Peru, and around 76% of Peru’s and 68% of Chile’s copper exports went to China, totaling up to 56% of all global raw <a href="https://features.csis.org/copper-in-latin-america/">copper</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nickel is highlighted as the one key mineral that is not refined mostly in China, as 37% is refined in Indonesia, and “only” 28% in China. However, according to the most recent <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ee01701d-1d5c-4ba8-9df6-abeeac9de99a/GlobalCriticalMineralsOutlook2024.pdf">IEA</a> report, over 80% of Indonesia’s battery-grade nickel output is owned by Chinese producers linked to the <a href="https://c4ads.org/commentary/refining-power/">CCP</a>.</li>



<li>Cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and accounts for <a href="https://issafrica.org/iss-today/rampant-cobalt-smuggling-and-corruption-deny-billions-to-drc">80%</a> of the world’s cobalt production, but China has struck up the Sicomines Pact with them and now owns <a href="https://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/from-cobalt-to-cars-how-china-exploits-child-and-forced-labor-in-the-congo">80%</a> of the DRC’s cobalt output.</li>
</ul>



<p>China understands that without access to processed minerals, there is no first step to manufacturing a product. The Western nations have not woken up to the fact that reshoring manufacturing starts at these minerals.</p>

<p>Batteries, lithium-ion specifically, are critical for mobile robots, like drones, service robots, autonomous guided vehicles in warehouses, mobile manipulators, humanoids, and especially EVs. If you wanted to realize the future of detaching robots from a connected power source, you’d most likely equip it with Chinese battery cells, as Chinese companies supply around <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-breaking-china-ev-supply-chain-dominance/?embedded-checkout=true">80%</a> of battery cells globally. Chinese battery packs maintain an advantage by having a cost of around $127/kWh, while North America and Europe see prices 24% and 33% higher <a href="https://www.bnef.com/insights/30265/view">respectively</a>. The largest producer, CATL, accounted for <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/1600609/who-dominates-ev-battery-market-why-important/">37%</a> of the global EV battery market in 2023, while BYD accounted for ~16%.</p>



<p>The largest producer outside of China, LGES (South Korea), only accounted for roughly 13% of the global market share. It’s not easy to overcome the barriers to entry in this market, Sweden’s state-backed attempt to break the dependency, Northvolt, just filed for <a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/northvolt-investment-fund">bankruptcy</a>. While the US was committing at least ~USD$73B to battery supply chain investments with the Inflation Reduction Act, China was giving out over USD$230B in subsidies to EV companies since 2009. The current layout of the battery market is a bit scary, given that Chinese companies can and will be iterating faster than Western companies due to the massive industrial base in China and continued government investment which will only further drive their costs down to edge out competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a battery from an engineering standpoint is a hurdle that Chinese companies have been able to climb over their repeated iterations. The balancing between complex chemistries within cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes must all meet stringent purity requirements as any impurity can lead to noticeable variations in battery lifetime. Constructing sufficient capacity to produce at scale is already challenging, especially in US, and can cost over USD$100M in the US to construct, which is <a href="https://evboosters.com/ev-charging-news/300-billion-in-new-lithium-ion-battery-gigafactories/">46%</a> more expensive per GWh than its Chinese counterparts. LG has even paused the construction on their USD$5.5B battery plant in Arizona citing “<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/lg-pauses-arizona-battery-plant-energy-storage-queen-creek/720416/">market conditions</a>.”</p>



<p>In the case of robots, batteries are all different sizes, there is no standardization, and the batteries have different demands. Power-to-weight ratio is a much stricter requirement as a robot doesn’t have the leniency to carry the same weight a car would, and often different robots have different power requirements. The battery that a quadruped would use is not the same battery that a humanoid would use, and this extends to nearly all form factors. The difficulty and cost in manufacturing a pure and efficient battery is already challenging enough, especially in the US, but the lack of uniformity in robot batteries will be one of the largest issues as the time arrives to scale production<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Industrial automation through robotics has been long in the making over the past decades, and throughout this time, some countries have prevailed as paragons of what the automated future can look like, and some have lost their position. Let’s take a look at the current world powers, where they stand in the robotics race to automation, and the driving forces moving their markets. So how did the world leaders in robotics end up on top?</p>

<p>The Robotics landscape has historically been dominated by four countries: South Korea, Japan, Germany, and the US. China today is a major force, but we will deep dive into the country later in the report. A closer look at the four incumbents reveals common factors driving their success to varying extents:</p>

<h2 id="south-korea-and-japan-cant-automate-birth-rates">South Korea and Japan: Can’t Automate Birth Rates</h2>



<p>South Korea has taken automation to an extreme level, with 10% of the workforce being automated! With high-tech manufacturing companies making up a whopping <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1490388/south-korea-total-assets-of-major-chaebols-as-percentage-of-gdp/">61%</a> of the Korean economy in 2022, it has a clear advantage. But cultural factors are also at play – for example, eCommerce adoption is among the world’s highest, with <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-share-breakdown">north of 30%</a> of retail sales done online, double that of the US!</p>



<p>And the South Korean government and Chaebols are all-in: In 2021, Samsung declared their company-wide initiative to invest up to <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2025/02/129_389731.html">USD$163B</a> into industrial automation and AI. Hyundai already acquired Boston Dynamics in 2021. LG set robotics as a key growth area after deploying self-driving airport guide robots at the Seoul airport in 2017, and recently just converted their stake in <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/01/lg-acquires-majority-stake-in-bear-robotics-to-bolster-robotics-capabilities/">Bear Robotics</a> into a majority stake. On top of all of this, the government is upping their investments as well. In total, the country has put forth four rounds of the Basic Plan for Intelligent Robots since <a href="https://ifr.org/downloads/papers/Executive_Summary_-_World_Robotics_RD_Programs_V03.pdf">2008</a>–<a href="https://ifr.org/downloads/papers/Executive_Summary_-_World_Robotics_RD_Programs_V02.pdf">2030</a>, totaling USD$1.6B, and a new plan to invest ~USD$2.26B in the industry up to <a href="https://www.koreatechtoday.com/south-koreas-2-26-billion-vision-a-robotic-revolution-by-2030/">2030</a>. While the country needs automation more than ever, it doesn’t have the benefit of being a major manufacturer, having relied on other countries for <a href="https://www.korea-certification.com/en/south-korea-still-depends-heavily-on-imported-robot-components/">~60%</a><strong> </strong>of components in an industrial robot. South Korea is running on borrowed time.</p>



<p>South Korea has found automation to be a necessity for the same reason as Japan: an aging labor demographic and low birth rates. Despite government initiatives across the board, the country continues to hit record-low birth <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2025/02/japans-birth-crisis-is-a-leadership-failure/">rates</a>. Case in point, the dearth of workers in rural areas is forcing factories to <a href="https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2024/01/12/53W4QPBZORCCVF5HRX3DCHYOYI/">move</a> near Seoul just to man their operations. They’ve even recently had to <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/construction/newsView/ked202402140025">remove</a> their decades-old foreign worker ban at certain manufacturing plants (in place due to security reasons) to make up for the labor shortage. Korea suffers from the lowest birthrate in the world, with Japan trailing closely behind. However, Japan stands a slightly better chance in the race to automation as they have two of the Big 4 titans, while Korea still imports some <a href="https://www.korea-certification.com/en/south-korea-still-depends-heavily-on-imported-robot-components/">~60%</a><strong> </strong>of the components in an industrial robot.</p>



<h2 id="germany-and-the-eu-watching-from-the-chair-in-the-corner">Germany and The EU: Watching from the Chair in the Corner</h2>



<p>Germany, the industrial powerhouse of Europe, holds the position of 4th highest robot density in the world, and has always been geared toward a strong industrial economy. The country introduced Industrie 4.0 to the broader European Union in 2011, aimed at bringing the region to the forefront of integrating new technologies and automation processes into industry to enhance competitiveness. Their heavy emphasis on industrial manufacturing has led them down the path toward great automation, and they would be well positioned for the coming of the robotics unlocks had the EU managed to stop China from eating away at their automation companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>European countries have been complicit and passive in the selling of the EU’s industrial automation capacity and technologies to China. A travesty that will echo through the robotics revolution, Germany’s stringent and bureaucratic restrictions held them back from interfering on the KUKA take over in 2016, sidelined as it was sold off to China’s Midea Group. They could only <a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/137553/x/5c5eaafa8f/evolving-fdi-screening-in-germany.pdf">reform</a> the policy after it unfolded and their goliath was gone. Italy sold off many robotics companies (EVOLUT, OLCI Engineering, CMA Robotics), and in 2022 the country finally made the decision to <a href="https://decode39.com/3551/draghi-efort-robox-veto/">veto</a> one of the takeovers. Now, in <a href="https://www.automation.com/en-us/articles/february-2025/robotics-action-plan-europe-vdma">February 2025</a>, an automation organization industry finally issued a Call-To-Action to the EU to address its lack of competitiveness through robotics. Industrie 4.0 is a transformational plan, but it took the EU nine years to realize that it required the robots China was eating.</p>



<h2 id="the-us-the-american-dreams-rude-awakening"><strong>The US: The American Dream’s Rude Awakening</strong></h2>



<p>Lastly, in the US, we see a strange phenomenon of having a highly advanced tech sector, but both a lack of national strategy and the drawbacks of outsourcing manufacturing. Manufacturing capacity in the US is still a relevant topic, the issue is that it cannot compete in sectors that China competes in due to the expensive nature of manufacturing in America, and the “quality” moat that the US once had is slowly draining, as China now has the means to produce most goods at similar quality for cheaper. Automating certain sectors could alleviate this pain, but this would be a ways away. The country has a large automotive industry like its peers, but it only ranks 10th in robot density in 2023. One study showed that according to wage-adjusted robot adoption, the US is actually 49% lower than <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2021/01/25/robots-and-international-economic-development/">expected</a>. Given the AI revolution in the country, it’s surprising to see one of the main potential beneficiaries, robotics, diverging from the path of its other tech sectors. Should robotics become a target sector for growth, the country may be able to benefit from the cheaper production and compete, but this is down the line.</p>



<p>There’s a number of reasons why the dissonance could be occurring in the US, a large one mainly being the lack of multi-year national initiatives that other countries see benefit from. For example, the CHIPS act and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/191/titles">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, two major government initiatives aimed at bolstering domestic industry, were initiated under one administration and under another the IRA is already on the table for <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/191/titles">repeal</a>, with the <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/future-chips-act-under-trump-admin">CHIPS</a> act being in the conversation as well. Moreover, the economy was structured to follow different economic incentives than China.&nbsp; The US found it more worthwhile to pursue digital innovation, cutting-edge technology, and services, and in the process it outsourced most production capabilities to countries with a better cost advantage as most American companies cannot compete. However, the US is now left at the mercy of Chinese manufacturing powers and will need a significant turnaround just to enter the race.</p>



<p>To add insult to injury, a closer look at the Western world’s automation growth reveals a peak in ~2016-18. Japan’s 2023 additions are still ~13% below the 2018 peak, and South Korea has not grown since 2016. The only country among the top 4 that has reached a new peak in 2023 is Germany… but their goliath KUKA has been acquired by China and is shifting manufacturing to Asia.</p>

<p>KUKA is part of the small set of companies referred to as the “Big 4” in robotics, having dominated the industry for decades: FANUC (Japan), ABB (Switzerland/Sweden), Yaskawa (Japan), and KUKA (prev Germany, now China).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A closer look at those four titans reveals a lot of similarity: decades of experience in the space, high-volume manufacturing capacity among a broad product portfolio (cobots, robots, multiple industries, etc), but relatively low R&amp;D ratio and overall limited willingness to participate in the capital-heavy and risk-oriented goal to build these next-gen robots that hold the same promises that have failed in the past. In addition, their business is increasingly tilted towards mainland China – leaving a large geopolitical risk.</p>



<p>The situation is particularly worrisome, with Chinese players now on track to catch up and fill the gaps with unprecedented speed.</p>



<h2 id="china%e2%80%99s-robotics-champions"><strong>China’s Robotics Champions</strong></h2>



<p><strong></strong>While the revenues of the major companies are much larger than those of China, the landscape has been shifting toward western sleeping giants growing complacent and Chinese innovation. Chinese robotics are picking up very quickly through companies like Estun, Efort, and Siasun, and their recent takeovers of the aforementioned European robotics companies.</p>



<p>These companies are setting up to be powerhouses. Most are focused on strong vertical integration, like Estun with up to <a href="https://en.estun.com/?list_180/">95%</a> of core components manufactured in-house, enabling them to rapidly iterate product development. They recognize the power of a strong production capacity, for example EFORT is planning to build out a “<a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/eforts-stock-surges-on-plan-to-invest-usd263-million-to-build-robot-super-plant-global-hq">Super Plant</a>” to upgrade production capacity by 100,000 robots/year. Siasun is already well-equipped for an impressive production output with around 2.3M square footage of factories globally. Furthermore, their R&amp;D numbers may speak for themselves, but Siasun has gone even further in their innovation strategy. The company went so far as to <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/tech/2017-08/24/content_31035917.htm">buy</a> a leading German mechanical engineering vocational school so that they could both train new employees abroad and gain access to the decades of German experience in training engineers, all while setting up its own robotics institute at a Chinese <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-robotics/industrial-partners/siasun">university</a>.</p>



<p>The traditional industrial robotics market and the respective hardware is still dominated by the original four giants of ABB, KUKA, Fanuc, and Yaskawa, however, they are not matching the pace of their Chinese contemporaries. Lack of innovation and investment in R&amp;D is leaving a door wide open for Chinese companies to enter through, and they’re only ramping up further. This expansion is not only happening at the company level but rather it’s the country’s imperative to cross the finish line first.</p>



<h2 id="china%e2%80%99s-hellbent-path-to-robotics-dominance"><strong>China’s Hellbent Path to Robotics Dominance</strong></h2>



<p>In China, the most impressive shifts are taking place, going from outside the top 10 in robots per 10,000 employees in 2018, to overtaking 3rd place in the world from Germany with 470 robots/10,000 employees in 2024. China’s annual root installations dwarf that of the four western incumbents <strong>combined</strong>.</p>

<p>A change of this scale can only be described as a robotics revolution. Many factors can point to how this happened, but most stem from their massive industrial sector and policies that continue to fuel it, like the Made in China 2025 plan, and aggressive government subsidies. Exact numbers are hard to pinpoint, and the EV industry is a key recipient, but it is clear that the broad industrial landscape is benefiting from at least tens of billions of dollars every year.</p>

<p>The Chinese manufacturing base is currently dominated by automotive and electronics production, as <a href="https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/rise-robots-china">China</a> has been producing more cars than the US and Japan combined since 2009, and assembles some 70% of the world’s electronics. Even with a massive sector ripe for automation, 51% of global robot installations in 2023 were coming from China, adding 276,000 units that year alone! China’s industrial economy is one of the most formidable players in the world, setting it up perfectly to reap the next evolutions of robotics and automation.</p>



<p>The Made in 2025 plan was the largest catalyst toward becoming the industrial and high-tech manufacturing giant it is today. Signed by Li Keqiang in 2015, the plan initiated the move from 40% of domestic content of core components in 2020 to 70% by 2025. Additionally, the plan highlights the following six of the ten priority sectors going forward: automated machine tools &amp; robotics, new-energy vehicles and equipment, power equipment, modern rail transport equipment, new advanced information technology, and new materials. With a focus on the entire manufacturing chain and the development of both advanced and traditional industries, the country laid out the road map to become an economic juggernaut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2023 they doubled down on robotics, with China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology posted their <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3240259/china-says-humanoid-robots-are-new-engine-growth-pushes-mass-production-2025-and-world-leadership">four-year plan</a> positioning humanoids as a strategic engine of economic growth. Within this outline, they highlighted having a robust innovation system for humanoids and to achieve “production at scale” by 2025, with the engine of growth coming online by 2027. This state-backed interest is significant for the sector as the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission posted an <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/Humanoid_Robots.pdf">Issue Alert</a> in October 2024 stating that Chinese humanoid companies raised USD$769M in 2023 alone, and over USD$990M in the first half of 2024. China believes in robotics and its related form factors as the future of the country, just recently, Unitree CEO Wang Xingxing was even seen at the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3299435/meet-wang-xingxing-young-chinese-robotics-star-unitree-xi-jinpings-symposium">private sector symposium</a> seated across from Xi Jinping.</p>



<p>Even humanoids are now booming in China, still considered the most difficult form factor to unlock, with many older estimates misinterpreting the coming revolution, i.e. Goldman Sachs having to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-global-market-for-robots-could-reach-38-billion-by-2035">revise</a> their 2035 TAM by 6x! At the 2024 World Robot Conference in Beijing, over <a href="https://archive.is/5StXj">27 different humanoids</a> were debuted and active, while the Tesla Optimus remained motionless in a clear box. A stark contrast to the Unitree H1 which was performing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrjxmJWo3IY">synchronized choreography</a> with both H1’s and humans nearby in Feb 2025. While it is impressive to see how well Chinese humanoids are performing, it’s more impressive that they can produce these at a much faster and larger scale than any other country. <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103128/chinas-humanoid-robots-slated-for-mass-production-by-end-of-2025/index.html">UBTech</a> is already set to mass produce nearly 1000 units by late 2025. Agibot was created in 2023, and has started mass production already, with <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/former-huawei-genius-youth-recruit-093000908.html">962 units</a> fully produced as of December 15. Most importantly, Unitree G1 is already in the United States and <a href="https://toborlife.ai/g1/">commercially available</a>, and the humanoid boasts a shocking price tag of only USD$16K. There are no other humanoids in the world available for purchase by consumers, and the price tags for most humanoids are angling to be in the ~USD$100K range, and up to ~USD$200K for a significant portion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="what-stands-to-come">What Stands to Come</h2>



<p>This is a Call for Action. In America there are many companies attempting to build their own hardware, but in-house hardware development means the company designing and assembling it in-house, and everyone closes their eyes when the materials and base components roll in from China. The US once had a solid base to spin up heavy industry factories, but this withered away as cheaper overseas manufacturing cut US producers out and the American economy shifted toward leading edge technology and services. However, with each dilapidated factory and every “Made in China” sticker the dots connected a pointillist image of a nation depleted. Now the country stands at the bifurcated path between limitless labor expansion or obsolescence, and the echoes of industry’s past are shouting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China knew 10 years ago that these robots would be a force and doubled down again in 2023. This is not a question of ifs: China knows what comes next if they are first to unlock these robots, they will iterate faster than the US, they will subsidize the industry to an unprecedented extent, they will achieve massive economies of scale and oversupply all global markets, and the general purpose robotics boom will be nothing but a bad dream for the US if nothing changes. The US must take part in the robotics revolution before all labor is handed over to China to own in perpetuity.</p>



<p>Unitree exemplifies the threat posed by China’s rise to Western industrial semiconductor suppliers. Behind paywall, we dive into the different types of electronic components found in robots, explain how western incumbents like NXP, Infineon or TXN are positioned, and highlight the Chinese threat. We also discuss leading edge logic for next-gen robots and Nvidia’s position.&nbsp;</p>

This means they are translatable across languages and platforms, which is really nice for our purpose because they focus on how something is written rather than the complexity of underlying algorithms being described.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/halstead-and-book.png" alt="Maurice Halstead and his seminal work"></figure><p>The root of his metrics was four measurements based around counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_%28computer_programming%29" target="_blank">operators</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand" target="_blank">operands</a>:</p><ul><li>Number of <em>distinct</em> <em>operators</em> (<code>n1</code>)</li><li>Number of <em>distinct</em> <strong>operands</strong> (<code>n2</code>)</li><li>Number of <strong>total</strong> <em>operators</em> (<code>N1</code>)</li><li>Number of <strong>total</strong> <strong>operands</strong> (<code>N2</code>)</li></ul><p>Halstead’s focus was building a system of related metrics such as program “length”, “volume”, and “difficulty” with a series of equations describing the relationships between them… ambitiously culminating in a numerical value that would estimate the number of bugs contained in the implementation!</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/halstead-equations.png" alt="Halstead Complexity Metrics Equations"></figure><p>These metrics definitely are debatable (they were made in the 70’s…), but they give us numbers that are a starting point for at least comparison, and the reasoning seems to make sense</p><p>Intuitively, the more operators in play, the more one has to reason about potential interactions.
Similarly, a larger number of operands means understanding possibilities of dataflow become more complex.</p><h3>Halstead Complexity Javascript Example<span><a href="#halstead-complexity-javascript-example" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>If we go back to our early example we can make two variations that attempt to be on separate ends of the spectrum in terms of operands and operators, and we can see how that affects two of the Halstead metrics, <em>Volume</em> and <em>Difficulty</em>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>getOddnessA</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

That’s kinda nice!</p><p>The big downside here is that it’s not well-defined what exactly counts as an <strong>operator</strong> or <strong>operand</strong> for all languages, so it’s best to just use a specific tool or implementation for measurement and stick with it.

Try reading someone else’s Perl or Ruby if this doesn’t resonate with you.</li><li>Chaining together <code>map</code>/<code>reduce</code>/<code>filter</code> and other functional programming constructs (lambdas, iterators, comprehensions) may be concise, but long/multiple chains hurt readability<ul><li>This seems more common in Javascript and Rust, or when a Python programmer gets fascinated with itertools</li></ul></li></ul><p>As mentioned, the Halstead metrics have been debated fiercely in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4523.pdf" target="_blank">academic</a> and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1990.pdf" target="_blank">other</a> circles, but we don’t need to wait for <em>science</em>.</p><p>Pfft, we can take the ideas and run!</p><h2>“Cognitive Complexity”<span><a href="#cognitive-complexity" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>A more recent metric developed in an effort to more accurately capture the difficulty of reading is a measure called “<a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf" target="_blank">Cognitive Complexity</a>” developed by SonarSource, a company that makes static analysis products.</p><p>Some people find the name of the metric misleading, feeling that it makes the measure sound more scientific or objective, rather than naming it something that sounds like a heuristic developed from experience.</p><p>Being a practitioner who really only cares about effectiveness, I’ll take good metrics with bad names over bad metrics, and I have respect for heuristics as long as they work!</p><p>The authors break down Cognitive Complexity into three ideas:</p><ol><li>Shorthand constructs that combine statements decreases difficulty</li><li>Each break from linear flow increases difficulty</li><li>Nested control flow increases difficulty</li></ol><p>Seems straightforward and reasonable, but the whitepaper goes into <em>much</em> more depth than just three points, so let’s get into the meat of this to see what a group of static analysis developers believe hurt readability.</p><h3>Shorthand Constructs<span><a href="#shorthand-constructs" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>For the first principle, their whitepaper uses the following two snippets, arguing that the first increases difficulty for the reader while the second doesn’t:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span><span><span>// 1
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>MyObj</span> <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>myObj</span><span>;</span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>MyObj</span> <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>?</span><span>.</span><span>myObj</span><span>;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The second is shorter and takes less time to read, but I’d argue that in the second construct there’s a better chance that the programmer forgets to properly handle all of the possibilities… case in point, these code snippets aren’t actually equivalent!</p><p>In the first case <code>myObj</code> will either be <code>a.myObj</code> or <code>null</code> and in the second it will be <code>a.myObj</code> or <code>undefined</code>!</p><p>This may seem like splitting hairs, but if I’ve got my bug-hunting hat on, I look for the small unexpected behaviors like this to see if I can leverage them into something useful!</p><p>Even using languages with solid type-checking like TypeScript or Rust, they only reduce the chance you <em>omit</em> handling such a case, but it doesn’t mean that you handle it <em>correctly</em> in all cases.</p><p>Without the assistance of type checking, like in vanilla JavaScript, the chances of that corner case not being handled are much higher.
So while I won’t argue that shorthand constructs are simpler to write and easier to read, there’s still some tradeoff in terms of conciseness and density.</p><h3>Linear Flow Breaks<span><a href="#linear-flow-breaks" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>One thing that seems obvious is that “linear” code with no conditionals is easier to scan than code with conditionals, and is a big focus for Cognitive Complexity.</p><p>Naturally they assess additional difficulty for any conditionals, loops, or <code>goto</code>s, but they also get a bit fancier and include conditional macros, try/except blocks, sequences of logical operators, and recursion.</p><p>I totally agree that each of these things generally affect readability, but I think there are four fine points worth talking about.</p><p>Point 1. They count <code>switch</code> statements as a single group, but they penalize each additional <code>else-if</code> in a chain because each <code>else-if</code> <strong>can</strong> make more than one comparison, even the one in question doesn’t.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I think switches look better than if-else chains, but they aren’t innocent either; switch case fall-throughs definitely increase reading difficulty and missing <code>break</code>s have caused needless headaches for many programmers, myself included!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>// Switches are preferred by this metric

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Overview<span><a href="#overview" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Espressif has already provided a <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Response_ESP32_Bluetooth" target="_blank">formal response</a> to the recently published claims about ESP32 Bluetooth controller serving as a potential “backdoor” or having “undocumented features” that can cause security concerns.</p><p>This post highlights the technical details about the relevant commands (HCI Commands) that were undocumented and establishes that the mentioned undocumented HCI commands do not pose a security threat and are certainly not a “backdoor”.</p><h3>What are HCI Commands?<span><a href="#what-are-hci-commands" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The Bluetooth protocol stack consists of two primary layers:</p><ul><li><strong>Bluetooth Controller (Lower Layer)</strong> – Handles radio operations, link management, and low-level Bluetooth communication. Each ESP32 series chip implements a controller through a combination of hardware and software.</li><li><strong>Bluetooth Host Stack (Upper Layer)</strong> – Manages higher-level Bluetooth functionality, such as pairing, encryption, and application-layer interactions. This is fully implemented in software. The ESP32 series of chips support open-source NimBLE and Bluedroid as Bluetooth host stacks.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/bluetooth_architecture.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/bluetooth_architecture.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These layers communicate via a standard interface call the Host Controller Interface (HCI). HCI defines a set of standard commands for the Bluetooth Host stack to use. The Bluetooth controller implements standard HCI commands along with a set of Vendor-specific HCI commands that are primarily used for custom hardware initialization on control as well as for debugging purposes.</p><h3>What is the Reported Security Issue?<span><a href="#what-is-the-reported-security-issue" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The reported security issue highlights that the ESP32 contains a set of undocumented HCI commands. The issue claims that these could be used to gain malicious access to devices running Bluetooth on the ESP32.</p><h3>What are these Undocumented Commands?<span><a href="#what-are-these-undocumented-commands" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The “undocumented” HCI commands mentioned in the report are debug commands present in the Bluetooth controller IP in the ESP32. These commands are mostly for assisting the debug (e.g., read/write RAM, memory mapped flash read, send/receive packets, etc.) and do not play any active role in the HCI communication from a standard Bluetooth host stack such as NimBLE or Bluedroid used on the ESP32.</p><p>Such debugging commands, a common paradigm for Bluetooth Controller implementations, assist developers to debug Controller behavior. This is particularly helpful in dual-chip solutions.</p><h2>ESP32 Bluetooth Architecture<span><a href="#esp32-bluetooth-architecture" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In ESP32, the Controller and the Host both run on the same MCU. The Host continues to communicate with the Controller over HCI. But since both are running on the same MCU, the HCI can be treated as a <strong>virtual</strong> HCI layer, an internal layer of communication.</p><p>Any code accessing this virtual HCI layer should itself be first executing on the ESP32, with full execution privileges.</p><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_vhci.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_vhci.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><h2>Impact<span><a href="#impact" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><ul><li>For the majority of the ESP32 applications, the Bluetooth Host and Controller are part of the same application binary running on ESP32. There is no security risk because the application already has full privileged access to the memory and registers as well as ability to send/receive Bluetooth packets irrespective of the availability of these HCI commands.</li><li>These undocumented HCI commands cannot be triggered by Bluetooth, radio signals, or over the Internet, unless there is a vulnerability in the application itself or the radio protocols. Presence of such vulnerabilities will be a bigger problem and the presence of these undocumented commands does not offer additional attack surface.</li><li>Only the original ESP32 chip has these commands. ESP32-C, ESP32-S and ESP32-H series chips are unaffected as they don’t have these commands supported in their Bluetooth controller.</li></ul><h2>ESP32 Hosted Mode Operation (Less Commonly Used)<span><a href="#esp32-hosted-mode-operation-less-commonly-used" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In a not-so-commonly-used alternate configuration, ESP32 can tunnel HCI commands over a serial (e.g., <strong>UART HCI</strong>) interface to an external host system. This is typically used in scenarios where ESP32 acts just as a communication coprocessor. This type of use of ESP32 is not as common as the standalone mode of operation.</p><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_serial_hci.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_serial_hci.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>In such a system, the ESP32 fully trusts the host. If an attacker maliciously gains control over the host system, they could potentially issue these debug commands to influence ESP32’s behavior. However, an attacker must first compromise the host device, making this a second-stage attack vector rather than a standalone vulnerability. Or, gain a physical access to the device to send the HCI commands over serial interface.</p><p>For these UART-HCI-based implementations, the attack is not self-exploitable. Still, a software fix can disable debug commands via an OTA update for added security. We will have more updates in our software stack regarding this soon.</p><h2>Mitigation<span><a href="#mitigation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>As summarized above, there is no real, known security threat that these undocumented commands pose. Regardless, Espressif has decided to take the following measures:</p><ul><li>Espressif will provide a fix that removes access to these HCI debug commands through a software patch for currently supported ESP-IDF versions</li><li>Espressif will document all Vendor-specific HCI commands to ensure transparancy of what functionality is available at the HCI layer</li></ul><h2>Summary<span><a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>To summarize, for most ESP32 applications, we do not foresee any impact from the reported issue provided the product has the recommended platform security features enabled. For a small number of Bluetooth HCI serial use-cases, we can mitigate the issue by disabling debug commands and we will provide an update on that front soon.</p><p>We follow a standardized <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/Espressif%20Security%20Incident%20Response%20Process%20v1.0_EN.pdf" target="_blank">Product Security Incident Response process</a> and we believe in responsible disclosure.</p><p>We believe that the security of devices based on Espressif chips is of paramount importance and are committed to transparency and best security practices. We will continue to work with the community to ensure that our devices are secure and that all security-related information is responsibly disclosed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>That prediction was incorrect and HNZ blew its budget, leading to a review of its finances that last week delivered a damning <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/HNZ-Financial-Review-Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF] that found the org lost “control of the critical levers that drive financial outcomes” and had an “inability to identify and respond to the disconnect between expenditure and revenue.”</p>

    

<p>The Deloitte-penned report also found an Excel spreadsheet was the “primary data file used by HNZ to manage its financial performance” and was used for “consolidation, journals, business-critical reporting, and analysis.”</p>

        


        

<p>The report also noted five big problems with the sheet used at HNZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial information was often 'hard-coded,' making it difficult to trace to the source or have updated data flow through.</li>

<li>Errors such as incorrectly releasing accruals or double-up releases were not picked up until following periods.</li>

<li>Changes to prior periods and FTE errors in district financial reporting Excel submissions, would not flow through to consolidated file.</li>

<li>The spreadsheet can be easy to manipulate information as there is limited tracking to source information where information is not flowing directly from accounting systems.</li>

<li>It is highly prone to human error, such as accidental typing of a number or omission of a zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relying on the spreadsheet also meant Health NZ moved slowly: The report found “monthly financial reporting usually took 12-15 days to consolidate and five days to analyse.”</p>
<p>The report suggests that’s a long way short of where Health NZ needs to be.</p>
<p>“The use of an Excel spreadsheet file to track and report financial performance for a NZ$28bn expenditure organisation raises significant concerns, particularly when other more appropriate systems are present on the IT landscape,” the report states.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/01/internetnz_constitution/">Membership of New Zealand’s domain registry suddenly triples, which isn't entirely welcome</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/16/kim_dotcom_us_extradition/">New Zealand minister OKs Kim Dotcom extradition to US</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/09/on_call/">Techie told 'Bill Gates' Excel is rubbish – and the Microsoft boss had it fixed in 48 hours</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/16/excel_hell_comment/">Excel Hell II: If the sickness can't be fixed, it must be contained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It gets worse: Health Minister Simeon Brown last week delivered a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/speech-businessnz-health-forum">speech</a> in which he said HNZ operates “an estimated 6,000 applications and 100 digital networks” – or roughly one application for every 16 staff members.</p>
<p>He also said HNZ’s Senior Leadership Team members “have only just begun weekly in-person meetings, and have continued to operate from different offices, despite the majority living in Auckland and the organization being two and a half years old.” Most work in different buildings.</p>

        

<p>However the Minister doesn’t have a plan to get off Excel, or fix HNZ’s tech leadership woes.</p>
<p>In his speech, Simeon promised to investigate “creating a separate Health Infrastructure Entity under Health New Zealand, to manage and deliver physical and digital assets.” But there’s no word on when that investigation might conclude</p>
<p><i>Reg</i> writers who learn of organizations that contemplate ERP as the fix for an unruly estate of legacy apps, with Excel holding things together in the middle, know they’re a chance of spending years chronicling the resulting mess. So good luck, HNZ, you might one day wish for the bad old days of running the org with spreadsheets. ®</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Explicit Selection</strong>: Set <code>search_tool = "research_papers"</code> to search only that specific collection.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p dir="auto">The system supports multiple search engines that can be selected by changing the <code>search_tool</code> variable in <code>config.py</code>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Auto</strong> (<code>auto</code>): Intelligent search engine selector that analyzes your query and chooses the most appropriate source (Wikipedia, arXiv, local collections, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Wikipedia</strong> (<code>wiki</code>): Best for general knowledge, facts, and overview information</li>
<li><strong>arXiv</strong> (<code>arxiv</code>): Great for scientific and academic research, accessing preprints and papers</li>
<li><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> (<code>duckduckgo</code>): General web search that doesn't require an API key</li>
<li><strong>The Guardian</strong> (<code>guardian</code>): Quality journalism and news articles (requires an API key)</li>
<li><strong>SerpAPI</strong> (<code>serp</code>): Google search results (requires an API key)</li>
<li><strong>Local Collections</strong>: Any collections defined in your <code>local_collections.py</code> file</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> The "auto" option will intelligently select the best search engine based on your query. For example, if you ask about physics research papers, it might select arXiv or your research_papers collection, while if you ask about current events, it might select The Guardian or DuckDuckGo.</p>

He found plenty that remained enraging: mud huts, primitive ploughs, “barefoot old men” and “bone-thin children”. One older villager, Ram Dass, recalled the bitter deprivation of his younger years, when he would work long days on someone else’s land for the meagre reward of 1.5kg of grain. On cold nights, the poor stuffed rice stalks into old clothes to keep warm. “What did we know what a quilt was?” A man was lucky to own a single pair of shoes from his wedding to his

<p dir="auto">Bash scripting is a powerful and valid approach for shell automation. Shef isn't designed to replace bash scripts, but
rather provides a toolkit that compliments bash when you need specific features.</p>
<p dir="auto">Shef implements some common tooling like built-in support for interactive prompts, conditional logic, and command
piping. This structured approach can simplify certain tasks that might require more verbose code in bash.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider Shef as another tool in your automation toolkit. Absolutely use bash scripts when they're the right fit, and
reach for Shef when its features align with your specific needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ugh. YAML? Really?</h2><a id="user-content-ugh-yaml-really" aria-label="Permalink: Ugh. YAML? Really?" href="#ugh-yaml-really"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sigh. Yep. Another config format. I considered several options, and YAML emerged as the most practical choice for
this particular use case. JSON lacks comments and multiline string support, which are essential when defining shell
commands and documenting workflows. XML would have been unnecessarily verbose. TOML, while nice, doesn't handle nested
structures as elegantly for complex workflows.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="I need help creating a Shef recipe. Shef is a CLI tool that combines shell commands into reusable recipes defined in YAML.

[DESCRIBE YOUR WORKFLOW IN DETAIL]

A Shef recipe is defined in YAML with this structure:

recipes:
  - name: &quot;short-name&quot;
    description: &quot;Human-readable description&quot;
    category: &quot;category&quot;
    author: &quot;optional author&quot;
    operations:
      - name: &quot;Operation Name&quot;
        id: &quot;unique_id&quot;
        command: &quot;shell command&quot;
        execution_mode: &quot;standard|interactive|stream&quot;  # How the command runs
        silent: true|false  # Whether to suppress the command's output
        condition: &quot;optional condition&quot;
        on_success: &quot;next_op_id&quot;
        on_failure: &quot;fallback_op_id&quot;
        transform: &quot;{{ .input | transformation }}&quot;
        prompts:
          - name: &quot;variable_name&quot;
            type: &quot;input|select|confirm|password|multiselect|number|editor|path|autocomplete&quot;
            message: &quot;Prompt message&quot;
            default: &quot;Default value&quot;
            help_text: &quot;Additional help information&quot;
            required: true|false  # Whether input is required
            options: [&quot;option1&quot;, &quot;option2&quot;]  # For select/multiselect/autocomplete types
            source_operation: &quot;operation_id&quot;  # For dynamic options
            source_transform: &quot;{{ .input | transform }}&quot;  # For processing source options
            min_value: 0  # For number type
            max_value: 100  # For number type
            file_extensions: [&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;json&quot;]  # For path type
            multiple_limit: 3  # For multiselect type
            editor_cmd: &quot;vim&quot;  # For editor type
        control_flow:
          type: &quot;foreach|for|while&quot;  # Type of control flow
          collection: &quot;Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3&quot;  # Items to iterate over (foreach loops)
          as: &quot;item&quot;  # Variable name for current item (foreach loops)
          count: 5  # Number of iterations (for loops)
          variable: &quot;i&quot;  # Variable name for iteration index (for loops)
          condition: &quot;{{ lt .counter 5 }}&quot;  # Condition to check (while loops)
        operations:  # Operations to perform for each iteration
          - name: &quot;Sub Operation&quot;
            # command: &quot;echo 'Processing {{ .item }}'&quot; # foreach loop
            # command: &quot;echo 'Iteration {{ .i }} of 5'&quot; # for loop
            # command: &quot;echo 'While iteration {{ .iteration }}'&quot; # while loop

RECIPE MECHANICS:
1. Operations execute in sequence unless redirected by on_success/on_failure
2. Each operation's output becomes input to the next operation
3. Variables from prompts are accessible as {{ .variable_name }}
4. Operation outputs are accessible as {{ .operation_id }}
5. You can combine variables and operation outputs in command templates
6. Control flow structures like foreach allow iterating over collections

CONTROL FLOW STRUCTURES:
- foreach: Iterate over a collection of items
  - collection: Newline-separated list of items (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - as: Variable name to assign each item during iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute for each item (with access to the iteration variable)
- for: Execute operations a fixed number of times
  - count: Number of iterations to perform (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - variable: Variable name for the current zero-based index (optional, defaults to &quot;i&quot;)
  - operations: Operations to execute for each iteration (with access to the index variable and .iteration)
- while: Execute operations as long as a condition is true
  - condition: Expression to evaluate before each iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute while the condition is true (with access to .iteration)

[DESCRIBE YOUR WORKFLOW IN DETAIL]

A Shef recipe is defined in YAML with this structure:

recipes:
  - name: "short-name"
    description: "Human-readable description"
    category: "category"
    author: "optional author"
    operations:
      - name: "Operation Name"
        id: "unique_id"
        command: "shell command"
        execution_mode: "standard|interactive|stream"  # How the command runs

RECIPE MECHANICS:
1. Operations execute in sequence unless redirected by on_success/on_failure
2. Each operation's output becomes input to the next operation
3. Variables from prompts are accessible as {{ .variable_name }}
4. Operation outputs are accessible as {{ .operation_id }}
5. You can combine variables and operation outputs in command templates
6. Control flow structures like foreach allow iterating over collections

CONTROL FLOW STRUCTURES:
- foreach: Iterate over a collection of items
  - collection: Newline-separated list of items (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - as: Variable name to assign each item during iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute for each item (with access to the iteration variable)
- for: Execute operations a fixed number of times
  - count: Number of iterations to perform (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - variable: Variable name for the current zero-based index (optional, defaults to "i")
  - operations: Operations to execute for each iteration (with access to the index variable and .iteration)
- while: Execute operations as long as a condition is true
  - condition: Expression to evaluate before each iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute while the condition is true (with access to .iteration)

<hr>

<p>
One of the things I detested about being a little kid was that every
time I thought of something really cool to do, I was invariably
thwarted by my little brother shouting, “<em>Mom!  Kelvin's
mixing rocket fuel in the bathtub again!</em>” or
“<em>Mom!  Kelvin's making a submarine out of the old
refrigerator!</em>”.  Well, middle age has its drawbacks, but at
least you can undertake a project like this without fear of getting
nipped in the bud at the cry, “<em>Mom! Kelvin's down in the
basement bending spacetime!</em>”.  It's important to recall the
distinction between “grownup” and “grown up”.
Let's us grownups head for the basement to bend some serious
spacetime.
</p>

<h2>Matters of Gravity</h2>

<p>
Apart from rare and generally regrettable moments of free-fall, we
spend our entire lives under the influence of the Earth's
gravity, yet rarely, if ever, do we experience the
<em>universal</em> nature of gravitation.  It's a tremendous
philosophical leap from “stuff falls” to “everything in the universe
attracts everything else”.  That leap, made by Isaac Newton in the
17th century, not only allowed understanding the motion of the Moon
and the planets, but inoculated in Western culture the idea that
the universe as a whole was governed by laws humans could discover.
This realisation fueled the Enlightenment and the subsequent
development of science and technology.
</p>

<p>
This page presents a “basement science” experiment which
reveals the universality of gravitation by demonstrating the
gravitational attraction between palpable objects on the human scale.
The experiment deliberately uses only
the crudest and most commonplace materials, permitting
anybody who's so inclined to perform it.
Einstein's 1915 theory of General Relativity explains
gravitation as spacetime curvature created by
matter and energy.  So, by demonstrating how every object
in the universe attracts everything else, we're
<em>bending spacetime in the basement</em>.
</p>

<p>
But, if gravitation is ubiquitous, why was it not discovered millennia
before Newton's 1687 <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philosophiæ
naturalis principia mathematica</cite>?  The reason lies in the
extraordinary <em>weakness</em> of the gravitational force.
</p>

<h2>Feeble Attraction</h2>

<p>
Now you might say, “What do you mean, <em>weak</em>?  I fell down a
flight of stairs a couple of years ago, and gravity sure didn't feel
weak to me!“.  And yet, of the four forces of nature known to
physics, gravitation is the weakest, by the mindboggling factor of
4.17×10<sup>42</sup> (4 followed by 42 zeroes) times weaker than
the electromagnetic force.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/magrav.jpg" width="202" height="317" alt="Electromagnetism vs. gravity">
The stark difference in the strength of the electromagnetic and
gravitational forces is evident in the picture to the left.  The
bright square in the jaws of the pliers is a 4 mm cubical magnet.  It
is lifting a spherical steel pétanque (a lawn bowling game popular in
southern France and Switzerland) ball which weighs 550 grams.
Consider this picture in the following way: we're pitting our valiant
little magnet, with a volume of 0.064 cubic centimetres, weighing
less than one gram, pulling <b>up</b> with the electromagnetic force,
against the entire Earth, pulling <b>down</b> with gravity.  And the
winner is…the magnet.  A one gram magnet (I'm being generous: I
don't have a scale on which its weight reads other than zero)
out-pulls the Earth, which weighs 5.9736×10<sup>27</sup> grams and has
a volume of more than 10<sup>27</sup> cubic centimetres.
</p>

<p>
(The apparent discrepancy between the ratio of masses of the Earth
and the magnet and the 4.17×10<sup>42</sup> strength ratio
of electromagnetism and gravitation is due to the
fact that only an infinitesimal fraction of the mass of the magnet
contributes to the [electro]magnetic attraction on the ball,
while every gram of the Earth's mass exerts gravitational force.
To obtain the correct ratio of force strengths, one must compare
the gravitational attraction between two electrons at a given
distance with the electromagnetic repulsion
resulting from their charge.  This calculation arrives at the
correct strength ratio for the two forces.)
</p>

<p>
If gravity were not so weak compared to the electromagnetic force, you
wouldn't be reading this page; it's only because the electromagnetic
force that bonds the atoms in your body together so easily defeats the
Earth's gravity that you, along with all other solid objects,
don't slump into a puddle and eventually merge into a perfectly
spherical (actually, slightly ellipsoidal thanks to rotation) planet.
<br>
</p>

<p id="gravcalc">
If your browser supports JavaScript, you can use the following calculator
to determine the gravitational force between any two objects.  The
gravitational force between two masses <em>m</em> and <em>m'</em>
whose centres of gravity are separated by a distance <em>r</em> is
given by:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/gforce.png" alt="F = G\frac{m m'}{r^2}" width="96" height="42">
</p>

<p>
where <em>G</em>, the <em>gravitational constant</em>, is:
</p>

<p>
6.67408×10<sup>−8</sup> cm³/g-sec²
</p>



<form name="calc1">
Given:<br>
Mass 1: <em>m</em> =  grams<br>
Mass 2: <em>m'</em> =  grams<br>
Distance: <em>r</em> =  centimetres<br>

<br>
Gravitational force: <em>F</em> =  dyne

<p>
Since most folks don't encounter forces in dynes on an everyday basis,
not to mention small fractions of a dyne, it's useful to express
this force in terms of the weight of something one can visualise.
We can calculate the mass of an object from its weight at the
Earth's surface merely by solving the gravitational force
equation above for <em>m</em> and plugging in the Earth's
mass, <em>m<sub>e</sub></em> = 5.9736×10<sup>27</sup> grams,
and the Earth's equatorial radius, <em>r<sub>e</sub></em> =
6.37814×10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;cm:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/gravmass.png" alt="m = \frac{{r_e}^2 F}{G m_e}" width="84" height="47">
</p>

<p>
The value below, then, is the mass of an object whose weight
at the Earth's surface equals the gravitational force displayed
in the box above.  This value is automatically updated when you
press the “Calculate” button.
</p>

<p>
Equivalent mass:   grams
</p><p id="monofilament">
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/monofilament.jpg" width="256" height="234" alt="Picture of 0.02 cm nylon monofilament, with micrometer and distance scale">
This mass is equivalent to the following
length of nylon monofilament fishing line with a diameter of 0.02&nbsp;cm
(0.2 millimetres) like that shown at the left (the scale at top shows
centimetres and millimetres; the micrometer holding the segment of
monofilament is, regrettably, calibrated in English inches—one inch
is 2.54 centimetres.
</p>

<p>
Monofilament length:   mm
</p>

<p>
This is small, but it is an object visible to the naked eye (easily
with a modest magnifier), and heavy enough to fall under
the influence of Earth's gravity, as opposed to smaller and
lighter particles of dust and smoke which stay suspended
in the air for long periods of time.
<br>
</p>
</form>

<h2>Do the Twist!</h2>

<p>
Even though the force of gravity between objects of modest mass is
palpable compared to the weight of objects one can see,
detecting such a tiny force seems a daunting, if not hopeless,
endeavour for the basement tinkerer.  Certainly, painstakingly
designed and constructed laboratory apparatus has allowed measuring
the gravitational constant to great precision and verifying the
equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, and precision
gravitometers are routinely used in oil and gas exploration and
mineral prospecting, but we're trying to see if we can experience
the universal attraction of gravity without any high tech, high
budget gear.
</p>

<p>
Measuring tiny gravitational forces would be easy if we were in deep
space, far from any massive bodies.  The only forces on objects in our
space laboratory, then, would be those entirely under our control.  As
long as we made sure none of the objects we were experimenting with
were magnetic or electrically charged (easily arranged, assuming they
are conductive, simply by bringing them into contact so all excess
charges equilibrate), the only force remaining between objects would
be gravity, so however weak it be, we need only be sufficiently
patient to observe its effects.  (The other two forces, the strong and
weak nuclear interactions, are limited in range to distances on the
order of the size of an atomic nucleus and can be neglected on the
human scale.)
</p>

<p>
What we'd like to do, then, is <em>cancel</em> the Earth's gravity so
that the much smaller gravitational forces between objects that fit in
the basement become evident.  Fortunately, we don't need a 25th
century WarpMan to accomplish this, only a modest helping of 18th
century technology.
</p>

<h3>Differential Cleverness</h3>

<p>
One of the great all-purpose sledgehammers in the toolbox of
physicists and engineers is <em>differential measurement</em>; in
other words, don't worry about the absolute value of something, but
only the <em>difference</em> between things you can measure.  For
example, it is common practice for linemen repairing high-voltage
power transmission lines to work on them, without cutting power, from
insulated baskets raised by a crane.  As long as the lineman is
insulated from the ground, only the voltage difference between his
hands and the line he's working on matters; after attaching the basket
to the line, this is zero, so he might as well be repairing a grounded
conductor.  Now if, while working on a conductor at, say, 200,000
volts above Earth potential, he should happen to touch the tower,
grounded to Earth, that would make for a really bad day.  The trick is
keeping the <em>difference</em> small; you can live your entire life
at 1 million volts, and as long as everything around you is near that
value, there is no way, even in principle, you could discover the
absolute potential.  This is the consequence of all the
forces of physics being <em>gauge invariant</em>:
absolute values don't exist—only differences matter.
</p>

<h3>The Torsion Balance</h3>

<p>
What we're looking for, then, is a device which responds only to
differences in gravitational attraction, canceling out the
much stronger constant gravitational attraction of the
Earth.  We need look no further than a slightly modified version of
the same device Henry Cavendish used in 1798 to first measure
the gravitational constant, <em>G</em> in the equations above.
Ever since, the <em>torsion balance</em> has been the primary tool
used both for measuring the gravitational constant
and testing the <em>equivalence principle</em>, which states
that all bodies experience the same gravitational force regardless
of composition; Einstein's General Relativity showed this to be
a fundamental consequence of the structure of space and time.
</p>

<p>
State of the art torsion balances have measured the gravitational
constant to better than one part per million and confirmed
the equivalence principle to more than 11 decimal places.  This
requires extraordinarily refined and delicate laboratory apparatus and
experimental design, in which a multitude of subtle effects must be
compensated for or canceled out.  We, however, aren't going to
<em>measure</em> anything—we're only interested in <em>observing</em>
universal gravitation.  This allows simplifying the torsion balance to
something we can set up in the basement.
</p>

<p>
The principle of the torsion balance is extremely simple.  Suspend a
horizontal <em>balance arm</em> from a vertical elastic fibre.  At
each end of the balance arm are masses, much denser than material of
the arm, which respond to the gravitational force.  Once the
suspending fibre, balance arm, and weights are set up and brought into
balance, the downward force of gravitation acts equally on every
component.  The balance arm is then free to rotate without any
hindrance from the Earth's gravity.  It is constrained only by air
friction and the <em>torsional strength</em> of the support fibre—its
resistance to being twisted.  We can then place
<em>test masses</em> near the ends of the balance arm and observe
whether the gravitational attraction between them and the masses on
the arm causes the balance arm to move.  When measuring the
gravitational constant one must precisely calibrate the torsional
strength of the fibre, but to simply observe gravitation we need only
make sure the fibre is sufficiently limp to allow the gravitational
force to overcome its resistance to twisting.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the balance arm is <em>so</em> free to move that once any
force sets it into motion, it oscillates for a long period, spinning
round and round if free or bouncing back and forth off the stops if
constrained.  To avoid this we need to <em>damp</em> the system so
kinetic energy acquired by the bar is more rapidly dissipated.  Well,
nothing's more damp than water, so we add a <em>water brake</em> to
the arm which turns in a fixed reservoir.  The resulting drag as the
balance arm moves is much greater than air resistance and frictional
losses in the fibre, and reduces the oscillations to a tolerable
degree.

</p>

<p>
So here's the sophisticated, high-tech, big science apparatus we'll
use to observe the subtle curvature of spacetime.  An aluminium ladder
serves as the support from which the balance arm is suspended.  Nylon
monofilament fishing line, as <a href="#monofilament">shown above</a>,
is knotted to the middle of the third cross-beam at the back of the
ladder, one above the brace bearing the little white box, about which
<a href="#spycam">more later</a>.  Using a ladder or similar movable support frame allows
setting up the balance in the middle of the room.  This is important
because we <em>are</em> bending spacetime in the basement, in this
case an underground storage room at Fourmilab.  Ground level is about
even with the ceiling of this room, about 45&nbsp;cm above the top of the
ventilation window at the upper right of the picture.  An underground
room is ideal because it minimises temperature variations and
vibration which might perturb the balance arm.  Both walls shown in
this picture are sunk into solid limestone rock—if you set up the
balance near one of these walls, the gravitational field from all that
rock will mask that of the test masses, and the balance will assume a
“gravity gradient” position with one of the ends of the bar pointing
toward the wall, and will budge only slightly under the influence of
the test masses.  With the bar in the middle of the room, the tidal
influence of the mass of the wall and the rock behind it is reduced to
a negligible value.  The pipe on the wall at the right is part of the
serpentine pressurised hot water heating system; it was disabled to
prevent air currents from disrupting the balance arm.  In fact, since
the room is underground, the heating system is rarely engaged, and
only in the depths of winter, never in June.
</p>

<h4>The Balance Arm and Cradle</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appdetail.jpg" width="320" height="297" alt="Detail of balance arm">
The balance arm is a 5 × 5 × 30&nbsp;cm bar of plastic foam, hacked from a
5&nbsp;cm thick slab of packing material with a
<a href="http://www.victorinox.ch/" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">Swiss Army knife</a>.  The
bar is suspended in a cradle made of insulated telephone wire.
The bar is held in its cradle by friction and the indentation made
in the soft plastic foam due to the weights at either end of the
bar; it's easier to adjust the bar for proper alignment this way
than if it were glued to the cradle.
</p>

<h4>The Support Fibre</h4>

<p>
The nylon monofilament that suspends the cradle is barely visible at
the top of the picture—it is fastened by a knot to a loop formed
into the cradle wires by twisting them.  The monofilament is a very
fine “six pound test” (about 3&nbsp;kg capacity) fishing line
manufactured in Japan; a 300 metre spool of it costs about US$9. The
masses which cause the bar to turn when a gravitational force acts
upon them are lead “sinkers” used by fishermen, each
weighing 169 grams.  Two are placed on each end of the balance beam,
giving it a total weight of 676 grams.  Be sure to place the weights
on both ends of the beam simultaneously so it doesn't topple, then
adjust the placement so the beam is horizontal.  Nylon monofilament is
very elastic: when you put the weights on the beam the support line
will stretch and the beam will end up closer to the ground.  You may
have to adjust the attachment of the line to the ladder (or other
support) or, as I did, twist the cradle wires to restore the beam to
the desired height. Finally, when you first hang the beam, it may take
some time to release stresses in the fibre remaining from the
manufacturing process and from its having been rolled onto a spool. 
It's best to let the arm hang for a couple of days, free to turn, to
allow these initial stresses to equalise before attempting any
experiments with gravitation.
<br>
</p>

<h4>The Water Brake</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appclose.jpg" width="320" height="175" alt="Closeup of beam and water brake">
The height of the beam is important because of the need for it to fit
properly with the water brake.  If the beam is allowed to swing
freely, it will be terribly underdamped—once it starts to swing,
only air friction and the minuscule losses in the fibre will act to
stop it.  This causes the beam to bounce around incessantly, masking
the steady influence of gravitation.  The water brake dissipates the
energy of these unwanted oscillations precisely as an automotive shock
absorber does; the flap's motion does work on a viscous fluid, water
in this case, and deposits its energy in heating it.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/brakeflap.jpg" width="200" height="193" alt="Closeup of water brake flap">
The water brake consists of a flap which projects downward from the
balance arm (in this case, a piece of aluminium cut with scissors from
the tray of a “heat and eat” meal, fixed with white glue
into a slot cut into the bottom of the balance beam).  The flap
projects into a reservoir (a tuna fish can) filled with water.  A more
viscous fluid such as salad oil would provide greater damping and less
bouncing than water, but I opted for water since it's less icky to
clean up when the inevitable spill occurs and can be disposed of when
the experiment's done without a visit to the village recycling barrel.
</p>

<p>
If I were rebuilding the balance beam, I would use a longer and
narrower flap and/or a larger and deeper water reservoir.  If
the flap is only slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the
reservoir, you have to be very careful that the flap and reservoir are
centred on the beam.  Otherwise, the flap will touch the edge of
the reservoir and freeze the beam in place, as that frictional force is many
orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational force we wish
the beam to respond to.  The water reservoir can be as large as
you like, as long as it doesn't interfere with placing the
test masses; the larger it is, the less you have to worry
about its being precisely centred.
<br>
</p>

<h4>Test Masses and Supports</h4>

<p>
Blocks of plastic foam support the test masses so their centre of
gravity is at the same height as the masses at the ends of the balance
beam, maximising the attraction.  The foam also keeps the balls from
tending to roll away.  The black rectangle, actually an inverted mouse
pad, serves as a background for the time display superimposed by the
video camera, rendering it more readable when images are reduced in
scale so movies download more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Use the densest objects you can obtain for the ends of the balance
beam and as test masses: lead sinkers, steel balls, plutonium
hemispheres, etc.  Density is important because the gravitational
force varies as the inverse square of the distance <em>between the
centres of mass</em> of two objects.  With a dense substance, the
centre of mass is closer to the surface, so you can get the centres of
mass closer together and enhance the gravitational force.  For
example, consider two pairs of one-kilogram spheres, the first made of
lead (density 11.3&nbsp;g/cm³), the second of pine wood (density about
0.43&nbsp;g/cm³), placed so the surfaces of each pair of spheres are
1&nbsp;cm apart.  A one kilogram lead sphere has a radius of 2.76&nbsp;cm,
so the centres of mass are separated by 1+2.76×2, or 6.52&nbsp;cm.  A
one kilogram sphere of pine has a radius of 8.22&nbsp;cm, by comparison,
so the centres of mass of the two pine spheres are 1+8.22×2 = 17.44&nbsp;cm
apart.  Taking the square of the ratio of these distances shows that
the gravitational force between the lead spheres is more than 7
times that of the pine spheres.  Since attraction is linear by mass but
inverse square in distance, you're better off with a modest mass of
high-density material than a large mass of a substance with lesser density.
</p>

<p>
It's best to use a nonmagnetic material like lead for the weights
on the ends of the balance arm.  The forces we're working with are
so small that if you use, for example, steel ball bearings on the
arms, you may end up accidentally reinventing the compass instead of
detecting the force of gravity.
</p>

<h4 id="spycam">The Spy Cam</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/bsrmon.jpg" width="256" height="267" alt="BSR surveillance monitor">
“So what's the little white box on the back of the
ladder?”, you ask. Okay….  It's a BSR Model 500
surveillance camera which lets me observe the state of the experiment
as it runs.  The Sony camcorder I use to make movies doesn't generate
video output while recording, so I can't use its video feed to monitor
what's happening.  Popping into the room where the experiment's
running is a no-no—air currents from opening and closing the
door, not to mention walking around in the room could seriously
disrupt things.  The BSR camera and accompanying 13&nbsp;cm (diagonal)
monitor allows keeping tabs on what's happening in a non-intrusive
manner.  I made a custom interface of the BSR camera/monitor cable to
Fourmilab's ubiquitous RJ-45 cabling, so I can place two BSR cameras
anywhere on the site and monitor either from anywhere else.  At the
right is an image from the surveillance camera taken at the end of an
experiment, confirming that the balance beam has come to a stop
against the foam block supporting the mass at the top.  The camera is
sensitive to infrared and includes infrared LEDs to illuminate nearby
objects, and has a microphone linked to a speaker in the monitor. 
This makes it ideal for anxious parents who wish to monitor their
sleeping baby; spacetime hackers can use the infrared illumination to
view the balance beam without the thermal disruption of incandescent
lamps or direct sunlight.  The storage room where I ran this
experiment has fluorescent strip lighting on the ceiling, and I
observed no detrimental effects from its being illuminated.  Of
course, if the room you're using is equipped with that low-tech
miracle called a window, you can dispense with all this complexity.

<h2>Gravitation in Action</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appcam.jpg" width="256" height="192" alt="View showing camera angle used in the movies">
The following time-lapse movies (about 30 seconds per frame) show the
torsion balance responding to the gravitational field generated by two
740 gram competition pétanque balls.  The picture at left shows the
camera angle employed in both movies.  In each, the movie begins with
the bar stationary, in contact with one of the balls or the foam
supporting it.  The balls are then shifted to the opposite corners,
where they attract the lead weights on the ends of the bar.  The bar
then turns, slowly at first and then with increasing speed as it is
accelerated by the gravitational force growing as the inverse square
of the decreasing distance between the masses.  The bar bounces when
it hits the stop on the other end, and finally, after a series of
smaller and smaller bounces as the water brake dissipates its kinetic
energy, comes to rest in contact with the closer ball or support.
This is the lowest energy state, at which the bar will always arrive
at the end of the experiment.

<p>
Pay no attention to the plastic robot ant—she's just curious.
It's a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/hackants13.html" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">long story</a>.
</p>

<h2>A Tide in the Affairs of Man</h2>

<p>
What we've demonstrated by these experiments is the universality of
gravitation; there is nothing special about the Earth that makes
objects fall toward it.  Everything attracts everything else;
the Earth's attraction is greater simply because the Earth is
so much more massive than the objects we encounter in everyday
life.  Only by canceling out the Earth's gravitation by means of
a torsion balance were we able to observe the gravitational
attraction between masses of less than a kilogram.
</p>

<p>
The universality of gravitation means that every object in the
universe is interlinked in a web of mutual attraction; the universe is
transparent to gravitation.  The most distant galaxies exert a pull on
you, as you do upon them—immeasurably tiny to be sure, but
present just the same.  From a practical standpoint, universality
means there's no way to shield your torsion balance from the
gravitational attraction of masses in its vicinity; you can only set
it up sufficiently far from other massive objects so the attraction of
the test masses predominates.  One interesting massive object to
consider is yourself (I use “massive” only in the sense of
"possessing mass", not pejoratively; if you took it that way, perhaps
you should check out my on-line
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">diet book</a>).
</p>

<p>
Using the <a href="#gravcalc">gravitational force calculator</a>
earlier in this document, we can compute the gravitational attraction
between the 338 gram mass at the end of the balance beam and the 740
gram test mass at the 14&nbsp;cm distance when the beam is at the midpoint
between the masses to be 0.000085 dynes.  Now suppose you're crouching
down in order to move the test masses, with your centre of gravity one
metre from the closer test mass, and that you weigh 65&nbsp;kg.  Plugging
these numbers into the calculator shows that your own gravitational
attraction on the nearer end of the beam is 0.000147 dynes, 1.7 times
as great as that of the test mass.  Your actual influence on the
motion of the balance arm is less, however, since what matters is the
<em>difference</em> in force exerted on the masses at the two ends of
the balance arm.  Since your centre of gravity is more distant than
the test masses, the difference is less.
</p>

<p>
Let's work it out.  Assume the centres of gravity of the two masses on
the balance arm are 25&nbsp;cm apart, and that you're crouching so the arm
makes a 45° angle with your centre of gravity, one metre from the
centre of the arm.  The nearer mass is then 17.68&nbsp;cm closer than the
more distant one and the difference in gravitational attraction (or <em>tidal
force</em>) on the two masses is the difference in attraction on a
mass 91.16&nbsp;cm distant and one 108.84&nbsp;cm away.  The calculator gives
the attraction on the near end of the arm as 0.0001764 dynes and the
far end as 0.0001238 dyne, with a difference of 0.0000527 dynes.
Now recall that the force exerted by the test mass was 0.000085 dynes,
only 1.6 times as large, so even taking into account the reduced tidal
influence due to your greater distance, the force you exert on the
balance cannot be neglected.  This makes it essential to remotely monitor
the experiment so your own mass doesn't disrupt it.
</p>

<p>
In practice, air currents due to your motion and resulting from convection
driven by your body's temperature being above room temperature may exert
greater forces on the balance arm than the gravitational field generated
by your mass.  In any case, it's best to let the experiment evolve
on its own, observed from elsewhere.
</p>

<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/archimede.png" width="161" height="250" alt="Archimedes">
<h2><em>Enlightenment Deferred:</em><br>An Historical Speculation</h2>

<p>
Nineteen centuries elapsed between the death of Archimedes in
212&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span> and the publication of
Newton's <em>Principia</em> in 1687.  Given the philosophical
implications of Newton's theory, it's interesting to speculate what
might have happened had Archimedes discovered the universal nature of
gravitation.
</p>

<p>
To do this, he would have had to suspect that attraction was
universal, suggest an experiment to confirm this, and perform that
experiment, with results validating the hypothesis.  Here is
information in Archimedes' possession which might have suggested the
universality of gravitation.
<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>    The Earth is a sphere.  The shape of its shadow on the Moon
	    during a lunar eclipse demonstrated this, and was
	    confirmed by the next item.  The assertion that “the
	    ancients thought the world was flat” is
	    nonsense—Columbus didn't “discover the world
	    was round”: he discovered that his own estimate of
	    the diameter of the world was wrong by a factor of two
	    compared to that available to Archimedes; if he hadn't
	    inadvertently discovered the New World, he and his
	    unfortunate crew would have died of starvation far from
	    the coast of China.</li>

    <li>    The approximate radius of the Earth.  Around
	    250&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span>, by measuring the
	    difference in the angle of sunlight at noon on the June
	    Solstice, which illuminated the bottom of a well at Syene
	    (now Aswan) Egypt near the Tropic of Cancer, with the
	    length of the shadow cast on the same date and time by a
	    vertical pillar in Alexandria, a known distance to the
	    North, Eratosthenes determined the Earth's circumference. 
	    Archimedes corresponded extensively with Eratosthenes and
	    other scholars in Alexandria, and knew of this result. 
	    Archimedes himself calculated the value of π as between 3
	    10/71 and 3 1/7, with a mean value of 3.14185, allowing
	    accurate computation of the Earth's radius from the
	    circumference.</li>

    <li>    The approximate mass of the Earth.  Assuming the Earth
            to have the same density as common rocks such as
            limestone (2.7&nbsp;g/cm³) gives an estimate within a
            factor of two of the correct value.  The actual density of
            the Earth is 5.52&nbsp;g/cm³.</li>

    <li>    How to calculate with very large numbers.  
            In <cite>The Sand Reckoner</cite>
	    (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Ψαμμίτης</span>)
            in 215&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span>, Archimedes
            invented a positional number system which allowed writing
            and calculating with arbitrarily large quantities, which he
            demonstrated by calculating not only how many grains of
            sand would fill the volume of the Earth, but how many
            grains of sand would fill the entire universe (which the
            Greeks estimated to be about one light year in diameter).
            The latter number, about 10<sup>63</sup>, is comfortably
            larger than any of the quantities associated with
            gravitation.</li>
             
    <li>    The existence of electrostatic and magnetic forces which
            appeared to act at a distance.  The inverse square
            behaviour of these forces was not
            known in antiquity, however.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Suppose then that, given these facts, Archimedes embarked upon the
following chain of reasoning.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>    Objects fall, not in a fixed direction, but toward the
            centre of our world.  If they fell in a fixed direction,
            if I dropped a rock down a well in the south of
            Egypt and a well in Syracuse, separated by a
            substantial percentage of the world's circumference,
            one would hit the wall of the well before striking the
            bottom.  This doesn't happen, so objects fall everywhere
            toward the centre of the world.</li>

    <li>    Why does the world attract falling objects?  Is there
            something special which endows it with
            this property?  Yet the world seems to be made of the same
            substances as everything else.  What is the difference
            between the world and a rock?</li>

    <li>    <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="Eureka, eureka!">Εὕρηκα,
    	    εὕρηκα!</span>
            The world is <em>much larger</em> than
            a rock!  Perhaps <em>every object</em> attracts
            <em>every other</em>.  We only feel the world's attraction
            because it is so large.</li>

    <li>    But if this is so, might the celestial bodies be objects
            no different from the world and its inhabitants, and subject
            to the same forces?</li>

    <li>    If attraction is universal, might an artificer
            be able to build a device to show it?</li>

    <li>    Such a device must be isolated from falling down.  Perhaps
            a horizontal balance, free to turn in either direction,
            with weights at each end to be attracted to objects
            in their vicinity….</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Archimedes Apparatus</h3>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/archapp.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Balance built from materials available to Archimedes">
It seems plausible, then, given the knowledge at hand and a chain of
inference which, in retrospect at least, appears straightforward, that
Archimedes could have suspected the universality of gravitation.  But
could he have <em>demonstrated it</em>?  Unlike many scholars in
ancient Greece who contented themselves with philosophical arguments,
Archimedes was an intensely practical man, renowned as a military
engineer as well as a mathematician and philosopher.  His laws of the
lever and buoyancy were tested experimentally, and so we should expect
he would subject any inference about gravitation to experimental
confirmation.  Now that we've succeeded in bending spacetime in the
basement with common household materials of the late 20th century,
let's see if the experiment can be done using only materials
Archimedes might have employed.
<br>
</p>

<p>
Let's try to redesign the torsion balance using only materials
available in antiquity.

    <dd>Instead of plastic foam, we use a strip of pine wood,
	2&nbsp;cm wide, ½&nbsp;cm high, and 30&nbsp;cm long. 
	Notches are cut in the edges of the beam near each end to
	secure the support cradle. For masses at the ends of the
	balance beam we may continue to use lead, which was produced
	in Egypt in the 2nd millennium <span>B.C.</span>
	and in Europe no later than the 6th century <span>B.C.</span> As the discoverer of specific
	gravity, Archimedes would understand the merit in using the
	densest substance available. (Gold, almost twice as dense as
	lead, would be an even better choice.  Perhaps King Hiero of
	Syracuse, grateful to Archimedes for exposing the goldsmith
	who adulterated the gold in his crown with silver, might have
	contributed gold weights for the balance beam, thereby taking
	the first small step down the road to government-funded Big
	Science.  Wishing to remain in the domain of basement science,
	we shall forgo royal subsidies and soldier on with lead.)</dd>

<dt>The Cradle</dt>
    <dd>To support the balance arm, we substitute twine
        made of vegetable fibre for telephone wire.  Actually,
        since copper was known for thousands of years before
        the Greeks, a lightweight copper cradle could have been
        made, but it would have been more work to fabricate
        and has no advantage compared to the twine.  Thread,
        string, and rope were made from a variety of natural
        fibres by all ancient cultures.</dd>

<dt>The Support Fibre</dt>
    <dd>The support fibre is the most difficult component to
        replace with a 3rd century <span>B.C.</span> analogue.  Nylon
        monofilament so closely approaches the ideal of a
        massless support free of torsional resistance that
        doing without it requires experimenting with a variety
        of alternatives and compromising with the shortcomings
        of whatever is selected.  I finally settled on a very thin 
        vegetable fibre support “peeled” from a piece of
        twine by unwinding it.  The fibres you find in rope or
        twine are a variety of lengths—you have to separate them
        and then select individual fibres long enough to support
        the balance arm.  To obtain sufficient strength, I used
        four separate fibres selected from the twine.  If the
        rope or twine has been twisted or braided, you'll have
        to let the fibre hang for an extended period of time (three
        or four days at least) to release its internal stresses.
	
    	<p> In choosing and using any natural fibre support, you have to
        approach the project with a willingness to learn by trial and
        error and a great deal of patience.  Each kind of fibre has
        its own “personality”, and the quirks can take some time to
        understand.  For example, many plant and animal fibres are
        sensitive to moisture—if a summer thunderstorm increases the
        relative humidity from 50% to 99% in the space of an hour,
        your balance arm may start to swing wildly as the fibre
        absorbs moisture from the air.  Further,
        plant fibres tend to tear, both under tensile stress and
        when twisted.  This can cause your balance beam to
        “spontaneously” shift to a different equilibrium point or,
        after having been displaced, return to a different location
        than the starting point.</p>

        <p>Would Archimedes have appreciated the importance of choosing a
        supple and well-behaved support fibre?  I think so.  From the
        radius of the Earth, which he knew, and assuming its density
        to be the same as rocks such as limestone (about half the
        actual density of the Earth), the ratio of the Earth's
        mass to that of whatever test masses were employed could be
        estimated within a factor of two.  Making the simplest
        assumption (which has the additional merit of being correct)
        that attraction is proportional to mass, it is clear that
        the force acting on the masses at the ends of the balance
        arm is minuscule, so a fibre which offers the least possible resistance
        to twisting should be employed.</p></dd>

<dt>Test Masses</dt>
    <dd>Lead or gold (<em>Monarch!  Archimedes is doing natural
        philosophy in the bathtub again!</em>) test masses would be
        preferable, but to show how robust this experiment is I opted
        for a couple of rocks—two kilogram paving stones like those
        which border every highway in Switzerland, where roads are so
        built to last that Julius Cæsar would shake his head in
        admiration.</dd>

<dt>No Water Brake</dt>
    <dd>After experimenting with a variety of vegetable fibres,
        I decided to proceed without a water brake for this
        experiment.  The balance arm is more prone to oscillation,
        but the friction in the support fibre, much greater than
        in synthetic nylon monofilament, damps the oscillations
        adequately.  Allowing the lead weights on the balance arm
        to collide with the stone test masses also dissipates
        substantial energy, further reducing the need for a brake.</dd>

<dt>Unreconciled Residua</dt>
    <dd>I didn't bother to replace the aluminium ladder with a support
        Archimedes might have used.  Any carpenter could fashion a
        more suitable replacement for the ladder.  In fact, a wooden
        saw-horse would have been better for all these experiments,
        but I don't have one and didn't feel like making one from
        various pallets and spare lumber in the High Bay.

    	<p>The concrete floor would also seem strange to Archimedes, but
        it is irrelevant to the experiment.  A smooth stone floor, as
        existed for millennia before, would produce identical results.</p></dd>

The following movies demonstrate universal gravitation with an apparatus
which, as argued above, could have been conceived by Archimedes and
built from materials he could readily obtain.

</p><h3>The Archimedes Enlightenment?</h3>

<p>
Suppose this had happened.  Consider how easily it could have.
Would such a discovery in Archimedes' time have had an impact
comparable to Newton's or, occurring in a very different social
and intellectual milieu, would it have been regarded as no more than
a curiosity?  How might human history have played out had the
Enlightenment begun 1900 years before Newton?
