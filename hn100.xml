<p dir="auto">You own a high-end ASUS ROG laptop perhaps a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus. It's specifications are impressive: an RTX 30/40 series GPU, a top-tier Intel processor, and plenty of RAM. Yet, it stutters during basic tasks like watching a YouTube video, audio crackles and pops on Discord calls, the mouse cursor freezes for a split second, just long enough to be infuriating.</p>
<p dir="auto">You've likely tried all the conventional fixes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Updating every driver imaginable, multiple times.</li>
<li>Performing a "clean" reinstallation of Windows.</li>
<li>Disabling every conceivable power-saving option.</li>
<li>Manually tweaking processor interrupt affinities.</li>
<li>Following convoluted multi-step guides from Reddit threads.</li>
<li>Even installing Linux, only to find the problem persists.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If none of that worked, it's because the issue isn't with the operating system or a driver. The problem is far deeper, embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">CPU 0 is taking the brunt of the impact, spending over 90 seconds processing interrupts while other cores remain largely unaffected. This isn't a failure of load balancing; it's a process locked to a single core.</p>
<p dir="auto">A similar test on a Scar 15 from 2022 shows the exact same culprit: high DPC latency originating from <code>ACPI.sys</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's easy to blame a Windows driver, but <code>ACPI.sys</code> is not a typical driver. It primarily functions as an interpreter for ACPI Machine Language (AML), the code provided by the laptop's firmware (BIOS). If <code>ACPI.sys</code> is slow, it's because the firmware is feeding it inefficient or flawed AML code to execute. These slowdowns are often triggered by General Purpose Events (GPEs) and traffic from the Embedded Controller (EC). To find the true source, we must dig deeper.</p>

<p dir="auto">This power cycling is nonsensical because the laptop is configured for a scenario where it is impossible: <strong>The system is in Ultimate Mode (via a MUX switch) with an external display connected.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In this mode:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The discrete NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) is the <strong>only</strong> active graphics processor.</li>
<li>The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is completely powered down and bypassed.</li>
<li>The dGPU is wired directly to the internal and external displays.</li>
<li>There is no mechanism for switching between GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Yet, the firmware is relentlessly trying to power cycle the dGPU every 15-30 seconds. The dGPU in mux mode isn't just "preferred" - it's the ONLY path to the display. There's no fallback, and no alternative. When the firmware sends <code>_PS3</code> (power off), it's attempting something architecturally impossible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the time, hardware sanity checks refuse these nonsensical commands, but even failed attempts introduce latency spikes causing audio dropouts, input lag, and accumulating performance degradation. Games freeze mid-session, videos buffer indefinitely, system responsiveness deteriorates until restart.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Catastrophic Edge Case</h4><a id="user-content-the-catastrophic-edge-case" aria-label="Permalink: The Catastrophic Edge Case" href="#the-catastrophic-edge-case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes, under specific thermal conditions or race conditions, the power-down actually succeeds. When the firmware manages to power down the GPU that's driving the display, the sequence is predictable and catastrophic:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Firmware executes <code>_PS3</code></strong> - GPU power off command</li>
<li><strong>Hardware complies</strong> - safety checks fail or timing aligns</li>
<li><strong>Display signal cuts</strong> - monitors go black</li>
<li><strong>User input triggers wake</strong> - mouse/keyboard activity</li>
<li><strong>Windows calls <code>PowerOnMonitor()</code></strong> - attempt display recovery</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA driver executes <code>_PS0</code></strong> - GPU power on command</li>
<li><strong>GPU enters impossible state</strong> - firmware insists OFF, Windows needs ON</li>
<li><strong>Driver thread blocks indefinitely</strong> - waiting for GPU response</li>
<li><strong>30-second watchdog expires</strong> - Windows gives up</li>
<li><strong>System crashes with BSOD</strong></li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">An interrupt handler runs at a very high priority to service hardware requests quickly. The <code>Sleep()</code> function completely halts the execution of the CPU core it is running on (CPU 0 in this case). While CPU 0 is sleeping, it cannot:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Process any other hardware interrupts.</li>
<li>Allow the kernel to schedule other threads.</li>
<li>Update system timers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wtf 2: Time-Sliced Interrupt Processing</strong>
The entire loop is designed to run for an extended period, processing events in batches. It's effectively a poorly designed task scheduler running inside an interrupt handler, capable of holding a CPU core hostage for potentially seconds at a time.</p>

<p dir="auto">These notifications (<code>0xD1</code>, <code>0xD2</code>, etc.) are hardware-specific signals that tell the NVIDIA driver to re-evaluate its power state, which is what triggers the futile <code>_PS0/_DOS/_PS3</code> power-cycling sequence seen in the traces.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here's where a simple but catastrophic oversight in the firmware's logic causes system-wide failure. High-end ASUS gaming laptops feature a MUX (Multiplexer) switch, a piece of hardware that lets the user choose between two distinct graphics modes:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Optimus Mode:</strong> The power-saving default. The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is physically connected to the display. The powerful NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) only renders demanding applications when needed, passing finished frames to the iGPU to be drawn on screen.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate/Mux Mode:</strong> The high-performance mode. The MUX switch physically rewires the display connections, bypassing the iGPU entirely and wiring the NVIDIA dGPU directly to the screen. In this mode, the dGPU is not optional; it is the <strong>only</strong> graphics processor capable of outputting an image.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Any firmware managing this hardware <strong>must</strong> be aware of which mode the system is in. Sending a command intended for one GPU to the other is futile and, in some cases, dangerous. Deep within the ACPI code, a hardware status flag named <code>HGMD</code> is used to track this state. To understand the flaw, we first need to decipher what <code>HGMD</code> means, and the firmware itself gives us the key.</p>

<p dir="auto">For screen brightness to work, the command must be sent to the GPU that is physically controlling the display backlight. A command sent to the wrong GPU will simply do nothing. Therefore, the brightness control method (<code>BRTN</code>) <em>must</em> be aware of the MUX switch state to function at all. It is the firmware's own Rosetta Stone.</p>

<p dir="auto">The logic here is flawless and revealing. The code uses the <code>HGMD</code> flag to make a binary decision. If <code>HGMD</code> is <code>0x03</code>, it sends the command to the NVIDIA GPU. If not, it sends it to the Intel GPU. The firmware itself, through this correct implementation, provides the undeniable definition: <strong><code>HGMD == 0x03</code> means the system is in Ultimate/Mux Mode.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">This is the bug. The firmware, despite proving it knows how to check the MUX state, forgets to do so here. It blindly sends a power-management notification to the NVIDIA driver, instructing it to change power states. In MUX mode, this command is nonsensical it's asking the driver to power down the only GPU that is keeping the screen on. This triggers the futile power-cycling, the massive latency spikes, and the system instability.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once again, the firmware prepares to cut power to the discrete GPU without first checking if it's the only GPU driving the displays. This demonstrates that the Mux Mode Confusion is a systemic design flaw. The firmware is internally inconsistent, leading it to issue self-destructive commands that try to cripple the system.</p>

<p dir="auto">Microsoft has a built-in "smooth video" check. It plays HD video in full screen and watches for hiccups. If the PC drops frames, crackles, or any driver pauses for more than a few milliseconds, it fails. That’s Microsoft’s baseline for what "smooth" should look like.</p>

<p dir="auto">ASUS firmware is causing millisecond-long pauses. Those pauses are exactly the kind that make this test fail i.e., the same stutters and audio pops regular users notice on YouTube/Netflix and games; this firmware violates fundemental standards.</p>

<li><strong>Logical Proof:</strong> The code lacks critical checks for the laptop's hardware state (MUX mode).</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Proof:</strong> The issue is reproducible across different models and BIOS versions.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Until a fix is implemented, millions of buyers of Asus laptops from approx. 2021 to present day are facing stutters on the simplest of tasks, such as watching YouTube, for the simple mistake of using a sleep call inside of an inefficient interrupt handler and not checking the GPU environment properly.</p>

<p>C++ has often and frequently been criticized for its complexity, steep learning curve, and most of all for its ability to allow the developers using it to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but to blow off their whole leg in the process. But do these criticisms hold up under scrutiny?</p>
<p>Well, in this blog post, I aim to tackle some of the most common criticisms of C++ and provide a balanced perspective on its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-complex">C++ is “Complex”</h2>
<p>C++ is indeed a complex language, with a vast array of features and capabilities. For any one thing you wish to achieve in C++, there are about a dozen different ways to do it, each with its own trade-offs and implications. So, as a developer, how are you to know which approach is the best one for your specific use case? Surely you have to have a deep understanding of the language to make these decisions, right?</p>
<p><strong>Not really…</strong> I mean, don’t get me wrong, it helps, but it’s not a hard requirement. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, and in C++, you can write perfectly fine code without ever needing to worry about the more complex features of the language. You can write simple, readable, and maintainable code in C++ without ever needing to use templates, operator overloading, or any of the other more advanced features of the language.</p>
<p>There’s this idea that for everything you want to do in any programming language, you need to use the most efficient and correct approach possible. Python has this with their pythonic way of doing things, Java has this, C# has this, and Go has this. Heck, even something as simple as painting HTML onto a browser needs to be reinvented every couple of years and argued about ad nauseam. Here’s the thing, though, in most cases, there is no one right way to do something. The hallowed “best approach” is often just a matter of personal or team preference. The idea that if you just write your code in the “best” and correct way, you’ll never need to worry about maintaining it is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t worry so much about using the “best” approach; worry more about writing code that is easy to read and understand. If you do that, you’ll be fine.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-outdated">C++ is “Outdated”</h2>
<p>C++ is very old, in fact, it came out in 1985, to put it into perspective, that’s 4 years before the first version of Windows was released, and 6 years before the first version of Linux came out, or to drive the point even further home, back when the last 8-bit computer was released. So yes, C++ is quite old by any standard. But does that make it outdated?</p>
<p><strong>Hell no</strong> it’s not like C++ has just been sitting around unchanged from its 1985 release. C++ has been actively developed and improved upon for over 40 years now, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. The most recent version of the C++ standard, C++20, was released in 2020 and introduced a number of new features and improvements to the language. C++23 has introduced significant enhancements, particularly in the standard library and constexpr capabilities. Notably, concepts, ranges, and coroutines have been expanded, bringing modern programming paradigms to C++ and making the language more powerful and expressive th
an ever before.</p>
<p><strong>But Dave, what we mean by outdated is that other languages have surpassed C++ and provide a better developer experience.</strong></p>
<p>Matter of personal taste, I guess, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages with a huge ecosystem of libraries and tools. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from game development to high-performance computing to embedded systems. Many of the most popular and widely used software applications in the world are written in C++.</p>
<p>I don’t think C++ is outdated by any stretch of the imagination; you have to bend the definition of outdated quite a bit to make that claim.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-unsafe">C++ is “Unsafe”</h2>
<p>Ah, finally, we get to the big one, and yes, I will draw comparisons to Rust as it’s the “memory safe” language that a lot of people claim will or should replace C++.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, let’s get the main point out of the way right now.</strong></p>
<h3 id="rewrites-of-c-codebases-to-rust-always-yield-more-memory-safe-results-than-before">Rewrites of C++ codebases to Rust always yield more memory-safe results than before.</h3>
<p>Countless companies have cited how they improved their security or the amount of reported bugs or memory leaks by simply rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust.</p>
<p><strong>Now is that because of Rust?</strong> I’d argue in some small part, yes. However, I think the biggest factor is that any rewrite of an existing codebase is going to yield better results than the original codebase.</p>
<p>When you rewrite a codebase, you have the opportunity to rethink and redesign the architecture, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the code. You get to leverage all the lessons learned from the previous implementation, all the issues that were found and fixed, and you already know about. All the headaches that would be too much of a pain to fix in the existing codebase, you can just fix them in the new one.</p>
<p>Imagine if you will that you’ve built a shed, it was a bit wobbly, and you didn’t really understand proper wood joinery when you first built it, so it has a few other issues, like structural integrity and a leaky roof. After a few years, you build a new one, and this time you know all the mistakes you made the first time around, so you build it better, stronger, and more weatherproof. In the process, you decide to replace the materials you’ve previously used, say for example, instead of using maple, you opt for oak. Is it correct to say that the new shed is better only because you used oak instead of maple? Or is that a really small part of the overall improvement?</p>
<p>That’s how I feel when I see these companies claim that rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust has made them more memory safe. It’s not because of Rust, it’s because they took the time to rethink and redesign their codebase and implemented all the lessons learned from the previous implementation.</p>
<h3 id="but-that-does-not-deny-the-fact-that-c-is-unsafe">But that does not deny the fact that C++ is unsafe.</h3>
<p>Yes, C++ can be unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. But here’s the thing: all programming languages are unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. You can write unsafe code in Rust, you can write unsafe code in Python, you can write unsafe code in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Memory safety is just one aspect of safety in programming languages; you can still write unsafe code in memory-safe programming languages. Just using Rust will not magically make your application safe; it will just make it a lot harder to have memory leaks or safety issues.</p>
<p>The term “unsafe” is a bit too vague in this context, and I think it’s being used as a catch-all term, which to me reeks of marketing speak.</p>
<h3 id="can-c-be-made-safer">Can C++ be made safer?</h3>
<p>Yes, C++ can be made safer; in fact, it can even be made memory safe. There are a number of libraries and tools available that can help make C++ code safer, such as smart pointers, static analysis tools, and memory sanitizers. Heck, if you wish, you can even add a garbage collector to C++ if you really want to(please don’t).</p>
<p>But the easiest and most straightforward way to make C++ safer is to simply learn about smart pointers and use them wherever necessary. Smart pointers are a way to manage memory in C++ without having to manually allocate and deallocate memory. They automatically handle the memory management for you, making it much harder to have memory leaks or dangling pointers. This is the main criticism of C++ in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-hard-to-read">C++ is Hard to Read</h2>
<p>Then don’t write it that way. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language; you can write procedural code, object-oriented code, functional code, or a mix of all three. You can write simple and readable code in C++ if you want to. You can also write complex and unreadable code in C++ if you want to. It’s all about personal or team preference.</p>
<p>Here’s a rule of thumb I like to follow for C++: make it look as much like C as you possibly can, and avoid using too many advanced features of the language unless you really need to. Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers, and use the standard library wherever possible.</p>
<p>You can do a heck of a lot of programming by just using C++ as you would C and introducing complexity only when you really need to.</p>
<h3 id="but-doesnt-that-defeat-the-whole-purpose-of-c-why-not-just-use-c-then">But doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of C++? Why not just use C then?</h3>
<p>C++ is a superset of C you can write C code in C++, and it will work just fine. C++ adds a lot of features and capabilities to C. If you were to start with C, then you are locked with C, and that’s fine for a lot of cases, don’t get me wrong, but C++ gives you the option to use more advanced features of the language when you need them. You can start with C and then gradually introduce C++ features as you need them. You don’t have to use all the features of C++ if you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Again, going back to my shed analogy, if you build a shed out of wood, you can always add a metal roof later if you need to. You don’t have to build the whole shed out of metal if you don’t want to.</p>
<h2 id="c-has-a-confusing-ecosystem">C++ has a confusing ecosystem</h2>
<p>C++ has a large ecosystem built over the span of 40 years or so, with a lot of different libraries and tools available. This can make it difficult to know which libraries and tools to use for a specific task. But this is not unique to C++; every programming language has this problem.</p>
<p>Again, the simple rule of thumb is to use the standard library wherever possible; it’s well-maintained and has a lot of useful features. For other tasks like networking or GUI development, there are a number of well-known libraries that are widely used and well-maintained. Do some research and find out which libraries are best suited for your specific use case.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid boost like the plague.</strong> Boost is a large collection of libraries that are widely used in the C++ community. However, many of the libraries in boost are outdated and no longer maintained. They also tend to be quite complex and difficult to use. If you can avoid using boost, do so.</p>
<p>Unless you are writing a large and complex application that requires the specific features provided by Boost, you are better off using other libraries that are more modern and easier to use. Do not add the performance overhead and binary size bloat of Boost to your application unless you really need to.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-not-a-good-choice-for-beginners">C++ is not a good choice for beginners</h2>
<p>Programming is not a good choice for beginners, woodworking is not a good choice for beginners, and car mechanics is not a good choice for beginners. Programming is hard; it takes time and effort to learn, as all things do. There is no general language that is really good for beginners; everything has its trade-offs.</p>
<p>Fact is, if you wanna get into something like <strong>systems programming or game development</strong> then starting with Python or JavaScript won’t really help you much. You will eventually need to learn C or C++.</p>
<p>If your goal is to become a web developer or data scientist, then start with Python or JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you just want a job in the programming industry, I don’t know, learn Java or C#, both great languages that get a lot of undeserved hate, but offer a lot of job opportunities.</p>
<p>Look, here’s the thing: if you’re just starting out in programming, yeah, it’s gonna be hard no matter what language you choose. I’d actually argue that starting with C or C++ is far better than starting with something that obscures a lot of the underlying concepts of programming, I’d argue further that by starting with Python or Javascript you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run and trading off the pain of learning something when your understanding of a topic is still fresh and malleable for the pain of learning something later when you have a lot more invested in your current understanding of programming.</p>
<p>But hey, that’s just my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-rust-friends-or-rivals">C++ vs Rust: Friends or Rivals?</h2>
<p>Rust has earned a lot of love in recent years, and for good reason. It takes memory safety seriously, and its borrow checker enforces discipline that C++ often leaves to the programmer. That said, Rust is still building its ecosystem, and the learning curve can feel just as steep — just in different ways. C++ may not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, but it gives you decades of battle-tested tooling, compilers, and libraries that power everything from Chrome to Unreal Engine. In practice, many teams use Rust and C++ together rather than treating them as enemies. Rust shines in new projects where safety is the priority, while C++ continues to dominate legacy systems and performance-critical domains.</p>
<h2 id="is-c-still-used-in-2025">Is C++ Still Used in 2025?</h2>
<p>The short answer: absolutely. Despite the constant chatter that it’s outdated, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. Major browsers like Chrome and Firefox are still written in it. Game engines like Unreal run on it. Automotive systems, financial trading platforms, and even AI frameworks lean heavily on C++ for performance and control. New standards (C++20, C++23) keep modernizing the language, ensuring it stays competitive with younger alternatives. If you peel back the layers of most large-scale systems we rely on daily, you’ll almost always find C++ humming away under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has stood the test of time. While it does have its complexities and challenges, it remains a relevant and widely used language in today’s tech landscape.
With the right approach and mindset, C++ can be a joy to work with and can yield high-performance and efficient applications. So next time you hear someone criticize C++, take a moment to consider the strengths and capabilities of this venerable language before dismissing it outright.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter">https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45266039">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework</a> desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-385.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max APU</a>, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.</p>
<p>The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.</p>
<p>As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x15-pwm">NF-A12x25</a> fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures – you can <a href="https://noctua.at/en/noctua-cooling-enhancements-to-framework-desktop">read more about this here</a>. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_intake_fan_duct.jpg" alt="Framework Desktop PC Fan Intake Noctua Designed Duct" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition</a> power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_3D_print_intake_fan_grill_installation.jpg" alt="3D printed Noctua Signature grill sidepanel for Framework PC" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/Framework_desktop_fan_grill_comparison.jpg" alt="Stock vs Noctua Framework Desktop grill temperature comparison" width="650" height="451"></p>
<p>While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.</p>
<p>Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at <a href="https://www.printables.com/@Noctua/models">Printables.com</a> for you to 3D-print at home:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1368249-framework-desktop-custom-fan-duct">Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_3D_printing_intake_fan_grill_sidepanel.jpg" alt="3D printing the Noctua grill Framework PC sidepanel" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a8-pwm">NF-A8 PWM</a> fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it’s not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/Noctua_NF-A8_and_NF-A12x25_G2_fans.jpg" alt="Noctua NF-A8 and NF-A12x25 G2 fans" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>While upgrading to an <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the „G1“ fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_3D_print_intake_fan_grill.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the <a href="https://frame.work/si/en/desktop">Framework Desktop’s</a> cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.</p>

<p>It was the turn of the millenium when I got my first computer fresh at university.  Windows seemed uninteresting, it was impossible to work out how it worked or write programs for it.  SuSE Linux 6.2 was much more interesting to try and opened a world of understanding how computers worked and wanting to code on them.  These were the days of the .com boom and I went to big expos in London where they showered you with freebies and IBM competed with SuSE and Red Hat for the biggest stall.  IBM said that Linux had made it on the server and now was going to take over the desktop so I realised that working with KDE would be a good idea.  And as a novice coder it was very perfect for learning Qt and how open development worked and I loved the free software ideals.  Going to the pre-Akademy conference (it was called Kastle then) in Nove Hrady was a great intro to the community in person and in some ways I learnt more about software development in a week there then my years at uni.</p>



<p>So clearly this was a good way to make a career.  I dossed around for a year until the Quaker geek collective heard tale of an African Spaceman who was funding a new Linux distro called SSDS (Shuttleworth’s Super Secret Debian Startup) so I got into Debian packaging and made a point that KDE should be involved.  Before long they came knocking and I went to the first Ubuntu conference in Australia.  I spent about ten amazing years brining KDE to Ubuntu or bringing Ubuntu to KDE for what was already called Kubuntu (not my name choice), a successful community project I’m really proud of.  At one point Nokia wanted to use it alongside Plasma Active to sell on a tablet thing along with phones, this could well have taken over the world but y’know, iPhone happened and Kubuntu never found a commercial use after that although it still gets used in big places like Google or the City of Munich or Weta digital (watch those Hobbit DVD extras).  I loved being invited out to Nigeria or India to give talks and spread the world of open software.  Looking back there’s probably a million business cases that would have been possible but I’m not the best at being a future visionary.  Eventually Canonical decided to stop funding it which is fair enough.  </p>



<p>But then Blue Systems came along, another nice guy with deep pockets wanting to help and we carried on.  When Canonical decided to kill off lots of community projects we came up with the idea of moving directly into KDE to make KDE neon.  It has always been crazy how open source communities like KDE are reliant on separate companies to take their software out to the world so we wanted to change that, and I like to think we succeeded.  Using CI systems we could create a much more manageable setup.  Still the system was never as resiliant as it should have been and several times KDE neon ended up shipping a duff update which will have been very painful for users.  We had three people working full time on it at the start but before long it was just me and a volunteer and the quality suffered as a result.</p>



<p>Last winter I drove to the Blue Systems schoße for a routine conference and was organising people to give talks when the guy who pays us started off by saying he was dying and the company would be shutting down.  Which was very sad but it makes sense to end it on a high.  After years of having no business modal and not knowing what the aims of the company were, which caused several people to genuinely go mad, we finally had a business model of sorts with Valve paying us to make Plasma up to the standards needed to ship it as Desktop Scope on the Valve Steam Deck games console.  Nate had been given advanced notice of the company shutting down and had already started another company, Tech Paladin, to take on the business.  Shouldn’t this be run as a cooperative we wondered?  No that was too complex he said.  The next day I ended up at a funeral for some German accountants and when I came back there had been some more discussion and we watched a video about Igalia who make the other operating system for Valve.  They are a cooperative socialist paradise and Nate said he’d look into doing that instead of the setup where he had full control and all the profit.  It was clear there was to be no other discussion on the matter of our future.</p>



<p>A few weeks later we had an online meeting where I proposed a useful agenda but was ignored, instead Nate gave his updated plan for a business which was to give Dave a slice of the profit and otherwise he’d keep all the profit and all the control.  So I gave my proposal I’d been working on for a company with equal ownership, equal profit, a management structure and workers rights.  A couple weeks later we had anther video call but Nate called me first and told me I’d be excluded from it.  No explanation was given beyond I had “made some comments and would not be happy”.  If someone is telling you what your emotions that is when controlling behaviour starts to become abusive.  And thus ended my 25 years with KDE.</p>



<p>And what of my colleagues?  Surely they wouldn’t want a setup where they have no control over their professional life and all their profit goes to one person?  Well dunno, they’ve stopped speaking to me.  Nothing.  Silence.  Nil.  Not so much as a “cheereo”, nor “sorry we chose the option were you got excluded” and certainly no explanation.  From people who I have worked with for some twenty years in some cases that hurts.  I don’t know why they stopped talking to me, I can only speculate and I don’t want to do that.</p>



<p>We never had workers rights at Blue Systems, we were all on self employment contracts.  This will continue at Tech Paladin.  It is illegal but unenforceable when done on an international setup.  But employment rights are not a luxury you can chose to do without if you enjoy your job and want some more flexibility in your work day.  They are fundamental and life altering rights that change people’s lives as I discovered when my adopted children were taken away from me.  Nobody should be doing business with or taking money from Tech Paladin else be party to illegal workers rights abuses.</p>



<p>Then I started to get sad, being cut off from my life for the last 25 years was too much for me.  All things come to an end and I’ve seen plenty people had to leave KDE because the money ran out or maybe they had a disagreement with someone in the project, but never a profiteering control struggle like this.  I struggled to get out of bed on some days.  I’ve given my life to KDE, I’ve seen it gone from a sure fire project to take over the world to being one open desktop project in a world of many to seeing the revival in recent years where we can honestly say we make some of the best software out there.  I like to think I’ve been part of keeping it alive, progressing, relevant and at the forefront of commercial, government and community usage.  It’s been an amazing ride full of opportunities and adventures the likes of which I’m sure my peers from my university course have never had.</p>



<p>But in the end I lost my friends, my colleagues, my job, my career and my family.  What’s a spod who just tried to do the right thing for society to do?  Dunno.  For now, if you want me, you can find me surfing the endless wave whenever the sun sets over my digital nomad coliving paddleshack at the end of the world.</p>

      <p>Denmark has effectively eliminated infections with the two biggest cancer-causing strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) since the vaccine was introduced in 2008, data suggests.</p><p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820"><em>Eurosurveillance</em></a>, could have implications for how vaccinated populations are screened in the coming years – particularly as people increasingly receive vaccines that protect against multiple high-risk types of HPV virus.</p><h3>Deadly cancer</h3><p>After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years in Europe, and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause.</p><p>At least 14 high-risk types of the virus have been identified, and before Denmark introduced the HPV vaccine in 2008, HPV types 16 and 18 accounted for around three quarters (74%) of cervical cancers in the country.</p><p>Initially, girls were offered a vaccine that protected against four types of HPV: 16, 18, plus the lower risk types 6 and 11. However, since 2017, Danish girls have been offered a vaccine that protects against nine types of HPV – including those accounting for approximately 90% of cervical cancers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To better understand the impact that these vaccination programmes have had on HPV prevalence as vaccinated girls reach cervical screening age (23 to 64 years in Denmark), Dr Mette Hartmann Nonboe at Zealand University Hospital in Nykøbing Falster and colleagues analysed up to three consecutive cervical cell samples collected from Danish women between 2017 and 2024, when they were 22 to 30 years of age.</p><p>“In 2017, one of the first birth cohorts of women in Denmark who were HPV-vaccinated as teenage girls in 2008 reached the screening age of 23 years,” Nonboe explained.</p><p>“Compared with previous generations, these women are expected to have a considerably lower risk of cervical cancer, and it is pertinent to assess [their] future need for screening.”</p><h3>High-risk HPV elimination</h3><p>The research found that infection with the high-risk HPV types (HPV16/18) covered by the vaccine has been almost eliminated.&nbsp;</p><p>“Before vaccination, the prevalence of HPV16/18 was between 15 and 17%, which has decreased in vaccinated women to less than one percent by 2021,” the researchers said.</p><p>In addition, prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women who had not been vaccinated against HPV was five percent. This strongly suggests that the vaccine has reduced the circulation of these HPV types in general population, to the extent that even unvaccinated women are now less likely to be infected with them – so called “population immunity” – the researchers said.</p><p>Despite this good news, roughly one third of women screened during the study period still had infection with high-risk HPV types not covered by the original vaccines – and new infections with these types were more frequent among vaccinated women, compared to unvaccinated ones.</p><p>This is expected to fall once girls who received the more recent ‘nine-valent’ vaccine reach screening age. At this point, the screening guidelines should potentially be reconsidered, Nonboe and colleagues said.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has removed a study showing that white supremacist and far-right violence “continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism” in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>The study, which was conducted by the National Institute of Justice and hosted on a DOJ website was available there at least until September 12, 2025, according to an archive of the page saved by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250911165140/https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/306123.pdf"><u>Wayback Machine</u></a>. Daniel Malmer, a PhD student studying online extremism at UNC-Chapel Hill, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/malmer.com/post/3lypvmsr2qc2u?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">first noticed</a> the paper was deleted. </p><p>“The Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs is currently reviewing its websites and materials in accordance with recent Executive Orders and related guidance,” reads a message on the page where the study was formerly hosted. “During this review, some pages and publications will be unavailable.

Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>We’ll partner with SFO to prepare our operations at the airport in phases, beginning with employee testing soon ahead of welcoming Bay Area riders. Pickups and dropoffs will initially start at SFO’s Kiss &amp; Fly area – a short AirTrain ride from the terminals – with the intention to explore other locations at the airport in the future.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone that strengthens Waymo’s impact on the region and offers residents and visitors an innovative way to travel. With years of experience serving riders at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and operations beginning soon at San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), we’re accelerating our efforts to serve more airports in more cities as we scale.</p>
<p>“Across San Francisco, we are expanding safe, reliable, and modern transportation options—supporting our city’s economic comeback, boosting our tourism industry, and connecting residents and visitors to everything our city has to offer,” said Mayor Lurie. “We announced in March that we wanted visitors to be able to ride in a Waymo as soon as they arrived in San Francisco, and today, we are taking another important step to get there.”</p>
<p>“Bringing the Waymo experience to San Francisco International Airport is about more than just a ride—it’s about providing a safe, reliable, magical way for Bay Area residents and global visitors to connect with the places and people that matter most,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “We’re grateful for the partnership with SFO and the vision of Mayor Lurie in making this a reality.”</p>

We’ll begin fully autonomous testing this fall and intend to offer a commercial service to riders later this year. SJC will be the second international airport where we operate fully autonomously – and the first in California – building on the success of our service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.</p>
<p>“It’s the perfect time for Waymo’s autonomous vehicles to begin to roll into San José, the Capital of Silicon Valley,” San José Mayor Matt Mahan. “For decades, our region has shaped the future — and Waymo embodies our region’s spirit of innovation. With San José at the epicenter of the biggest sporting events of 2026, Waymo is an ideal mode of transportation that will help visitors move around the area smoothly and safely.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to offering fully autonomous rides at San José Mineta International Airport terminals in the future,” said Annabel Chang, Head of U.S. State and Local Public Policy, Waymo. “Waymo was born in Silicon Valley, and our testing and eventual commercial deployment at the airport will help us offer a valuable service to travelers in San Jose and more of the Bay Area, as we help keep innovation on the move.”</p>

<p>We’ll arrive with a mixed fleet of Jaguar I-PACE with the 5th-generation Waymo Driver and Zeekr RT vehicles equipped with our 6th-generation Waymo Driver. Our next-generation system is informed by years of winter weather experience across Michigan, upstate New York, and the Sierra Nevada and engineered to autonomously sustain operations in harsher climates.</p>

We welcome Waymo to Colorado.”</p>
<p>“Whether they need a ride to work, school, the farmer’s market, or they’re heading out for a night on the town, Waymo is a great way for Denverites to get where they’re going safely,” said Mayor Mike Johnston. “Waymo’s innovative, climate-friendly technology will not only make our streets safer but cleaner, and I can’t wait for my first ride.”</p>

We’re excited to open our doors to the broader Seattle metropolitan area and offer a new way to get around. Washington State, and many of its municipalities, have been early leaders in autonomous vehicle (AV) testing as they develop their framework for AV operations.  </p>
<p>We’ve spent years getting to know the area —from communities around the Lake to its notoriously wet weather. This experience has been vital in helping us serve riders rain or shine in cities across the country. We’re eager to bring that same safe, accessible, and sustainable service to you.</p>
<p>As we work to create a path forward for autonomous operations, we’re deepening our relationships with the local community.</p>
<p>“The Epilepsy Foundation Washington applauds Waymo’s expansion to Seattle. Safe, reliable transportation is one of the greatest challenges for people with epilepsy,” said Kevin Koppes, Executive Director, Epilepsy Foundation Washington. “For many, the inability to drive limits independence, access to employment, and participation in other activities. Waymo’s commitment to growing autonomous vehicle services creates new opportunities for greater freedom and inclusion, and we are excited about the positive impact this will have on the epilepsy community.”</p>

Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>We’ll partner with SFO to prepare our operations at the airport in phases, beginning with employee testing soon ahead of welcoming Bay Area riders. Pickups and dropoffs will initially start at SFO’s Kiss &amp; Fly area – a short AirTrain ride from the terminals – with the intention to explore other locations at the airport in the future.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone that strengthens Waymo’s impact on the region and offers residents and visitors an innovative way to travel. With years of experience serving riders at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and operations beginning soon at San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), we’re accelerating our efforts to serve more airports in more cities as we scale.</p>
<p>“Across San Francisco, we are expanding safe, reliable, and modern transportation options—supporting our city’s economic comeback, boosting our tourism industry, and connecting residents and visitors to everything our city has to offer,” said Mayor Lurie. “We announced in March that we wanted visitors to be able to ride in a Waymo as soon as they arrived in San Francisco, and today, we are taking another important step to get there.”</p>
<p>“Bringing the Waymo experience to San Francisco International Airport is about more than just a ride—it’s about providing a safe, reliable, magical way for Bay Area residents and global visitors to connect with the places and people that matter most,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “We’re grateful for the partnership with SFO and the vision of Mayor Lurie in making this a reality.”</p>

We’ll begin fully autonomous testing this fall and intend to offer a commercial service to riders later this year. SJC will be the second international airport where we operate fully autonomously – and the first in California – building on the success of our service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.</p>
<p>“It’s the perfect time for Waymo’s autonomous vehicles to begin to roll into San José, the Capital of Silicon Valley,” San José Mayor Matt Mahan. “For decades, our region has shaped the future — and Waymo embodies our region’s spirit of innovation. With San José at the epicenter of the biggest sporting events of 2026, Waymo is an ideal mode of transportation that will help visitors move around the area smoothly and safely.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to offering fully autonomous rides at San José Mineta International Airport terminals in the future,” said Annabel Chang, Head of U.S. State and Local Public Policy, Waymo. “Waymo was born in Silicon Valley, and our testing and eventual commercial deployment at the airport will help us offer a valuable service to travelers in San Jose and more of the Bay Area, as we help keep innovation on the move.”</p>

We’re excited to open our doors to the broader Seattle metropolitan area and offer a new way to get around. Washington State, and many of its municipalities, have been early leaders in autonomous vehicle (AV) testing as they develop their framework for AV operations.  </p>
<p>We’ve spent years getting to know the area —from communities around the Lake to its notoriously wet weather. This experience has been vital in helping us serve riders rain or shine in cities across the country. We’re eager to bring that same safe, accessible, and sustainable service to you.</p>
<p>As we work to create a path forward for autonomous operations, we’re deepening our relationships with the local community.</p>
<p>“The Epilepsy Foundation Washington applauds Waymo’s expansion to Seattle. Safe, reliable transportation is one of the greatest challenges for people with epilepsy,” said Kevin Koppes, Executive Director, Epilepsy Foundation Washington. “For many, the inability to drive limits independence, access to employment, and participation in other activities. Waymo’s commitment to growing autonomous vehicle services creates new opportunities for greater freedom and inclusion, and we are excited about the positive impact this will have on the epilepsy community.”</p>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, one of the great intellectuals of his generation, was known by most as the founder of analytic philosophy, but he was actually a man of many talents: a pioneering mathematician, an accomplished logician, a tireless activist, a respected historian, and a Nobel Prize-winning writer, to name but a handful. When he wrote this principled letter at the beginning of 1962, Russell was 89 years old and clearly still a man of morals who stood firm in his beliefs. Its recipient was Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, a man most famous for founding, in 1932, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>.</p>

<article><header>The Letter</header><div>
<p>22 January 1962</p>



<p>Sir Oswald Mosley,<br>5, Lowndes Court,<br>Lowndes Square,<br>London, S.W.1.</p>



<p>Dear Sir Oswald,</p>



<p>Thank you for your letter and for your enclosures. I have given some thought to our recent correspondence. It is always difficult to decide on how to respond to people whose ethos is so alien and, in fact, repellent to one’s own. It is not that I take exception to the general points made by you but that every ounce of my energy has been devoted to an active opposition to cruel bigotry, compulsive violence, and the sadistic persecution which has characterised the philosophy and practice of fascism.</p>



<p>I feel obliged to say that the emotional universes we inhabit are so distinct, and in deepest ways opposed, that nothing fruitful or sincere could ever emerge from association between us.</p>



<p>I should like you to understand the intensity of this conviction on my part. It is not out of any attempt to be rude that I say this but because of all that I value in human experience and human achievement.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Bertrand Russell</p>

            <p>Last week, I went on an adventure through the electromagnetic spectrum!</p>

<p>It’s like an invisible world that always surrounds us, and allows us to do many amazing things: It’s how radio and TV are transmitted, it’s how we communicate using Wi-Fi or our phones. And there are many more things to discover there, from all over the world.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll show you fifty things you can find there – all you need is this simple USB dongle and an antenna kit!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/ed1513b2b350229a.jpeg" alt="The device looks like a big USB stick with a bronze screw connector at the back end. It's labelled &quot;RTL-SDR Blog V4&quot;." title="The device looks like a big USB stick with a bronze screw connector at the back end. It's labelled &quot;RTL-SDR Blog V4&quot;."></p>

<h2 id="the-make-50-of-something-technique">The “Make 50 of Something” technique</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, I heard about the “Make 50 of Something” technique in Vi Hart’s <a href="https://github.com/vihart/fiftyfizzbuzzes/blob/master/Fifty%20Fizzbuzzes.ipynb">Fifty Fizzbuzzes</a>. Since then, I’ve already made <a href="https://blinry.org/50-tic80-carts/">fifty programs for the fantasy console TIC-80</a> in one weekend in 2021.</p>

<p>I found that a very exciting experience – trying to make so many new things really pushed me to leave my comfort zone, to be creative, and not to get sucked into rabbit holes too deep.</p>

<p>I knew I definitely wanted to try the technique again. So, when I took a week of vacation, I decided to try to find 50 things to do with a Software Defined Radio!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-sdr">What is an SDR?</h2>

<p>A Software Defined Radio is essentially a radio that relies on a computer to do most of its data processing. It doesn’t rely on analog hardware too much – instead, most of what is does is “defined in software”, hence the name.</p>

<p>Usually, SDRs can detect electromagnetic waves in a much wider range than a common FM radio, which makes it especially exciting! I got interested in SDRs after reading about <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/rtl-sdr-expansion-card/37098/15">Albert’s project</a> to build one as a module for the Framework laptop!</p>

<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>

<p>I went into this week without much knowledge of the things I’d find. I’d read through a introductory course for aspiring amateur radio operators (more on that later), but I barely knew which way to point my antenna.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, this section is intended to help you get started!</p>

<p>Most of the 50 things also have a little infobox at the beginning, explaining the frequencies, and some special knowledge needed to receive them.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>I looked into the topic a bit, and a popular, cheap SDR right now is the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-blog-v4-dongle-initial-release/"><em>RTL-SDR Blog V4</em></a>, which has the form factor of a simple SUB dongle. You can get it for around $30, or as a kit with telescopic antennas for $50.</p>

<p>Everything I tried during this week was done using this USB dongle, the antenna kit, and a long piece of wire!</p>

<p>(By the way, there’s another great option if you don’t want to buy anything – lots of people make their SDR accessible through the Internet! You can find a map <a href="https://rx-tx.info/map-sdr-points">here</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="using-the-antennas">Using the antennas</h3>

<p>I tried to adjust my antenna to the desired frequencies as best as I could. I think for receiving, it’s not super important that your antenna is perfectly configured, though.</p>

<p>For most applications, I used the dipole antennas that came with the kit I purchased. Dipole antennas have two sides that stick out the same length. You generally wanna make the whole antenna half as long as the wave length you want to receive, and orient it vertically.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb was to divide 72 by the frequency in MHz, and take that as the length of each side of the dipole in meters. That’d make the whole antenna a bit shorter than half of the wavelength.</p>

<p>For example, this is what the configuration looked like for frequencies around 100 MHz:</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/e7c6048323389ceb.jpg" alt="A 1.4 m long, two sided antenna, attached to my window." title="A 1.4 m long, two sided antenna, attached to my window."></p>

<p>And for higher frequencies, I used the tiny screw-on antennas from the kit:</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/6476ab30f0d233df.jpg" alt="The antennas are only a couple of centimeters long." title="The antennas are only a couple of centimeters long."></p>

<p>For specific applications like receiving satellites, or receiving locators for airplanes, I used special configurations, but I’ll discuss these as we go!</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>The software I liked best, and which I used for many things, was <a href="https://www.sdrpp.org/">SDR++</a>. It allows you to explore the frequency spectrum very smoothly, and has a modern user interface!</p>

<p>But I also used plenty of other software, on Linux in my case. I’ll link to the software as needed below.</p>

<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>

<p>On Monday morning, I was excited to start this project! I sat down at my desk, and got to work!</p>

<h3 id="listen-to-fm-radio">1: Listen to FM radio</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 87.5-108 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> FM (“frequency modulation”)</li>
</ul>

<p>This as an obvious first thing to do, as the signals are very strong! I was using the SDR++ software, and it felt very nice browsing around and discovering the stations around me! It reminded me of exploring the radio as a child.</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/545dc74004d1946b.mp4" controls=""></video>

<p>I found a local station that gives 1-hour slots to civic groups, for example!</p>

<h3 id="listen-to-freenet">2: Listen to Freenet</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 149.01-149.11 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> FM</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a special frequency range in Germany: Anyone is allowed to send there, using licensed devices. There are 6 channels.</p>

<p>I think someone was testing their device there when I listened in. :D I heard a “Hellooo?”, then a “Test, test”, and then a “General call to all stations”. Oh, and shortly after a short transmission on channel 3 in a Slavic-sounding language!</p>

<p>Freenet devices have a range of only a couple of kilometers, so these people must have been pretty close! :O</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/99dc224db1441231.png" alt="A short burst in the waterfall diagram, at 149.05 MHz." title="A short burst in the waterfall diagram, at 149.05 MHz."></p>

<h3 id="receive-weather-conditions-from-airports">3: Receive weather conditions from airports</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Differs by airport, search term is “ATIS”</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> AM</li>
</ul>

<p>While browsing the aviation frequencies, I found this station that reports weather conditions in an endless loop. It seems to be the “Automatic Terminal Information Service” of Hamburg airport!</p>

<p>Thanks to that, I found out that the current air pressure was 1011 hPa! :D</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/ecdd3c2ce2b8da7b.mp4" controls=""></video>

<h3 id="listen-to-airplane-communication">4: Listen to airplane communication</h3>

<p>Listening to “messages not meant for the general public” is <a href="https://www.buzer.de/5_TTDSG.htm">not allowed</a> in Germany, so of course I didn’t do that. And if I had accidentally done that, I wouldn’t be allowed to tell you about it. 🙅</p>

<h3 id="track-aircraft-via-ads-b">5: Track aircraft via ADS-B</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1090 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> ADS-B</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s short for “Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast”. Aircraft send it automatically to be tracked.</p>

<p>For this, I built my first antenna! From wire and and an antenna connector called “SMA”.</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/abc2bb1af1132f58.jpeg" alt="A antenna made from two short wires." title="A antenna made from two short wires."></p>

<p>And it worked! \o/ I decoded the signal using the software <a href="https://www.sdrangel.org/">SDRangel</a>. Fascinating! I saw some big &amp; small airplanes, and even a helicopter!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/0e508ca1be070861.png" alt="Planes around Hamburg on a map, together with a table of their properties." title="Planes around Hamburg on a map, together with a table of their properties."></p>

<h3 id="listen-to-stereo-fm-radio">6: Listen to <em>stereo</em> FM radio</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 87.5-108 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> FM</li>
</ul>

<p>How stereo audio is transmitted is really interesting, because it’s backwards-compatible to receivers that don’t support it:</p>

<p>Here, you see the demodulated audio frequency spectrum, as shown in SDRangel. Below 19k Hz, it’s just mono audio. Then, to mark a stereo station, there’s a constant “pilot tone” at 19k Hz! (Outside of what most humans can hear.)</p>

<p>Then, if you double the frequency of the pilot tone, you can derive the sections where the difference of the left &amp; right channel to the mono channel is transmitted!</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> I’ve been told that instead of what I call “left” and “right” in this diagram, the upper frequencies transmit the <em>difference of the left and right channels</em>! That way, the receiver can calculate the left and right channels from the mono signal (which is, esseutially, the <em>sum</em> of left and right).</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/117da03f9f7ff03c.png" alt="An audio spectrum, with the pilot tone and the frequency ranges marked in blue." title="An audio spectrum, with the pilot tone and the frequency ranges marked in blue."></p>

<h3 id="receive-road-traffic-information">7: Receive road traffic information</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 87.5-108 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>If you <em>triple</em> the frequency of the pilot tone, you get to a range where FM stations transmit small amounts of digital metadata, like the name and genre of the station, and the current song! That’s a protocol called Radio Data System.</p>

<p>This system can also transmit road traffic information! There seemed to be a road closure at “0x64BE”, as decoded by SDRangel.</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/1d19e5388d95bcab.png" alt="Metadata of a station called N-JOY." title="Metadata of a station called N-JOY."></p>

<p>The Federal Highway Research Institute <a href="https://www.bast.de/BASt_2017/DE/Verkehrstechnik/Fachthemen/v2-LCL/location-code-list-start_node.html">publishes</a> an Excel table, where I could look up that this is a town in Lower Saxony!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/dc403604e704fc79.png" alt="An Excel file, with the proper street and town highlighted." title="An Excel file, with the proper street and town highlighted."></p>

<h3 id="listen-to-conversations-on-the-2-meter-amateur-radio-band">8: Listen to conversations on the 2-meter amateur radio band</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 144-146 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> FM</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a frequency range reserved for amateur radio operators – for non-commercial use only. You may send on this band after getting a license.</p>

<p>What I found here is seemingly a conversation circle facilitated by a relay around 15 km away from here – it takes input on a certain frequency, and outputs an amplified copy of it on another frequency! Klaus, Bernd, Jürgen and Horst were talking about antennas, relays, and Windows XP! 😁</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/ba8aecf90d72d5b2.png" alt="An FM signal at 145.75 MHz." title="An FM signal at 145.75 MHz."></p>

<h3 id="listen-to-digital-radio">9: Listen to digital radio</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 174-240 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>The SDRangel software also has a demodulator for Digital Audio Broadcast! :O I continue to be amazed by it!</p>

<p>I think this was the first time I’ve received digital radio via air! I saw so many stations, and I’ve only checked a couple of channels.</p>

<p>The advantage of this digital channel is that there’s no noise. And I even saw a “cover image” in one of the programs!</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/57ee52cbbbfe70d1.mp4" controls=""></video>

<h3 id="listen-to-pmr446">10: Listen to PMR446</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 446.0-446.2 MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> FM</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a frequency range for “Private Mobile Radio”. It’s another of these bands where anyone can transmit using a licensed device!</p>

<p>Not a lot of activity here. I heard “Hello, hellooo!”, “Can you hear me?” and some short transmissions that sounded like a child! :D</p>

<p>There also seemed to be digital transmissions, but I didn’t know how to decode them yet.</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/9138cbe316231071.png" alt="Some speech burts in a noisy waterfall diagram." title="Some speech burts in a noisy waterfall diagram."></p>

<p>The range of PMR446 devices is pretty low (a couple of hundred metres in cities), so again, the people must’ve been close!</p>

<h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2>

<p>After the first day of SDR experiments, I was amazed how much invisible communication is going on around us in the electromagnetic spectrum at the same time!</p>

<p>I posted each of these things <a href="https://chaos.social/@blinry/112036984423655020">on Mastodon</a> as I went, and asked people for suggestions for more things I could receive.</p>

<h3 id="read-your-neighbors-sensors">11: Read your neighbors’ sensors</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 433.05-434.79 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>At 433 MHz, there’s a frequency band for “industrial, scientific and medical” applications. And wow, there was quite a lot of activity nearby!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/00f1744c6d7d5180.png" alt="Short signal bursts in the frequency spectrum, at different frequencies around 433 MHz." title="Short signal bursts in the frequency spectrum, at different frequencies around 433 MHz."></p>

<p>Using the decoder <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a>, I saw two sensors that output the current temperature, humidity, and air pressure!</p>

<p>There were also some “IBIS beacons” flying by, which are used in public transportation, so maybe it’s buses driving by?</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/88f09ea499f9273d.png" alt="Command line output of rtl_433, reporting sensor data." title="Command line output of rtl_433, reporting sensor data."></p>

<p>Later, an “Interlogix Security” device also appeared, reporting “closed switch states” :O</p>

<h3 id="track-ships">12: Track ships!</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 162.025 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>Ships send out their status using AIS (Automatic Identification System). And again, I received <em>a lot</em> of them here in Hamburg! :O</p>

<p>I was especially excited to receive data from the <a href="https://www.stubnitz.com/">MS Stubnitz</a> (a fisher boat that was turned into a culture center/techno club)! It reports its status as “moored”, and its speed as 0.1 knots! :D</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/f99730ce760ad7f9.png" alt="A table of ships, along with a map." title="A table of ships, along with a map."></p>

<p>Again, I used the software SDRangel. Apparently, it can also display a 3D map, but I haven’t figured out how to add 3D models…</p>

<h3 id="detect-gsm-activity">13: Detect GSM activity</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 876-959 MHz, I looked up the specific ranges for Germany <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications#Situation_in_Deutschland">on Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was curious whether you could tell if someone used their phone! So I borrowed a GSM phone, tuned to the correct frequencies, and made some test calls.</p>

<p>What surprised me most: You can kind of “see” the volume at which I was talking!?</p>

<p>In the recording, the three dense bands at the end were when I was humming into the phone at the other end. This only worked in the “receiving” direction.</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/9ef1c5c2fec6053d.mp4" controls=""></video>

<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>

<h3 id="receive-signals-from-a-satellite">14: Receive signals from a satellite!</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 136-138 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent all Tuesday afternoon and evening learning about satellites. The program <a href="https://oz9aec.dk/gpredict/">gpredict</a> is really nice to find out when satellites will pass overhead! I learned a lot, including that one satellite I was trying to receive burned up last week! :D</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/4193c146fe11aac1.png" alt="A map of the Earth, with satellite positions and predictions." title="A map of the Earth, with satellite positions and predictions."></p>

<p>I was super excited when I first received a signal from a NOAA satellite! 🛰️</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/0d64ef01beb64d32.png" alt="A striped signal in a waterfall diagram, at around 137 MHz." title="A striped signal in a waterfall diagram, at around 137 MHz."></p>

<p>But I didn’t manage to decode it properly yet. Maybe my reception was too noisy? I wanted to keep trying, but I had to move on.</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/64de2491fb3d1ae5.png" alt="A noisy image with borders." title="A noisy image with borders."></p>

<h3 id="admire-tetra-signals">15: Admire TETRA signals</h3>

<p>In Germany, the police has switched to an encrypted digital protocol called TETRA.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve seen some interesting talks at CCC events about weaknesses in the decryption, all I wanted to do for now is looking at the pretty signals in SDR++. :3</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/dca4c590f7d2da84.png" alt="Colorful, very orderly strips in a waterfall diagram." title="Colorful, very orderly strips in a waterfall diagram."></p>

<h3 id="listen-to-taxi-dispatchers">16: Listen to taxi dispatchers</h3>

<p>Again, this is communication not meant for the general public.</p>

<p>I didn’t listen to someone dispatching taxis to specific addresses, and you also shouldn’t do that either. 🚕</p>

<p>Stay away from a site called “frequenzdatenbank”!</p>

<h3 id="ponder-mysterious-signals">17: Ponder mysterious signals</h3>

<p>Some of the most fun I had was just browsing frequencies and seeing what I can find! Sometimes, I encountered signals I can’t identify.</p>

<p>For example, at 865-868 MHz, there was a family of slow, continuous, digital signals that made a nice melody when listened to in single-sideband demodulation!</p>

<p>And at 177-180 MHz, there were two very broadband transmissions. Might be TV? But I couldn’t find out what type. (It later turned out that I’d already listened to these signals – it was digital radio, DAB+.)</p>

<p>As I was browsing around for things to receive, I saw on this <a href="https://s1.radiosondy.info/">tracking website</a> that a radiosonde was just launched in Hamburg! SDRangel could decode its transmission! It had climbed to a height of 7 km, and it’s -17 °C there!</p>

<p>I knew that it would eventually burst and fall back to Earth, and that I could try to get to it and find it!</p>

<p>Eventually, it landed in a forest. I hoped I could get to it! What made this adventure more tricky was that my mobile Internet contract ran out while I was on the go, and my battery was also almost empty.</p>

<p>But I made it to the forest, and entered it.</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/4a198ccef135bdf3.jpg" alt="All pictures show me in a swampy forest." title="All pictures show me in a swampy forest."></p>

<p>As I circled the site, I encountered a person in their 60s, with a stubbly beard and a blue wool hat. He was looking in the direction of the crash site, and was holding a smartphone, so I asked him whether he also was looking for the radiosonde.</p>

<p>He was! We looked for it together for half an hour, jumping over small rivers and crawling through the woods, while he gave me a lot of tips related to hunting sondes.</p>

<p>He told me that he had found around 40 of them so far!</p>

<p>Usually, the sondes keep broadcasting after landing, but this one wasn’t. So he quickly guessed that someone else could’ve taken it. Or maybe it landed in the water and died?</p>

<p>Some pictures of the area we searched:</p>

<p>Eventually, we gave up, and walked back to our vehicles. He also is an amateur radio operator, and could answer a couple of questions related to building antennas!</p>

<p>And he was right: Someone had been faster than us! The status <a href="https://radiosondy.info/sonde_archive.php?sondenumber=V2930794">was changed</a>. So in the end, I didn’t find the sonde. But something that might be even better – a friend!</p>

<p>In the 2-meter amateur band, there are certain frequencies for the “Automatic Packet Reporting System”. It’s a bit like IP – packets have a “from” and a “to”. They can also broadcast their position, or weather data.</p>

<p>Some stations seem to announce themselves as repeaters, which probably help forward the packets to increase the range.</p>

<p>And two people seemed to be on a “fieldday”, and broadcasted their location. :D</p>

<p>This was going to be a simple “random wire” antenna, to allow me to get better reception in the lower frequencies, which I’ve omitted so far (because I knew it would be much more fun with a better antenna)!</p>

<p>I measured out 21.6 m of wire (which for ✨magic✨ reasons seem to be a good universal antenna length)…</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/73e5201fdfad8421.png" alt="Green wire spread across a carpet." title="Green wire spread across a carpet."></p>

<p>…directly attached it to the center of another SMA connector…</p>

<p>People on the Internet say that there are many problems with this – that it would be better to have it outside, and that there’s an impedance mismatch between the receiver and the wire.</p>

<p>I could address those problems, but I wanna try how well this works first :)</p>

<p>The German Weather Service broadcasts maritime information throughout the day on various shortwave frequencies.</p>

<p>They use a protocol called RTTY (radioteletype), and it took me a while to decode it. But I found a neat little program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fldigi">“fldigi”</a>: You can pipe audio to it (single side band modulation), and then if you pick the correct settings (see screenshot), it happily transcribes the messages!</p>

<p>Here’s the station weather reports for the Baltic Sea and Northern Sea!</p>

<p>FT8 is quite a new protocol, invented in 2017, and it seems to be super popular right now! It allows you to transmit short messages, and again, people are looking for people to talk to (CQ), saying how well they receive each other, or saying goodbye (73).</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a> software.</p>

<p>But other times, it wouldn’t work at all, and everything would be loud, angry noise. Even in regions where I had better reception before!</p>

<p>Eventually, I found out how to solve that issue – by unplugging my notebook charger. D’oh! :D</p>

<p>In the low frequencies, occasionally, you can hear a short <em>chirp</em>! :D These are caused by ionosondes, scientific instruments which measure the properties of the ionosphere by sweeping a wide frequency spectrum.</p>

<p>Another signal (which I accidentally got in the same screenshot) is a radar system – in this case, according to the Signal Identification Wiki, it’s a <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/CODAR">“CODAR”</a> system, used to measure the motion of water waves and currents along coasts! :O</p>

<p>How do you transmit speech over long distances? You can use “amplitude modulation”, where you change the volume of the carrier frequency to model your audio.</p>

<p>As a side effect, the bands to the sides of the carrier will contain a signal, as well.</p>

<p>One trick is to transmit <em>just</em> those sidebands, which saves power! But you have to “guess” the base frequency when listening. Depending on which part you transmit, this is called “lower side band” or “upper side band”.</p>

<p>SDR++ makes it very easy to play with this! :) Here’s someone from Serbia!</p>

<p>I put my antenna outside, and I could hear <em>a lot</em> of broadcasting stations! On <a href="https://www.short-wave.info/">short-wave.info</a>, you can look up where they are located.</p>

<p>Some stations in China are broadcasting with very high power! Some I could hear were over 7500 km away.</p>

<p>This is the third frequency band I’m aware of where anyone is allowed to transmit – provided that you use a licensed device!</p>

<p>This is a band where my random wire antenna really came in handy. Without it, I would have had a hard time understanding anything. And even with it, transmissions are extremely noisy.</p>

<p>CB radio is used internationally, especially by truck drivers, it seems.</p>

<p>The International Beacon Project runs a network of 18 stations, which take turns transmitting their callsigns at certain frequencies.</p>

<p>Using this system, you can quickly get a sense of how well radio waves are currently propagating to your location. Clever!</p>

<p>I picked up the beacon from southern Finland! You can see its callsign scrolling away in the video. It’s followed by four dashes send with decreasing power. I only heard the first one…</p>

<p>So I used higher frequencies! Russia transmits its “RWM” time signal at 9996 kHz, which beeps every second, with a long beep for the full minute.</p>

<p>Not enough to tell the time, but enough to adjust your wrist watch, I guess!</p>

<p>That evening, an American satellite called NOAA-15 passed right over us, so I thought I’d try again. And this time, I got parts of an image! \o/</p>

<p>This is real-time data! At night, both transmitted images are infrared recordings.</p>

<p>I recorded the FM signal using SDR++, and then decoded the image using <a href="https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/">noaa-apt</a>, which also added country outlines.</p>

<p>Then it hit me: Doppler effect! At the time of the recording, the frequency was around 4250 Hz higher than expected.</p>

<p>After looking up the formula, I calculated a relative speed of 9 km/s! (Which got close to its real speed, 7.5 km/s.)</p>

<p>This project was exhausting, but also joyful – having committed to it, I got in a nice flow state, where I could focus on it for hours.</p>

<p>Often, I thought: “Okay, this is it. I can’t possibly find more things.” But this is the power of the 50 Things technique: I have to keep looking, leave my comfort zone, be creative, try things I otherwise wouldn’t have tried!</p>

<p>In Germany, there’s now DVB-T2, which my hardware doesn’t support in TV mode. And in SDR mode, the bandwidth is too narrow for DVB-T2. But we can scroll over a channel and look at it! :3</p>

<p>Super happy about this! I got both the name of the satellite, as well as its callsign at the end, and what seems to be some kind of greeting? I later learned that <code>ES</code> is Morse code shorthand for “and”, and that Manfred and Christa Fuchs were the founders of a company that helped launch the satellite!</p>

<p>(Thanks for the tip, @manawyrm!)</p>

<p>This is another thing that’s not allowed in Germany, so you shouldn’t do it.</p>

<p>Pagers use a format called “POCSAG” (Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group…), which you should not decode using multimon-ng.</p>

<p>Because you would find that the content is short and cryptic anyway. It would probably be repeated by several stations all around you, to make sure the whole region is covered.</p>

<p>Do not read the English Wikipedia page! It contains frequencies!</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>

<p>At this point, I was pretty tired. Focusing on this project for 6 days straight took a lot of energy, and I was always uncertain if I could actually complete all 50 things in that week! But I woke up with a fun idea:</p>

<h3 id="detect-when-a-smartphone-is-turned-on">44: Detect when a smartphone is turned on</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 13.56 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>I was curious whether I could see the NFC transceiver in my smartphone! And yeah, especially using my random wire antenna, this works really well!</p>

<p>My smartphone seems to emit at the NFC frequency a couple of times per second. And when unlocking the screen, it emits five very strong beeps on that frequency! I can see those from the other side of our apartment.</p>

<p>Surely, these signals are the same for every device, right? 😶</p>

<p>Observe the five beeps here:</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/feb0a619986a7006.mp4" controls=""></video>

<h3 id="communicate-wirelessly-using-a-book">45: Communicate wirelessly using… a book</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 13.56 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://chaos.social/@piko">Piko</a> and I played around with NFC a bit more, and we found out that when getting close to an NFC tag, a smartphone emits at 13.56 MHz continuously!</p>

<p>So, we started sending Morse code to each other between rooms, using a smartphone and a library book! :’D</p>

<p>Take that, Bundesnetzagentur!</p>

<p>Seems that the shortest signal you can create is 0.7 s long, resulting in a meager communication speed of 3-4 words per minute…</p>

<h3 id="receive-navigational-aids-for-airplanes">46: Receive navigational aids for airplanes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 108.00-117.95 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>There are ground stations that emit a signal that allow calculating your angle relative to it! If you receive two, you can determine your position. (Thanks, @fly_it!)</p>

<p>I heard the one close to Hamburg! And SDRangel has a decoder, of course! It calculated angles between 210° and 230°, which is pretty close to the actual value of 224°! I don’t think they are meant to be used from the ground.</p>

<p>The neat navigational map is from <a href="https://skyvector.com/">https://skyvector.com</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/5029b31e8a681a21.png" alt="View of SDRangel, it decodes the signal in the lower left, and shows 229°!" title="View of SDRangel, it decodes the signal in the lower left, and shows 229°!"></p>

<p>I spent ages trying to build my own decoder in GNU Radio. But I wasn’t familiar with it at all, and I eventually gave up. Still, that seems to be the software you wanna learn for tasks like these!</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/0e55a27def0a797d.png" alt="All screenshots show experiments I did in GNU Radio and Audacity." title="All screenshots show experiments I did in GNU Radio and Audacity."></p>

<p>By the way, how the ground stations work is fascinating: In my case, it’s a “Doppler VOR”: It transmits a static frequency via amplitude modulation, and adds another signal that moves around in circles, so you get a Doppler frequency shift.</p>

<p>If you compare the two, you can calculate the angle!</p>

<h3 id="see-how-low-you-can-go-in-the-frequency-spectrum">47: See how low you can go in the frequency spectrum</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> mostly AM</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a fun exploration: What’s the lowest-frequency broadcast I can receive?</p>

<p>The RTL-SDR Blog V4 stick I’m using has a neat feature – a built-in “upconverter”, which is enabled automatically when you try to listen to frequencies below what the chipset supports. This allows it to receive down to ~500 kHz!</p>

<p>The first stations that are comprehensible started at 1 MHz for me.</p>

<video src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/cc5ff2908379955d.mp4" controls=""></video>

<h3 id="see-how-high-you-can-go-in-the-frequency-spectrum">48: See how high you can go in the frequency spectrum</h3>

<p>The chipset in my SDR stick go up to maximum frequency of 1766 MHz. It seems pretty quiet up there, probably because I lack proper antennas. I found these three lines in an amateur band, but they probably originate from the stick itself, or another device.</p>

<p>So the highest-frequency thing I’ve received is ADS-B at 1090 MHz (see entry #5)! 🎉</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/833875a5a00f9c32.png" alt="Three lines at around 1296 MHz." title="Three lines at around 1296 MHz."></p>

<h3 id="listen-to-marine-radio">49: Listen to marine radio</h3>

<p>We’ve been over this. Not allowed in Germany. Don’t do it. ⛔</p>

<p>But if you’re in the US, anyone can purchase a marine radio, and even use it to transmit! :D</p>

<h3 id="go-mobile">50: Go mobile!</h3>

<p>Just now, I was wondering whether there are any Android apps for controlling SDRs.</p>

<p>And it turned out, the software I liked best that week, SDR++, had an <a href="https://www.sdrpp.org/nightly">Android version</a> since a couple of weeks! \o/</p>

<p>So now I could go track down the source of some of these strange signals! :3</p>

<p><img src="https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/a8eec89128df1f90.jpeg" alt="Me, a red-haired, red-bearded white human, hold a smartphone, connected to a Framework module, connected to my SDR stick, connected to an antenna! I look happy and tired." title="Me, a red-haired, red-bearded white human, hold a smartphone, connected to a Framework module, connected to my SDR stick, connected to an antenna! I look happy and tired."></p>

<h2 id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>

<p>And with that, … 🥁 … I was officially done with my “50 things to do with a software defined radio”! 🎉</p>

<p>This were seven very intense days, where I learned a lot of new things about radio waves and the many things they can be used for!</p>

<p>I was proud! I was tired! I was amazed that all those things I received are all around us, everywhere, all at once – if you know where to look. :O</p>

<h2 id="more-things-to-explore">More things to explore</h2>

<p>Here’s some things that I haven’t tried or that haven’t worked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receiving digital voice modes (SDRangel should be able to do it, but I couldn’t figure it out)</li>
  <li>Receive something from the ISS</li>
  <li>Use the GRAVES radar to detect meteors (couldn’t detect it)</li>
  <li>Receive videos on ham bands</li>
  <li>Receive Iridium satellites</li>
  <li>Listen to pirate stations</li>
  <li>Receive Cubesat</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, doing things with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Zigbee could be fun, but I’d need a more expensive receiver for those frequencies.</p>

<h2 id="future-thoughts">Future thoughts</h2>

<p>So, was this project in fact a gateway drug to getting an amateur radio license?</p>

<p>Yeah, probably. I’d love to transmit something and experiment more! :D</p>

<p>In Germany, a new license class will be introduced in summer 2024, that’ll allow you to send on the 10-meter, 2-meter and 70-cm bands (the “N class”).</p>

<p>In fact, there’s a really good German online course that teaches you everything you need to know: <a href="https://50ohm.de/">50ohm.de</a></p>

<p>Highly recommended, even if you’re not planning on getting a license.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to Piko, Chris, and Cqoicebordel for proof-reading this blog post! &lt;3</p>

Iratxe Garcia Perez, leader of the centre-left S&amp;D group, blasted von der Leyen’s hypocrisy in calling for Europe to have courage and fight when she herself showed no courage with Trump.

That to replace the Russian LNG gas that is only $10 billion per year for now. These numbers don’t add up…We should invest this money in European renewables and European industry, because renewables are the worst enemy of fossil autocrats.”</span></p><p><span>The Commission has defended President von der Leyen’s promise to invest $250 billion per year in US liquified natural gas (LNG) for the remainder of Trump’s term (something analysts say </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-us-oil-gas-energy/" rel="">isn’t possible</a><span> to fully deliver) by saying it is just a temporary measure until this can be replaced by renewables in the next decade. But energy analysts have pointed out that </span><a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/decarbonising-gas/europes-rush-for-energy-security-through-lng-risks-fossil-fuel-lock-in/" rel="">building the infrastructure</a><span> needed to receive the American LNG will lock Europe into long-term dependence. Last week, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an interview with Euractiv that this is exactly the point.</span></p><p><span>Contradicting the Commission’s claims that this use of US LNG will be a “</span><a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/media/video/I-276913" rel="">short-term measure</a><span>,” Wright told Euractiv that it is in fact a “</span><a href="http://“I think it’s a long-term change,” Wright said in an interview in Brussels on Friday. “When you buy energy, particularly liquefied natural gas, there’s a huge amount of infrastructure that’s built.” “This isn’t going to be three and a half years and it’ll all be over,” Wright said after his first meetings with senior EU leaders since Ursula von der Leyen struck a trade deal with Donald Trump at the end of July." rel="">long-term change</a><span>.” “When you buy energy, particularly liquefied natural gas, there’s a huge amount of infrastructure that’s built,” he said. “This isn’t going to be three and a half years and it’ll all be over.”</span></p><p>It’s an important distinction because it will only be possible for the EU to meet its target of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 if the use of US LNG is short term. But Wright is right, it doesn’t make sense that Europe would build all of the expensive infrastructure necessary to receive US LNG at its ports and then just stop using it a few years later.</p><p>Wright, who was on a visit to Brussels to plan the fossil-fuel-dumping bonanza with EU lawmakers, also dismissed analysts’ claims that the US will not be able to deliver this amount of LNG over the next three years. “During the Trump administration the capacity for the United States to export LNG will double, not increase by 10 or 20 percent,” Wright told Euractiv.</p><p><span>At the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when the EU urgently switched from importing Russian pipeline gas to importing liquified gas from the US and other suppliers, most US export terminals and EU import terminals </span><a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/finance/investment-management/opinion-why-arent-investors-piling-in-to-build-new-lng-projects" rel="">were operating at maximum capacity</a><span>, and those that are not were not didn’t have the pipeline infrastructure to get the gas to where it needs to go. New port terminals and pipelines have been rapidly built after President von der Leyen </span><a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/decarbonising-gas/europes-rush-for-energy-security-through-lng-risks-fossil-fuel-lock-in/" rel="">agreed with President Biden</a><span> in 2022 to immediately redirect 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of US LNG to the EU to help replace the 100bcm of Russian gas the EU stopped importing. That was successfully done. But the plan also called for scaling this up to 50bcm of US LNG per year starting in 2023. That hasn’t happened, for two reasons: the needed export and import infrastructure takes time to build, and market interest has been limited because EU gas demand has actually fallen recently.</span></p><p><span>To receive more US LNG the US needs to build liquefication export terminals, and the EU needs to build gasification import terminals and pipelines at either end to get the gas to and from where it needs to go. So the problem is that by their very nature, a surge of LNG imports cannot be temporary. Receiving them will require a huge amount of expensive port and pipeline infrastructure to be built, and once it’s built it needs to continue to be used for decades in order to justify the investment. In other words, US LNG </span><em>can’t</em><span> be short term, it can’t only be long term.</span></p><p><span>“A big LNG import terminal takes around five years to build and come online,” Simon Dekeyrel, a climate and energy analyst at the European Policy Centre, </span><a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/decarbonising-gas/europes-rush-for-energy-security-through-lng-risks-fossil-fuel-lock-in/?cf-view" rel="">told me</a><span> in 2022. The pipelines connecting that terminal also take several years to build – well beyond the short-term urgency of replacing Russian gas imports. “What we’re seeing right now is a flurry of new announced projects across EU member states. Germany has announced two LNG import terminals. Italy is also considering a new terminal. It’s a huge rush…which might really lead to unnecessary investments in fossil fuel infrastructure which would be much better spent elsewhere.”</span></p><p><span>The deal’s </span><a href="https://davekeating.substack.com/p/europes-surrender-summer" rel="">defenders</a><span> have insisted that this is an empty promise that can’t actually be delivered so it’s harmless. But the US government has made it clear they don’t see this as a mere symbolic tribute that doesn’t require delivery.

                <p>A very common adage in ODE solvers is that if you run into trouble with an explicit method, usually some explicit Runge-Kutta method like RK4, then you should try an implicit method. Implicit methods, because they are doing more work, solving an implicit system via a Newton method having “better” stability, should be the thing you go to on the “hard” problems.</p>
<p>This is at least what I heard at first, and then I learned about edge cases. Specifically, you hear people say “but for hyperbolic PDEs you need to use explicit methods”. You might even intuit from this “PDEs can have special properties, so sometimes special things can happen with PDEs… but ODEs, that should use implicit methods if you need more robustness”. This turns out to not be true, and really understanding the ODEs will help us understand better why there are some PDE semidiscretizations that have this “special cutout”.</p>
<p>What I want to do in this blog post is more clearly define what “better stability” actually means, and show that it has certain consequences that can sometimes make explicit ODE solvers actually more robust on some problems. And not just some made-up problems, lots of real problems that show up in the real world.</p>
<h2>A Quick Primer on Linear ODEs</h2>
<p>First, let’s go through the logic of why implicit ODE solvers are considered to be more robust, which we want to define in some semi-rigorous way as “having a better chance to give an answer closer to the real answer”. In order to go from semi-rigorous into a rigorous definition, we can choose a test function, and what better test function to use than a linear ODE. So let’s define a linear ODE:</p>
<p>$$u’ = \lambda u$$</p>
<p>is the simplest ODE. We can even solve it analytically, $u(t) = \exp(\lambda t)u(0)$. For completeness, we can generalize this to a linear system of ODEs, where instead of having a scalar $u$ we can let $u$ be a vector, in which case the linear ODE has a matrix of parameters $A$, i.e.</p>
<p>$$u’ = Au$$</p>
<p>In this case, if $A$ is diagonalizable, $A = P^{-1}DP$, then we can replace $A$:</p>
<p>$$u’ = P^{-1}DP u$$</p>
<p>$$Pu’ = DPu$$</p>
<p>or if we let $w = Pu$, then</p>
<p>$$w’ = Dw$$</p>
<p>where $D$ is a diagonal matrix. This means that for every element of $w$ we have the equation:</p>
<p>$$w_i’ = \lambda_i w_i$$</p>
<p>where $w_i$ is the vector in the direction of the $i$th eigenvector of $A$, and $\lambda_i$ is the $i$th eigenvalue of $A$. Thus our simple linear ODE $u’ = \lambda u$ tells us about general linear systems along the eigenvectors. Importantly, since even for real $A$ we can have $\lambda$ be a complex number, i.e. real-valued matrices can have complex eigenvalues, it’s important to allow for $\lambda$ to be complex to understand all possible systems.</p>
<p>But why is this important for any other ODE? Well by the Hartman-Grobman theorem, for any sufficiently nice ODE:</p>
<p>$$u’ = f(u)$$</p>
<p>We can locally approximate the ODE by:</p>
<p>$$u’ = Au$$</p>
<p>where $A = f'(u)$, i.e. $A$ is the linear system defined by the Jacobian local to the point. This is effectively saying any “sufficiently nice” system (i.e. if $f$ isn’t some crazy absurd function and has properties like being differentiable), you can understand how things locally move by looking at the system approximated by a linear system, where the right linear approximation is given by the Jacobian. And we know that linear systems then boil down generally to just the scalar linear system, and so understanding the behavior of a solver on the scalar linear system tells us a lot about how it will do “for small enough h”.</p>
<p>Okay, there are lots of unanswered questions, such as what if $A$ is not diagonalizable? What if $f$ is not differentiable? What if the system is very nonlinear so the Jacobian changes very rapidly? But under assumptions that things are nice enough, we can say that if a solver does well on $u’ = \lambda u$ then it is probably some idea of good.</p>

<p>So now we have a metric by which we can analyze ODEs: if they have good behavior on $u’ = \lambda u$, then they are likely to be good in general. So what does it mean to have good behavior on $u’ = \lambda u$? One nice property would be to at least be asymptotically correct for the most basic statement, i.e. does it go to zero when it should? If you have $u’ = \lambda u$ and $\lambda$ is negative, then the analytical solution $u(t) = \exp(\lambda t)u(0)$ goes to zero as $t$ goes to infinity. So a good question to ask is, for a given numerical method, for what values of $h$ (the time step size) does the numerical method give a solution that goes to zero, and for which $h$ does it get an infinitely incorrect answer?</p>
<p>To understand this, we just take a numerical method and plug in the test equation. So the first thing to look at is Euler’s method. For Euler’s method, we step forward by $h$ by assuming the derivative is constant along the interval, or:</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = u_n + hf(u_n)$$</p>
<p>When does this method give a solution that is asymptotically consistent? With a little bit of algebra:</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = u_n + h\lambda u_n$$</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = (1 + h\lambda) u_n$$</p>
<p>Let $z = h\lambda$, which means</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = (1 + z) u_n$$</p>
<p>This is a discrete dynamical system which has the analytical solution:</p>
<p>$$u_n = u_0 (1+z)^{n}$$</p>
<p>Note that if $1 + z &gt; 1$, then $(1+z)^n$ keeps growing as $n$ increases, so this goes to infinity, while if $1 + z &lt; 1$ it goes to zero. But since $\lambda$ can actually be a complex number, the analysis is a little bit more complex (pun intended), but it effectively means that if $z$ is in the unit circle shifted to the left in the complex plane by 1, then $u_n \rightarrow 0$. This gives us the definition of the stability region, $G(z)$ is the region for which $u_n \rightarrow 0$, and this is the shifted unit circle in the complex plane for explicit Euler.

<p>This shows a pretty bad property for this method. For any given $\lambda$ with negative real part, there is a maximum $h$, actually $h = 1/\lambda$, such that for any larger step size we don’t just get a bad answer, we can get an infinitely bad answer, i.e. the analytical solution goes to zero but the numerical solution goes to infinity!</p>
<p>So, is there a method that doesn’t have this bad property? In comes the implicit methods. If you run the same analysis with implicit Euler,</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = u_n + hf(u_{n+1})$$</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = u_n + h\lambda u_{n+1}$$</p>
<p>$$(1-z) u_{n+1} = u_n$$</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = \frac{1}{1-z} u_n$$</p>
<p>Then we have almost an “inverse” answer, i.e. $G(z)$ is everything except the unit circle in the complex plane shifted to the right. This means that for any $\lambda$ with negative real part, for any $h$ the implicit Euler method has $u_n \rightarrow 0$, therefore it’s never infinitely wrong.</p>

<p>Therefore it’s just better, QED.</p>
<p>This then generalizes to more advanced methods. For example, the stability region of RK4</p>

<p>an implicit method does not. You can even prove it’s impossible for any explicit method to have this “good” property, so “implicit methods are better”. QED times 2, done deal.</p>
<h2>Wait a second, what about that other “wrongness”?</h2>
<p>Any attentive student should immediately throw their hand up. “Teacher, given the $G(z)$ you said, you also have that for any $\lambda$ where $\text{Re}(\lambda)&gt;1$, you also have that $u_n \rightarrow 0$, but in reality the analytical solution has $u(t) \rightarrow \infty$, so implicit Euler is infinitely wrong! And explicit Euler has the correct asymptotic behavior since it goes to infinity!”</p>
<p>That is completely correct! But it can be easy to brush this off with “practical concerns”. If you have a real model which has positive real eigenvalues like that, then it’s just going to explode to infinity. Those kinds of models aren’t really realistic? Energy goes to infinity, angular momentum goes to infinity, the chemical concentration goes to infinity: whatever you’re modeling just goes crazy! If you’re in this scenario, then your model is probably wrong. Or if the model isn’t wrong, the numerical methods aren’t very good anyways. If you analyze the error propagation properties, you’ll see the error of the numerical method also increases exponentially! So this is a case you shouldn’t be modeling anyways.</p>
<h2>Seeing this robustness in practice</h2>
<p>Therefore if you need a more accurate result, use an implicit method. And you don’t need to go to very difficult models to see this manifest in practice. Take the linear ODE:</p>
<p>$$T’ = 5(300-T)$$</p>
<p>with $T(0) = 320$. This is a simple model of cooling an object with a constant temperature influx. It’s easy to analytically solve, you just have an exponential fall in the temperature towards $T = 300$ the steady state. But when we solve it with an explicit method at default tolerances, that’s not what we see:</p>

<p>We see that the explicit method gives oscillations in the solution! Meanwhile, if we take a “robust” implicit method like the BDF method from the classic C++ library SUNDIALS, we can solve this:</p>

<p>Sure it’s not perfectly accurate, but at least it doesn’t give extremely wrong behavior. We can decrease tolerances to make this all go away,</p>

<p>But the main point is that the explicit method is just generally “less robust”, you have to be more careful, it can give things that are just qualitatively wrong.</p>
<p>This means that “good tools”, tools that have a reputation for robustness, they should default to just using implicit solvers because that’s going to be better. And you see that in tools like Modelica. For example, the <a href="https://modelica.university/">Modelica University’s playground</a> and other tools in the space like OpenModelica and Dymola, default to implicit solvers like DASSL. And you can see they do great on this problem by default!</p>

<p>So QED, that’s the “right thing to do”: if you want to be robust, stick to implicit methods.</p>
<h2>But why oscillations?</h2>
<p>Hold up a bit… why does the explicit method give oscillations? While we know that’s wrong, it would be good to understand why it gives the qualitatively wrong behavior that it does. It turns out that this falls right out of the definition of the method. If you go back to the definition of explicit Euler on the test problem, i.e.</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = u_n + hf(u_n)$$</p>
<p>then substitute in:</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = (1 + h\lambda) u_{n}$$</p>
<p>If we think about our stability criteria $G(z)$ another way, its boundaries are exactly the value by which the next $u_{n+1}$ would have a negative real part. So the analytical solution is supposed to go to zero, but the “bad” behavior is when we choose a step size $h$ such that if we extrapolate out with a straight line for $h$ long in time, then we will “jump” over this zero, something that doesn’t happen in the analytical solution. But now let’s think about what happens in that case. If you jump over zero, then $u_n &lt; 0$ (think real right now), so therefore the derivative of the next update points in the other direction, i.e. we're still going towards zero, but now from the negative side we go up to zero. But since $\|1 + h\lambda\| &gt; 1$, we have that $\|u_{n+1}\| &gt; \|u_n\|$, i.e. the norm of the solution keeps growing. So you jump from positive to negative, then negative to positive, then positive to negative, where the jumps are growing each time. This is the phantom oscillations of the explicit ODE solver!</p>
<p>So what’s happening is the default tolerances of the explicit ODE solver were large enough that the chosen $h$s were in the range of the phantom oscillation behavior, and so you just need to cap $h$ below that value, which is dependent on the real part of the eigenvalue of $h$ (you can do the same analysis with complex numbers, but that just gives rotations in the complex plane along with the real part oscillation).</p>
<p>But if explicit methods give oscillations, what’s going on with implicit ODE solvers with large $h$? Let’s look at the update equation again:</p>
<p>$$u_{n+1} = \frac{1}{1-z} u_n$$</p>
<p>now instead of multiplying each time by $(1-z)$, we divide by it. This means that when $\lambda &lt; 0$ (or $\text{Re}(\lambda) &lt; 0$ to be more exact), then for any $h$ we have that $\|u_{n+1}\| &lt; \|u_{n}\|$. Therefore, we might jump over the zero with a big enough $h$, but we are guaranteed that our "jump size" is always shrinking. Thus for any $h$, we will get to zero because we're always shrinking in absolute value.

This means that implicit methods are working because they have a natural dampening effect. So:



</p><h4>Explicit methods introduce spurious oscillations, but implicit methods naturally damp oscillations</h4>
<p>This explains in more detail why we saw what we saw: the explicit method when the error tolerance is sufficiently high will introduce oscillations that don’t exist, while the implicit method will not have this behavior. This is a more refined version of the “energy doesn’t go to infinity!”, now it’s “energy doesn’t come from nowhere in real systems”, and because of this implicit solvers give a better qualitative answer. This is why they are more robust, which is why robust software for real engineers just always default to them.</p>
<h2>Wait a second… do we always want that?</h2>
<p>You should now be the student in the front row raising your hand, “implicit methods are always dampening… is that actually a good idea? Are you sure that’s always correct?” And the answer is… well it’s not. And that then gives us exactly the failure case for which implicit methods are less robust. If you have a system that is supposed to actually oscillate, then this “hey let’s always dampen everything to make solving more robust” actually leads to very wrong answers!</p>
<p>To highlight this, let’s just take a simple oscillator. You can think of this as a harmonic oscillator, or you can think about it as a simple model of a planet going around a star. However you want to envision it, you can write it out as a system of ODEs:</p>
<p>$$u_1′ = 500u_2$$<br>
$$u_2′ = -500u_1$$</p>
<p>This is the linear ODE $u’ = Au$ where $A = [0\ 500; -500\ 0]$, which has complex eigenvalues with zero real part. In other words, the analytical solution is $\sin(500t)$ and $\cos(500t)$, just a pure oscillation that just keeps going around and around in circles. If we solve this with an explicit ODE solver:</p>

<p>we can see that it generally gets the right answer. Over time you get some drift where the energy is slowly increasing due to numerical error in each step, but it’s going around in circles relatively well. However, our “robust implicit method”…</p>

<p>It says the answer goes to zero! Even when the analytical solution is just a circle! But we can understand why this is the case: the software developers made the implicit assumption that “dampening oscillations is always good, because generally that’s what happens in models, so let’s always do this by default so people get better answers”, and the result of this choice is that if someone puts in a model of the Earth going around the sun, then oops the Earth hits the sun pretty quickly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: ODE solvers make trade-offs, you need to make the right ones for your domain</h2>
<p>This gives us the conclusion: there is no “better” or “more robust” ODE solver method, it’s domain-specific. This is why <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/">the Julia ODE solver package has hundreds of methods</a>, because each domain can be asking for different properties that they want out of the method. Explicit methods are not generally faster, they are also something that tends to preserve (or generate) oscillations. Implicit methods are not generally more robust, they are methods which work by dampening transients, which is a good idea for some models but not for others. But then there’s a ton of nuance. For example, can you construct an explicit ODE solver so that on such oscillations you don’t get energy growth? You can! <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Runge-Kutta-Methods">Anas5(w) is documented as “4th order Runge-Kutta method designed for periodic problems. Requires a periodicity estimate w which when accurate the method becomes 5th order (and is otherwise 4th order with less error for better estimates)”</a>, i.e. if you give it a canonical frequency 500 it will be able to do extremely well on this problem (and being a bit off in that estimate still works, it just has energy growth that is small).</p>
<p>What about what was mentioned at the beginning of the article, “for hyperbolic PDEs you need to use explicit methods”? This isn’t a “special behavior” of PDEs, this is simply because for this domain, for example advective models of fluids, you want to conserve fluid as it moves. If you choose an implicit method, it “dampens” the solver, which means you get that as you integrate you get less and less fluid, breaking the conservation laws and giving qualitatively very incorrect solutions. If you use explicit methods, you don’t have this extraneous dampening, and this gives a better looking solution. But you can go even further and develop methods for which, if $h$ is sufficiently small, then you get little to no dampening. These are <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws)">SSP methods</a>, which we say are “for Hyperbolic PDEs (Conservation Laws)” but in reality what we mean is “when you don’t want things to dampen”.</p>
<p>But the point is, you can’t just say “if you want a better solution, use an implicit solver”. Maybe in some domains and for some problems that is true, but in other domains and problems that’s not true. And many numerical issues can stem from the implicit assumptions that follow from the choice being made for the integrator. Given all of this, it should be no surprise that much of the Modelica community has had many problems handling fluid models, the general flow of “everything is a DAE” → “always use an implicit solver” → “fluid models always dampen” → “we need to fix the dampening” could be fixed by making different assumptions at the solver level.</p>
<p>So, the next time someone tells you should just use ode15s or scipy.integrate.radau in order to make things robust without knowing anything about your problem, say “umm actually”.</p>
<h2>Little Extra Details</h2>
<p>The article is concluded. But here’s a few points I couldn’t fit into the narrative I want to mention:</p>
<h3>Trapezoidal is cool</h3>
<p>One piece I didn’t fit in here is that the Trapezoidal method is cool. The dampening property comes from L-stability, i.e. $G(z) \rightarrow 0$ as $\text{Re}(z) \rightarrow -\infty$. This is a stricter form of stability, since instead of just being stable for any finite $\lambda$, this also enforces that you are stable at the limit of bigger lambdas. “Most” implicit solvers that are used in practice, like Implicit Euler, have this property, and you can show the dampening is directly related to this property. But you can have an implicit method that isn’t L-stable. Some of these methods include Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods, which are not even A-stable so they tend to have stability properties and act more like explicit methods. But the Trapezoidal method is A-stable without being L-stable, so it doesn’t tend to dampen while it tends to be also pretty stable. Though it’s not as stable, and the difference between “is stable for any linear ODE” versus “actually stable for nonlinear ODEs” (i.e. B-stability) is pronounced on real-world stiff problems. What this means in human terms is that the Trapezoidal method tends to not be stable enough for hard stiff problems, but it also doesn’t artificially dampen, so it can be a good default in cases where you know you have “some stiffness” but also want to keep some oscillations. One particular case of this is in some electrical circuit models with natural oscillators.</p>
<h3>Lower order methods have purposes too</h3>
<p>“All ODE solvers have a purpose”, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_t6dIKjUUc">give some talks that give the justification for many high order methods</a>, so in general “higher order is good if you solve with stricter tolerances and need more precision”. But lower order methods can be better because the higher order methods require that more derivatives of $f$ are defined, and if that’s not the case (like derivative discontinuities), then lower order methods will be more efficient. So even implicit Euler has cases where it’s better than higher order BDF methods, and it has to do with “how nice” $f$ is.</p>
<h3>BDF methods like DASSL are actually α-stable</h3>
<p>I said that generally implicit methods that you use are A-stable. That’s also a small lie to make the narrative simpler. The BDF methods which Sundials, DASSL, LSODE, FBDF, etc. use are actually α-stable, which means that they are actually missing some angle α of the complex plane for stability. The stability regions look like this:</p>

<p>So these BDF methods are actually pretty bad for other reasons on very oscillatory problems! Meanwhile, things like Rosenbrock methods can also solve DAEs while actually being L-stable, which can make them more stable in many situations where there’s oscillations towards a steady state. So there’s a trade-off there… again every method has a purpose. But this is another “ode15s is more stable than ode23s”… “well actually…”</p>

<p>I have the good fortune to have a job right now, but many of my friends are out of work. Most have been searching for a while. Some are encountering a problem that has my full sympathy, something I’ve experienced myself at various times. I’m not sure I can solve it, but maybe I can help put words to what some are going through.</p>



<p>The problem unfolds in three distinct phases as the job search drags on.</p>



<h2>Phase I: The Obvious but Impossible Search</h2>


<div>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="700" height="1024" src="https://www.jeffwofford.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etidorhpaorendof00lloy_0231.jpg-700x1024.avif" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeffwofford.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etidorhpaorendof00lloy_0231.jpg-700x1024.avif 700w, https://www.jeffwofford.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etidorhpaorendof00lloy_0231.jpg-205x300.avif 205w, https://www.jeffwofford.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etidorhpaorendof00lloy_0231.jpg-768x1124.avif 768w, https://www.jeffwofford.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etidorhpaorendof00lloy_0231.jpg.avif 957w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure></div>


<p>You’ve spent several months sending out scores of carefully tailored resumes and cover letters for jobs you know you are fully qualified for and would excel at. Usually you get no response. Occasionally you get a polite “position filled.” That’s it.</p>



<p>You’re knocking on all the obvious doors—all the jobs closest to what you’ve been doing—and nothing is opening up. It’s exhausting and frustrating. The very act of telling your friends you’re “discouraged” feels like swallowing a horse pill; “discouraged” does not reach the depths of your fear and despair.</p>



<p>The obvious path forward—finding a job in line with your resume—no longer looks like a path. It looks like The Cliffs of Insanity. What used to feel like the Obvious Way Forward now feels like the Impossible Way Forward. Somewhere in your brain there is a tank of gasoline that gets burned each time you force yourself to do something irksome. That tank has burned down to vapors.</p>



<p>You are burned out. You are burned out on search. You are burned out on an impossible search.</p>



<p>But you can’t stay still. So your mind looks for new paths.</p>



<h2>Phase II: The Adjacent-to-Impossible Search</h2>



<p>You consider job openings that aren’t quite aligned with what you were doing but might offer better chances. Maybe it’s in an adjacent industry, a slightly different role, or somewhere you never really wanted to live. Maybe you could take a small pay cut. Maybe an hour’s commute wouldn’t be so bad. You expand your search away from the impossible to a broader horizon, to things that are adjacent to impossible.</p>



<p>This often works! The compromises can turn out better than expected. A pay cut can lead to a quick raise that puts you ahead of your prior pay. Sometimes they turn out worse than expected, but the next job search goes better—new connections, new head space, more time for the market to improve.</p>



<p>Sometimes it doesn’t work. The employers don’t bite. The required compromises are just too dire. The adjacent-to-impossible jobs turn out to be impossible too.</p>



<p>You are burned out. You are very burned out. The creativity and spunk it took to expand your horizons has gone nowhere. That extra spark has died. The brain’s reserve gas tank is now showing “E.” You are suffering from a disease we call Adjacent-to-Impossible Search Burnout (AISB, for the medical professionals in the room).</p>



<p>But you can’t stay still. So your mind looks for new paths.</p>



<h2>Phase III: Weird Search</h2>



<p>Well, if none of the obvious or even next-to-obvious stuff is working, why hang around? Throw the gates wide open, go ronin, walk the whole horizon, drag the whole ocean. You could learn to make jewelry and open an Etsy shop. You could band together with friends and make that little app you’ve always talked about. You could open up that little coffee shop, that bakery, that catering business. You could go back to college and learn a new career.</p>



<p>It feels like giving up, though, doesn’t it? Wait, no! It feels like taking charge of your own destiny, plotting your own course, becoming <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">master of your fate,</a> all that sort of thing! Except, geez, at maybe one-half, one-fourth the pay, if you’re lucky? Maybe less, if you’re paying for college before you even start this new career. </p>



<p>And yet… what’s the alternative? Getting paid zero for the foreseeable future? Continuing to churn out groveling resumes and “I can’t wait to work at your wonderful company that doesn’t have the internal culture of decency or self-discipline to bother responding to this application that <em>you invited</em>, from someone <em>you know </em>really needs answers right now” cover letters?</p>



<p>So yes, you go weird, at least mentally, and you entertain ideas about what else in tarnation might possibly pay you a living wage while using your talents and filling up your joy-meter.</p>



<p>And sometimes this goes great. Almost every company or product we love started more or less like this. The next one might be yours. I like the weird path, and if you take it and it blossoms, I salute you and I bless you.</p>



<p>But we’re here for the ones that are still stuck in this place, this third phase.</p>



<p>You have been thwarted by the Cliffs of Insanity. You have become nauseated by the Wide World of Compromise. But nowhere else on your broad horizon has yet called you forward.</p>



<p>And here’s the deal: here’s how you know you are really at the end of the rope: <em>you are sick of freaking thinking about it.</em></p>



<p>You are sicking of trying to find jobs you <em>should</em> have. You are sick of trying to find jobs you <em>could</em> have. You are sick of trying to find jobs you <em>shouldn’t</em> have—jobs that could be fun but would make your grandmother shake her head a little. You are burned out on search. All possible gas tanks are empty. All the creative-hopeful-bright-idea-one-more-try sauce is gone, dried up, kaput.</p>



<p>You are Burned Out On Search (BOOS for the professionals). That’s the problem. That’s the disease. You’re welcome.</p>



<h2>Solutions</h2>



<p>I don’t know. I can’t solve your problem. If your problem wasn’t genuinely hard you would have solved it already. Some stranger who doesn’t know your situation ain’t gonna solve it. But here are some notes I’ve picked up along similar roads.</p>



<p><strong>You’re not alone.</strong> A lot, a <em>lot </em>of people are in this boat right now, and frankly, in any given year somebody, probably somebody you know, is in this boat. As I write, 40% of unemployed people have been out of work for at least 15 weeks. That’s almost four months. Fully a fourth have been unemployed at least 27 weeks: over six months. Unemployment is not strange or rare. Happens to everybody: good, capable people who did miracles at prior organizations and will do them again, they just can’t do them right now.</p>



<p><strong>It sucks real bad. </strong>Let’s not understate the horror of unemployment in a modern economy. Talk about a Cliff of Insanity: there is an unbelievable drop in wellbeing from the employed to unemployed. I don’t need to spell it all out—the money stuff, the healthcare stuff, the embarrassment, the boredom, the fear. It’s bad.</p>



<p>And yet somehow in the grand scheme of social sympathy and compassion, unemployment doesn’t get a lot of loving. Tell folks you’ve got knee problems, house foundation problems, college debt, divorce, death in the family, hair stylist went rogue this morning and messed up your cowlick, and here comes all kinds of sympathy. Tell them you’re unemployed, what do you get? “Oh yeah I was unemployed one month ten years ago boy that sucked.” Yes, friend, yes it does suck right now six months in, and unlike your little story there I don’t know when or if it will ever stop.</p>



<p>But I do feel you. High five. I feel you.</p>



<p><strong>It won’t turn out as bad as you fear. </strong>How often have you known somebody whose life was really, finally wrecked by unemployment? I mean, they truly never got back on their feet. Maybe previously they had a decent home, but then they became homeless, and now they’re still homeless? I’m not just talking about stories and imagination and movies right now, I’m talking about who do you personally know who’s had it go that badly?</p>



<p>And look, it does happen. I’m not saying that 100% of people spring back from unemployment. But in your experience what percentage of people get back to a decent place? 90%? It’s got to be more than that. 95%? 99%? Most of the time, your friends and family members go through a period of unemployment and then they find a new, good life on the other side. It might be in the obvious place, it might not be. It might be on one of those “weird paths” we talked about, but very often the new path, no matter how weird, becomes stable and sufficient and even joyful.</p>



<p>People—<em>you</em>—are more resilient and resourceful than you think. You are skillful at <em>imagining bad outcomes</em>. You are also skillful at <em>avoiding them. </em>Do yourself a favor, set aside the <em>imagining bad</em> <em>outcomes</em> skill for a year or two and focus for now on the<em> avoiding</em> skill—and the <em>finding </em>skill that runs along with it.</p>



<p><strong>It’s okay to rest. </strong>This is the best lesson I’ve learned from these kinds of seasons. When you’ve searched and you’ve searched without success until you’re sick of searches, usually the lesson is: now it’s time to rest.</p>



<p>There is a time for hard work, very hard work. There’s a time to push yourself, even to push beyond the limits of what you think you can endure. But a time comes when you are at the limit, at least for now. In those times, the word is “rest.”</p>



<p>Rest is much more than mere idleness. When you rest you give your mind the space to explore possibilities it never had time to consider. Often this exploration happens without your knowing it. Suddenly you see a new way to tackle that challenge. Or you realize it was the wrong challenge to begin with, that what you needed was a different quest. Rest refuels the mind. It refills the gas tanks. It untwists wounded joints. It builds up sore muscles.</p>



<p>We’re not talking about watching eight hours of YouTube every day or playing video games till 4 AM. Rest is all about space. It engages purposefully with serious boredom. You’re going to need to get in there and stare at some ceilings—or better yet, from a hammock, at some skies. Give the mind space to think.</p>



<p>Rest should involve time with friends but also plenty of solitude. It ought to involve some deep reading—books, not just the short pieces—especially those that are full of new ideas, not on the usual menu, surprising perspectives that get your thoughts percolating.</p>



<p>Rest needs to be done well. Set your alarm. Make appointments and keep them. Get outside. Use your hands.</p>



<p>When you’re Burned Out On Search, what do you do next? When we ask it that way the answer becomes obvious. You rest. It’s the only antidote to burn out. Give your mind time to rebuild and it will find ways forward that you never expected. Sometimes the best way to search is… not to search.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on <a href="https://gomakethings.com/consulting">so many projects recently</a> that were more complicated than they needed to be because they used JavaScript to generate HTML.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-is">JavaScript is…</h2>

<ul>
<li>Slower to load</li>
<li>Slower to run</li>
<li>More prone to breaking</li>
<li>Harder to read and reason about</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually look like the final output</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s inferior to just using HTML in nearly every way.</p>

<p>I’m not saying <em>never</em> use JavaScript, though. I think JS is great at augmenting and enhancing what’s already there, and adding interactivity that cannot (yet) but handled with HTML.</p>

<p>Let’s look at two examples…</p>

<h2 id="submitting-a-form">Submitting a form</h2>

<p>I see this a lot in React and JSX.</p>

<p>Every input in a form has an <code>input</code> listener on it. Any changes to that input update a state property. That property is used to set the value of the input, creating this weird circular logic.</p>

<p>(<em>This approach is called “controlled inputs” in React-land, and some devs are slowly moving away from it, finally.</em>)</p>

<p>The form submit is often also tied to clicking a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> rather than submitting a form, meaning that hitting enter on an input won’t submit the form. This removes a native accessibility feature.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>function</span> <span>Login</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>username</span><span>,</span> <span>setUsername</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>);</span>

		<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s that same setup with HTML…</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span> <span>action</span><span>=</span><span>"/login"</span> <span>method</span><span>=</span><span>"POST"</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;</span><span>label</span> <span>for</span><span>=</span><span>"username"</span><span>&gt;</span>Username<span>&lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> 
		<span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"username"</span>
		<span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"text"</span>
		<span>required</span>
	<span>/&gt;</span>

	<span>&lt;</span><span>label</span> <span>for</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;</span>Password<span>&lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> 
		<span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span>
		<span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span> 
		<span>required</span>
	<span>/&gt;</span>

	<span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>Submit<span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you can enhance it with just a touch of JavaScript…</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>form</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'[action*="/login"]'</span><span>);</span>

	<span>const</span> <span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>fromEntries</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>));</span>

		<span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>,</span>
		<span>body</span>

<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Hell, you can even do this <em>in React</em> if you want!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>function</span> <span>Login</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Another area where you can lean a lot more heavily on HTML is API responses.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> that gets generated based on some data that’s specific to the user or some selections that have been made in a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In most modern apps, that means getting back some JSON, and generating a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> from it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'#app'</span><span>);</span>

<h2 id="there-are-workflow-changes">There are workflow changes</h2>

<p>This, of course, changes the workflow of building apps quite a bit.</p>

<p>A lot of work shifts to the backend that in today’s apps is handled with client-side code. But… that’s a good thing?</p>

<p>It means faster, simpler apps that behave more predictably and reliably.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Eastern District of Michigan - Detroit)</p>

<p>My husband, Conrad Rockenhaus, is wrongly incarcerated in a county jail. I’m posting this here because you are one of the few communities that will understand the full technical and political reality of how he ended up there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My husband is a former Tor operator, and at one point, he ran some of the fastest relays and exit nodes in the world.</p>

<p>This nightmare began when he refused to help the FBI decrypt traffic from his exit nodes.</p>

<p>Months later, the government arrested him. Their official reason? A minor, non-violent CFAA charge from an old workplace dispute that had nothing to do with Tor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, the statute of limitations was just a couple of months from expiring. It was a clear pretext to target him.</p>

<p>That minor charge was all they needed to get him into the system. To deny him bail, a U.S. Probation Officer in Texas lied under oath, telling a judge that Conrad had installed a "Linux OS called Spice" to "knock out their monitoring software" and access the "dark web."</p>

<p>(Read the transcript <a href="https://rockenhaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/U.S.-v.-Rockenhaus-2-20-20-2.pdf">https://rockenhaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/U.S.-v.-Rockenhaus-2-20-20-2.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Here is the technical reality of their lie: The software was a standard SPICE graphics driver needed for his Ph.D. program. As many of you know, this is a basic utility for displaying graphics from a virtual machine. It is not an OS, has no connection to the dark web, and was technically incapable of interfering with their monitoring software.</p>

<p>The claim is a technical absurdity, equivalent to saying a mouse pad can hack a server.</p>

<p>Based on that lie alone, he was held in pre-trial detention for three years.</p>

<p>Now, the retaliation has escalated in Michigan. After I filed a formal complaint against his US probation officers for harassment, they used fraudulent warrants to jail my husband again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this violent arrest by US Marshals (who smashed in our windows and nearly shot my dog) he sustained a severe head injury that caused him to have a grand mal seizure in court. The jail’s “medical attention” was to ask him what year it was (he said 2023) and then send him back to his cell. He is being denied real medical care.</p>

<p>See videos:</p>

<p>To make matters worse, U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy, III has created a procedural trap that has stripped my husband of his right to a lawyer to fight for his life, health, or innocence. He is trapped in a constitutional and medical crisis.</p>

<p>I am not asking for money. I am asking for your help to amplify this story. You understand the technical truth and why this fight is so important.</p>

<p>We have all the evidence: the court transcript of the false testimony, the fraudulent warrants, the proof of medical neglect. It’s documented on my website:</p>

<p><a href="https://rockenhaus.com/">https://rockenhaus.com</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: My husband, a former Tor operator, refused to help the FBI decrypt Tor traffic. They retaliated by using an old, unrelated CFAA offense to arrest him and then lied about him using a "graphics driver to access the dark web” to keep him in pre-trial detention for 3 years. Now he's been jailed again in Michigan on fraudulent violations, is being denied care for a head injury, and has no lawyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need help getting the word out🙏</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-blog-post=""><h2>Executive Summary</h2><p>The NPM ecosystem is facing another critical supply chain attack. The popular @ctrl/tinycolor package, which receives over 2 million weekly downloads, has been compromised along with more than 40 other packages across multiple maintainers. This attack demonstrates a concerning evolution in supply chain threats - the malware includes a self-propagating mechanism that automatically infects downstream packages, creating a cascading compromise across the ecosystem. The compromised versions have been removed from npm.</p><p>The incident was discovered by <a href="https://github.com/franky47" target="_blank">@franky47</a>, who promptly notified the community through a <a href="https://github.com/scttcper/tinycolor/issues/256" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>. </p><p>In this post, we'll dive deep into the payload's mechanics, including deobfuscated code snippets, API call traces, and diagrams to illustrate the attack chain. Our analysis reveals a Webpack-bundled script (bundle.js) that leverages Node.js modules for reconnaissance, harvesting, and propagation; targeting Linux/macOS devs with access to NPM/GitHub/cloud creds. </p><h2>Technical Analysis</h2><p>The attack unfolds through a sophisticated multi-stage chain that leverages Node.js's process.env for opportunistic credential access and employs Webpack-bundled modules for modularity. At the core of this attack is a ~3.6MB minified bundle.js file, which executes asynchronously during npm install. This execution is likely triggered via a hijacked postinstall script embedded in the compromised package.json.</p><p><strong>Self-Propagation Engine</strong>‍</p><p>The malware includes a self-propagation mechanism through the NpmModule.updatePackage function. This function queries the NPM registry API to fetch up to 20 packages owned by the maintainer, then force-publishes patches to these packages. This creates a cascading compromise effect, recursively injecting the malicious bundle into dependent ecosystems across the NPM registry.</p><p><strong>Credential Harvesting</strong>‍</p><p>The malware repurposes open-source tools like TruffleHog to scan the filesystem for high-entropy secrets. It searches for patterns such as AWS keys using regular expressions like AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}. Additionally, the malware dumps the entire process.env, capturing transient tokens such as GITHUB_TOKEN and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.</p><p>For cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS Secrets Manager using SDK pagination and accesses Google Cloud Platform secrets via the @google-cloud/secret-manager API. The malware specifically targets the following credentials:</p><ol role="list"><li>GitHub personal access tokens</li><li>AWS access keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)</li><li>Google Cloud Platform service credentials</li><li>Azure credentials</li><li>Cloud metadata endpoints</li><li>NPM authentication tokens</li></ol><p><strong>Persistence Mechanism</strong>‍</p><p>The malware establishes persistence by injecting a GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) via a base64-encoded bash script. This workflow triggers on push events and exfiltrates repository secrets using the expression ${{ toJSON(secrets) }} to a command and control endpoint. The malware creates branches by force-merging from the default branch (refs/heads/shai-hulud) using GitHub's /git/refs endpoint.</p><p><strong>Data Exfiltration</strong>‍</p><p>The malware aggregates harvested credentials into a JSON payload, which is pretty-printed for readability. It then uploads this data to a new public repository named <code>Shai-Hulud</code> via the GitHub /user/repos API.</p><p>The entire attack design assumes Linux or macOS execution environments, checking for os.platform() === 'linux' || 'darwin'. It deliberately skips Windows systems. For a visual breakdown, see the attack flow diagram below:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68c9067c02ea9a2f037ae6ad_Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%2011.40.28%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Attack Mechanism</h2><p>The compromise begins with a sophisticated minified JavaScript bundle injected into affected packages like @ctrl/tinycolor. This is not rudimentary malware but rather a sophisticated modular engine that uses Webpack chunks to organize OS utilities, cloud SDKs, and API wrappers.</p><p>The payload imports six core modules, each serving a specific function in the attack chain.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68c91b23b911622bbe928502_Screenshot%202025-09-16%20at%201.08.52%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>OS Recon (Module 71197)</h3><p>This module calls getSystemInfo() to build a comprehensive system profile containing platform, architecture, platformRaw, and archRaw information.

After validating the token via the /whoami endpoint, it queries /v1/search?text=maintainer:${username}&amp;size=20 to retrieve packages owned by the maintainer.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Deobfuscated NPM update snippet</span><span>

<!-- -->
<span></span><span># Delete any malicious branches found</span><span>
</span>git push origin --delete shai-hulud</code></pre><p>‍</p><h3>Rotate All Credentials Immediately</h3><p>The malware harvests credentials from multiple sources. Rotate ALL of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>NPM tokens (automation and publish tokens)</li><li>GitHub personal access tokens</li><li>GitHub Actions secrets in all repositories</li><li>SSH keys used for Git operations</li><li>AWS IAM credentials, access keys, and session tokens</li><li>Google Cloud service account keys and OAuth tokens</li><li>Azure service principals and access tokens</li><li>Any credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager</li><li>API keys found in environment variables</li><li>Database connection strings</li><li>Third-party service tokens</li><li>CI/CD pipeline secrets</li></ul><h3>Audit Cloud Infrastructure for Compromise</h3><p>Since the malware specifically targets AWS Secrets Manager and GCP Secret Manager, you need to audit your cloud infrastructure for unauthorized access. The malware uses API calls to enumerate and exfiltrate secrets, so reviewing audit logs is critical to understanding the scope of compromise.</p><h4>AWS Security Audit</h4><p>Start by examining your CloudTrail logs for any suspicious secret access patterns. Look specifically for BatchGetSecretValue, ListSecrets, and GetSecretValue API calls that occurred during the time window when the compromised package may have been installed. Also generate and review IAM credential reports to identify any unusual authentication patterns or newly created access keys.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span># Check CloudTrail for suspicious secret access</span><span>

<span></span><span># Review IAM credential reports for unusual activity</span><span>
</span><span>aws iam get-credential-report --query </span><span>'Content'</span></code></pre><h4>GCP Security Audit</h4><p>For Google Cloud Platform, review your audit logs for any access to the Secret Manager service. The malware uses the @google-cloud/secret-manager library to enumerate secrets, so look for unusual patterns of secret access. Additionally, check for any unauthorized service account key creation, as these could be used for persistent access.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span># Review secret manager access logs

If you are not an existing enterprise customer, you can start our 14 day free trial by installing <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor" target="_blank">the StepSecurity GitHub App</a> to complete the following recovery step.</p><h4>‍<br>Use NPM Package Cooldown Check</h4><div><p><a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/introducing-the-npm-package-cooldown-check" target="_blank">The NPM&nbsp;Cooldown check</a> automatically fails a pull request if it introduces an npm package version that was released within the organization’s configured cooldown period (default: 2 days). Once the cooldown period has passed, the check will clear automatically with no action required. The rationale is simple - most supply chain attacks are detected within the first 24 hours of a malicious package release, and the projects that get compromised are often the ones that rushed to adopt the version immediately. By introducing a short waiting period before allowing new dependencies, teams can reduce their exposure to fresh attacks while still keeping their dependencies up to date.</p><p>Here is an example showing how this check protected a project from using the compromised versions of packages involved in this incident:</p></div><p><a href="https://github.com/step-security/test-reporting/pull/16/checks?check_run_id=49850926488" target="_blank">https://github.com/step-security/test-reporting/pull/16/checks?check_run_id=49850926488</a></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68bf0ba9eb58ed09a40a6832_Screenshot%202025-09-08%20at%209.59.17%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Discover Pull Requests upgrading to compromised npm packages</h4><p>We have added a new control specifically to detect pull requests that upgraded to these compromised packages. You can find the new control on the StepSecurity dashboard.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Use StepSecurity Harden-Runner to detect compromised dependencies in CI/CD</h4><p>StepSecurity Harden-Runner adds runtime security monitoring to your GitHub Actions workflows, providing visibility into network calls, file system changes, and process executions during CI/CD runs. Harden-Runner detects the compromised nx packages when they are used in CI/CD. Here is a sample Harden-Runner insights page demonstrating this detection:</p><p><a href="https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/actions-security-demo/compromised-packages/actions/runs/17259145119">https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/actions-security-demo/compromised-packages/actions/runs/17259145119</a></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68af60ec28c0c2eec02c4d1f_Screenshot%202025-08-27%20at%2012.47.35%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you're already using Harden-Runner, we strongly recommend you review recent anomaly detections in your Harden-Runner dashboard. You can get started with Harden-Runner by following the guide at <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner">https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner</a>.</p><h4>Use StepSecurity Artifact Monitor to detect software releases outside of authorized pipelines</h4><p>StepSecurity Artifact Monitor provides real-time detection of unauthorized package releases by continuously monitoring your artifacts across package registries. This tool would have flagged this incident by detecting that the compromised versions were published outside of the project's authorized CI/CD pipeline. The monitor tracks release patterns, verifies provenance, and alerts teams when packages are published through unusual channels or from unexpected locations. By implementing Artifact Monitor, organizations can catch supply chain compromises within minutes rather than hours or days, significantly reducing the window of exposure to malicious packages.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/687df9387e6b08fe8bd27e5c_image.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Learn more about implementing Artifact Monitor in your security workflow at <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor" target="_blank">https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor</a>.</p><h2>Reference</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/scttcper/tinycolor/issues/256" target="_blank">GitHub Issue</a></p><p><a href="https://socket.dev/blog/tinycolor-supply-chain-attack-affects-40-packages" target="_blank">Socket.dev Blog Post</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>
