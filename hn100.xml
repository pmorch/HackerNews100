            The duty to document

        <p>If you learn something the hard way, share your findings with others. You have blazed a new trail; now you must mark it for your fellow travellers. Sharing knowledge is an unreasonably effective way of helping others.</p>

<p>I owe a debt of gratitude to those whose knowledge helped me debug software, repair bicycles, choose camping gear, start a business, and deal with anything life throws at me.</p>
<p>I repay that debt by marking my own trails. When I think “it should not have been this hard to find out”, I make it easier to find out. Over the years, I have documented everything from <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/ffmpeg-extract-subtitles">ffmpeg incantations</a> to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/72463537">Uzbek petrol stations</a>, and made a career out of <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/all-about-berlin">documenting German bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>I figure that if you have knowledge that could benefit thousands of people, and it costs you next to nothing to share that knowledge, it’s your duty to do it.</p>

What do people do there that you think could be applied elsewhere?</p><p>For Iceland, I believe I said something about people's contact with nature. Just about every Icelandic person has been on a hike, and they all seem to have a level of admiration and care for nature that's not as widespread elsewhere.</p><p>But in light of the most recent volcanic eruption, I got to thinking about something else.</p><p><span>There's a saying in Icelandic - </span><em>þetta reddast</em><span> - that means "everything will be alright", and, while many languages have a similar expression, this one is really embedded in Icelandic culture.</span></p><p>I remember the first time I felt an earthquake in my life, back when I lived there. I was reasonably worried, and started remembering things I'd seen as a child.</p><p><span>"</span><em>Should we get under a table?</em><span>" — I asked my Icelandic girlfriend at the time. She didn't seem too phased, and before she had a chance to answer, the quake stopped. "</span><em>Well, I guess it's all good now</em><span>".</span></p><p>There was also the time when I was convinced to “walk up” (turns out it was actually climb up) one of the ice pinnacles atop of Snaefellsjökull. At the time I had no experience with crampons or an ice axe at all, yet the group of also amateurs from my ex-girlfriend's company were all pretty chill about the situation and pitched it as a seemingly easy thing.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2816635,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b5124-f0eb-4940-bae1-452cc71552a4_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Snaefellsjökull, 2022.</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the way up there, quite a few of the people got scared, and I for one nearly lost my oversized crampon, which came off my foot and caused me to slide down this steep ice slope that led straight into a crevasse at the bottom.

Plus they also managed to save the harbor, by pumping seawater and spraying it into the lava to redirect it.</p><p>I say all this to say that Icelanders are possibly better prepared than most of us to deal with life. </p><p>Because the Icelandic antifragility built up from generations of living in an island that seems to not want you there should not be mistaken as something applicable only in their little island.</p><p>It has made Icelanders well-prepared to deal with an inevitable part of all of our lives — crisis.</p><p>By contrast, Brazilians love to mention how we have no natural disasters. We don't get earthquakes, have no active volcanoes, no hurricanes, nothing.</p><p>Yet every year thousands of homes are lost, people die, and infrastructure is damaged just from the repercussions of the comparatively predictable rainy season.</p><p>I'm sure that both for our country, but also our personal lives, we have a lot to learn. </p><p><span>Because in my experience, despite its inherent optimism, </span><em>þetta reddast </em><span>often</span><em> </em><span>doesn’t imply “it’ll be taken care of”, but rather “we’ll take care of it”.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-eq-pts="xxs-hr: 0, md-hr: 360, lg-hr: 450">
        <p><strong>June 30th, 2024</strong>. Before you read anything else, commit that date to memory.</p>

<p>June 30th, 2024, will bring the End of Life (EOL) of CentOS Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) will be reaching End of Maintenance (EOM). The good news is that these events won’t require a complete infrastructure overhaul. Tools are available to move from your current configuration to a place where you’ll have years of support.</p>

<p>While June of ‘24 may sound a ways off, do not delay. It will be here faster than you think. Start planning now. Start moving soon. Give yourself plenty of runway, and don’t forget that we aren’t just your software vendor at Red Hat. We are your partners and are here to help you with these transitions.</p>

<p>If you’re like me when looking at a long-term, intensive project, some time is required to stare at a blank screen and process the task before me. Let me see if I can help drive you into action.</p>

<h2>The hard way</h2>

<p>In my days as a systems administrator, we didn’t consider in-place conversions or upgrades. For one thing, it wasn’t the straightforward process we have today. Secondly, new operating systems and hardware retirements went hand in hand. New OS? Time for a new server model! There are specific environments where that is the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can certainly buy new hardware (or spin up new cloud instances) on the latest versions of RHEL and do a “rip-and-replace,” moving over only your application data. But for many, this isn’t an ideal approach. What other options are there?</p>

<p>If you want to keep your application on the same version and focus solely on the operating system for this project, you can do that too. Look at setting up a RHEL 8 or 9 server and running it as a container host for Podman. Put your applications into a container, and viola. You can build your applications into pre-built application images or <a href="https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?vendor_name=Red%20Hat&amp;p=1&amp;q=UBI">Universal Base Images (UBI)</a>.</p>

<p>However, this will require a fair amount of work as well. There is an easier way. In what amounts to a 2-phase process, we can convert your CentOS Linux systems onto a supported version of RHEL and then execute an in-place upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Convert from CentOS Linux</h2>

<p><strong>Pop Quiz</strong>: When does CentOS Linux 7.9 go EOL?</p>

<p>If you said June 30th, 2024, then I can write the rest of this blog post feeling accomplished!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Red Hat has created a way for users to move to a supported operating system in place using a supported process.</p>

<p>Why in-place? Think of all the configurations, user home directories, processes and packages you already have running on these systems. An in-place upgrade means all that customization doesn’t go away. The other piece of good news is that the conversion process and the resulting server image are both supported by Red Hat! In other words, if something breaks during or after the conversion, you can open a support ticket and get the help you need.</p>

<p>Now, we are looking at the final days of CentOS Linux. You’ve got hundreds (or even thousands) of servers running various minor releases of CentOS Linux 7. Let’s walk through what a conversion process looks like:</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xX7P4BzOcNg" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The first thing to do, if you are running anything older than CentOS Linux 7.9, is to upgrade all of your packages to the latest minor release.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Once you are running CentOS Linux 7.9 with all the packages on their latest available version, you can configure the convert2rhel repository.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Run the conversion!</li>
<li aria-level="1">Validate your applications and register your systems to <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights">Red Hat Insights</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Brace yourself— we aren’t done just yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get your hands dirty, we have a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/interactive-labs/migrate-red-hat-enterprise-linux-centos-linux">Convert2RHEL lab</a> on our website to try for yourself!</p>

<h2>In-place upgrade</h2>

<p>Time for a review! When does RHEL 7 go EOM? If you said June 30th, 2024, you nailed it!</p>

<p>Now, you should be looking at a fleet of systems running RHEL 7.9. Perhaps you already had a group of systems running earlier releases of RHEL 7. Now would be an excellent time to patch those to the latest available package set and the recently converted CentOS Linux systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much like CentOS Linux, RHEL 7 has limited life left. Red Hat does offer Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) subscriptions if that is a path of interest. However, these entitlements come with an added cost. For today’s thought exercise, we are looking at how to keep your systems feeling fresh (read supported) without added expense or the need to rip-and-replace later.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVVwg9IyqwQ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Once the ‘yum’ command says there are no available packages left to update, your RHEL systems are ready to upgrade to the latest version of RHEL 8.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Install the Leapp tools.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Run the pre-upgrade assessment and remediate any identified issues.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Run the in-place upgrade.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Validate the upgraded systems and their applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is all there is to it! Sit back and take a deep breath. Even after June 2024, RHEL 8 will still have five years of maintenance support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’d like to try an in-place upgrade for yourself, we have a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/interactive-labs/perform-in-place-upgrade-with-leapp">self-paced lab</a> over on our website.</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>June 30th, 2024…</p>

<p>Set a countdown on your phone. Put a reminder on your desktop. Grab a sticky note and put it on your mirror. Whatever you have to do. The date is rapidly approaching, and as a former sysadmin, I don’t want to see you having to scramble at the last minute to find ways to support your systems.</p>

<p>June 30th, 2024…</p>

<p>My experiences were always building a new server, with a new OS, on a new hardware platform. In the perfect world that exists only in my imagination, I might consider one last full-scale replacement and go straight to RHEL 9, then keep pace with the in-place upgrades for RHEL 10 and beyond.</p>

<p>Sadly, technology, applications, industries and organizations don’t always march to that drum. Complex dependencies, processes and resource availabilities limit our ability to stay on the “latest and greatest.”</p>

<p>If that is the position you find yourself in, follow the links in this blog, watch our videos and engage our <a href="https://access.redhat.com/">Support </a>and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting">Services</a> organizations. Red Hat is your partner in this.</p>

<p>Have you heard about this new app called&nbsp;BoopSnoop?</p>
<p>It launched in the first week of January 2020, and almost immediately, it was down­loaded by four people in three different time zones. In the years since, it has remained steady at four daily active users, with zero churn: a resounding success, exceeding every one of its creator’s&nbsp;expectations.</p>
<p>🙂</p>
<p>I&nbsp;made a messaging app for, and with, my family. It is ruth­lessly simple; we love it; no one else will ever use it. I&nbsp;wanted to share a few notes about how and why I&nbsp;made it, both to (a) offer a nudge to anyone else consid­ering a similar project, and (b) suggest something a little larger about&nbsp;software.</p>

<h2>Barely there</h2>
<p>My story begins with another app, now defunct, called&nbsp;Tapstack.</p>
<p>Opening the app, you saw a live feed from your phone’s camera. Below, a grid of faces, some of them representing individuals, others repre­senting groups. My grid had four cells: my mom, my dad, my sister, and a group collecting all three. Just like Snapchat or Instagram, you tapped to capture a photo, pressed to record a video. As soon as you lifted your finger, your message zipped away, with no editing, no reviewing. A “stack” of messages awaited you in the corner, and, after you tapped through them, they were&nbsp;discarded.</p>
<p>It was all so simple that it was barely there. Tapstack more closely approx­i­mated a clear pane of glass than any app I’ve ever&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>For several years, Tapstack was the main channel for my family’s communication. The app didn’t lend itself to practical corre­spon­dence or logis­tical coordination; its strength was ambient presence. I&nbsp;met one of Tapstack’s designers once, and they told me it seemed espe­cially popular with far-flung families: a diaspora app. Because there was no threading and no history, messages didn’t carry the burden of an expected reply. Really, they were just a carrier wave for another sentiment, and that sentiment was always the same: I’m thinking of&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>A selfie with coffee, a picture of an ice-covered pond, a video of my nephews acting silly: I’m thinking of you, I’m thinking of you, I’m thinking of&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>It never seemed to me that Tapstack attracted a huge number of users. I&nbsp;don’t know if the company ever made a cent. There was no adver­tising in the app, and they never asked their users to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>Why didn’t they ask us to&nbsp;pay?</p>
<p>In 2019, I&nbsp;felt a rising dread as the months ticked by and the app didn’t receive a single update. Sure enough, in the fall, Tapstack announced that it was shutting down. It offered its users a way to export their data. It went&nbsp;gracefully.</p>
<p>It was, I&nbsp;have to say, a really great&nbsp;app.</p>
<h2>Here comes a new challenger</h2>
<p>My family all agreed we were going to need a replacement, and while my first instinct was to set up a group on Instagram or WhatsApp, the prospect of having our warm channel <span>surrounded — </span><wbr>encroached <span>upon — </span><wbr>by all that other garbage made me feel even sadder than the prospect of losing&nbsp;Tapstack.</p>
<p>So, instead of settling for a corporate messaging app … </p>
<p>I&nbsp;built one just for&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I’ll show you the screen capture again, but the point is that there’s not much to show. The app is a “magic window” that captures photos and videos and shuttles them around. Messages wait in a queue and, once <span>viewed — </span><wbr>always full-screen, with no distractions, no prods to comment or <span>share — </span><wbr>they disappear. That is literally it. The app has basically no interface. There’s a camera button and a badge in the corner, calm green, that indicates how many messages are&nbsp;waiting.</p>

<p>Here are a few mildly technical observations. Feel free to skip ahead if this part doesn’t interest&nbsp;you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tapstack was simple to start with, and I&nbsp;made it even simpler. Unlike Tapstack, my app doesn’t need a login system. It doesn’t need an interface to create and manage contacts. It already knows exactly who’s using it. (This makes me think about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040411202042/http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">an old blog post</a> by Clay Shirky: “Situated software, by contrast, doesn’t need to be <span>personalized — </span><wbr>it is personal from its inception.”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core of the app is a camera view with the now-familiar tap/press for photo/video affordance. This is an <a href="https://github.com/Awalz/SwiftyCam?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">off-the-rack open source component</a>; what a gift. I&nbsp;don’t think this project would have been possible without&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the app itself, not much is required: an AWS S3 bucket to hold the photos and videos, a couple of AWS Lambda functions to shuffle things around when new messages are uploaded. The back end is actually fairly <span>elegant — </span><wbr>which is, uh, not usually my <span>style — </span><wbr>but, again, that’s only because it’s so simple. There’s barely anything&nbsp;there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&nbsp;distributed the app to my family using TestFlight, and in Test­Flight it shall remain forever: a cozy, eternal&nbsp;beta.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a better world, I&nbsp;would have built this in a day, using some kind of modern, flexible HyperCard for&nbsp;iOS.</p>
<p>In our actual world, I&nbsp;built it in about a week, and roughly half of that time was spent wrestling with different flavors of code-signing and identity provi­sioning and I&nbsp;don’t even know what. I&nbsp;burned some incense and threw some stones and the gods of Xcode allowed me to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>Our actual world isn’t totally broken. I&nbsp;do not take for granted, not for one millisecond, the open source compo­nents and sample code that made this project possible. In the 21st century, as long as you’re operating within the bounds of the state of the art, program­ming can feel delight­fully Lego-like. All you have to do is rake your fingers through the&nbsp;bin.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;ought to pay it forward and publish the code for my app. Even if it doesn’t work for anyone else as-is, it might provide a helpful <span>guide — </span><wbr>one I&nbsp;would have been grateful to have. But the code is marbled with application-specific values, well-salted with authen­ti­ca­tion keys. This app is Entirely <span>Itself — </span><wbr>not a framework, not a <span>template — </span><wbr>and that’s insep­a­rable from the spirit in which it was made. Which brings me&nbsp;to:</p>
<h2>Cooking at home<a name="cooking-at-home"></a></h2>
<p>For a long time, I&nbsp;have struggled to artic­u­late what kind of programmer I&nbsp;am. I’ve been writing code for most of my life; I&nbsp;can make many inter­esting and useful things happen on computers. At the same time, I&nbsp;would not last a day as a profes­sional software engineer. Leave me in charge of a critical database and you will return to a smoldering&nbsp;crater.</p>
<p>Building this app, I&nbsp;figured it&nbsp;out:</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am the program­ming equiv­a­lent of a home&nbsp;cook.</p>
<p>The exhor­ta­tion “learn to code” has its foun­da­tions in market value. “Learn to code” is suggested as a way up, a way out. “Learn to code” offers economic leverage, profes­sional transformation. “Learn to code” goes on your&nbsp;resume.</p>
<p>But let’s substi­tute a different phrase: “learn to cook”. People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But many more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably. Because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn because they’re bored! Or even because they enjoy spending time with the person who’s teaching&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The list of reasons to “learn to cook” overflows, and only a handful have anything to do with the marketplace. Cooking reaches beyond buying and selling to touch nearly all of human experience. It connects to domes­ticity and curiosity; to history and culture; to care and&nbsp;love.</p>
<p>Well, it’s the 21st century now, and I&nbsp;suspect that many of the people you love are waiting inside the pocket computer you are never long without, so I&nbsp;will gently suggest that perhaps coding might connect the same&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>When you liberate program­ming from the require­ment to be profes­sional and <small>scalable</small>, it becomes a different activity altogether, just as cooking at home is really nothing like cooking in a commer­cial kitchen. I&nbsp;can report to you: not only is this different activity rewarding in almost exactly the same way that cooking for someone you love is rewarding, there’s another feeling, too, specific to this realm. I&nbsp;have struggled to find words for this, but/and I&nbsp;think it might be the crux of the whole&nbsp;thing:</p>
<p>This messaging app I&nbsp;built for, and with, my family, it won’t change unless we want it to change. There will be no sudden redesign, no flood of ads, no pivot to chase a userbase inscrutable to us. It might go away at some point, but that will be our decision. What <em>is</em> this feeling? Independence? Security? Sovereignty?</p>
<p>Is it simply … the feeling of being&nbsp;home?</p>
<p><em>Update, February 2022:</em> Two years later, my family still uses BoopSnoop every day. I&nbsp;have added one (1) feature, at my mother’s&nbsp;request.</p>
<p><em>Update, February 2023:</em> Yep, still using it every&nbsp;day!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-autopogo="">
<p>Planning to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/infestation-88-steamboat-willy-horror-game" target="_self"><u>utilize</u></a> new public domain works featuring Mickey Mouse this year? Well, here's a case you should certainly pay attention to.</p><p>On Thursday, voice actor and YouTuber Brock Baker uploaded a new video, titled "Steamboat Willie (Brock's Dub),"&nbsp; to his YouTube channel with more than 1 million subscribers.</p>
<p>The video contains the entirety of the 1928 Disney animated short "Steamboat Willie," with Baker providing his own comedic voice overs and sound effects throughout the less than 8 minute long cartoon.</p><blockquote>

</a>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Baker, shortly after uploading the clip though, YouTube <a href="https://twitter.com/BrockBaker/status/1743009587475665205" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>demonetized</u></a> the video, evidently on behalf of the erstwhile copyright owner, Disney. Baker also shared a screenshot to his X account showing the video was also being blocked from view in some territories as well.</p><blockquote>

</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to this year, nothing here would be out of the ordinary. Disney is very protective of its copyrighted works and would likely be especially so of a film like <em>Steamboat Willie</em> as it stars its most iconic character, Mickey Mouse.</p><p>However, <em>Steamboat Willie</em> along with that 1928 version of Mickey Mouse, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-disney-public-domain" target="_self"><u>entered the public domain</u></a> on January 1, 2024. This means that a video like Baker's should be completely fine for the YouTuber to not only create and distribute, but monetize as well.</p><p>Baker could likely make a fair use or parody defense for his dubbed version of <em>Steamboat Willie</em>, but as Duke University's Jennifer Jenkins, a professor of law teaching intellectual property, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-public-domain-so-far" target="_self"><u>told Mashable this week</u></a>, he doesn't even need to make that argument. Public domain works are considered public property.&nbsp;</p><p>"Reproducing and adapting the footage in whatever way you like is legit," Jenkins told Mashable.</p><p>As soon as "Steamboat Willie" became public domain earlier this week, multiple different creative projects using the iconic mouse were announced. Some of these creative works include a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/steamboat-willie-horror-film-mickey-mouse-public-domain-copyright-1235849861/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>horror movie</u></a> and a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/infestation-88-steamboat-willy-horror-game" target="_self"><u>video game</u></a>.</p>
<p>So, what happened with Baker's video? Mashable has reached out to YouTube to find out more information and will update this post when we hear back. However, due to how quickly Disney's copyright claim was issued after Baker uploaded his "Steamboat Willie" video, it's likely the video was a victim of the automated Content ID process.</p><p>"Videos uploaded to YouTube are scanned against a database of audio and visual content that's been submitted to YouTube by copyright owners," reads YouTube's policy page on its <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Content ID</u></a> feature. "When Content ID finds a match, it applies a Content ID claim to the matching video."</p><p>If this is the case, YouTube nor Disney appear to have updated the database to remove works that have recently entered the public domain. And, if so, it seems that should certainly be programmed into the Content ID system as an automated process, much like the valid claims are.</p><p>Mashable will keep you updated on the status of Baker's video.</p>

<p>As I lay in bed, I realized that this was a better match than I initially thought. Forget the CSV part, row references are what let Excel do <em>computation.</em> And while you could make that work with assembly, there’s an alternative that’s a much better fit: LLVM.</p>

<h3 id="ssa-format">SSA Format</h3>

<p><a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is a library for building compilers and related tools—the one used by Swift and Rust, actually.<sup id="fnref:gcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gcc" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> At its core is a stripped-down language also called LLVM, or maybe “<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">the LLVM instruction set</a>”. What’s unique about this language, besides being designed as an intermediate stage for compiling higher-level languages, is that every local variable is assigned a value exactly once, as a simple expression that can only depend on the variables that come before it. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form">static single-assignment form</a>.</p>

<p>My insight, which I don’t think is new, is that Excel formulas work the same way. Any cell with a formula has that formula defined up front, and values flow through the spreadsheet based on the references set in the formulas—just like SSA. So it should be possible, for operations supported by both LLVM and Excel, to rewrite an LLVM function as an Excel sheet that performs the same computation!</p>

<p>I went to sleep excited about that idea. I woke up and realized the primary problem with it: what about loops?</p>

<h3 id="phi-nodes">Phi Nodes</h3>

<p>In order for SSA to represent branching control flow (such as a conditional increment), it has to have some notion of history when the branches join back up. The conventional way to do this is with a special kind of expression called a <em>phi node,</em> which basically says “if we came from the true block, use x<sub>1</sub> as the value; if we came from the else block, use x<sub>2</sub> as the value”. The name “phi” isn’t short for anything; it’s apparently just meant to be close to “fi”, as in “if” backwards.<sup id="fnref:args" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:args" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> This form works for switches as well (there are just more possible predecessors), and even loops: the predecessor of a loop body might be the entry of the loop, or it might be the last block in the <em>previous</em> time through the loop.</p>

<p>But spreadsheets don’t have loops, do they? I searched around a bit and discovered I was incorrect: Excel spreadsheets <em>do</em> support loops, in the form of “iterative calculation”. As long as the formulas converge on a fixed point within a certain number of steps, Excel will find it. So now I need to figure out how to encode loops in such a way that they do, in fact, converge.</p>

<p>At this point I got up from my bed and started messing around in Google Sheets. (It was a weekend, I didn’t have to go to work.) And I hit on a solution: a variation of the classic “program counter” used by real CPUs. If you keep track of the number of blocks you’ve visited, counting repeats, then you always know what the “current” block is, and more importantly what the “previous” block was. Which means you can implement phi nodes.</p>

<p>Here’s what a phi expression looks like in Excel:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>=CHOOSE(</code></td>
      <td>A phi is a choice…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>  XMATCH(</code></td>
      <td>of values based on a source…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>    MAX(</code></td>
      <td>which is the most recent (max) PC…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>      IF(B5=ROW(),C5,0),</code></td>
      <td>of the branch in row 5, if it was coming here…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>      IF(B10=ROW(),C10,0),</code></td>
      <td>the branch in row 10, if it was coming here…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>      C7-0.5),</code></td>
      <td>and the current row, 7, as a last resort…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>    {C5,C10,C7-0.5}),</code></td>
      <td>which we get as an index with <code>XMATCH</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>  B4,B8,B7)</code></td>
      <td>and <code>CHOOSE</code> the correct value</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not pretty but it gets the job done. And with that, I knew it was possible, and I set off to build the compiler.</p>

<h3 id="the-compiler">The Compiler</h3>

<p>The actual compiler is a scant 150 lines of code, partly because it barely implements anything, but also because it’s not actually doing much work. All of the hard parts are in LLVM (and its wrapper, <a href="https://github.com/llvm-swift/LLVMSwift">LLVMSwift</a>, which <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/LLVMSwift/">I did have to fork</a>) and <a href="https://libxlsxwriter.github.io/">xslxwriter</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/damuellen/xlsxwriter.swift">its own wrapper</a>). Without these pre-existing libraries, doing this in a day would have been impossible.</p>

<p>The compiler makes two passes over a single LLVM function: one to assign rows to instructions and basic blocks, and one to translate each instruction into a formula, 1:1. There are only three relevant columns: a label with the instruction type, the value of each instruction, and the “program counter” described above. <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/CellLVM/">You can read the whole thing if you want.</a></p>

<p>The result is a command-line tool that takes LLVM bitcode as input and produces an xlsx file as output. It throws an error if there’s more than one function in the input, or if there’s an operation it doesn’t support (like, say, subtraction). But I do consider it a valid proof of concept! And a successful project, of course—which is important when <a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/2021/07/Keyboard-Pants/">I can’t spend much time on computers outside of work these days.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_K4gMtS0GGviPAIFkhGZmXXFXvuaAatxcx2ulM1XZXk/edit">The output from the video above is on Google Sheets</a>, though you’ll have to make your own copy if you want to “run” it. It adds its two inputs, then doubles them until the result is greater than 50. (Which is about all the current implementation knows how to handle.)</p>

<h3 id="future-directions-alloca">Future Directions: alloca</h3>

<p>One thing that’s <em>not</em> implemented in this proof-of-concept is alloca, i.e. local variables. This is both inconvenient, because that’s the default for a non-optimized build, and a definite missing piece for <em>truly</em> compiling LLVM to a spreadsheet. The thing is, LLVM’s load and store instructions are <em>definitely</em> imperative, in a way that spreadsheets aren’t. So to actually represent a memory location, we’d probably need to express a load as “the value of the most recent store with a matching location”, similar to how we represented a phi as “one of several values based on the most recent basic block”. There’s probably some trickiness around loops as well—maybe the “program counter” actually should count instructions and not just basic blocks, so “most recent” can include “but not in my future”.</p>

<p>Once here, it’s still a jump to <em>arbitrary</em> memory allocation, but maybe not as big of one as it could be. As long as stores are broken up into individual fields, we could say that column H represents heap memory, and column I the instant when it was last modified. This would be a formula involving <em>every store instruction in the program,</em> but it might work. I haven’t tried to work out the details, though.</p>

<h3 id="future-directions-a-call-stack">Future Directions: A Call Stack</h3>

<p>Another major omission is function calls. For non-recursive functions this is mostly a weird kind of branch/phi combination, but for recursive functions we have a problem: all our local SSA variables need to do double duty! I don’t have a good idea of how to do this one short of using <em>columns</em> to represent stack frames. (In which a stack overflow would be running out of columns that have the right formulas.) That would also be neat because you could <em>see the call stack,</em> but I haven’t thought through if it would actually work.</p>

        <p>
            Imitation learning from human demonstrations has shown impressive performance in robotics. However, most results focus on table-top manipulation, lacking the mobility and dexterity necessary for generally useful tasks.
            In this work, we develop a system for imitating mobile manipulation tasks that are bimanual and require whole-body control.
            We first present Mobile ALOHA, a low-cost and whole-body teleoperation system for data collection. It augments the ALOHA system with a mobile base, and a whole-body teleoperation interface.
            Using data collected with Mobile ALOHA, we then perform supervised behavior cloning and find that co-training with existing static ALOHA datasets boosts performance on mobile manipulation tasks.
            With 50 demonstrations for each task, co-training can increase success rates by up to 90%, allowing Mobile ALOHA to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sauteing and serving a piece of shrimp,
            opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking pots, calling and entering an elevator,
            and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen faucet.

<p dir="auto">Or "How I sped up <a href="https://neat-lang.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Neat</a> by a factor of 2x".</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">If you check the <a href="https://github.com/jinyus/related_post_gen/">related_post_gen</a> benchmark, you will find that Neat,
my language, has moved up a few spots. How did I achieve this? Did I implement new high-level optimizer
passes that use language details to expose hidden optimization potential?</p>
<p dir="auto">I changed arrays to be passed as three pointer parameters instead of one parameter consisting of a
three-pointer struct. That's it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This problem has been vexing me for a long time. Neat seemed weirdly slower than it should have been,
particularly compared to D, and if I looked at a profiler I would be seeing a lot of weird stack moves.
The compiler seemed to be spending most of its time rearranging large amounts of the stack for function calls.</p>
<p dir="auto">Why are Neat arrays three pointers? As opposed to D, Neat employs a refcounter. That means that arrays, in addition
to start and end, also need a pointer to the base of the array object, where the reference count is stored.
It turns out the reason that D arrays are fast and Neat arrays are so slow is just because having 24 bytes instead of
16 puts them into a different regime of parameter passing.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we check <a href="https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/x86_64-abi-0.99.pdf" rel="nofollow">the SystemV AMD64 ABI specification</a> (PDF),
it tells us that any struct greater than 16 bytes is passed by pointer.
("If the size of the aggregate exceeds two eightbytes and the first eightbyte isn’t SSE or any other
eightbyte isn’t SSEUP, the whole argument is passed in memory.")
To pass a struct by memory, we allocate a struct-sized spot on the stack, fill it with the values we pass, then
pass the pointer to the function.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, LLVM is a very good optimizer, but this does not leave it much room. The value <em>has</em> to go on the stack, which
means there must be space for it there, it must be copied out of the register it is probably living in, and
it has to remember which parts of the stack are in use and which ones can be reused by another call, which it turns
out to be pretty poor at.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can demonstrate the issue with this benchmark:</p>
<pre><code>==========
harness.h:
==========

#define TYPE double

struct Vector { TYPE x, y, z; };

struct Vector vector_add_struct(struct Vector left, struct Vector right);

struct Vector vector_add_fields(

        left_y + right_y,
        left_z + right_z,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">As you can see, depending on parameters, this either passes some values as separate parameters or a single large struct.
The mode and run length are passed on the commandline to prevent the optimizer from constant folding everything.</p>
<p dir="auto">We must compile impl.c separately to avoid inlining:</p>
<pre><code>clang -O3 impl.c -c -o impl.o
clang -O3 harness.c impl.o -o benchmark
time ./benchmark 0 1000000000
time ./benchmark 1 1000000000
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">This is hardly subtle: with just the change of passing three separate fields instead of a vector struct, I go
from 12.3 seconds to 5.3 seconds!</p>
<p dir="auto">If we check the assembly, we can indeed see that a lot of instructions are occupied with stack shuffles.
In fact, a major benefit of the field version is that the parameters already enter the function in SSE registers, rather
than having to be loaded from the stack every time. This was the whole point of the SystemV ABI and its focus on
passing values in registers as much as possible, so it's kind of sad to see it fail here. I believe with the number of
registers available on AMD64, a benchmark would have shown by-value passing to be valuable even for types above 16 bytes.</p>
<p dir="auto">In fact, if you think about what the code does, by writing the fields on the stack and then (explicitly rather than
implicitly) passing a pointer, the (new, performant) AMD64 System V ABI has effectively regressed to the old x86 cdecl
ABI, where everything was passed on the stack! Cdecl, famously, was so known for its slowness that it spawned multiple
calling conventions aimed just at making it fast.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, in any real situation this code would be all inlined. In fact, turning on LTO with gcc (though interestingly
not clang!) erases any performance difference between the two versions. But still, not every function can or
should be inlined.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, if you are calling a C API, you have to use the C ABI. But lots of high-level types internal to non-C languages,
though they may be presented to the compiler's backend as a struct (such as Neat's three-pointer arrays), don't strictly
speaking <em>need</em> to be expressed as one. You are the language writer, and it's up to you to decide how arrays,
tuples, sumtypes etc. are passed. That's why I chose to pass all of those (if above 16 bytes) as individual fields instead,
and the benchmark shows the benefit.</p>
<p dir="auto">So if you are on AMD64, and you're either working on languages or microoptimizing an API, I advise you to take
the free speedup. You should at least benchmark to see if you can benefit from splitting structs above 16 bytes manually.
Especially in inner loops, the benefit can be surprisingly large.</p>
<p dir="auto">Addendum:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Q: Sure, maybe this is true for structs of pointers. But <code>double</code> is in class SSE, according to the spec.
Why isn't the struct passed in SSE registers anyways?</li>
<li>A: Man I don't know. All I can tell you is that it doesn't.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Modern Java/JVM Build Practices</strong> is an article-as-repo on building modern
Java/JVM projects using
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html" rel="nofollow">Gradle</a> and
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html" rel="nofollow">Maven</a>, and a <em>starter project</em>
for Java.</p>
<p dir="auto">The focus is <em>best build practices</em> and <em>project hygiene</em>.
This document is <em>agnostic</em> between Gradle and Maven: discussion in each section
covers both tools (alphabetical order, Gradle before Maven).
See <a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/final-take-gradle/" rel="nofollow"><em>My Final Take on Gradle (vs.
Maven)</em></a> for an opinionated view.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not a JVM starter for only Java:
I use it for starting my Kotlin projects, and substitute complilation and code
quality plugins.
Any language on the JVM can find practices and tips.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a <em>guide</em>, this project focuses on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A quick starter for JVM projects using Gradle or Maven.
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/fork">Fork</a> me,
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices.git">clone</a> me, copy/paste
freely!
I am <a href="http://unlicense.org/" rel="nofollow"><em>Public Domain</em></a></li>
<li>Discuss—and illustrate (through code)—sensible default practices;
highlight good build tools and plugins</li>
<li>Document pitfalls that turned up.
Some were easy to address after Internet search; some were challenging
(see "Tips" sections)</li>
<li>Do not be an "all-in-one" solution. You know your circumstances best.
I hope this project helps you discover build improvements you love.
Please share with others through
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/issues">issues</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/pulls">PRs</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Two recurring themes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Shift problems left</em> — Find issues earlier in your build—before
you see them in production</li>
<li><em>Make developer life easier</em> — Automate build tasks often done by
hand: get your build to complain (<em>fail</em>) locally before sharing with your
team, or fail in CI before deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is a <em>Starter</em>?</h3>
<p dir="auto">A project starter has several goals:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Help a new project get up and running with minimal fuss</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This starter project is focused on <em>build</em>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Easy on-ramp for new folks to try out your project for themselves</li>
<li>Support new contributors to your project that they become productive quickly</li>
<li>Support current contributors in the build, get out of their way, and make
everyday things easy</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This starter project has minimal dependencies.
The focus is on Gradle and Maven plugins and configuration so that you and
contributors can focus on the code, not on setting up the build.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Summing up</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.</em>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532211-i-m-not-a-great-programmer-i-m-just-a-good-programmer" rel="nofollow">Kent Beck</a></li>
<li><em>Make it work, make it right, make it fast</em>
— <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast" rel="nofollow">C2 Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — This is a <em>living document</em>.
The project is frequently updated to pick up new dependency or plugin
versions, and improved practices; this README updates recommendations.
This is part of what <em>great habits</em> look like.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Hi! I want you to have <em>awesome builds</em> 🟢. If you're on a <em>Java</em> project,
or a project on any
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" rel="nofollow">JVM language</a></em>
(Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, Java, Jython, Kotlin, Scala, <em>et al</em>), this article is
for you.
This article assumes you are using Gradle or Maven for your build locally, and
in CI.
Some of you are using other build systems native to your source language.
Please follow along!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is the goal of this article?</strong> I want to highlight modern practies in
building Java/JVM projects with Gradle or Maven, and provide guidance, or at
least food for thought.
The sample Gradle and Maven projects use Java, but most recommendations apply to
builds for <em>any</em> JVM language.
I'll never be as clever or as talented as <a href="http://poignant.guide/book/" rel="nofollow"><em>why the lucky stiff</em></a>, but I
hope writing this makes you, developers, and others happy.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the wheel to the right?
<em>No, you do not need to be agile!</em>
(But I encourage you to explore the benefits of Agile.)
This article is for you regardless of how your team approaches software.
The point is to <em>"make people awesome"</em> for any project, possibly the most key
value of the Agile approach to software.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Principles in designing these builds</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><em>Make it work</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Can I as a Day 1 developer build the project locally?</li>
<li>Can I hand the project off to someone else to try?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Make it right</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Can I reproduce issues in the CI build, and fix it locally?</li>
<li>Can I find code and security issues from running the build?</li>
<li>Is the code clean? Am I happy to explore the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Make it fast</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Can I run the local build as frequently as I like, and be productive?</li>
<li>Can I have a fast cycle of code &amp; test? What about red-green-refactor?</li>
<li>Can I update my dependencies and plugins quickly and easily?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals for this project</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Starter build scripts for Modern Java/JVM builds in Gradle and Maven, helpful
for new projects, or refurbishing existing projects</li>
<li>Quick solutions for raising project quality and security in your local build</li>
<li>Shift <em>problems to the left</em> ("to the left" meaning earlier in the development
cycle). You'll get earlier feedback while still having a fast local build.
Time spent fixing issues locally is better than waiting on CI to fail, or
worse, for production to fail</li>
<li>The article focuses on Gradle and Maven: these are the most used build tools
for Modern Java/JVM projects. However, if you use a different build tool, the
principals still apply</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I want to help with the question: <em>I am in Day 1 on my project</em>: How do I begin
with a local build that supports my team through the project lifetime?
And when I have an existing project, how to I catch up?</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goal of this article</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://modernagile.org/" rel="nofollow"><em>Make people awesome</em></a> (that means <em>you</em>). This
project is based on the experiences of many, and experiments with Modern
Java/JVM builds, and shares lessons learned with you.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/fork" title="Reuse">
<img src="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/raw/master/images/reuse.png" alt="Reuse" width="20%" height="auto">
</a>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reusing this project</h2>
<p dir="auto">Don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/fork"><em>fork
me</em></a> or <em>clone</em> me! This
is <a href="http://unlicense.org/" rel="nofollow"><em>Public Domain</em></a> software: it is meant to be reused
by you however is sensible.
If you fork, I take care that upstream pulls work, but I'd like to <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/issues">hear from
you</a> if you have
trouble.
See also: <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices#cleaning-up"><em>Cleaning
up</em></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sensible approaches:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fork this project, and work from there, pulling down improvements (usually
version bumps on tools and dependencies)</li>
<li>Clone this project to a new repository, and work from there. Manually pull
over improvements (there is <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices#keep-plugins-and-dependencies-up-to-date">tooling to
help</a>)</li>
<li>Read through this repository's code and changes, and update your own
repository by hand, useful for existing repositories</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you cloned this project as a starter, you may want to stay updated on
improvements:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git remote add upstream https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices.git
git fetch upstream
git merge master/upstream"><pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices.git
git fetch upstream
git merge master/upstream
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once you are happy with your project, you should think about removing the
upstream remote, and reviewing changes in this repository by hand.
Your decision might depend on what merge conflicts you encounter.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Consider <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30001304/clone-git-repository-without-history" rel="nofollow"><em>Clone git repository without
history?</em></a>
to start at the current tip of this project. For example, some images in
<code>README.md</code> started overlarge in earlier versions, something you may not want
in a clone</li>
<li><em>Caution</em>: Not all the images used in <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> may be in the
Public Domain (this is challenging to research). Use due diligence before
sharing your clone, and other licenses may apply for these images in a
global context</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Irrelevant files</h3>
<p dir="auto">This project includes files which are helpful for maintaining itself, but may
be irrelevant to you. Some, however, may prove helpful in specific contexts as
noted:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/build-as-ci-does.sh"><code>build-as-ci-does.sh</code></a>
Helpful when CI has steps that local developers do not, and you want to
reproduce or explore locally a CI problem. The script should match the
actions your CI takes on pushes (this project uses GitHub actions)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/compare-tooling-versions.sh"><code>compare-tooling-versions-sh</code></a>
If your project supports <em>both</em> Gradle and Maven builds (unlikely), a
quick way to look at dependency and plugin versions between the two.
Note that the ouput needs <em>human</em> reading: the same tool version may appear
as different lines when comparing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/coverage.sh"><code>coverage</code></a>
Checks if the local code passes at given levels of code coverage.
The script is focused on Maven, but with edits would do the same for Gradle.
This supports the <a href="#leverage-unit-testing-and-coverage">"ratchet" pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-gradle.sh"><code>run-with-gradle.sh</code></a>
If you are a Gradle project, you will likely rename this to just <code>run</code> or
similar</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-maven.sh"><code>run-with-maven.sh</code></a>
If you are a Maven project, you will likely rename this to just <code>run</code> or
similar</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a>.
Please <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/issues">file issues</a>,
or contribute <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/pulls">pull
requests</a>!
I'd love a conversation with you.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">You and your project</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are simple ways to make your project great. Some goals to strive for:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Visitors and new developers get off to a quick start, and can understand what
the build does (if they are interested)</li>
<li>Users of your project trust it—the build does what it says on the
tin—, and they feel safe relying on your project</li>
<li>You don't get peppered with questions that are answered "in the source"
—because not everyone wants to read the source, and you'd rather be
coding than answering questions ☺</li>
<li>Coding should feel easy. You solve <em>real</em> problems, and do not spend overmuch
much time on build details: your build supports you</li>
<li>Your code passes "smell tests": no simple complaints, and you are proud of
what others see. <em>Hey!</em> You're a professional, and it shows. (This is one of
my personal fears as a programmer)</li>
<li>Your project is "standard", meaning, the build is easily grasped by those
familiar with standard techniques and tooling</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Hopefully this article and the sample build scripts help you!</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting your project started</h2>
<p dir="auto">To get a project off to a good start, consider these items. Even for existing
projects, you should address these as you go along or while refurbishing an
existing project:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Team agreement comes first</strong>. Make sure everyone is onboard and clear on
what build standards are, and understands—at least as an
outline—what the build does for them</li>
<li>Provide a <em>good</em> <code>README.md</code>. This saves you a ton of time in the long run.
This is your <em>most important</em> step. A good resource is Yegor's
<a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Elegant READMEs</em></a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/" rel="nofollow">Intelligent laziness is a virtue</a>. Time
invested in good documentation pays off</li>
<li>A good <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> answers visitors questions, so you don't
spend time answering trivial questions, and explains/justifies your
project to others.</li>
<li>Fight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Conway's Law</a> with
communication!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick a version of Java, and stick to it throughout your local build, CI
pipeline, and environment deployments. <em>Do not mix versions.</em></li>
<li>Pick <strong>Gradle</strong> or <strong>Maven</strong>, and use only one. This project provides both to
demonstrate equivalent builds for each. See
<a href="#use-gradle-or-maven">Use Gradle or Maven</a> for more discussion</li>
<li>Use build wrappers committed into your project root. These run Gradle or
Maven, and coders should always invoke <code>./gradlew</code> or <code>./mvnw</code> (use shell
<em>aliases</em> if these grow tiresome to type)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Build wrappers are shell scripts to run Gradle or Maven. The wrapper takes
care of downloading needed tools without getting in the way. New
contributors and developers can start right away; they do not need to
install more software</li>
<li>For Gradle, use
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html" rel="nofollow"><code>./gradlew</code></a>
(part of Gradle)</li>
<li>For Maven, use <a href="https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/" rel="nofollow"><code>./mvnw</code></a> (a plugin)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always run CI on push to a shared repository. It's a sad panda when someone is
excited about their commit, and then the commit breaks the other developers
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In CI, use caches for dependency downloads; this speeds up the feedback
cycle from CI (see <a href="#setup-your-ci">below</a>)</li>
<li>When sensible, move code quality and security checks into local builds
before changes hit CI (see <a href="#setup-local-ci">below</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick a common code style, and stay consistent; update tooling to complain on
style violations
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The team should agree on a common code style, <em>eg</em>, SUN, Google, <em>et al</em></li>
<li>See <a href="#use-linting">Use linting</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Consider using client-side Git hooks for <code>pre-push</code> to run a full, clean,
local build. This helps ensure "oopsies" from going to CI where they impact
everyone. The options are broad. Try web searches on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>"gradle install git hooks"</li>
<li>"maven install git hooks"</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This article presently has no specific recommendations on choices of plugin or
approach for Git hooks.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The JDK</h2>
<p dir="auto">For any Modern Java/JVM project, the first decision is <em>which version of Java
(the JDK)</em> to use? Some guidelines:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Java 17 is the most current LTS ("long-term support") version</li>
<li>There are more recent versions with continuing improvements and additional
features to try out</li>
<li>If your personal or open-source project does not require a paid support
contract, newer Java versions are a good choice</li>
<li>For a full breakdown of the current JDK landscape (as of Jul 2022), see
<a href="https://tomgregory.com/which-jdk-version-and-vendor/" rel="nofollow"><em>Which JDK Version and Vendor Should You Use on Your
Project?</em></a>, and a short
list of recommendations at <a href="https://whichjdk.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Which Version of JDK Should I
Use?</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In this project, you'll see the choice of Java 17 as this is the version to
recommend in production.</p>
<p dir="auto">In general, you will find that <a href="https://adoptium.net/" rel="nofollow">Adoptium</a> is a go-to
choice for the JDK.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In Maven, use a property to <em>fix</em> the version of Java in place. But note
naming for that property: <code>java.version</code> is defined by the JVM, and Maven
creates a matching property. Recommended is to define your Java version with
the <code>jdk.version</code> property, which has no collision with pre-defined
properties</li>
<li>In Gradle, use the <code>javaToolchains</code> task to investigate issues with
mismatching or confusing build paths, project configuration, and Gradle
sorting it out. This is an issue for local-only builds; local builds using a
container (such as via <a href="#setup-local-ci"><em>Batect</em></a>) lower these concerns</li>
<li>In GitHub Actions, building supports cross-checking multiple JVM versions,
use
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs">the <code>matrix</code> feature</a>.
See <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-batect-maven.yml">the example GitHub actions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Managing your Java environment</h3>
<p dir="auto">Two best-of-class tools come to mind to manage your JDK environment in projects:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#jenv">jEnv</a></li>
<li><a href="#direnv">Direnv</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both assume UNIX-type shells (Bash, Zsh, etc).</p>
<p dir="auto">For those on Windows, you may need to use Cygwin, Git for Windows, or WSL2 to
use these.</p>
<p dir="auto">(Reminder: in general, when setting up your project environment, prefer the
latest LTS version of Java, which is 17.)</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Jenv</h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.jenv.be/" rel="nofollow">jEnv</a> supports both "global" (meaning you, the user)
and "project" choices of JDK (particular to a directory and its children) in
which JDK installation to use. You may notice the
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.java-version"><code>.java-version</code></a> file: this is a per-project file for jEnv to
pick your project Java version.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do use <code>jenv enable-plugins export</code> and restart your shell. This ensures
<code>JAVA_HOME</code> is exported to match your jEnv settings. Several tools use
<code>JAVA_HOME</code> rather than the <code>java</code> or <code>javac</code> found in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also find the <code>gradle</code> and <code>maven</code> plugins for jEnv useful.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are many ways to install the JDK, most are platform-dependent. In general,
your team will be better off using a "managed" approach, rather than with each
person using binary installers. Popular choices include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://adoptium.net/installation.html#linux-pkg" rel="nofollow">Apt and friends</a> for Linux
or WSL</li>
<li><a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> for Mac</li>
<li><a href="https://sdkman.io/jdks" rel="nofollow">SDKMAN</a> for multiple platforms</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Direnv</h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://direnv.net/" rel="nofollow">direnv</a> is more general. Rather than specifying a Java
version, you edit a <code>.envrc</code> file and add JDK-specific environment settings
(and another other environment settings) just as you would on the command-line.
Typically set are <code>PATH</code> to find <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> programs, and <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use Gradle or Maven</h2>
<p dir="auto">The choice between Gradle and Maven depends on your team, your broader
ecosystem, and your project needs. In summary:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Gradle — your build script is written in Groovy or Kotlin; dynamic,
imperative, and mutable; requires debugging your build on occasion, but less
verbose than Maven's XML. Use of "parent" (umbrella) projects is possible but
challenging. You can locally extend your build script either <em>inline</em>
with build code, with project plugins, or with plugins from a separate
project (perhaps shared across project for your team). If interested in custom
plugins,
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html" rel="nofollow">read more here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Maven — your build scripts is written in XML; declarative and immutable;
verbose but specific; it either works or not. Use of "parent" (umbrella)
projects is simple with built-in support. You can locally extend your build
with plugins from a separate project (perhaps shared across project for your
team). If interested in custom plugins,
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html" rel="nofollow">read more here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For Modern Java/JVM projects, <strong>use Gradle or Maven</strong>. The article doesn't cover
alternative build tools:
<a href="https://www.jrebel.com/blog/2020-java-technology-report#build-tool" rel="nofollow">industry data</a>
shows Gradle or Maven are the build tools for most folks. Unless you find
yourself in a complex monorepo culture (Google, <em>etc.</em>), or there are mandates
from above, you need to select one of Gradle or Maven. However, for projects not
using Gradle or Maven, you will still find improvements for your build herein
(though details will differ).</p>
<p dir="auto">For new projects, you may find <a href="https://start.spring.io/" rel="nofollow">Spring Initializr</a>,
<a href="https://micronaut.io/" rel="nofollow"><code>mn</code> from Micronaut</a>, or
<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/" rel="nofollow">JHipster</a>, among many other project excellent
starters, more to your liking: they provide you with starter Gradle or Maven
scripts specific for those frameworks. <em>That's great!</em> This article should
still help you improve your build beyond "getting started". You should pick
and choose build features as makes sense to you and your circumstances.</p>
<p dir="auto">This article offers <strong>no preference between Gradle or Maven</strong>. You need to
decide with your team and circumstances. After picking your build tool, you
might rename <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-gradle.sh">run-with-gradle.sh</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-maven.sh">runs-with-maven.sh</a> to just <code>run.sh</code> or similar.</p>
<p dir="auto">Projects using Ant <strong>should migrate</strong>. It is true that Ant is well-maintained
(the latest version dates from 2021). However, you will spend much effort in
providing modern build tooling, and effort in migrating from Ant is repaid in
smaller work for integrating modern tools. Data point: consider the number of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="nofollow">Stackoverflow</a> posts providing Gradle or
Maven answers to those for Ant.  <em>Consider Ant builds to be no longer
well-supported, and a form of
<a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html" rel="nofollow">Tech Debt</a>.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Throughout, when covering both Gradle and Maven, Gradle will be discussed first,
then Maven. This is no expressing a preference!  It is neutral alphabetical
ordering.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — Gradle Enterprise provides additional features for Maven as
well such as <a href="https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-build-cache/" rel="nofollow">build
caching</a> and <a href="#keep-your-build-fast">build
scans</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Cleaning up</h3>
<p dir="auto">Once you pick between Gradle or Maven, it is a good time to clean up.
If you have cloned the project, some renames/deletions to consider:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-gradle.sh">run-with-gradle.sh</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/run-with-maven.sh">runs-with-maven.sh</a> → just <code>run.sh</code> or <code>build.sh</code> or
anything you like. Remember to document in <code>README.md</code> for others</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/batect.yml">batect.yml</a> — update the task names, and remove those not
relevant. Again, don't forget about <code>README.md</code> instructions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-maven.yml">ci.yml</a> — update the jobs, and remove those
not relevant. Did I mention <code>README.md</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You are ready to make great software.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keeping Gradle or Maven up to date</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gradle</h4>
<p dir="auto">To update Gradle:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ $EDITOR gradle.properties  # Update gradleWrapperVersion property

$ ./mvnw wrapper:wra  <span><span>#</span> Confirm, and download files if needed</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that Maven wrapper is developing, and will be bundled with an upcoming
Maven release.
For now it is a separate plugin in your <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Take advantage of your shell's tab completion:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle-completion">Gradle completion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/juven/maven-bash-completion">Maven completion</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sample Gradle and Maven build scripts often specify specific versions of
the tooling, separate from the plugin versions. This is intentional. You
should be able to update the latest tool version even when the plugin has not
yet caught up</li>
<li>Gradle itself does not provide support for "profiles", a key Maven feature.
This is <em>different</em> from <em>profiling</em> build performance!  Maven profiles
can be used in many ways. The most common are to enabling/disabling build
features on the command line, tailoring the build to a particular deployment
environment, or using different credentials for other systems. If this
feature is important for your team, you can code <code>if/else</code> blocks directly
in <code>build.gradle</code>, or use a plugin such as
<a href="https://kordamp.org/kordamp-gradle-plugins/#_org_kordamp_gradle_profiles" rel="nofollow">Kordamp Profiles Gradle plugin</a>
(Kordamp has a suite of interesting Gradle plugins beyond this one; read more
on that page)</li>
<li>Gradle uses advanced terminal control, so you cannot always see what is
happening. To view Gradle steps plainly when debugging your build, use:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./gradlew <your tasks> | cat"><pre>$ ./gradlew <span>&lt;</span>your tasks<span>&gt;</span> <span>|</span> cat</pre></div>
or save the output to a file:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./gradlew <your tasks> | tee -o some-file"><pre>$ ./gradlew <span>&lt;</span>your tasks<span>&gt;</span> <span>|</span> tee -o some-file</pre></div>
</li>
<li>If your source code is in Kotlin, so should be your build. Gradle provides
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html" rel="nofollow">a Kotlin DSL for build scripts</a>
as a first-class counterpart to the traditional Groovy DSL</li>
<li>Maven colorizes output, but does not use terminal control to overwrite output</li>
<li>See <a href="#setup-your-ci">Setup your CI</a> for another approach to getting plain text
console output</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jcgay/maven-notifier">The Maven Notifier</a> may be to your
liking</li>
<li>If you like Maven, but XML isn't your thing, you might explore the
<a href="https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven"><em>Polyglot for Maven</em></a> extension
which provides the POM in multiple languages/formats (<em>eg</em>, Ruby, YAML, many
others)</li>
<li>If you have a multi-module Maven build, you might consider
<a href="http://takari.io/book/30-team-maven.html#takari-smart-builder" rel="nofollow"><em>Takari Smart
Builder</em></a>
to speed it up</li>
<li>Maven best practice is to specify the version for each plugin, <em>even default
plugins</em> that come with your version of Maven. This enforces
<strong>reproducible builds</strong>. See also the
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Maven Enforcer Plugin</a>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup your CI</h2>
<p dir="auto">Your CI is your "source of truth" for successful builds. Your goal:
<em>Everyone trusts a "green" CI build is solid</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using GitHub, a simple starting point is
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-gradle.yml"><code>ci-gradle.yml</code></a> or
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-maven.yml"><code>ci-maven.yml</code></a>.
(GitLab is similar, but as this project is hosted in GitHub, there is not a
simple means to demonstrate CI at GitLab).
This project includes a workflow for Gradle and a workflow for Maven as
examples.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you use GitLab, read about the equivalent in
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/" rel="nofollow"><em>GitLab CI/CD</em></a>, or for Jenkins in
<a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/" rel="nofollow"><em>Pipeline</em></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When publishing your project, consider
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/publishing-java-packages-with-maven"><em>Publishing Java packages with
Maven</em></a>
for GitHub, or equivalent for other CI systems.  <strong>Do not publish from local
builds.</strong>  For GitHub, note the limitations of
<a href="https://github.community/t/download-from-github-package-registry-without-authentication/14407" rel="nofollow"><em>Download from Github Package Registry without
authentication</em>.</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Save your CI artifacts</h3>
<p dir="auto">It is helpful to preserve your build artifacts from CI, for example, to
download built jars from different CI runs for comparing their behavior
between commits without needing to rebuild locally, and also to confirm that
your local build makes the same jars as CI does.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "Build with Gradle" and "Build with Maven" CI workflows each provide a
download named "jars", and the Maven build a "site" download.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are services to provide links to the most recent build artifacts.
One example is <a href="https://nightly.link/" rel="nofollow">nightly.link</a> (this is not an
endorsement).
You can use these links in your <code>README.md</code> or share as makes sense.
An example is
<a href="https://nightly.link/binkley/modern-java-practices/workflows/ci-maven/master/jars.zip" rel="nofollow">downloading the Maven-built jar</a>
from this project.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To disable ASCII colorizing printing as control sequences in CI, or
Gradle trying to overwrite lines (control sequences make for hard-to-read
CI logs), a simple approach is to use an environment setting:

This does not make sense for local builds, and your CI system (<em>eg</em>, GitHub)
may manage this problem already</li>
<li>With Gradle, use the <code>--warning-mode=all</code> flag for CI: this shows <em>all</em>
warnings Gradle generates, not just a summary. See
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings" rel="nofollow"><em>Showing or hiding
warnings</em></a>
for details</li>
<li>With Maven, use the <code>--no-transfer-progress</code> flag for CI: this avoids spamming
CI logs with download progress messages</li>
<li>For GitHub Actions, you may find a tool like
<a href="https://github.com/nektos/act"><code>act</code></a> useful for running CI actions locally
(it may not work for all projects, however, depending on your actions)</li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep local consistent with CI</h2>
<p dir="auto">What is "local CI"?
That sounds like a contradition.
Tooling helps you reproduce locally the same build that CI uses, so that you
suffer less from version drift and other type problems, and minimize
related environment issues.
A common example is building on different JVM/JDK versions.
Ideally, excepting truly environment-specific, your local build should fail
when CI would also fail so that you can catch problems earlier in your
development process before commits are shared.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup local CI</h3>
<p dir="auto">Reflecting the principle that local builds should be like CI builds, some
tools that greatly help:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://batect.dev/" rel="nofollow">Batect</a> is a solid tool from Charles Korn.
It runs your build in a "CI-like" local environment via Docker.
This is one of your first lines of defence against "it runs on my box".
(<a href="https://batect.dev/Comparison.html" rel="nofollow">Compare Batect</a> with other tools in this
space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://earthly.dev/" rel="nofollow">Earthly</a> shares philosophy with Batect and with a
different approach to implementation.
<strong>Feedback on Earthly</strong> is
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/issues/new/choose">appreciated</a>.
<em>Earthly is experimental</em> for the template project in this repository</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">They are <em>both good choices</em>, but not the only ones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>This is an important step</em>!
It is closer to your CI builds locally.
You should strive to keep local as faithful as possible to CI and Production.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may decide not to use CI-like tooling for local builds. However, consider
that use of them raises your confidence that CI will succeed. Local CI-like
tooling is part of the theme of <em>shifting left</em> for problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://batect.dev/tools/GitHubActions.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Working with CI systems</em></a>
for documentation on using Batect from within a dockerized CI environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — to be as consistent as possible, the sample
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-maven.yml"><code>ci.yml</code> for GitHub</a> uses Batect for the
Gradle and Maven builds, and <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/batect.yml"><code>batect.yml</code> for Batect</a> pulls
an image for <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk" rel="nofollow">AdoptOpenJDK</a>.
So <code>ci.yml</code> does not <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-java">setup JDK 17</a>
directly, but relies on Batect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Configure your local CI in <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/batect.yml"><code>batect.yml</code></a> or in
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/Earthfile"><code>Earthfile</code></a> with suitable tasks.
For this project, there are example tasks/targets:</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gradle</h4>
<p dir="auto">It is helpful that your <code>batect.yml</code> calls Gradle with the <code>--no-daemon</code> flag:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There is no point in spinning up a daemon for a Docker ephemeral container;
but it is harmless either way</li>
<li>With a daemon, the Docker container's Gradle may be confused by
<code>~/.gradle/daemon</code> and <code>/.gradle/workers</code> directories mounted by Batect from
your home directory, as these refer to processes in the host, not the
container (<code>batect.yml</code> mounts your <code>~/.gradle</code> to include caches of
already-downloaded dependencies, <em>et al</em>)</li>
<li>If you encounter troubles, run locally <code>./gradlew --stop</code> to kill any local
daemons: This indicates a <em>bug</em>, and "stop" is a workaround.
See <a href="https://github.com/batect/batect/issues/680#issuecomment-719821099" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/batect/batect/issues/680/hovercard">a suggestion of a better approach</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Earthly</h4>
<p dir="auto">Earthly has its own caching strategies that apply to your build (such as
Gradle or Maven dependency downloads) based around Docker layers. See
<a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/docs/guides/advanced-local-caching" rel="nofollow"><em>Advanced local
caching</em></a> for more information.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you encounter issues with Gradle and Batect, try stopping the local Gradle
daemons before running Batect:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./gradlew --stop
$ ./batect <your Batect arguments>"><pre>$ ./gradlew --stop
$ ./batect <span>&lt;</span>your Batect arguments<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The Batect builds <em>assume</em> you've run local builds first. Plesae run
<code>./gradlew build</code> or <code>./mvnw verify</code> at least once before running
<code>./batect ...</code> to ensure cached/shared downloads are present</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In CI, use the <code>--permanently-enable-telemetry</code> flag to avoid CI asking a
"Y/N" question. This <strong>must</strong> be <em>separate step</em> from running the build
itself. See <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-maven.yml"><code>ci.yml</code></a> for Gradle and Maven examples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run your local Gradle or Maven build before you run with Batect if you have
updated dependencies.  This is helpful when fetching the dependencies, and
sometimes avoids awkwardness (sometimes you may have different access rights
for the build tool caches when run as yourself directly <em>vs</em> running in a
container)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Maintain your build</h2>
<p dir="auto">Treat your build as you would your codebase: Maintain it, refactor as needed,
run performance testing, <em>et al</em>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Know what your build does</h3>
<p dir="auto">What does your build do exactly, and in what order? You can ask Gradle or Maven
to find out:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/dorongold/gradle-task-tree">Gradle Task Tree plugin</a>
with <code>./gradlew some...tasks taskTree</code></li>
<li><a href="https://buildplan.jcgay.fr/" rel="nofollow">Maven Buildplan plugin</a>
with <code>./mvnw buildplan:list</code> (see plugin documentation for other goals and
output format)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each of these have many options and features, and are worth exploring.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep your build clean</h3>
<p dir="auto">Let tools tell you when you have dodgy dependencies, or an inconsistent setup.
For example, leverage <code>jdeps</code> which
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jdeps.html" rel="nofollow">comes with the JDK</a>.
Jdeps spots, for example, if you have a multi-version jar as a dependency that
does not include <em>your</em> JDK version (an example of this may be is JUnit), or if
your code depends on <em>internal</em> (non-public) classes of the JDK
(important especially when using the JDK module system).</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gradle</h4>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/kordamp/jdeps-gradle-plugin">Kordamp plugin</a> used for
Gradle does not fail the build when jdeps errors, and only generates a report
text file. See
<a href="https://github.com/kordamp/jdeps-gradle-plugin/issues/16" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/kordamp/jdeps-gradle-plugin/issues/16/hovercard">this issue</a>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Maven</h4>
<p dir="auto">Try Maven with <code>dependency:tree -Dverbose</code>.
This will show conflicting versions of dependencies.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep local builds quiet</h3>
<p dir="auto">It is frustrating for local devs when something horrible happened during the
build (say a production with "ERROR" output during a test), but:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The build is <strong>GREEN</strong>, and developers should trust that</li>
<li>There is too much output in the local build, so developers don't spot
telltale signs of trouble</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">There are many approaches to this problem. This project uses JDK logging as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html" rel="nofollow">an
example</a>,
and keeps the build quiet in
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/config/logging.properties"><code>config/logging.properties</code></a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep CI builds noisy</h3>
<p dir="auto">In CI, this is different, and there you want as much output as possible to
diagnose the unexpected.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep your build current</h3>
<p dir="auto">An important part of <em>build hygiene</em> is keeping your build system, plugins, and
dependencies up to date. This might be simply to address bug fixes
(including bugs you weren't aware of), or might be critical security fixes. The
best policy is: <em>Stay current</em>. Others will have found—reported
problems—, and 3<sup>rd</sup>-parties may have addressed them. Leverage
the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law" rel="nofollow"><em>Linus' Law</em></a> ("given
enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow").</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep plugins and dependencies up-to-date</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin">Gradle</a>
Benjamin Manes is kind enough in his plugin project to list alternatives.
If you are moving towards <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html" rel="nofollow">Gradle version
catalogs</a>, you might
consider
<a href="https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions/" rel="nofollow">refreshVersions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Maven</a></li>
<li>Team agreement on release updates only, or if non-release plugins and
dependencies make sense for your situation</li>
<li>Each of these plugins for Gradle or Maven have their quirks.  <strong>Do not treat
them as sources of truth but as recommendations</strong>. <em>Use your judgment</em>. In
parallel, take advantage of CI tooling such as
<a href="https://github.com/dependabot">Dependabot (Github)</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/dependabot-gitlab/dependabot" rel="nofollow">Dependabot (GitLab)</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">An example use which shows most outdated plugins and dependencies (note that one
Maven example modifies your <code>pom.xml</code>, a fact you can choose or avoid):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./gradlew dependencyUpdates

<span><span>#</span> output ommitted</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This project keeps Gradle version numbers in
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/gradle.properties"><code>gradle.properties</code></a>, and for Maven in
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/pom.xml">the POM</a>, and you should do the same.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since your <code>pom.xml</code> is in Git, <code>versions:update-properties</code> is <em>safe</em> as you
can always revert changes, but some folks want to look before doing.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gradle and Maven provide <em>default versions</em> of bundled plugins. In both built
tools, the version update plugins need you to be <em>explicit</em> in stating
versions for bundled plugins, so those versions are visible for update</li>
<li>Enable <em>HTML reports</em> for local use; enable <em>XML reports</em> for CI use in
integrating with report tooling</li>
<li>To open the report for Jdeps, build locally and use the
<code>&lt;project root&gt;/build/reports/jdeps/</code> (Gradle) path.
The path shown in a Docker build is relative to the interior of the container</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automated dependency upgrade PRs</h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>NB</em> —
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/" rel="nofollow">Dependabot</a>
may prove speedier for you than updating dependency versions locally, and runs
in CI (GitHub) on a schedule you pick. It submits PRs to your repository when it
finds out of date dependencies. See
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.github/dependabot.yml"><code>dependabot.yml</code></a> for an example using a daily
schedule.</p>
<p dir="auto">A similar choice is <a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate">Renovate</a>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">More on Gradle version numbers</h4>
<p dir="auto">Your simplest approach to Gradle is to keep everything in <code>build.gradle</code>. Even
this unfortunately still requires a <code>settings.gradle</code> to define a project
artifact name, and leaves duplicate version numbers for related dependencies
scattered through <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another approach is to rely on a Gradle plugin such as that from Spring Boot to
manage dependencies for you. This unfortunately does not help with plugins at
all, nor with dependencies that Spring Boot does not know about.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project uses a 3-file solution for Gradle versioning, and you should
consider doing the same:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/gradle.properties"><code>gradle.properties</code></a> is the sole source of truth for
version numbers, both plugins and dependencies</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/settings.gradle"><code>settings.gradle</code></a> configures plugin versions using the
properties</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/build.gradle"><code>build.gradle</code></a> uses plugins without needing version numbers,
and dependencies refer to their property versions</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The benefits of this approach grow for Gradle multi-project projects, where you
may have plugin and dependency versions scattered across each <code>build.gradle</code>
file for you project and subprojects.</p>
<p dir="auto">So to adjust a version, edit <code>gradle.properties</code>. To see this approach in action
for dependencies, try:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ grep junitVersion gradle.properties setttings.gradle build.gradle
gradle.properties:junitVersion=5.7.0
build.gradle:    testImplementation &quot;org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:$junitVersion&quot;
build.gradle:    testImplementation &quot;org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:$junitVersion&quot;"><pre>$ grep junitVersion gradle.properties setttings.gradle build.gradle
gradle.properties:junitVersion=5.7.0
build.gradle:    testImplementation <span><span>"</span>org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:<span>$junitVersion</span><span>"</span></span>
build.gradle:    testImplementation <span><span>"</span>org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:<span>$junitVersion</span><span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note on <code>toolVersion</code> property</h4>
<p dir="auto">If you use the <code>toolVersion</code> property for a plugin to update the called tool
separately from the plugin itself, <em>this is a convention</em>, not something the
Gradle API provides to plugins. As a consequence, the Versions plugin is unable
to know if your tool version is out of date. An example is the JaCoCo plugin
distributed with Gradle.</p>
<p dir="auto">Two options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Do not use the <code>toolVersion</code> property unless needed to address a discovered
build issue, and remove it once the plugin catches up to provide the tool
version you need</li>
<li>Continue using the <code>toolVersion</code> property, and as part of running
<code>./gradlew dependencyUpdates</code>, manually check all <code>toolVersion</code>
properties, and update <code>gradle.properties</code> as accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — Maven handles this differently, and does not have this concern.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep your build fast</h3>
<p dir="auto">A fast local build is one of the best things you can do for your team. There are
variants of profiling your build for Gradle and Maven:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://scans.gradle.com/" rel="nofollow">Gradle build scan</a> with the <code>--scan</code> flag</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jcgay/maven-profiler">Maven profiler extension</a> with
the <code>-Dprofile</code> flag</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://scans.gradle.com/s/fik7c7bq25l3w" rel="nofollow">an example build scan</a> from May
1, 2023.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — <a href="https://scans.gradle.com/#maven" rel="nofollow">Build Scan</a> supports Maven as
well when using the paid enterprise version.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keep your developers fast</h3>
<p dir="auto">Some shortcuts to speed up the red-green-refactor cycle:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Just validate code coverage; do not run other parts of the build:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gradle: <code>./gradlew clean jacocoTestReport jacocoTestCoverageVerification</code></li>
<li>Maven: <code>./mvnw clean test jacoco:report jacoco:check</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Both <a href="#dependency-check"><em>dependency vulnerability checks</em></a> and
<a href="#use-mutation-testing"><em>mutation testing</em></a>
can take a while, depending on your project. If you find they slow your team
local build too much, these are good candidates for moving to
<a href="#setup-your-ci">CI-only steps</a>, such as a <code>-PCI</code> flag for Maven (see "Tips"
section of <a href="#use-gradle-or-maven">Use Gradle or Maven</a> for Gradle for an
equivalent). This project keeps them as part of the local build, as the
demonstration code is short</li>
<li>See the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/build.gradle"><code>build.gradle</code></a> for an example of
customizing "new" versions reported by the Gradle <code>dependencyUpdates</code> task</li>
<li>The equivalent Maven approach for controlling the definition of "new" is to
use <a href="https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/version-rules.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Version number
rules</em></a></li>
<li>With the Gradle plugin, you can program your build to fail if dependencies are
outdated. Read at

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Choose your code style</h2>
<p dir="auto">Style is an often overlooked but very critical attribute of writing. The style
of writing directly impacts the readability and understandability of the end
product</p>
<p dir="auto">There are 2 main java code styles</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf" rel="nofollow">Sun code style</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" rel="nofollow">Google code style</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It is up to you which one you should choose. But the style should be chosen and
the style should be the same for everyone.</p>
<p dir="auto">To maintain the same standard <code>config/ide/eclipse-java-google-style.xml</code>
or <code>intellij-java-google-style.xml</code> should be imported to your IDE. Checkstyle
should be configured based on the chosen standard</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generate code</h2>
<p dir="auto">When sensible, prefer to generate rather than write code. Here's why:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://threevirtues.com/" rel="nofollow">Intelligent laziness is a virtue</a></li>
<li>Tools always work, unless they have bugs, and you can fix bugs. Programmers
make typos, and fixing typos is a challenge when not obvious. Worse are <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thinko" rel="nofollow">_
thinkos_</a>; code generation does not "
think", so is immune to this problem</li>
<li>Generated code does not need code review, only the source input for generation
needs review, and this is usually shorter and easier to understand. Only your
hand-written code needs review</li>
<li>Generated code is usually ignored by tooling such as linting or code
coverage (and there are simple workarounds when this is not the case). Your
hand-written code needs tooling to shift problems left</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that many features for which in Java one would use code generation
(<em>eg</em>, Lombok's <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter" rel="nofollow"><code>@Getter</code></a>
or <a href="https://www.projectlombok.org/features/ToString" rel="nofollow"><code>@ToString</code></a>), can be
built-in language features in other languages such as Kotlin or Scala (<em>eg</em>,
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html" rel="nofollow">properties</a>
or <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html" rel="nofollow">data classes</a>).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lombok</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://projectlombok.org/" rel="nofollow">Lombok</a> is by far the most popular tool in Java for
code generation.
Lombok is an <em>annotation processor</em>, that is, a library (jar) which
cooperates with the Java compiler.
(<a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/introductory-guide-annotation-processor/#handling-annotations-at-compile-time-annotation-processors" rel="nofollow"><em>An introductory guide to annotations and annotation
processors</em></a>
is a good article if you'd like to read more on how annotation processing
works.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Lombok covers many common use cases, does not have runtime dependencies, there
are plugins for popular IDEs that understand Lombok's code generation, and has
tooling integration for JaCoCo's output code coverage (see
<a href="#leverage-lombok-to-tweak-code-coverage">below</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Do note though, Lombok is not a panacea, and has detractors.
For example, to generate code as an annotation processor, it in places relies on
internal JDK APIs, though the situation has improved as the JDK exposes those
APIs in portable ways.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Leverage Lombok to tweak code coverage</h4>
<p dir="auto">Be sparing in disabling code coverage!
JaCoCo knows about Lombok's
<a href="https://projectlombok.org/api/lombok/Generated.html" rel="nofollow"><code>@Generated</code></a>, and will
ignore annotated code.</p>
<p dir="auto">A typical use is for the <code>main()</code> method in a framework such as Spring Boot
or <a href="https://micronaut.io/" rel="nofollow">Micronaut</a>.
For a <em>command-line program</em>, you will want to test your <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do note that Lombok reflects on internal features of the JDK.
If you have issues, for <em>Maven</em>: use in your project the
<code>--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED</code>
example from <code>.mvn/jvm.config</code>, and look to address these.
The solutions in the project are a "workaround" assuming Java 17.
This is a two-edged sword: as the JVM improves access controls, you may find,
especially dependencies, that there are times you want deep reflection.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lombok configuration</h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration" rel="nofollow">Configure Lombok</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/src/lombok.config"><code>src/lombok.config</code></a> rather than the project root or a
separate <code>config</code> directory.
At a minimum:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="config.stopBubbling=true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation=true
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties=true
lombok.extern.findbugs.addSuppressFBWarnings=true"><pre><span>config.stopBubbling</span>=true
<span>lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation</span>=true
<span>lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties</span>=true
<span>lombok.extern.findbugs.addSuppressFBWarnings</span>=true</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Lines:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>stopBubbling</code> tells Lombok that there are no more configuration files higher
in the directory tree</li>
<li><code>addLombokGeneratedAnnotation</code> helps JaCoCo ignore code generated by Lombok</li>
<li><code>addConstructorProperties</code> helps JSON/XML frameworks such as Jackson
(this may not be relevant for your project, but is generally harmless, so the
benefit comes for free)</li>
<li><code>addSuppressFBWarnings</code> helps SpotBugs ignore code generated by Lombok</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Leverage the compiler</h2>
<p dir="auto">Compilers targeting the JVM generally provide warning flags for dodgy code, and
a flag to turn warnings into errors: Use them.
The compiler is your first line of defense against code issues.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, add these flags with <code>javac</code>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>-Werror</code> -- turn warnings into errors, and fails the build</li>
<li><code>-Xlint:all,-processing</code> -- enable all warnings excluding annotation
processing</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Be judicious in disabling compiler warnings: they usually warn you for good
reasons.
For <code>javac</code>, disabled warnings might include <code>serial</code> or <code>deprecation</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">JVM compilers support <code>-Werror</code> (<em>eg</em>, <code>javac</code>, <code>kotlinc</code>, <code>scalac</code>, <em>et al</em>);
enabling/disabling specific warnings may be compiler-specific.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Consider using <a href="https://errorprone.info/" rel="nofollow"><em>Error Prone</em></a>.
<em>Error Prone</em> is an excellent compiler plugin to fail problems earlier: fail
at compile-time rather than a runtime, however it can be overly strict</li>
<li>Lombok annotation processing fails <code>-Xlint:all</code>.
Use <code>-Xlint:all,-processing</code> to bypass warnings about annotation processing.
In addition, using Lombok's configuration to add suppression annotations on
generated code (so other tools will ignore generated code) needs the older
Spotbugs annotations provided as a dependency</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use linting</h2>
<p dir="auto">"Linting" is static code analysis with an eye towards style and dodgy code
constructs. The term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)" rel="nofollow">derives from early UNIX</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Linting for modern languages is simple: the compiler complains on your behalf.
This is the case, for example, Golang. Having common team agreements on style
and formatting is a boon for avoiding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality" rel="nofollow">bikeshedding</a>, and aids in:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Reading a code base, relying on a similar style throughout</li>
<li>Code reviews, focusing on substantive over superficial changes</li>
<li>Merging code, avoiding trivial or irrelevant conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Code style and formatting are <em>entirely</em> a matter of team discussion and
agreement.
In Java, there is no recommended style, and <code>javac</code> is good at parsing almost
anything thrown at it.
However, humans reading code are not as well-equipped.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Pick a team style, stick to it, and <em>enforce</em> it with tooling.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">See the section <a href="#checkstyle"><em>Checkstyle</em></a> for more details on enforcement.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>

<p dir="auto">However, Checkstyle will not auto-format code for you. For auto-formatting,
consider, depending on your team preferences, any of these build plugins:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/diffplug/spotless">Spotless</a> — Focus on Google style
guides for Java. For Gradle, use the <code>spotlessApply</code> task to reformat; for
Maven use the <code>spotless:apply</code> goal to reformat. It supports <em>many</em>
source languages, not just Java</li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">For your editor, consider the sample <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.editorconfig">.editorconfig</a> file in
this project. It is respected by IntelliJ and many other code editors.<br>
(The sample uses 80-character line limits as IBM and Hollerith punch cards

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependency check</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This is CRITICAL if you have any direct, indirect, or through-plugin
dependencies on Log4j. Beyond your project, you may be impacted by services you
call, so check with your organization or external services</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/" rel="nofollow">DependencyCheck</a> is the
current <em>best tool</em> for JVM projects to verify that your project does not rely
on external code with known security vulnerabilities ([CVEs](<a href="https://cve.mitre/" rel="nofollow">https://cve.mitre</a>.
org/)) from the NVD.
That said, DependencyCheck does impact build times.
It is smart about caching, but will once a day may take time to download
data on any new NVD CVEs, and occasionally the site is down for maintenance.
You may consider leaving this check in CI-only if you find local build times
overly impacted.
Leaving these checks to CI-only is a tradeoff between "shifting security left",
and speed for local builds.
I lean towards <em>security first</em>; however, you know your circumstances
best.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This project fails the build if finding any CVEs for the current version of
any dependency.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Your build should fail, too. It is a <em>red flag</em> to you to consider the CVE, what
impact the vulnerable dependency has, and if you are comfortable with a
vulnerable dependency. It is rarely (if ever) the case you keep a vulnerable
version of a dependency.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automate scanning for secrets</h3>
<p dir="auto">One key to shifting security left is avoiding secrets (passwords, private
identifiers, etc.) in your source code, commit history, and so on.</p>
<p dir="auto">GitHub and other repository services offer secrets scanning out of the box:
<a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-28-secret-scanning-alerts-are-now-available-and-free-for-all-public-repositories/" rel="nofollow">Secret scanning alerts are now available (and free) for all public

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To open the report for DependencyCheck, build locally and use the
<code>&lt;project root&gt;/build/reports/</code> (Gradle) or
<code>&lt;project root/target/</code> (Maven) path.
The path shown in a Docker build is relative to the interior of the container</li>
<li>Sometimes you may want to refresh your local cache of the NVD files:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gradle: <code>./gradlew dependencyCheckPurge depenedencyCheckUpdate</code></li>
<li>Maven: <code>./mvnw dependency-check:purge dependency-check:update-only</code></li>

See <a href="https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v8.0.0"><em>v8.0.0</em> release
notes</a>
when updating from DependencyCheck 8</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes</h4>
<p dir="auto">DependencyCheck may be your slowest quality check in local builds (competing
with mutation testing for that ignominious title). Sometimes it may fail when
the upstream source for CVEs is offline. If this is a recurring problem for you,
consider moving this check into CI. The downside that local work might use an
insecure dependency for a while. Checking daily for updated dependencies can
lessen this risk:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gradle: <code>./gradlew dependencyUpdates</code></li>
<li>Maven: <code>./mvnw versions:update-properties</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For non-Windows platforms, you may see this warning when <code>DependencyCheck</code> runs:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".NET Assembly Analyzer could not be initialized and at least one 'exe' or 'dll' was scanned. The 'dotnet' executable could not be found on the path; either disable the Assembly Analyzer or add the path to dotnet core in the configuration."><pre><code>.NET Assembly Analyzer could not be initialized and at least one 'exe' or 'dll' was scanned. The 'dotnet' executable could not be found on the path; either disable the Assembly Analyzer or add the path to dotnet core in the configuration.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In most situations, you are running in a Linux-based Docker container, or using
local Linux or Mac command line.  <strong>In a Windows project, this is an issue to
address, and may be a serious security concern</strong> indicating you are missing
critical Windows components. For other platforms, this is a nuisance message.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Gradle when updating to version 7.x.x of DependencyCheck from 6.x.x or
earlier, first run <code>./gradlew dependencyCheckPurge</code> to clear out the local
cache schema of CVEs.
DependencyCheck moved to schema v2 in 7.x.x from v1 in 6.x.x and earlier,
and the 7.0.0 Gradle plugin fails with the older schema version.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependabot</h3>
<p dir="auto">GitHub provides
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically">Dependabot</a>

<p dir="auto"><em>NB</em> — Dependabot is more reliable than either the Gradle or Maven plugins
for dependencies.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>See the "Tips" section of <a href="#use-gradle-or-maven">Gradle or Maven</a></li>
<li>With GitHub actions, consider adding a tool such as
<a href="https://dependabot.com/" rel="nofollow">Dependabot</a>, which automatically files GitHub issues

<a href="#dependabot">earlier in this document</a> for an example</li>
<li>You can <em>temporarily</em> disable OWASP dependency checking via

CVE-2021-45105
are extremely severe. They are so severe, this should be a top priority for
you to address regardless of other priorities. Although this project does not
use <code>log4j</code>, local testing shows that the <code>DependencyCheck</code> plugin for either
Gradle or Maven fails build when you use an older, insecure version
of <code>log4j-core</code> indirectly. Note that Gradle 7.3.3+ itself fails your build if
it detect a dependency on a vulnerable version of <code>log4j-core</code></li>
<li>The <em>BCEL security vulnerability</em>
(<a href="https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-42920" rel="nofollow">CVE-2022-42920</a>) is critical,

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Unit testing and code coverage are foundations for code quality.
Your build should help you with these as much as possible. 100% coverage may
seem absurd;
however, levels of coverage like this come with unexpected benefits such as
finding dead code in your project or helping refactoring to be simple.
An example: with high coverage (say 95%+, your experience will vary)
simplifying your covered code may lower your coverage as uncovered code becomes
more prominent in the total ratio.</p>
<p dir="auto">Setup for needed plugins:</p>

This helps avoid dependency conflicts from other dependencies or plugins</li>
<li>See <a href="#leverage-lombok-to-tweak-code-coverage">discussion on Lombok</a> how to
<em>sparingly</em> leverage the <code>@Generated</code> annotation for marking code that JaCoCo
should ignore</li>
<li>Discuss with your team the concept of a "coverage ratchet". This means, once a
baseline coverage percentage is agreed to, the build configuration will only
raise this value, not lower it. This is fairly simple to do by periodically
examining the JaCoCo report, and raising the build coverage percentage over
time to match improvements in the report</li>
<li>Unfortunately neither Gradle's nor Maven's JaCoCo plugin will fail your build
when coverage <em>rises</em>!  This would be helpful for supporting the coverage
ratchet</li>
<li>You may find <em>mocking</em> helpful for injection. The Java community is not of one
mind on mocking, so use your judgment:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://site.mockito.org/" rel="nofollow">Mockito</a> is the "standard" choice, and is a

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use mutation testing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Unit testing is great for testing your production code. But have you thought
about testing your unit tests? What that means is, how are you sure your tests
really check what you meant them to? Fortunately, there is an automated way to
do just that, no code from you required, only some build configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mutation testing is a simple concept: Go "break" some production code, and see
if any unit tests fail. Production bytecode is changed during the build—
for example, an <code>if (x)</code> is changed to <code>if (!x)</code>—, and the unit tests run.
With good code coverage, there should now be a failing unit test.</p>
<p dir="auto">The best option for Modern Java/JVM mutation testing is
<a href="http://pitest.org/" rel="nofollow">PITest</a>. It is under active development, does rather clever
things with compiled bytecode, and has Gradle and Maven plugins. The main
drawback for your <em>local build</em> is that PITest is <em>noisy</em>, so there might be
more build output than you might expect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mutation testing is one of the slowest parts of a local build. You might
consider moving mutation testing to CI-only to speed up local
<em>red-green-refactor</em> cycle
(<a href="https://medium.com/@tunkhine126/red-green-refactor-42b5b643b506" rel="nofollow">_Red, Green, Refactor!</a>,
<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html" rel="nofollow"><em>The Cycles of
TDD</em></a>).
Use your judgment on the value of the CI build never or rarely failing (modulo
external resources) when local build passes <em>vs</em> the speed of pushing good code.</p>
<p dir="auto">After running a build using PITest, to see the mutation report (on passed or
failed mutation coverage), open:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Gradle, open <code>build/reports/pitest/index.html</code></li>
<li>For Maven, open <code>target/pit-reports/index.html</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This project provides the PIT report as part of Maven's project report.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Without further configuration, PITest defaults to mutating classes using
your <em>project group</em> as the package base. Example: Set the <em>project group</em>
to "demo" for either Gradle or Maven if your classes are underneath the
"demo.*" package namespace, otherwise PITest may complain that there are no
classes to mutate, or no unit tests to run</li>
<li>If you need to open modules (<em>eg</em>, <code>--add-opens</code> flags), you need to include
these flags in "jvm args" configuration for the plugin</li>
<li>Read more about <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2021/04/mutation-testing.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Mutation
Testing</em></a> from
Google</li>
<li>To open the report for PITest, build locally and use the
<code>&lt;project root&gt;/build/reports/pitest/</code> (Gradle) or
<code>&lt;project root&gt;/target/pit-reports/</code> (Maven) path.
The path shown in a Docker build is relative to the interior of the container</li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use integration testing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here the project says "integration testing". Your team may call it by another
name. This means bringing up your application, possibly with
<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Mocks,%20Fakes,%20Stubs%20and%20Dummies.html" rel="nofollow">fakes, stubs, mocks, spies, dummies, or doubles</a>
for external dependencies (databases, other services, <em>etc</em>), and running tests
against high-level functionality, but <em>not</em> starting up external dependencies
themselves (<em>ie</em>, Docker, or manual command-line steps). Think of CI: what are
called here "integration tests" are those which do
<em>not</em> need your CI to provide other services.</p>
<p dir="auto">An example is testing <code>STDOUT</code> and <code>STDERR</code> for a command-line application.
(If you are in Spring Framework/Boot-land, use controller tests for your REST
services.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike <code>src/main/java</code> and <code>src/test/java</code>, there is no generally agreed
convention for where to put integration tests. This project keeps all tests
regardless of type in <code>src/test/java</code> for simplicity of presentation, naming
integration tests with "*IT.java". A more sophisticated approach may make sense
for your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd like to keep your integration tests in a separate source root from unit
tests, consider these plugins:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Gradle, use <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#sec:configuring_java_integration_tests" rel="nofollow">native Gradle to add new test
sets</a>.
(Previous versions of this project used the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin"><code>testsets</code> plugin</a>,
however, it does not support Gradle 8)</li>
<li>For Maven, use
the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/failsafe/maven-failsafe-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Maven Failsafe Plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caution</strong>: This project <em>duplicates</em>
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/src/test/java/demo/ApplicationIT.java"><code>ApplicationIT.java</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/src/integrationTest/java/demo/ApplicationTest.java"><code>ApplicationTest.java</code></a>
reflecting the split in philosophy between Gradle and Maven for integration
tests. Clearly in a production project, you would have only one of these.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Maven projects, Apache maintains Failsafe and Surefire plugins as a pair,
and share the same version numbers.
This project uses a shared <code>maven-testing-plugins.version</code> property</li>
<li>Baeldung
has <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/maven-failsafe-plugin" rel="nofollow">a good introduction article</a>
on Maven Failsafe</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Going further</h2>
<p dir="auto">Can you do more to improve your build, and shift problems left (before they hit
CI or production)?
Of course!
Below are some topics to discuss with your team about making them part of the
local build.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Test Pyramid</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html" title="TestPyramid" rel="nofollow">
<img src="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/raw/master/images/test-pyramid.png" alt="The test pyramid" width="20%" height="auto">
</a></p>
<p dir="auto">What is the "Test Pyramid"? This is an important conceptual framework for
validating your project at multiple levels of interaction. Canonical resources
describing the test pyramid include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html" rel="nofollow"><em>TestPyramid</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html" rel="nofollow"><em>The Practical Test
Pyramid</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As you move your testing "to the left" (helping local builds cover more
concerns), you'll want to enhance your build with more testing at different
levels of interaction. These are not covered in this article, so research is
needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are alternatives to the "test pyramid" perspective. Consider
<a href="https://blog.korny.info/2020/01/20/the-swiss-cheese-model-and-acceptance-tests.html" rel="nofollow">swiss cheese</a>
if it makes more sense for your project.
The build techniques still apply.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NB</strong> — What this article calls
<a href="#use-integration-testing">"integration tests"</a> may have a different name for
your team.
You may have "system tests" for example.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use automated live testing when appropriate</h3>
<p dir="auto">"Live testing" here means spinning up a database or other remote service for
local tests, and not
using <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Mocks,%20Fakes,%20Stubs%20and%20Dummies.html" rel="nofollow">fakes, stubs, mocks, spies, dummies, or
doubles</a>.
In these tests, your project calls on <em>real</em> external dependencies, albeit
dependencies spun up locally rather than in production or another environment.
These might be call "out of process" tests.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a complex topic, and this document is no guide on these. Some
potentially useful resources to pull into your build:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://flywaydb.org/" rel="nofollow">Flyway</a> — Version your schema in production, and
version your test data</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack">LocalStack</a> — Local testing
for AWS services</li>
<li><a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/" rel="nofollow">TestContainers</a> — Local Docker for
real database instances, or any Docker-provided service</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use contract testing when appropriate</h3>
<p dir="auto">Depending on your program, you may want additional testing specific to
circumstances. For example, with REST services and Spring Cloud, consider:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/contract-rest/" rel="nofollow"><em>Consumer Driven Contracts</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are many options in this area. Find the choices which work best for you
and your project.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Provide User Journey tests when applicable</h3>
<p dir="auto">Another dimension to consider for local testing: <em>User Journey</em> tests.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-test-user-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Why test the user
journey?</em></a></li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging</h2>
<p dir="auto">For direct debugging without a container follow your IDE's instructions.
For debugging within the local Batect container, examples are in the Batect
tasks <code>debug-with-gradle</code> and <code>debug-with-maven</code>.
Update <code>run-with-gradle.sh</code> or <code>run-with-maven.sh</code>, or write your own
similar script to run your program with the right JVM flags for <em>remote
debugging</em> (the container is a remote process on "localhost" from the
perspective of your IDE).</p>
<p dir="auto">These Batect example tasks assume a command-line program that exits when
completed.
See <a href="#spring-boot">the Spring Boot</a> sample for the same approach with
long-running services.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Samples</h2>
<p dir="auto">These samples are external projects, are at varying states of maturity, and
are frequently updated (espcially for dependency versions).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Kotlin</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/kunits">KUnits</a> (Maven) is a pleasure project to
represent units of measurement in Kotlin</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/kotlin-rational">Kotlin Rational</a> (Maven)
explores a math library for rationals (fractions) akin to <code>BigDecimal</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/kotlin-magic-bus">Magic Bus</a> (Gradle) is a
library for using messaging patterns within a single application (it talks

</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Spring Boot</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/kotlin-spring-boot-hateoas-database">Spring Boot HATEOAS
Database</a>
(Maven) looks at Spring Boot features for Open API (Swagger), REST APIs,
HATEOAS, GraphQL, Prometheus, <em>et al</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Problems</h2>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/303/" title="Compiling" rel="nofollow">
<img src="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/raw/master/images/compiling.png" alt="Compiling" width="20%" height="auto">
</a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why is my local build slow?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Both Gradle and Maven have tools to track performance time of steps in your
build:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://scans.gradle.com/" rel="nofollow">Gradle build scans</a> — Not limited to
Enterprise licenses, just build with <code>./gradlew --scan &lt;tasks&gt;</code> and follow the
link in the output.
<a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/binkley/modern-java-practices/docs/profile-run/gradle-profile.html" title="A sample Gradle profile for this project" type="text/html" rel="nofollow">
See a sample Gradle profile for this project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jcgay/maven-profiler">Maven profiler</a> — run
with <code>./mvnw -Dprofile &lt;goals&gt;</code> and open the local link in the output. This
project includes the setup for <a href="https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/blob/master/.mvn/extensions.xml">Maven extensions</a>.
<a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/binkley/modern-java-practices/docs/profile-run/maven-profile.html" title="A sample Maven profile for this project" type="text/html" rel="nofollow">
See a sample Maven profile for this project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>TODO</strong>: Fix the sample profile links to display as pages, not as raw HTML.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">My local build is still too slow</h3>
<p dir="auto">Congratulations!  You care, and you notice what is happening for your team.<br>
Local build time is <em>important</em>: gone are the days when a multi-hour, or even
30+ minute build, are viewed in most cases as the "cost of doing business".
And "compiling" is rarely any longer where your project takes most local build
time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use the Gradle or Maven instructions
in <a href="#keep-your-build-fast">keep your build fast</a> to profile your build, and spot
where it spends time.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find your local build is taking too long, consider testing moving these
parts to CI with the cost to you of issues arising from delayed feedback:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#keep-your-build-clean">Jdeps</a></li>
<li><a href="#shift-security-left">DependencyCheck</a></li>
<li><a href="#use-integration-testing">Integration tests</a></li>
<li><a href="#use-mutation-testing">PITest</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em>But beware</em>!  Your local build is now drifting away from CI, so you are pushing
problems off later in your build pipeline. Not everyone pays close attention to
CI failures, that is until something bad happens in production.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>IMPORTANT</em> — if you disable tools like the above in the <em>local</em> build,
ensure you retain them in your <em>CI</em> build. Your goal in this case is speed up
the feedback cycle locally while retaining the benefits of automated tooling.
You are making a bet: problems these tools find come up rarely (but can be
catastrophic when they do), so time saved locally repays time lost waiting for
CI to find these problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the Gradle and Maven samples in this repository, <em>DependencyCheck</em> and
<em>Mutation testing</em> are typically the slowest steps in a local build;
<em>Integration tests</em> are fast only because this project has very few (1), and are
samples only.
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Y/Your-mileage-may-vary.html" rel="nofollow">YMMV</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Every project is different; your team and stakeholders need to judge the value
of quicker feedback to programmers of these concerns, and quicker feedback from
a faster local build. There is no "one size fits all" recommendation.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">It fails in CI, but passes locally</h3>
<p dir="auto">As much as you would like local builds to be identical to CI, this can still
happen for reasons of environment. Examples can include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Credentials needed in CI have changed: Update your CI configuration</li>
<li>Network routing has changed, and CI is in a different subnet from local:
Talk with your Infrastructure team</li>
<li>CI includes steps to push successful builds further down the line to other
environments, and something there went wrong: Talk with your Infrastructure
team</li>
<li>Dependencies break in CI: If CI uses an internal dependency repository, check
in with the maintainers of the repository</li>
</ul>

<p><em>By David Buchanan, 4<sup>th</sup> January 2024</em></p>
<p>First of all, this article is an exercise in recreational "because I can" programming. If you just want to make your Python code go fast, this is perhaps not the article for you. And perhaps Python is not the language you want, either!</p>
<p>By the end, I'll explain how I implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> in pure Python (plus pysdl2 for graphics output) running in 4K resolution at 180fps, which represents a ~3800x speedup over a naive implementation.</p>

<p>If you're already familiar with SIMD and vectorization, you might want to skip this next section.</p>
<h3>A Brief Introduction to SIMD</h3>
<p>If you want to get the most performance out of a modern CPU, you're probably going to be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a> instructions - Single Instruction, Multiple Data.</p>
<p>For example, if you have two arrays of length 4, containing 32-bit integers, most modern CPUs will let you add the pairwise elements together in a single machine instruction (assuming you've already loaded the data into registers). Hopefully it's obvious why this is more efficient than looping over the individual array elements. Intel CPUs have had this <em>specific</em> capability since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2">SSE2</a> was introduced in the year 2000, but SIMD as a concept predates it by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data#History">a lot</a>.</p>
<p>Newer CPUs cores have been expanding on these capabilities ever since, meaning SIMD instructions are more relevant than ever for maximising CPU throughput.</p>
<p>If you're programming in a language like C, an optimising compiler will recognise code that can be accelerated using SIMD instructions, and automatically emit appropriate machine code. Compilers can't optimise everything perfectly, though, so anyone who wants to squeeze out the maximum performance might end up using <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html">Intrinsics</a> to explicitly tell the compiler which instructions to use. And if <em>that</em> still isn't enough, you might end up programming directly in assembly.</p>
<p>There are many ways to express SIMD programs, but the rest of them are out of scope for this article!</p>
<p>"Vectorization" is the process of transforming a typical program into one that operates over whole arrays of data (i.e. vectors) at once (for example, using SIMD). The work done by the optimising compiler described above, or the human writing Intrinsic operations, is vectorization.</p>
<h3>A Brief Introduction to CPython</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> is the reference implementation of the Python language, written mostly in C, hence the name. Other implementations exist, but when people say "Python" they're often implicitly referring to CPython. I'll try to only say Python when I'm referring to the language as a whole, and CPython when I'm talking about a CPython implementation detail (which we'll be getting into later).</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that CPython compiles your code into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode">bytecode</a> format, and then interprets that bytecode at run-time. I'll be referring to that bytecode interpreter as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-machine">"VM"</a>.</p>
<h3>SIMD in Python</h3>
<p>Python does not natively have a concept of SIMD. However, libraries like <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> exist, allowing for relatively efficient vectorized code. NumPy lets you define vectors, or even n-dimensional arrays, and perform operations on them in a single API call.</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>

</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Without NumPy, the above example would require a loop over array elements (or a list comprehension, which is fancy syntax for the same thing, more or less).</p>
<p>Internally, NumPy is implemented using native C extensions, which in turn use Intrinsics to express SIMD operations. I'm not an expert on NumPy implementation details, but you can peruse their SIMD code <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/main/numpy/_core/src/common/simd">here</a>. Note that the code has been customised for various CPU architectures.</p>
<p>CPython itself, being an interpreted Python implementation, is slow. But if you can structure your program so that all the "real work" gets done inside a library like NumPy, it can be surprisingly efficient overall.</p>
<p>NumPy is excellent and widely used for getting real work done. However, NumPy is not "pure" Python!</p>
<h3>SIMD in <em>Pure</em> Python</h3>
<p>By "pure," I mean using only functionality built into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/">Python language</a> itself, or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python standard library</a>.</p>
<p>This is an entirely arbitrary and self-imposed constraint, but I think it's a fun one to work within. It's also vaguely useful, since libraries like NumPy aren't available in certain environments.</p>
<p>Earlier, I said Python doesn't natively have a concept of SIMD. This isn't entirely true; otherwise the article would end here. Python supports bitwise operations over pairs of integers: AND (<code>&amp;</code>), OR (<code>|</code>), XOR (<code>^</code>). If you think about these as operations over vectors of booleans, each bit being one bool, it is SIMD!</p>
<p>Unlike many other programming languages, Python integers have unlimited precision. That is, they can accurately represent integers containing arbitrarily many digits—at least, until you run out of memory. This means we can evaluate an unlimited number of conceptually-parallel boolean operations with a single python operator.</p>
<p>SIMD over booleans might sound esoteric, but it's an idea we can immediately put to work. A common operation in cryptography is to XOR two byte buffers together. An idiomatic implementation might look like this:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>xor_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>bytes</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bytes</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bytes</span><span>:</span>
	<span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>))</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>bytes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>^</span> <span>y</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>in</span> <span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>This takes each individual byte (as an integer between 0 and 255) in a and b, applies the xor operator to each, and constructs a new <code>bytes</code> object from the results. Arguably, we are already using the boolean-SIMD concept here; each of the 8 bits in a byte are getting XORed in parallel. But we can do better than that:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>xor_bytes_simd</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>bytes</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bytes</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bytes</span><span>:</span>
	<span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>))</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
		<span>int</span><span>.</span><span>from_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>"little"</span><span>)</span> <span>^</span> <span>int</span><span>.</span><span>from_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>"little"</span><span>)</span>
	<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>to_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>"little"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>This might look a bit ridiculous, and that's because it is. We convert each <code>bytes</code> object into an arbitrary-precision integer, XOR those two integers together, and then convert the resulting integer back to <code>bytes</code>. The python <code>^</code> operator only gets executed once, processing all the data in one step (or more explicitly, one CPython VM operation). I'm going to call this approach "pseudo-SIMD". But with all this conversion between bytes and integers, surely it must be slower overall? Let's benchmark it.</p>
<p>Here are my results. The number is time to execute 1 million iterations. I tested on CPython 3.11 on an M1 Pro macbook. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DavidBuchanan314/51bb8f6219ea8bb7a603e0ad19725f6d">Try it on your own machine!</a></p>

</pre>
<p>Even for the trivial case of n=1, somehow our wacky pseudo-SIMD function wins, by about a third!</p>
<p>The difference becomes even more pronounced as the buffer size increases, with the pseudo-SIMD function being 12x faster for n=1024.</p>
<p>I also threw a numpy implementation into the mix. This isn't really fair on numpy, because converting the bytes to and from numpy arrays appears to have quite a high constant overhead. In more realistic numpy code, you'd end up keeping your data in numpy format throughout. Because of this, numpy ended up slower all the way until n=1024, where it became 3x faster. Evidently, those constant overheads become less relevant as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> grows.</p>
<p>But what if we eliminate the conversion overheads, allowing our functions to input and output data in their "native" formats, rather than bytes? For pseudo-SIMD, that format is integers, and for numpy it's a <code>np.array</code> object.</p>

<p>Pseudo-SIMD has the edge for small inputs (perhaps because it doesn't have to do any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>), but for large buffers, numpy edges ahead. But only barely! How is our pure-python XOR function (which at this point is just the XOR operator itself) able to keep up with NumPy's optimised SIMD code?</p>

<p>It's a simple loop over arrays. No SIMD instructions? Well, there aren't any explicit ones, but what does the C compiler do to it? Let's take an <em>even closer</em> look.</p>
<p>I loaded libpython into Ghidra and had a look around. The library on my system didn't have full symbols, so I searched for cross-references to the exported symbol <code>_PyLong_New</code>. There were 82 matches, but by an extremely weird stroke of luck it was the first function I clicked on.</p>
<p>On my system, the (aarch64) assembly corresponding to the above loop is as follows:</p>

This is a fairly typical result of compiler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">auto-vectorization</a>.

<p>The main loop operates using the <code>q0</code> and <code>q1</code> registers, which according to <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dht0002/a/Introducing-NEON/NEON-architecture-overview/NEON-registers">ARM docs</a> are 128-bit wide NEON registers. As far as I can tell, NEON doesn't stand for anything in particular, but it's what ARM calls its SIMD features (by the way, their "next-gen" SIMD instruction set is called <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102476/0100/Introducing-SVE">SVE</a>).</p>
<p>After the main loop, it xors the remaining 32-bit words, one at a time.</p>
<p>The key observation here is that our "pseudo-SIMD" implementation is using real SIMD instructions under the hood! At least, it is on my system; this may depend on your platform, compiler, configuration, etc.</p>
<p>If we limit ourselves to bitwise operators, and our numbers are big enough that the interpreter overhead is small (in relative terms), we can get real SIMD performance speedups in pure Python code. Well, kinda. If you were implementing a specific algorithm in assembly, you could generate much more tightly optimised SIMD routines, keeping data in registers where possible, avoiding unnecessary loads and stores from memory, etc.</p>
<p>Another big caveat with this approach is that it involves creating a whole new integer to contain the result. This wastes memory space, puts pressure on the memory allocator/gc, and perhaps most importantly, it wastes memory bandwidth. Although you can write <code>a ^= b</code> in Python to denote an in-place XOR operation, it still ends up internally allocating a new object to store the result.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the NumPy implementation was still slightly faster, I believe the answer lies in the way CPython represents its integers. Each entry in the <code>ob_digit</code> array only represents 30 bits of the overall number. I'm guessing this makes handling carry propagation simpler during arithmetic operations. This means the in-memory representation has a ~7% overhead compared to optimal packing. While I haven't checked NumPy's implementation details, I imagine they pack array elements tightly.</p>
<h3>Doing Useful Work</h3>
<p>Now that we know we can do efficient-ish bitwise SIMD operations, can we build something useful from that?</p>
<p>One use case is bitsliced cryptography. <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/python-bitsliced-aes">Here's</a> my implementation of bitsliced AES-128-ECB in pure Python. It's over 20x faster than the next fastest pure-python AES implementation I could find, and in theory it's more secure too, due to not having any data-dependent array indexing (but I still wouldn't trust it as a secure implementation; use a <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">proper cryptography library!</a>)</p>
<p>For a more detailed introduction to bitslicing, check out <a href="https://timtaubert.de/blog/2018/08/bitslicing-an-introduction/">this article</a>. The idea is to express your whole algorithm as a circuit of logic gates, or in other words, a bunch of boolean expressions. You can do this for any computation, but AES is particularly amenable to it. Once you have a boolean expression, you can use bit-parallel operations (i.e., bitwise SIMD operations) to compute multiple instances of your algorithm in parallel. Since AES is a block-based cipher, you can use this idea to compute multiple AES cipher blocks concurrently.</p>
<h3>SWAR</h3>
<p>We can use Python integers for more than just parallel bitwise operations. We can use them for parallel additions, too!</p>

<p>As shown here, we can pack multiple fixed-width integers into a single Python integer, and add them all together at once. However, if they're tightly packed and an integer overflow occurs, this causes unwanted carry propagation between lanes. The solution is simple: space them out a bit. In this example I use generous 4-bit-wide padding to make things more obvious, but in principle you only need a single bit of padding. Finally, we use the bitwise AND operator to mask off any overflow bits. If we didn't do this, the overflowing bits could accumulate over the course of multiple additions and start causing overflows between lanes again. The more padding bits you use between lanes, the more chained additions you can survive before masking is required.</p>
<p>You can do similar things for subtraction, multiplication by a small constant, and bit shifts/rotations, so long as you have enough padding bits to prevent overflows in each scenario.</p>
<p>The general term for this concept is SWAR, which stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAR">SIMD Within A Register</a>. But here, rather than using a machine register, we're using an arbitrarily long Python integer. I'm calling this variant SWAB: SIMD Within A Bigint.</p>
<p>SWAB is a useful idea in Python because it maximises the amount of work done per VM instruction, reducing the interpreter overhead; the CPU gets to spend the majority of its time in the fast native code that implements the integer operations.</p>
<h3>Doing <s>Useful Work</s> Something Fun</h3>
<p>That's enough theory; now it's time to make Game of Life go fast. First, let me describe the "problem" I'm trying to solve. I'll assume you're already broadly familiar with Game of Life, but if not, go read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia article.</a></p>
<p>There are some very clever algorithms for making GoL go fast, the most famous being <a href="https://johnhw.github.io/hashlife/index.md.html">Hashlife</a>, which works by spotting repeating patterns in both space and time. However, my favourite GoL pattern to simulate is <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Soup">"soup"</a>, i.e., a large random starting grid. These chaotic patterns aren't well suited to the Hashlife algorithm, so we need to go back to the basics.</p>
<p>When you simulate soup in the classic GoL ruleset, it typically dies out after a few thousand generations, producing a rather boring arrangement of oscillating <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Soup#Ash">"ash"</a> (which is back to something Hashlife can simulate quickly). I prefer my simulations to live on in eternal chaos, and there's a variant of the classic ruleset that more or less guarantees this, called <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:DryLife">DryLife</a>. I like DryLife because it still exhibits most of the familiar GoL behaviours (for example, gliders) and yet the soup lives on indefinitely, creating a pleasing screensaver-like animation.</p>
<p>The "obvious" implementation of the inner loop of the GoL algorithm looks something like this:</p>

<p>It iterates over every cell in the grid, counts up its immediate 8 neighbours, and applies the rules to decide if the cell should be alive or not in the next iteration. In big-O terms, this is an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> algorithm, where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> is the number of cells in the grid (i.e., width <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>×</mi></mrow></math> height).</p>
<p>Although it isn't made explicit in the snippet above, the state of the cells is being stored in a big array, accessed via the <code>get_cell</code> and <code>set_cell</code> helper functions. What if instead of using an array, we stored the whole state in one very long integer, and used SWAB arithmetic to process the whole thing at once? The trickiest part of this process will be counting up the neighbours, which can sum to up to 8 (or 9 if we also count the initial cell value). That's a 4-bit value, and we can be sure it will never overflow into a 5-bit value, so we can store each cell as a 4-bit wide "SWAB lane". Without further ado, here's the equivalent inner-loop code:</p>

<p>(I've omitted some details like wraparound handling; you can see the full code, along with definitions of those magic constants, <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/pyswargol/blob/main/swargol.py">here</a>)</p>
<p>Aside from the different state representation, this achieves exactly the same thing as the previous snippet. The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> loop over every cell has been completely eliminated! Well, almost. There are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> CPython VM operations, but there is still <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> work being done, hidden away inside the SIMD-accelerated native code of CPython's bigint arithmetic routines. This is a <em>huge</em> performance win, which I'll quantify later. But first, how do we turn that <code>state</code> integer into pixels on the screen?</p>
<h3>Blitting</h3>
<p>To get pixels on the screen, we need to convert the data into a more standard format. The very first step is easy: Python integers have a <code>to_bytes</code> method that serialises them into bytes (like I used in the XOR function example earlier in this article). What to do with those bytes next is less obvious.</p>
<p>In the spirit of only using "pure" Python, I came up with a ridiculous hack: craft a compressed gzip stream that, when decompressed, converts the weird 4-bits-per-pixel buffer into a more standard 8-bits-per-pixel grayscale buffer, and surrounds it in the necessary framing data to be a YUV4MPEG video stream. The output of the Python script can be piped into a gzip decompressor, and subsequently, a video player. That code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/DavidBuchanan314/acae2aab38953759aacc114b417ed0b9">here</a>, and probably deserves an article of its own, but I'm not going to go into it today.</p>
<p>While this was a great hack, gzip is not an especially efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitter">blitter</a>. I was able to get about 24fps at full-screen resolution on my 2021 macbook, but I really wanted at least 60fps, and that approach wasn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>The <em>ideal</em> approach would probably be to ship the 4bpp data off to the GPU as a texture, as-is, and write a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader">fragment shader</a> capable of unpacking it onto the screen pixels. The only reason I didn't do this is because it feels silly. It feels silly because if we're doing GPU programming, we might as well just implement the whole GoL algorithm on the GPU. It'd be way faster, but it wouldn't be within the spirit of the completely arbitrary constraints I'd set for myself.</p>
<p>My compromise here was to use SDL2, via the <code>pysdl2</code> bindings. Sure, it's not "pure Python," but it <em>is</em> very standard and widely available. It feels "right" because I can use it to its full extent without completely defeating the purpose (like running GoL entirely on the GPU would do).</p>
<p>SDL2 supports a pixel format called <code>SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX4LSB</code>, which is a 4-bit palleted mode. If we set up an appropriate palette (specifying the colours for "dead" and "alive" cells, respectively), then we can pass our 4bpp buffer to SDL as-is, and it'll know how to convert it into the right format for sending to the GPU (in this case, <code>SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ARGB8888</code>). This process isn't terribly efficient, because the conversion still happens on the CPU, and the amount of data sent over to the GPU is much larger than necessary. Despite that, it's a whole lot faster than the gzip method, getting around 48fps.</p>
<h3>Parallelization</h3>
<p>We still haven't hit the 60fps target, and to get there I added some parallelization. I summarised my approach in a code comment:</p>

<span>Blitter threads use SDL2 functions to unpack the SWAR buffers into RGBA8888</span>

<span>which does not hold the GIL (meaning we can use multithreading, as opposed</span>
<span>to multiprocessing).</span>

<span>"""</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>That's enough to smash past the 60fps target, reaching ~250fps at my full-screen resolution of 3024x1890, using 8 parallel Life processes. At 4K resolution (3840x2160), it can reach 180fps.</p>
<p>There are plenty of remaining inefficiencies here that could be improved on, but 250fps is already <em>way</em> faster than I care about, so I'm not going to optimise any further. I think 60fps is the most visually interesting speed to watch at, anyway (which can be achieved by turning on vsync).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After having some people test on non-Apple-silicon systems, many are struggling to hit 4K60fps. I haven't done any profiling, but my guess is that the bottleneck is the CPU-&gt;GPU bandwidth, or maybe just memory bandwidth in general. I might revisit this in the future, perhaps implementing the buffer-unpacking fragment shader idea I mentioned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier, I said that upgrading from the naive implementation to SWAB gave "huge" performance wins, so just how huge are they? If I go back to the naive approach, I get an incredible 0.4fps at 4K resolution (and that's <em>with</em> 8x parallelism), representing a ~450x performance difference. If I get extra mean and force it to run on a single thread, it's a 3800x difference relative to the fully optimised version. Damn!</p>
<p>As a reminder, both approaches are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>, but the faster version gets to spend more time within efficient native code.</p>
<p>If I rewrote this whole thing in C using SIMD intrinsics (combined with SWAR or other tricks), I predict that I'd get somewhere between 10x and 100x further speedup, due to more efficient use of SIMD registers and memory accesses. A GPU implementation could be faster still. Those speedups would be nice to have, but I think it's interesting how far I was able to get just by optimising the Python version.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="npm" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2022/07/05/NPM_logo_headpic.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Over the holidays,&nbsp;the npm package registry was flooded with more than 3,000 packages, including one called "everything," and others named&nbsp;a variation of the word.</p>
<p>The package is quite aptly named as downloading "everything"&nbsp;will gradually pull in&nbsp;<em>every single npm package</em>&nbsp;that's ever been published to the npmjs.com registry onto your computer, potentially making it run&nbsp;out of storage. But, that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>If you're asking, "But who would install 'everything'?"—that ignores a bigger side-effect of&nbsp;the package.</p>
<p>Since these 3,000+&nbsp;packages manage&nbsp;to <em>include</em> every single npm package on the npmjs.com registry&nbsp;as their dependency, npm package authors who have ever published to the npm registry would now be unable to remove their packages at will, because of npm's policy.</p>
<h2><em>everything</em>&nbsp;prevents you from unpublishing your packages</h2>
<p>What may have started as a simple prank, ended up having bigger repercussions for all authors across the npm ecosystem.</p>
<p>Installing&nbsp;<em>everything&nbsp;</em>could&nbsp;have just&nbsp;caused your computer to potentially fall short of storage space and slow down, but the package's mere existence on npmjs.com&nbsp;prevents authors—unrelated to this package whatsoever, from unpublishing their packages from&nbsp;the world's largest JavaScript software&nbsp;registry.</p>
<p>The "everything" package&nbsp;has just 5&nbsp;sub-packages, published under the "@everything-registry" scope, listed as its dependencies, BleepingComputer has observed.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="npm package called &quot;everything&quot; attempts to install every package on the npm registry" height="352" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2024/Jan/npm-everything-incident/everything-package.jpg" width="600"><figcaption><strong>"everything" and its many dependencies fetch every single npm package&nbsp;from the registry</strong><br>
(BleepingComputer)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>These 5 packages, however, gradually manage to pull in every single package present on the entire registry as a dependency. For example, "everything" pulls in "@everything-registry/chunk-2," which may further attempt to pull in several other packages by the same author, such as "@everything-registry/sub-chunk-1623."</p>
<p>Each of these&nbsp;sub-packages (or "chunks" as the author calls them),&nbsp;ultimately includes&nbsp;about 800 npm projects as their dependency.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="3000+ packages that pull in everything from the npmjs.com registry" height="553" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2024/Jan/npm-everything-incident/everything-dependencies.jpg" width="600"><figcaption><strong>3000+ packages that pull in everything from the npmjs.com registry</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Considering the author of "everything" has published 3,000 plus such packages (chunks), each with hundreds of dependencies, a single<span>&nbsp;`npm install everything`</span> command will start resolving, what's referred to as transitive dependencies, and end up downloading millions of packages.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~gdi2290" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gdi2290</a>&nbsp;</em>aka <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickJS__" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PatrickJS</a>&nbsp;who is behind this prank&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/everything-registry/everything/issues/17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">apologized</a> for "any difficulties this package has caused," and contacted npm admins to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>A preserved snapshot of the now-removed GitHub discussion is provided&nbsp;below:</p>

<p>"Imagine you did an experiment, published a package to NPM and now you want to remove your NPM package.&nbsp;You can't do it if other packages are using it," <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/when-everything-goes-wrong-npm-dependency-hell-campaign-2024-edition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">writes</a>&nbsp;Jossef Harush, Head of Software Supply Chain Security at&nbsp;Checkmarx on the company's blog.</p>
<p>Harush, who labeled this campaign,&nbsp;"dependency hell," further states, "The problem is, since 'everything' relies on every package (including yours), your package gets stuck, and there's some unknown package preventing you from removing it."</p>
<p>The researcher drew comparisons between "everything" and the "no-one-left-behind" package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/no-one-left-behind" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published in January 2023</a> that attempted to pull off much the same stunt.</p>
<h2>npm policy shift follows <em>left-pad</em> incident</h2>
<p>Unlike some open-source software registries like Maven Central, which are <a href="https://central.sonatype.org/faq/can-i-change-a-component/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">immutable</a>&nbsp;and generally prevent authors from removing their published components, npm and PyPI have traditionally allowed developers to delete, or "yank" their releases at will.</p>
<p>Following a 2016&nbsp;incident though, that entailed <a href="http://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">left-pad's author removing his npm package</a> in protest, and breaking a large part of the internet, npm made it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/69420293" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more difficult</a> for authors to unpublish packages.</p>
<p>One such policy change involved <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">allowing authors to unpublish</a> packages&nbsp;only if&nbsp;no other package on the npm registry is dependent&nbsp;on it.</p>
<p>Ironically, this policy has also left PatrickJS, the author of "everything," unable to easily remove his prank packages, given the extensively long&nbsp;dependency chain he has setup.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer observed, as of this morning, while "everything" continues to live on the registry, the thousands of "@everything-registry" scoped packages used by it have now been made private, potentially resolving the issue.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Updated</span> The US National Labor Relations Board has decided that Google's contractors are still its employees, thus Google is violating US labor laws by refusing to bargain with their chosen&nbsp;union.</p>
<p>A three-judge NLRB panel reached that conclusion in a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/16-CA-326027" rel="nofollow">case</a> between Google and a group of contract staffers working with Google's YouTube team who were hired through staffing firm Cognizant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cognizant contractors on the YouTube team voted to join the Alphabet Workers Union-Communication Workers of America (AWU-CWA) last April. Shortly after, the AWU accused Google and Cognizant of refusing to bargain with it on behalf of the YouTube contract workers.</p>

    

<p>According to the NLRB panel, Google openly admits to refusing to bargain with the Union because it, along with Cognizant "contest the validity of the union's certification" based on the pair's position "that Cognizant and Google are <em>not</em> joint employers."&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>The NLRB has concluded otherwise that "Cognizant and Google have codetermined the essential terms and conditions of employment [for the YouTube team] and have been joint employers" at all material times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"By failing and refusing … to recognize and bargain with the Union [Google and Cognizant] have engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 8(a)(5) and (1) and Section 2(6) and (7) of the [National Labor Relations] <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act" rel="nofollow">Act</a>," the three-judge panel decided.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Google, however, stands fast to the position that those Cognizant employees might work <em>at</em> Google, but not <em>for</em> it.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/04/google_nlrb_complaint/">Google cut contractors off from online 'Share My Salary' spreadsheet, union claims</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/05/google_union_plan/">Techies start growing an Alphabet-wide labor union: 200-plus sign up, only tens of thousands more to go</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/20/dont_be_evil_a_gaggle/">Don't Be Evil, a gaggle of Googlers tell CEO Pichai amid mega layoffs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/google_datacenter_contract_workers_nlrb/">Google datacenter contractors claim 'retaliation' for talking workers' rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"As we've said before, we have no objection to these Cognizant employees electing to form a union," Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini told <em>The Register</em>. "We simply believe it's only appropriate for Cognizant, as their employer, to engage in collective bargaining."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're appealing the NLRB's joint employer decision to federal court as Google does not control the employment terms or conditions of these Cognizant workers," Mencini added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Google refuses to comply with the NLRB order the board won't have much way to penalize it, at least not for now. Per the judges, a "compensatory remedy" was requested, but the board severed the issue for future consideration since fining Google for its actions would require reviewing prior case law and "outlining a methodological framework for calculating such a remedy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, we'll figure it out if and when we have to.</p>
<h3>How many times must you be told?</h3>
<p>If this entire situation sounds similar, that's because it's practically a point-for-point repeat of another situation Google found itself in last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that instance, a group of Google contract employees hired through Accenture and working to train Bard were allegedly fired after attempting to unionize, but remaining team members went through and won their vote to join the AWU-CWA in November. Mencini had a largely identical script prepared for us when we spoke after the NLRB decided Google and Accenture were joint employers despite Google's claims to the contrary.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"We have no objection to these Accenture workers electing to form a union. We've long had many contracts with unionized suppliers," Mencini told us last year. "However, as we made clear in our active appeal to the NLRB, we are not a joint employer as we simply do not control their employment terms or working conditions."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Accenture appeal is ongoing. Google was <a href="https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4583ae2264" rel="nofollow">told</a> last year that it and Cognizant met the terms of joint employment, but its latest appeal means the matter is headed for the federal court system. There, the matter could have wide-ranging implications for the future of contract labor law.&nbsp;®</p>
<h3>Update to add</h3>
<p>“Once again, the National Labor Relations Board has found Alphabet guilty of breaking labor law and infringing on our rights as workers to freely organize and bargain for fair working conditions," Katie-Marie Marschner, subject matter expert at YouTube Music and member of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"After a unanimous union election victory, and consistent rulings from the NLRB determining that Alphabet significantly shapes our working conditions and is in fact our employer, the company has refused to meet us at the bargaining table. Google and Cognizant have proceeded to make unilateral changes to our working conditions such as a forced return to office, removal of sick pay during a global pandemic, and the implementation of a 'Clean Room' policy that bars us from having our phones, paper, or pens in our office, without bargaining with our union.</p>
<p>"Any future appeals by Alphabet are just an attempt to avoid collectively bargaining with the union and pad the pockets of shareholders and executives. Alphabet and Cognizant are our joint employers and we, as employees of one of the largest corporations in the world, deserve to earn something above poverty wages."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="{updatedAt}">Updated on: <!-- -->January 5, 2024</time><p>If you want a home network that aligns with the US National Security Agency (NSA) criteria for protecting classified and top secret information, then read on fellow traveler, because that’s where we’re headed in this post!</p>
<p>However, if you want a home network that’s simple to configure, easy for your guests to borrow, hassle-free, and that all of your Smart Home gadgets can connect to, then you should close this tab now, because the most secure Wi-Fi mode available today—WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit mode—is not for you.</p>
<p>Still, it can be fun to try these things. And amazingly, deploying NSA-grade Wi-Fi is possible at home. It’s supported by a lot of modern Wi-Fi access points. It’s supported by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/extensible-authentication-protocol/network-access?tabs=eap-tls%2Cserveruserprompt-eap-tls%2Ceap-sim#wpa3-enterprise-192-bit-mode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Windows 10, Windows 11</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-access-to-wireless-networks-sec8a67fa93d/web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">macOS, iOS, tvOS, iPads, Apple Watches</a>, and <a href="https://networkmanager.dev/blog/networkmanager-1-30/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> as well.</p>
<p>This tutorial will cover iOS/iPadOS and macOS clients, and we will use a Unifi Dream Machine as our Access Point. You can follow this entire tutorial using “plain” WPA3 Enterprise <em>without</em> 192-bit mode, and you'll still have the most secure Wi-Fi network on the block. The only risk is that you may feel unprepared when the Secretary of Defense swings by for a casual co-working sesh in your living room.</p>
<h3 id="all-the-reasons-you-should-not-do-this-at-home">All the reasons you should not do this at home<a href="#all-the-reasons-you-should-not-do-this-at-home"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>WPA3 Enterprise is not a good fit for a home network. Typically, a large organization running WPA3 Enterprise will have many users and devices, and they will use Mobile Device Management (MDM). With an MDM provider like Jamf or Intune, it's possible to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSL_Ke7HcpU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">configure and deploy certificate-based Wi-FI on a network in a few minutes</a>. But on a home network, with no MDM provider, you'll need another mechanism for getting certificates to your devices. Oh, did I mention that you <em>need</em> certificates? There is no username or password option with WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit mode. It requires certificate-based authentication.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we're going to use a manual process. But by doing it this way, we can illuminate a bit more of what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>The two most common security modes for home Wi-Fi networks are WPA2-PSK and the newer WPA3-Personal. Both use a pre-shared password for authentication that strikes a friendly balance between usability and security.  NSA-grade Wi-Fi is different:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier, you need certificates. When friends come over, instead of just saying, “The password is MeleKalikimaka”, you will have to issue a precious Wi-Fi certificate for them and transfer it onto their device. A device which, by the way, does not yet have a Wi-Fi connection!</li>
<li>Because you need certificates, your Smart Home devices won’t support WPA3 Enterprise. Home printers won’t support it. A lot of things won't support it. In fact, it’s a miracle that some consumer-grade routers and access points support it at all.</li>
<li>Finally, Enterprise Wi-Fi is complex to operate. It requires more than just an access point. At minimum, you also need an external authentication server and, in our case, a Certificate Authority. (For this tutorial, we'll take care of these components for you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, most people should not run WPA3 Enterprise at home.
And if you’re still reading this, you’re not most people.</p>

<p>For this project, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Wi-Fi access point that supports WPA2 Enterprise or WPA3 Enterprise security.</li>
<li>A client device you can test with.</li>
<li>A Smallstep account for certificates and authentication. We have a free tier for homelabs, so <a href="https://smallstep.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sign up right here</a> to get started.</li>

<p>As you know, most home Wi-Fi uses a single shared password. With Enterprise Wi-Fi, however, there’s a dozen or so authentication protocols designed to fit different scenarios. These are all flavors of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3748" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RFC 3748</a>], and they allow network authentication to be delegated by the AP to an external server and identity provider. While the wireless security modes (eg. WPA2 Personal or WPA3 Enterprise) define the algorithms and security parameters for the entire Wi-Fi connection, the EAP method defines how a device will authenticate to the network.</p>
<p>Since we love certificates and TLS here at Smallstep, in this post we will zero in on the certificate-authenticated EAP method, called EAP-TLS [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5216" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RFC 5216</a>]. EAP-TLS is the only EAP that requires mutual certificate authentication. This makes it, in our humble opinion, the most secure EAP out there. It offers some very nice security properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>No shared secret for accessing the network</li>
<li>No usernames or passwords, either</li>
<li>Instead, every device or user needs a device certificate and private key issued by an internal CA</li>
<li>Certificates can be issued manually, but are more often issued via Mobile Device Management (MDM), making network authentication and device identity transparent to the user of the device</li>
<li>Certificates are validated by an external RADIUS authentication server [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2865" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RFC 2865</a>]—not by the access point itself.</li>
<li>The private key can be strongly protected from theft</li>
<li>Certificates expire—passwords don’t!</li>
</ul>
<p>And, beyond being a fun weekend project, EAP-TLS could have <em>some</em> use at home. If you have a crafty teenager named Mallory who knows how to spoof MAC addresses to circumvent parental controls, you could try EAP-TLS. Once you have established the basic EAP-TLS setup described below, you could extend your configuration to cover your wired Ethernet ports, using IEEE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">802.1X</a> features. This is what hospitals are required to do to lock down their networks for HIPAA compliance, so it would offer plenty of protection against a malicious TikTok-obsesseed threat actor. The setup details for 802.1X wired network protection are, however, beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup<a href="#the-setup"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Here’s a simplified diagram of an Apple laptop getting a client certificate and joining an EAP-TLS authenticated network. With EAP-TLS, the RADIUS server must complete a mutual TLS handshake with the device before giving the thumbs up to the access point:</p>
<p><img src="https://smallstep.imgix.net/graphics/Authenticating_to_an_EAP-TLS_network.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;q=50" alt="Authenticating to an EAP-TLS network.png"></p>

<p>Smallstep will be your Certificate Authority and it will issue certificates for your devices. It uses a two-tiered private PKI, with a Root CA and an Intermediate CA.</p>
<h3 id="the-radius-server">The RADIUS Server<a href="#the-radius-server"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Smallstep will host a RADIUS server for you too, so you don’t have to worry about setting that up or configuring it. All you'll do is configure your Access Point to use it.</p>
<p>For context, though, here’s what the RADIUS server is configured to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require EAP-TLS, which is the only EAP type compatible with NSA-grade Wi-Fi</li>
<li>Use a valid server certificate from a CA that the device will trust</li>
<li>When a new device connects, authenticate its client certificate via a TLS handshake that is proxied through the AP. Certificates will be issued by your Smallstep Accounts Authority. To accept clients certificates, the RADIUS server needs to be configured to trust the root and intermediate of your Smallstep Accounts Authority (Smallstep will take care of this for you, too)</li>
</ul>

<p>Smallstep issues the certificates you'll need for clients to access the network, and we host a RADIUS server for network authentication. The RADIUS server authenticate devices joining the network, and reports back to your Access Point whether they are to be accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>Let’s create a Smallstep Wi-Fi Account and RADIUS server:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, create a Device Collection. <a href="https://smallstep.com/app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sign into Smallstep</a>, go to the <strong>Mobile Devices</strong> tab, and choose <strong>+ Add Collection</strong>. Select <strong>Any macOS, iPadOS, or iOS device</strong> as the platform, and give your device collection a name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add your test device(s) to the device collection. Use the serial number of the device as the Device Identifier when you create it.  You can find the serial number for your device under <code>Settings &gt; General &gt; About</code> , or in <code>About This Mac</code>. Make sure you click "Register Device".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a “Wi-Fi” account in your new Smallstep Device Collection</p>
<p>You’ll need to supply the Wi-Fi SSID you’ll use for WPA3 Enterprise and your public-facing (WAN) IP address, so our RADIUS server can identify requests from your network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you’re finished, you’ll see your RADIUS server details. Use these when you configure your Access Point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-configure-your-access-point">2. Configure your Access Point<a href="#2-configure-your-access-point"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Once you have created your Smallstep Wi-Fi Account, there’s really only three or four bits of configuration needed your Access Point. You’ll probably want to create a separate test network for this project. Each AP is will have a slightly different configuration UI, but these are the network settings that will matter no matter what AP you’re using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Protocol: WPA-3 Enterprise</li>
<li>RADIUS server information (provided by Smallstep)
<ul>
<li>RADIUS server IP</li>
<li>RADIUS server port</li>
<li>RADIUS server shared secret</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High Security 192-bit Mode: On</li>
</ul>
<p>All we’re doing here is delegating WPA3 Enterprise Wi-Fi authentication to your Smallstep account.</p>
<h3 id="example-configuring-a-unifi-access-point">Example: Configuring a UniFi Access Point<a href="#example-configuring-a-unifi-access-point"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>In the Unifi Network app, first create a RADIUS Profile:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Profiles</strong> → <strong>RADIUS</strong> → <strong>Create New</strong></li>
<li>Give the profile a name</li>
<li>Under Authentication servers, add the RADIUS server IP address, port, and shared secret you received from Smallstep</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, create a Wi-Fi network that you’ll use for testing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>WiFi</strong> → <strong>Create New</strong></li>
<li>Give your network an SSID</li>
<li>Under <strong>Advanced Configuration</strong>, choose <strong>Manual</strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong>Security</strong>
<ol>
<li>For <strong>Security Protocol</strong>, select WPA-3 Enterprise</li>
<li>For <strong>RADIUS Profile,</strong> select the RADIUS profile you created above</li>
<li>Turn on <strong>High Security 192-bit mode</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Go back and choose <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>🚨 <strong>Not all APs support multiple SSIDs.</strong> If yours only supports a single SSID, and you can’t create a test network, it’s hard to do this project without any Wi-Fi interruptions. At a minimum, you will probably want to connect your device over Ethernet to your AP/router before you proceed to ensure you have uninterrupted access to the internet.</p>
<p>Great! You now have a test network. Let’s test it!</p>
<h2 id="3-connect-a-device">3. Connect a device<a href="#3-connect-a-device"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Let’s get your test device configured. This is the most complex and annoying part of the process, but I've tried to simplify it. We need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root distribution</strong>: Each device needs the CA that issued the RADIUS server’s certificate installed and marked as trusted.</li>
<li><strong>Enrollment</strong>: Each device needs a valid device certificate from a CA that the RADIUS server trusts. For this project, the device will generate its own private key and get a certificate which is bound to that key and signed by your Smallstep CA.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi configuration</strong>: While not critical, it helps to pre-configure the WPA3 Enterprise network as a known network configuration on the device. This way, the device can immediately connect with a single tap.</li>
<li>Finally, there’s <strong>renewal.</strong> The certificate we’ll issue will expire in about 90 days. We need to renew it somehow, <em>before</em> the device loses access to the network. We’ll cover renewal a bit later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enrollment-on-iosipados-using-airdrop">Enrollment on iOS/iPadOS, using AirDrop<a href="#enrollment-on-iosipados-using-airdrop"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>In a typical enterprise Wi-Fi deployment, all of the enrollment issues are resolved with an mobile device management (MDM) server. The MDM server pushes configuration profiles down to the device. Configuration profiles configure the device’s settings and, for things like Wi-Fi networks, get certificates from a CA.</p>
<p>But running an MDM server for a home network is a hassle. Instead, today we will do MDM <em>without</em> an MDM server. Also known as a manual enrollment or user enrollment.</p>
<p>Smallstep will generate an Apple configuration profile (a <code>.mobileconfig</code> file) for each of your devices, and you can just AirDrop this file over to the device and install it. This is perfect for testing, or if you only have a few devices and don’t need an MDM server. If you can't use AirDrop, email also works.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, we'd install the root certificate via the <code>.mobileconfig</code>. Unfortunately for us, Apple prevents automatic root certificate installation except via MDM. So we'll need to install our Accounts Root CA separately.</p>
<p>Download and install your Accounts Root CA certificate:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, go to your Apple device collection in the Smallstep UI</li>
<li>Navigate to the Wi-Fi account you created earlier</li>
<li>Scroll to "Authority Settings" and download your Root Certificate</li>
<li>AirDrop the root certificate to your test device, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/profile-manager/distribute-profiles-manually-pmdbd71ebc9/mac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">install it there</a> by opening Settings → Profile Downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve installed the root certificate, there’s one more step: with manual enrollment, Apple requires you to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102390" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">explicitly enable Full Trust</a> for the Smallstep Accounts Root CA. This is not true for a full MDM enrollment, but we need to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings</li>
<li>Toggle the switch on the Smallstep Accounts CA to enable Full Trust</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Smallstep Accounts Root CA is now trusted.</p>
<p>Now, download and install your <code>.mobileconfig</code> file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Return to your Apple device collection in the Smallstep UI</li>
<li>Click "Devices", find your test device, click "view device", and navigate to the "Accounts" tab on the device profile</li>
<li>Now, click the "Configuration Profile" link on the Wifi account to download the <code>.mobileconfig</code>, but don't install it</li>
<li>AirDrop the <code>.mobileconfig</code> to your test device, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/profile-manager/distribute-profiles-manually-pmdbd71ebc9/mac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">install it there</a> by opening Settings → Profile Downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve installed the profile, we once again need to manually tweak trust settings. This time to explicitly enable Full Trust for the Smallstep RADIUS server’s root CA. Again, this is not true for a full MDM enrollment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings</li>
<li>Toggle the switch on the Smallstep RADIUS Root CA to enable Full Trust</li>
</ol>
<p>The Smallstep RADIUS Root CA is now trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Join the network</strong></p>
<p>The device is now enrolled, and you’re ready to join the network.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Settings → Wi-Fi</li>
<li>Choose your WPA-3 Enterprise network SSID</li>
</ol>
<p>If everything is configured correctly, your test device will join the network!</p>
<h3 id="enrollment-on-macos">Enrollment on macOS<a href="#enrollment-on-macos"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>This is very similar to iOS enrollment.</p>
<p>To install the Smallstep Accounts Root CA, follow the download instructions for iOS then open the downloaded file to install it in your System Keychain. Again, manually installed root certificates aren't trusted by default, so you'll need to open Keychain Access and adjust the trust settings for the certificate to "Always Trusted" (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/change-the-trust-settings-of-a-certificate-kyca11871/mac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">full instructions here</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Keychain Access</li>
<li>In the System keychain, find the Smallstep Accounts Root CA Certificate, and double-click on it</li>
<li>Open the Trust section</li>
<li>In the “When using this certificate” dropdown, select “Always Trust.”</li>
<li>The CA certificate is now trusted for Wi-Fi RADIUS server connections</li>
</ol>
<p>To get a <code>.mobileconfig</code> file:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, go to your Apple Device Collection in the Smallstep UI</li>
<li>Click Devices and add macOS device, using the device serial number as the “device identifier” in Smallstep</li>
<li>Once it’s created, click "view device" and navigate to Accounts</li>
<li>Choose “download configuration profile” for your macOS device</li>
<li>Download the <code>.mobileconfig</code> and open it</li>
<li>Open System Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Profiles</li>
<li>Under “Downloaded”, double-click the profile you just added</li>
<li>Choose “Install…”, and choose Install again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve installed the profile, there’s one more step: return to Keychain Access and explicitly "Always Trust" the Smallstep RADIUS Root CA certificate as we did with the Smallstep Accounts Root CA above.</p>
<p><strong>Join the network</strong></p>
<p>Choose your WPA3 Enterprise SSID from the Wi-Fi menu. If everything is configured correctly, your test device will join the network!</p>

<p>Now you can repeat the process for other devices. Add the device to your Device Collection on Smallstep, download a profile for it, and AirDrop the profile to the device.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-renewal">What About Renewal?<a href="#what-about-renewal"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>You need to renew every device’s client certificate. By default, these certificates will have a 90 day validity period. For an MDM-without-MDM setup, you’ll need to renew them manually every 45-60 days. To do this, AirDrop the same <code>.mobileconfig</code> file that you originally downloaded to the device, and install it. The device will get a new certificate for itself from your Smallstep CA.</p>

<p>Houseguests with Apple devices don’t need full root distribution. They can just trust the RADIUS server’s certificate the first time they connect to wifi. (Side note: In enterprise networks, this is not okay, because without real server validation, an attacker can create an “evil twin” network with the same SSID and run a RADIUS server that captures credentials from devices attempting to connect.)</p>
<p>A houseguest’s device serial number doesn’t need to be registered with Smallstep, and they don’t need certificate renewal either. We just need to send them a single client certificate and they can join the network manually.</p>
<p>Let’s get a client certificate for your Wi-Fi network onto their device:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Certificate Manager → Authorities tab, go to your Accounts authority and use the UI to create a certificate for your houseguest. Give it a validity period that matches the duration of your guest’s stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <code>.crt</code> and <code>.key</code> files. From here you’ll need to make a <code>.p12</code> bundle for your device. Pop open a Terminal and run the following, using the files you just downloaded as inputs:</p>
<pre><code>openssl pkcs12 -export -legacy -inkey wifi.key -in wifi.crt -out wifi.p12
</code></pre>
<p>When asked for a password, <em>don’t leave it blank</em>. iOS/iPadOS won’t accept an empty password. This is a temporary password, so you can use something simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great, now AirDrop or otherwise transfer <code>wifi.p12</code> over to your device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept the AirDrop, then go to Settings → Profile Downloaded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap Install, type your passcode, and tap Install again. It will say that the profile is not signed. That’s totally fine. Tap install a third time, then enter the password you created earlier. Tap Done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the device can join the network, but since there’s no wifi configuration payload on their device, they will have to supply the certificate manually when they connect to your Wi-Fi:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the network SSID</li>
<li>Under the Mode menu, select EAP-TLS</li>
<li>Go back, and under the Identity menu, select the client certificate</li>
<li>Tap Join</li>
</ol>

<p>So, how does the <code>.mobileconfig</code> file work under the hood? Well, Apple’s configuration profiles are grouped by “payloads” that configure certain parts of the device. For our wifi setup, each profile has three payloads:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Certificate</strong>: This payload is for installing a CA certificate PEM file on the device. In our case, we’re installing the CA that issued our RADIUS server’s certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACME Certificate</strong>: The ACME Certificate payload uses the ACME protocol (this is the same protocol Let’s Encrypt uses, just in a different context) to get a Wi-Fi client certificate from your Smallstep Accounts CA.</p>
<p>The ACME Certificate flow uses Apple’s new Managed Device Attestation feature—and the new ACME <code>device-attest-01</code> challenge type—to get a certificate without any credentials stored in the payload. The basic idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device goes to Apple and gets an Attestation Certificate that includes some identifying information, like its serial number. Note that this certificate uses a private key that is not exportable, offering a third party strong assurances that it is, indeed, talking to the device identified by the attestation certificate.</li>
<li>The device uses the Attestation Certificate and private key to request a Wi-Fi certificate from the Smallstep CA. Smallstep will only issue certificates to devices with serial numbers shown in your Apple Device Collection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>: This configures the network itself, so you can connect with a single tap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-why-is-nsa-grade-wi-fi-called-192-bit-mode">Footnote: Why is NSA-grade Wi-Fi called "192-bit mode"?<a href="#footnote-why-is-nsa-grade-wi-fi-called-192-bit-mode"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Like many things in the dark art of PKI, this is not at all obvious at first, because none of the cryptographic parameters for this mode mention 192 bits of anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificates must be ECC using elliptic curve secp384r1</li>
<li>Protocol must be TLSV1.2, all others are disabled (in practice, TLS 1.3 seems to work, it just isn’t officially NSA-grade wifi)</li>
<li>Cipher algorithm must be AES-256</li>
<li>Key exchange algorithm must be ECDH</li>
<li>Digital signature algorithm must be ECDSA</li>
<li>Hashing algorithm must be SHA384</li>
<li>Cipher suites allowed for NSA Suite B 192 bit are
<ul>
<li><code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_W_AES_256_CBC_SHA384</code></li>
<li><code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_W_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this, as Microsoft puts it, will “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/extensible-authentication-protocol/network-access?tabs=eap-tls%2Cserveruserprompt-eap-tls%2Ceap-sim#wpa3-enterprise-192-bit-mode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">provide a minimum of 192 bits of security</a>.” Where “security” means “the amount of effort it would take to gain access.” I’m not sure if that is linear or exponential effort, but I will leave that question alone for now, otherwise this post will never see the light of day.</p>
<p>So, here’s what I think is going on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According to Wikipedia</a>, most cryptographic algorithms are designed to have a level of security equal to their key size. But elliptic curve algorithms are different. They have an effective security of roughly half of the key size. So, “192-bits of security” requires at least a 384 bit key size. And, as you can see above, 192-bit mode wifi uses secp384r1, a 384-bit prime field <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_elliptic_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Weierstrass elliptic curve</a>.</p>

Today I'd like&nbsp;</span></span><span>to take the opportunity to talk about some of the larger lessons&nbsp;</span><span>learned since that day. Even the most successful projects have&nbsp;</span><span>things that, upon reflection, could have been done better. And of&nbsp;</span><span>course, things that in hindsight seem to have been key to their&nbsp;</span><span>success.</span></p><p><span><span>Up front I must make clear that I am speaking only for myself, not&nbsp;</span></span><span>for the Go team and not for Google.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Go was and still is a huge effort by a dedicated team and a huge community, so if you agree with anything I say, thank them. If you disagree, blame me but please keep it to yourself 😃.</span></p><p><span><span>Given the title of this talk, many people might expect I'm going&nbsp;</span></span><span>to be analyzing good and bad things in the language. Of course I'll do some of that, but much more besides, for several reasons.</span></p><p><span><span>First, what's good and bad in a programming language is largely a&nbsp;</span></span><span>matter of opinion rather than fact, despite the certainty with which many people argue about even the most trivial features of Go or any other language.</span></p><p><span><span>Also, there has already been plenty of discussion about things such as where the newlines go, how nil works, using upper case for export, garbage collection, error handling, and so on.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are certainly things to say there, but little that hasn't already been said.</span></span></p><p><span><span>But the real reason I'm going to talk about more than the language is that that's not what the whole project was about. Our original goal was not to create a new programming language, it was to create a better way to write software. We had issues with the languages we were using</span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span>everyone does, whatever the language</span><span>—</span><span>but the fundamental problems we had were not central to the features of those languages, but rather to the process that had been created for using them to build software at Google.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="225" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l1ERR57yyeKPWdSlzvKhKpmL2ZXk4cZwIplGY7fG3jyOwUFn8esWo79SE6Vh0IiFWiD-AfKyXYk2iC90ryJCqHtpQCZbsDwJUDftuf_jX_p_XtfPP04j-nkZ9LL2u-bQIx2Zykc_uFcmT9j0KifQyo6x9A=w400-h225" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td><span>The first gopher on a t-shirt</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>The creation of a new language provided a new path to explore other ideas, but it was only an enabler, not the real point. If it didn't take 45 minutes to build the binary I was working on at the time, Go would not have happened, but those 45 minutes were not because the compiler was slow, because it wasn't, or because the language it was written in was bad, because it wasn't. The slowness arose from other factors.</span></span></p><p><span><span>And those factors were what we wanted to address: The complexities of building modern server software: controlling dependencies, programming with large teams with changing personnel, ease of maintainability, efficient testing, effective use of multicore CPUs and networking, and so on.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In short, Go is not just a programming language. Of course it is a&nbsp;</span></span><span>programming language, that's its definition, but its purpose was to help provide a better way to develop high-quality software, at least compared to our environment 14 plus years ago.</span></p><p><span><span>And that's still what it's about today. Go is a project to make&nbsp;</span></span><span>building production software easier and more productive.</span></p><p><span><span>A few weeks back, when starting to prepare this talk, I had a title&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but little else.<span>&nbsp; </span>To get me going, I asked people on Mastodon for&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>input. A fair few responded, and I noticed a trend in the replies:&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>people thought the things we got wrong were all in the language,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but those we got right were in the larger story, the stuff around&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>the language like gofmt and deployment and testing. I find that&nbsp;</span></span><span>encouraging, actually. What we were trying to do seems to have had an effect.</span></p><p><span><span>But it's worth admitting that we didn't make clear early on what&nbsp;</span></span><span>the true goals were. Perhaps we felt they were self-evident.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>To&nbsp;</span><span>address that shortcoming, in 2013 I gave a talk at the SPLASH&nbsp;</span><span>conference entitled,&nbsp;</span><i>Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering.</i></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="425" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HCe4_dZBgS8SSYkp1xwH0U61SceRS-r1VHnHRxvmkIQUMbv98NEfVr9xWQKkQYiZFdvajhvIRBzoqRWPR9J_xSfktKplJoC7QM_b6VL1eSc3J6PNiSiBCH0YN1y2NF3m45HXdQomQBC5ddqppBgzXxQVcw=w640-h425" width="640"></td></tr><tr><td>Go at Google</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>That talk and associated blog post are perhaps the best explanation of why Go happened.</span></p><p><span><span>Today's talk is something of a follow-on to the SPLASH talk,&nbsp;</span></span><span>looking back on the lessons learned once we got past building&nbsp;</span><span>the language and could apply ourselves to the bigger picture more broadly.</span></p><p><span><span>And so... some lessons.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First, of course, we have:</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The Gopher</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>It may seem an odd place to start, but the Go gopher is one of the&nbsp;</span></span><span>earliest factors in Go's success.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>We knew long before the launch&nbsp;</span><span>that we wanted a mascot to adorn the schwag - every project needs schwag - and Renee French offered to create one for us.

This bothered me. I'd been doing concurrency-like things, sometimes without even realizing it, since the 1970s and it seemed powerful to me. But upon reflection it became clear that Ousterhout was making two mistakes. First, he was generalizing beyond the domain he was interested in using threads for, and second, he was mostly complaining about using them through with clumsy low-level packages like pthread, and not about the fundamental idea.</span></p><p><span><span>It's a mistake common to engineers everywhere to confuse the solution and the problem like this. Sometimes the proposed solution is harder than the problem it addresses, and it can be hard to see there is an easier path. But I digress.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I knew from experience that there were nicer ways to use threads,&nbsp;</span></span><span>or whatever we choose to call them, and even gave a pre-Go talk&nbsp;</span><span>about them.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hB05UFqOtFA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img height="302" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GeRc6AtfheAKNQ8m31O0Y2s2TFLkZ39d8hadIjfzbenL_BwBktjznQiGpjkJpZppRRZorbGmITB1wI_dYxMZB1Ha4cyMR_gXgLjY5ZBfYbFlV01N3aLSHm2rYUWt0P6OQRz7xCl5HsLXyZcvw5jVwkPHvQ=w400-h302" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Concurrency in Newsqueak</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>But I wasn't alone in knowing this; a number of other languages,&nbsp;</span><span>papers, and even books had been written about concurrent programming that showed it could be done well.

We invented the word "goroutine" because no existing term fit. And to this day I wish the Unix spell command would learn it.</span></span></p><p><span><span>As an aside, because I am often asked about it, let me speak for a&nbsp;</span></span><span>minute about async/await.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>It saddens me a bit that the async/await model with its associated style is the way many languages have chosen to support concurrency, but it is definitely a huge improvement over pthreads.</span></p><p><span><span>Compared to goroutines, channels, and select, async/await is easier and smaller for language implementers to build or to retrofit into existing platforms. But it pushes some of the complexity back on the programmer, often resulting in what Bob Nystrom has famously called "colored functions".</span></span></p><p><span><span>I think Go shows that CSP, which is a different but older model,&nbsp;</span></span><span>fits perfectly into a procedural language without such complication. I've even seen it done several times as a library. But its implementation, done well, requires a significant runtime complexity, and I can understand why some folks would prefer not to build that into their system. It's important, though, whatever concurrency model you provide, to do it exactly once, because an environment providing multiple concurrency implementations can be problematic.

This is&nbsp;</span><span>not the style of object-oriented programming most people were&nbsp;</span><span>familiar with, but it's a very powerful idea.</span></p><p><span><span>That idea was exciting for us, and the possibility that this could become a foundational</span></span></p><p><span><span>programming construct was intoxicating.<span>&nbsp; </span>When Russ joined, he soon pointed out how I/O would fit beautifully into this idea, and the library took place rapidly, based in large part on the three famous interfaces: empty, Writer, and Reader, holding an average of two thirds of a method each.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those tiny methods are idiomatic to Go, and ubiquitous.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The way interfaces work became not only a distinguishing feature&nbsp;</span></span><span>of Go, they became the way we thought about libraries, and generality, and composition. It was heady stuff.</span></p><p><span><span>But we might have erred in stopping the conversation there.</span></span></p><p><span><span>You see, we went down this path at least in part because we had&nbsp;</span></span><span>seen too often how generic programming encouraged a way of thinking that tended to focus on types before algorithms. Early abstraction instead of organic design. Containers instead of functions.</span></p><p><span><span>We defined generic containers in the language proper - maps, slices, arrays, channels - without giving programmers access to the genericity they contained. This was arguably a mistake. We believed, correctly I still think, that most simple programming tasks could be handled just fine by those types. But there are some that cannot, and the barrier between what the language provided and what the user could control definitely bothered some people.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In short, although I wouldn't change a thing about how interfaces&nbsp;</span></span><span>worked, they colored our thinking in ways it took more than a decade to correct. Ian Taylor pushed us, from early on, to face this problem, but it was quite hard to do given the presence of interfaces as the bedrock of Go programming.</span></p><p><span><span>Critics often complained we should just do generics, because they&nbsp;</span></span><span>are "easy", and perhaps they can be in some languages, but the existence of interfaces meant that any new form of polymorphism had to take them into account. Finding a way forward that worked well with the rest of the language required multiple attempts, several aborted implementations, and many hours, days, and weeks of discussion. Eventually we roped in some type theorists to help out, led by Phil Wadler.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>And even today, with a solid generic model in the language, there are still lingering problems to do with the presence of interfaces as method sets.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5SS3786IKXJjs82x4-erKQdrijskx1rOwXBBVsefXsDLwZE5DDUJPRl9sMHzXc85WW8DY8qxQekd3JzuEKgUXqTvCBdpAcuVA8jn-vl_l8rfXoMCJ8_lP0dVmmlgy5lRVXf0yXVe8MPJ4XW6GlAmhsBJj0gpeJ4CpZZEmPR79RUdF9aLRjRWzPQ/s3016/Untitled.jpg"><img data-original-height="552" data-original-width="3016" height="118" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5SS3786IKXJjs82x4-erKQdrijskx1rOwXBBVsefXsDLwZE5DDUJPRl9sMHzXc85WW8DY8qxQekd3JzuEKgUXqTvCBdpAcuVA8jn-vl_l8rfXoMCJ8_lP0dVmmlgy5lRVXf0yXVe8MPJ4XW6GlAmhsBJj0gpeJ4CpZZEmPR79RUdF9aLRjRWzPQ/w640-h118/Untitled.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Generic sort specification</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>The final answer, as you know, was to design a generalization of&nbsp;</span><span>interfaces that could absorb more forms of polymorphism, transitioning from "sets of methods" to "sets of types". It's a subtle but profound move, one that most of the community seems to be fine with, although I suspect the grumbling will never stop.</span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes it takes many years to figure something out, or even to figure out that you can't quite figure it out. But you press on.</span></span></p><p><span><span>By the way, I wish we had a better term than "generics", which originated as the term for a different, data-structure-centric style of polymorphism. "Parametric polymorphism" is the proper term for what Go provides, and it's an accurate one, but it's an ugly mouthful. But "generics" is what we say, even though it's not quite right.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The Compiler</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>One of the things that bothered the programming language community was that the early Go compiler was written in C. The proper way, in their opinion, was to use LLVM or a similar toolkit, or to write the compiler in Go itself, a process called self-hosting.<span>&nbsp; </span>We didn't do either of these, for several reasons.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First, bootstrapping a new language requires that at least the first&nbsp;</span></span><span>steps towards its compiler must be done in an existing language. For us, C was the obvious choice, as Ken had written a C compiler&nbsp;</span><span>already, and its internals could serve well as the basis of a Go&nbsp;</span><span>compiler. Also, writing a compiler in its own language, while&nbsp;</span><span>simultaneously developing the language, tends to result in a language that is good for writing compilers, but that was not the kind of language we were after.</span></p><p><span><span>The early compiler worked. It bootstrapped the language well. But&nbsp;</span></span><span>it was a bit of an odd duck, in effect a Plan 9-style compiler using&nbsp;</span><span>old ideas in compiler writing, rather than new ones such as static&nbsp;</span><span>single assignment.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>The generated code was mediocre, and the internals were not pretty.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>But it was pragmatic and efficient, and the compiler code itself was modest in size and familiar to us, which made it easy to make changes quickly as we tried new ideas. One critical step was the addition of segmented stacks that grew automatically. This was very easy to add to our compiler, but had we been using a toolkit like LLVM, the task of integrating that change into the full compiler suite would have been infeasible, given the required changes to the ABI and garbage collector support.</span></p><p><span><span>Another area that worked well was cross-compilation, which came directly from the way the&nbsp;</span></span><span>original Plan 9 compiler suite worked.</span></p><p><span><span>Doing it our way, however unorthodox, helped us move fast. Some people were offended by this choice, but it was the right one for us at the time.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="256" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rfL0OSI7StvNiafGcbDSiUrlI2rYep8MO4XD-IqhatdvmVE7bEzVXf-swzlY5hSUXNgPEbNhHCW6-0O7AZ4uDKeJmVffeXooYqI7kPIHGMp-xjoh7i2Y55dqozmUFlDFQRNcrVJdXzeLzX8zbejDpWG5PQ=w400-h256" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>The Go compiler architecture post Go 1.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>For Go version 1.5, Russ wrote a tool to translate the compiler&nbsp;</span><span>semi-automatically from C to Go.

The current compiler&nbsp;</span><span>is much cleaner than the original and generates much better code. But, of course, that is how bootstrapping works.</span></p><p><span><span>Remember, our goal was just not a language, but much more.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Our unusual approach was in no way an insult to LLVM or anyone&nbsp;</span></span><span>in the language community.

And of course, today there is an LLVM-hosted compiler for Go, and many others, as there should be.</span></p><p><span><span><b>Project Management</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>We knew from the start that to succeed, Go had to be an open source project. But we also knew that it would be more productive to develop in private until we had the key ideas figured out and a working implementation. Those first two years were essential to clarifying, free of distraction, what we were trying to achieve.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The transition to open source was a huge change, and educational. The input from the community was overwhelming. Engaging with the community took a lot of time and effort, especially for Ian, who somehow found time to answer every question anyone asked. But it also brought so much more. I still marvel at how quickly the Windows port arrived, done entirely by the community under the guidance of Alex Brainman. That was amazing.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It took us a long time to understand the implications of the switch&nbsp;</span></span><span>to an open source project, and how to manage it.</span></p><p><span><span>In particular, it's fair to say it took us too long to understand&nbsp;</span></span><span>the best way to work with the community. A theme throughout this talk is poor communication on our part - even as we thought we were communicating well - and a lot of time was wasted due to misunderstandings and mismatched expectations. It could have been better done.</span></p><p><span><span>In time, though, we convinced the community, at least the part that stayed with us, that some of our ideas, although different from the usual open source way, were valuable. The most important were around our insistence on maintaining high code quality through mandatory code review and exhaustive attention to detail.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="297" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EM9rbPVLtezym_caYgRFi0ZfzLDCIBHMaBxS42GicnzjtGyPkl_dB74uqtSZa2qZcrudnsucXmQN47EuzIRiBW3GzgcapTJJHkqcCwpvKnp0f5fHYy4SVOOHGd7jct3mDp98GFMAKS_y6KXmL1wCLQaPuw=w400-h297" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>Mission Control (drawing by Renee French)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>Some projects work differently, accepting code quickly and then&nbsp;</span></span><span>cleaning up once it's been committed. The Go project works the other way around, trying to get the quality first. I believe that's the more efficient way, but it pushes more work back on the community and they need to understand the value or they will not feel as welcome as they should. There is still much to learn here, but I believe things are much better these days.</span></p><p><span><span>By the way, there's a historical detail that's not widely known.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The project has had 4 different content management systems: SVN, Perforce, Mercurial and then Git. Russ did a Herculean job of keeping all the history alive, so even today the Git repo contains the earliest changes as they were made in SVN. We all believe it's&nbsp;</span><span>valuable to keep the history around, and I thank him for doing the&nbsp;</span><span>heavy lifting.</span></p><p><span><span>One other point. People often assume Google tells the Go team what to do. That's simply not true. Google is incredibly generous in its support for Go, but does not set the agenda. The community has far more input. Google has a huge internal Go code base that the team uses to test and verify releases, but this is done by importing from the public repo into Google, not the other way around. In short, the core Go team is paid by Google but they are independent.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>Package Management</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>The process of developing package management for Go was not done well. The package design in the language itself was excellent, I believe, and consumed a large amount of time in the first year or so of our discussions. The SPLASH talk I mentioned earlier explains in detail why it works the way it does if you're interested.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A key point was the use of a plain string to specify the path in&nbsp;</span></span><span>an import statement, giving a flexibility that we were correct in&nbsp;</span><span>believing would be important.

But we didn't have enough experience using a package manager with lots of versions of packages and the very difficult problems trying to resolve the dependency graph. To this day, few people really understand the technical complexities, but that is no excuse for our failure to grapple with those problems from the start. It's especially embarrassing because I had been the tech lead on a failed project to do something similar for Google's internal build, and I should have realized what we were up against.</span></span></p><p><span><span>My work on <a href="http://deps.dev/">deps.dev</a> was a something of a penance.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Second, the business of engaging the community to help solve the dependency management problem was well-intentioned, but when the final design came out, even with plenty of documentation and writing about the theory, many in the community felt slighted.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This failing was a lesson to the team in how engagement with the community should really work, and much has improved since as a result.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Things are settled now, though, and the design that emerged is technically excellent and appears to be working well for most users.

I doubt that was the first time it had ever been done, but Go is a compiled language and many in the audience had never seen that trick before.

<p>This began as a quick-and-dirty experiment<sup id="fnref:quick-and-dirty"><a href="#fn:quick-and-dirty">[1]</a></sup> to visualize the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage</a> in real-time, inspired by Blake Fall-Conroy’s <a href="https://www.blakefallconroy.com/minimum-wage-machine.html">Minimum Wage Machine</a>.</p>
<p>Then I added the US <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage">Federal Minimum Wage</a>, since a sizeable proportion of this blog’s readership are US-based. Did you know the US also has a <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/docs/ymwplink.asp">Youth Minimum Wage</a>? I didn’t.</p>
<p>Then I got curious, and added some CEO salaries for comparison. The vast disparity is nothing new to me, but seeing it like this...</p>
<p>It’s fucking sobering.</p>

<hr>
<p>The UK and US minimum wage numbers are, to the best of my knowledge, accurate at the time of publishing. Additionally, the code has been written to account for the changes to the UK minimum wage taking effect on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2024. If you’re reading this in the far future, the numbers presented here may no longer reflect reality.<sup id="fnref:us-refusal-to-change"><a href="#fn:us-refusal-to-change">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>CEO <em>annual</em> salaries were taken from the <a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos">American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO). <em>Hourly</em> salary estimates were then derived by assuming 260 weekdays in a year, and 8 hours worked per day.</p>
