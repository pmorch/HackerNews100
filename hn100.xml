                  <p><span>Happy New Year everyone! HN will always remain in my heart and mind. 5 years ago I moved to Amsterdam to work on a super interesting R&amp;D project that taught me a lot about GPS, coordinate systems, algorithms, and sadly the importance of having a short commute. I spent an hour and a half to get in either direction. That was demotivating and made me depressed and tired. HN was how I passed time, first on the train, then on the bus, reading curated articles and through thoughtful comments. I couldn't have managed without you all. Once again, I wish you all a Happy New Year and luck in all your endeavours!</span></p></div></td></tr>

It has been an amazing few years, and I look forward to the coming year.</p><p>A lot has changed these last years, but somehow Hacker News always remains a solid place to procrastinate and/or learn new things.</p><p>When I tell other developers that if they want to keep up to date with tech, I tell them about Hacker News, it always goes like this: Come for the articles stay for the community. Thanks to everyone making Hacker News both an interesting and welcoming space to hang out!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4836335289577539405" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I've studied a lot of chips from the 1970s and 1980s, so I usually know what to expect.
But an Ethernet chip from 1982 had something new: a strange layer of yellow wiring on the die.
After some study, I learned that the yellow wiring is a second layer of resistive polysilicon, used in
the chip's static storage cells and latches.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/poly.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath." height="355" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/poly-w350.jpg" title="A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath." width="350"></a></p><p>A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath.</p>
<p>The die photo above shows a closeup of a latch circuit, with the diagonal yellow stripe in the middle.
For this photo, I removed the chip's metal layer so you can see the underlying circuitry.
The bottom layer, silicon, appears gray-purple under the microscope, with the active silicon regions slightly darker and bordered in black.
On top of the silicon, the pink regions are polysilicon, a special type of silicon.
Polysilicon has a critical role in the chip: when it crosses active silicon, polysilicon forms the gate of
a transistor. The circles are contacts between the metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.
So far, the components of the chip match most NMOS chips of that time.
But what about the bright yellow line crossing the circuit diagonally? That was new to me.
This second layer of polysilicon provides resistance. It crosses over the other layers, connected to the silicon at the ends with
a complex ring structure.</p>
<p>Why would you want high-resistance wiring in your digital chip? To understand this, let's first look at
how a bit can be stored.
An efficient way to store a bit is to connect two inverters in a loop, as shown below.
Each inverter sends the opposite value to the other inverter, so the circuit will be stable in two states,
holding one bit: a 1 or a 0.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters.jpg"><img alt="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." height="161" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters-w350.jpg" title="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." width="350"></a></p><p>Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit.</p>
<p>But how do you store a new value into the inverter loop? There are a few techniques.
One is to use pass transistors to break the loop, allowing a new value to be stored.
In the schematic below, if the <em>hold</em> signal is activated, the transistor turns on, completing the loop.
But if <em>hold</em> is dropped and <em>load</em> is activated, a new value can be loaded from the input into the inverter loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch.png"><img alt="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." height="133" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch-w300.png" title="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch, controlled by pass transistors.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use a weak inverter that produces a low-current output.
In this case, the input
signal can simply overpower the value produced by the inverter, forcing the loop into a new state.
The advantage of this circuit is that it
eliminates the "hold" transistor. However, a weak inverter turns out to be larger than a regular inverter,
negating much of the space saving.<span id="fnref:size"><a href="#fn:size">1</a></span> (The Intel 386 processor uses this type of latch.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch.png"><img alt="A latch using a weak inverter." height="87" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch-w300.png" title="A latch using a weak inverter." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a weak inverter.</p>
<p>A third alternative, used in the Ethernet chip, is to use a resistor for the feedback, limiting the
current.<span id="fnref:power"><a href="#fn:power">2</a></span>
As in the previous circuit, the input can overpower the low feedback current.
However, this circuit is more compact since it doesn't require a larger inverter.
The resistor doesn't require additional space since it can overlap the rest of the circuitry, as shown in the
photo at the top of the article.
The disadvantage is that manufacturing the die requires additional processing steps to create the resistive
polysilicon layer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor.png"><img alt="A latch using a resistor for feedback." height="86" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor-w300.png" title="A latch using a resistor for feedback." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a resistor for feedback.</p>
<p>In the Ethernet chip, this type of latch is used in many circuits. For example, shift registers are built
by connecting latches in sequence, controlled by the clock signals.
Latches are also used to create binary counters, with the latch value toggled when the lower bits produce a carry.</p>
<h2>The SRAM cell</h2>
<p>It would be overkill to create a separate polysilicon layer just for a few latches.
It turns out that the chip was constructed with AMD's "64K dynamic RAM process".
Dynamic RAM uses tiny capacitors to store data. In the late 1970s, dynamic RAM chips started using
a "double-poly" process with one layer of polysilicon to form the capacitors and a second layer of polysilicon
for transistor gates and wiring (<a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/11/reverse-engineering-classic-mk4116-16.html">details</a>).</p>
<p>The double-poly process was also useful for shrinking the size of static RAM.<span id="fnref:patent-cell"><a href="#fn:patent-cell">3</a></span>
The Ethernet chip contains several blocks of storage buffers for various purposes. These blocks are implemented as static RAM,
including a 22×16 block, a 48×9 block, and a 16×7 block.
The photo below shows a closeup of some storage cells, showing how they are arranged in a regular grid.
The yellow lines of resistive polysilicon are visible in each cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage.jpg"><img alt="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." height="363" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage-w500.jpg" title="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." width="500"></a></p><p>A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged.</p>
<p>A static RAM storage cell is roughly similar to the latch cell, with two inverters in
a loop to store each bit.
However, the storage is arranged in a grid: each row corresponds to a particular word, and each column
corresponds to the bits in a word.
To select a word, a word select line is activated, turning on the pass transistors in that row.
Reading and writing the cell is done through a pair of bitlines; each bit has a bitline and a complemented bitline.
To read a word, the bits in the word are accessed through the bitlines.
To write a word, the new value and its complement are applied to the bitlines, forcing the inverters into
the desired state.
(The bitlines must be driven with a high-current signal that can overcome the signal from the inverters.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of one storage cell." height="195" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-schematic-w300.png" title="Schematic of one storage cell." width="300"></a></p><p>Schematic of one storage cell.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the physical layout of one memory cell, consisting of two resistors and four transistors.
The black lines indicate the vertical metal wiring that was removed.
The schematic on the right corresponds to the physical arrangement of the circuit.
Each inverter is constructed from a transistor and a pull-up resistor, and the inverters are connected into a loop.
(The role of these resistors is completely different from the feedback resistors in the latch.)
The two transistors at the bottom are the pass transistors that provide access to the cell for reads or writes.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled.jpg"><img alt="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." height="408" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled-w600.jpg" title="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." width="600"></a></p><p>One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic.</p>
<p>The layout of this storage cell is highly optimized to minimize its area. Note that the yellow resistors take
almost no additional area, as they overlap other parts of the cell.
If constructed without resistors, each inverter would require an additional transistor, making the cell larger.</p>
<p>To summarize, although the double-poly process was introduced for DRAM capacitors, it can also be used for SRAM cell pull-up resistors.
Reducing the size of the SRAM cells was probably the motivation to use this process for the Ethernet chip, with
the latch feedback resistors a secondary benefit.</p>
<h2>The Am7990 LANCE Ethernet chip</h2>
<p>I'll wrap up with some background on the AMD Ethernet chip.
Ethernet was invented in 1973 at Xerox PARC and became a standard in 1980.
Ethernet was originally implemented with a board full of chips, mostly TTL. 
By the early 1980s, companies such as Intel, Seeq, and AMD introduced chips to put most of the circuitry onto VLSI chips. 
These chips reduced the complexity of Ethernet interface hardware, causing the price to drop from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3kpkQKds0lAC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">$2000</a> to $1000.</p>
<p>The chip that I'm examining is AMD's Am7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet).
This chip implemented much of the functionality for Ethernet and "Cheapernet" (now known as 10BASE2 Ethernet).
The chip handles serial/parallel conversion,
computing the 32-bit CRC checksum, handling collisions and backoff, and recognizing desired addresses.
The chip also provides DMA access for interfacing with a microcomputer.</p>
<p>The chip doesn't handle everything, though.
It was designed to work with an Am7992 Serial Interface Adapter chip that encodes and decodes the bitstream
using Manchester encoding.
The third chip was the Am7996 transceiver that handled the low-level signaling and interfacing with the coaxial network cable, as well as
detecting collisions if two nodes transmitted at the same time.</p>
<p>The LANCE chip is fairly complicated.
The die photo below shows the main functional blocks of the chip.
The chip is controlled by the large block of microcode ROM in the lower right.
The large dark rectangles are storage, implemented with the static RAM cells described above.
The chip has 48 pins, connected by tiny bond wires to the square pads around the edges of the die.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip." height="597" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/die-labeled-w600.jpg" title="Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip." width="600"></a></p><p>Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip.</p>

    <p>Since August 2018 I have run a social network site called Friend Camp for about 50 of my friends. I think Friend Camp is a really nice place, and my friends seem to agree that it has enriched our lives. I'd like to see more places like Friend Camp on the internet, and this document is my attempt to provide some practical guidance as to how you might run a social network site like this.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h3><a id="who-this-guide-is-for"></a>Who this guide is for</h3>
  <p>If you're tired of Facebook or Twitter or wherever else and have thought that there's got to be a better way, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you currently run a social network server for people besides just you, using software <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> or whatever else, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have some programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have no programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <h3><a id="social-solutions-to-social-problems"></a>Social solutions to social problems</h3>
  <div>
    <p>This document exists to lay out some general principles of running a small social network site that have worked for me. These principles are related to community building more than they are related to specific technologies. This is because the big problems with social network sites are not technical: the problems are social problems related to things like policy, values, and power.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Running a social network site is community building first and a technical task second.</p>
  <p>And while community building is hard work, it's often worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This is my pitch to you: using big social media sites is easy, but you pay a steep price for it. You should consider running your own site, which is harder, but can be extremely rewarding.</p>
    
  </div>

  <h2><a id="what-makes-a-small-social-network-site-different-from-a-big-one?"></a>What makes a small social network site different from a big one?</h2>
  <p>Friend Camp looks like this on a desktop web browser:</p>

    <figcaption>The phone view of Friend Camp.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div>
    <p>It's fairly Twitter-like at first blush: you post short messages, you can "@" individual users, you can follow and be followed, you can use hashtags, and you can boost things that you want your followers to see. While Friend Camp is small, the universe of content we have access to is big. We are connected to about 5,000 other communities on the web, allowing us to interact with hundreds of thousands of users if we want.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>So far, this seems like an underpowered Twitter, but there are some key differences from Twitter:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>you control the computer that runs the site</li>
  <li>you can modify the software that powers the site</li>
  <li>you get to make the rules and policies</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>Next I'll explain each of these in detail.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-control-the-computer-that-runs-the-site"></a>You control the computer that runs the site</h3>
  <p>Big social media sites all run on computers, usually a big complex network of computers. When you type "facebook.com" into your browser or load up your Facebook app, what happens is that your phone sends a message to a computer owned by Facebook, which then coordinates with a bunch of other computers owned by Facebook to collect all the information that is then displayed to you.</p>
  <p>In the context of Facebook, this means that everything you do on Facebook passes through computers that they control. And then they take the information about what you do and sell it to advertisers, directly or indirectly.</p>
  <p>But a small social network site doesn't need a huge complex network of computers. One computer can be enough. Often it's the kind of thing you can rent for $10 a month, or even run at home on an old computer you have lying around if you want.</p>
  <p>For example, Friend Camp <a href="#funding">costs about $30 a month to run</a>, it experiences about 10 minutes of down time each week, and it takes about 2 hours a week of my own time to maintain. I maintain the computer that Friend Camp's software runs on. I'm training another camper to be an administrator as well, so if something happens to me there is still someone who can make sure the site keeps going. The site is funded by campers who can afford to throw a few bucks a month at a Patreon that I run just for us. It's a small price to pay for a nice place to talk to friends on the internet.</p>
  <p>As a result of these economic realities, Friend Camp does not have the annoyances of big social network sites. We sell no data, we collect no extraneous data, there are no advertisements at all, and no major features get changed unless I talk to the campers about it first.</p>
  <p>Another result of these economic realities is that we're never going to grow much bigger than 50 active users. But that's okay, because it keeps costs low and we can still talk to people outside of our server.</p>
  <p>You might ask: how can one small computer replace something as huge as Facebook in my life? Well, the reason is that you control this one computer for your site, and then that computer talks to thousands of other computers, which gives you access to literally millions of people and organizations and videos and all sorts of other things. So what this does is replace thousands of computers owned by a single company with thousands of computers owned by thousands of different people.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-modify-the-software"></a>You can modify the software</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You don't have access to the code and the algorithms that Twitter uses to run their service. If I wanted Twitter to make it so that the word "tomato" always appears in bright red, I would have to submit a request to Twitter, and then they would laugh at me, and that would be the end of it. But on Friend Camp, I have the ability to change our code to do exactly that.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>A silly example of this kind of rule in action is <a href="https://dolphin.town/">Dolphin Town</a>, a fully functioning social network site that I started a couple years ago. Like Friend Camp, it's a modification of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. It behaves just like Mastodon with one important change: the only letter you are allowed to use is "E".</p>
  <div>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://runyourown.social/img/dolphin-town-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Dolphin Town. It looks like Twitter except everyone is saying things like &quot;Eee, eee eee!&quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
      <figcaption>Dolphin Town in action.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
  </div>
  <p>The reason I can make these modifications is that Mastodon is <em>open source</em>. There are a lot of things that open source software enables, but for our purposes the important thing is that you can open up the software, tinker with it, and put it back together in its newly modified state.</p>
  <p>I made Dolphin Town to draw attention to something that I think a lot of people miss: if you run a social network based on open source software, you can fundamentally alter how it works to your liking, at least for the version that runs on the computer you own.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies"></a>You get to make the social rules and policies</h3>
  <p>On a big site like Facebook, if you encounter content that you think shouldn't be there, you need to ask Facebook to take it down.</p>
  <p>On a small site serving a small community, if the content comes from inside your community, then you can navigate it the way you navigate problems in small communities in the real world. You bring up with the rest of your community that someone is behaving in a way that is counter to the values of the community. It's unpleasant, but at least you have some control over that process, and it's something tangible that you can navigate.</p>
  <p>It's more work than simply letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa">an army of underpaid and traumatized moderators</a> handle all of that for you. But it's worth it. (You might sense "it's hard work but it's worth it" as an ongoing theme.)</p>
  <h3><a id="wait,-who-is-%22you%22?"></a>Wait, who is "you"?</h3>
  <p>When I refer to "you" here I mean "your community" and "your decision making process". Some communities may have a single person who is kind of the "benevolent dictator". Other communities may run based on consensus or even more formal processes.</p>
  <p>Some servers are formal cooperatives that use <a href="https://www.loomio.org/">cooperative decision making tools like Loomio</a> to organize their node, which has its own advantages and drawbacks that I won't go into the details of here. Tools like Loomio are important when your group gets to a size that is too big to manage informally. This is why I am very much in favor of <a href="#keep-it-small">keeping these sites really small</a>, like way less than 100 people. It allows decision making to stay informal and means that running the site can be a hobby or a low-intensity community project instead of a full time job.</p>
  <p>And of course nothing is going to stop a corporation from running one of these sites either! But I don't recommend joining a corporate site; these things will eventually be driven by profit motive to replicate the same bad experience you get on the current social network sites that you hate.</p>

<section>
  <h2><a id="why-run-a-small-social-network-site?"></a>Why run a small social network site?</h2>
  <p>The main reason to run a small social network site is that you can create an online environment tailored to the needs of your community in a way that a big corporation like Facebook or Twitter never could. Yes, you can always start a Facebook Group for your community and moderate that how you like, but only within certain bounds set by Facebook. If you (or your community) run the whole site, then you are ultimately the boss of what goes on. It is harder work than letting Facebook or Twitter or Slack or Basecamp or  whoever else take care of everything, but I believe it's worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Let's go back to Friend Camp. While there are a hundred thousand people we can talk to from Friend Camp, there are only about 50 people with an active Friend Camp login. We call ourselves "campers" because we are corny like that. And campers have a special communication channel that lets us post messages that only other campers can see.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Because we're mostly all friends with each other, this extra communications mode is kind of like a group chat on steroids. For our community it ends up being a sort of hybrid between Twitter and a group chat. As a result of having a community layer alongside a more public layer, we have a movie night, a book club, and a postcard club. Campers visit each other when we travel, even if we've never met in person before. We correspond with each other about what we're making for dinner and trade recipes. They're the kind of mundane interactions that you probably don't want to have with perfect strangers but you cherish in a group of people you care about.</p>
  <p>We are also able to have moderation rules that are hyper-specific to our own values as a community. It lets us maintain an environment that's far more pleasant than you find on most social media sites.</p>
  <p>And I can make custom features at the request of the people on the site. So if someone wants a particular kind of visual theme, or content filter, or a button to do something that the software can't do right now, I can make it happen, at least within the limits of my own ability.</p>
  <h3><a id="software-can-be-complicated-where-necessary"></a>Software can be complicated where necessary</h3>
  <p>There are certain things that are notoriously subtle and complex to communicate to users passively via a user interface. A classic example is security settings: Facebook, for example, offers a lot of decent security options but it can be overwhelming to many users. Of course, by having reasonable defaults you can get past this problem, but any default setting is at best going to work for some but not all users.</p>
  <p>For example, Mastodon has four levels of privacy available for your posts, ranging from "a private message to another person" to "anyone on the internet can see this". According to some discussions I've seen, one reason that Mastodon has been reluctant to add a "local-only" posting option to its service is that it multiplies that to a combination of eight total privacy settings. The idea is that it would confuse people and they would potentially use it wrong, which could lead to bad security breaches due to user error in dealing with a complex design.</p>
  <p>I agree with this in a situation where a user tries out Mastodon and has to learn to use it themselves. But in a case like Friend Camp, I can personally walk the user through what these complex features mean. I can tailor the instruction to their personal learning style and to their needs. Plus, I'm available to answer questions about it whenever they come up.</p>
  <p>I'll discuss this more below in the section <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today"</a>.</p>
  <p>All that said, there's no need for overly complicated software. It should be as simple as possible. But in cases like security and privacy I think the ability to granularly control your settings outweighs factors like ease of use.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms"></a>You can have hyper-specific norms</h3>
  <p>Because of their need to have as many users as possible, big social network sites have to try to be everything to everyone. In practice this means they need to limit the number of people they alienate, which means they have to be very careful about what kinds of actions and speech they ban on their network. Every person they ban from their network is another set of eyeballs that could otherwise be looking at advertisements and making them money.</p>
  <p>In the end, this means everyone is going to be unhappy with the policies of a big site. You can see it right now on Twitter and Facebook: people on the left complain that these sites support right wing extremism, and people on the right complain that these sites support left wing extremism. And for a website with thousands of posts a second from hundreds of millions of potential sources that's aiming to please as many people as possible, both of these viewpoints are absolutely going to be true. There is no way to moderate this effectively, and you can never come up with rules for behavior that make millions of people happy.</p>
  <p>But on a small social network site, you can set hyper-specific norms. For example, Mastodon allows for "content warnings", where you hide content behind a text tag that you define for your post. It's often things like "nsfw" or "mental health discussion". This acts as a warning so people who don't want to read about that kind of stuff won't click through to see it. On Friend Camp, we generally tag anything related to United States politics as "uspol" — we didn't invent this tag, and lots of other servers use it too. I couldn't ever imagine people tagging politics tweets on Twitter, since Twitter styles itself as a news network, for the broadest possible interpretation of the word "news".</p>
  <p>You also don't need to implement some kind of draconian filtering system to have norms: you simply model the behavior you want to see, and remind people to act a certain way when they post outside of those norms. This kind of thing does not work well in a forum of even 200 people, but in the 50-ish range it is entirely doable.</p>
  <p>Your small social network site can have its own rules about, for example: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>what speech is acceptable</li>
  <li>what actions are considered violence</li>
  <li>what actions are considered protected speech or expression</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This will be very different for every site and I think that's part of the beauty of this whole thing. I talk more about the specifics of this in the <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today" section</a> below.</p>
  <h3><a id="why-to-not-run-a-small-social-network-site"></a>Why to NOT run a small social network site</h3>
  <p>There are many reasons not to run a small social network site. As I've mentioned before and will continue to mention, it's really hard work. You need to at least have time for a hobby or figure out a way to get community support for doing it (maybe people chip in to keep things running; maybe you can trade in-kind services with your community members; etc.).</p>
  <div>
    <p>If you choose to run a site like this, it means that people will now depend on you for something that's important to them. People on Friend Camp are very forgiving when we have down time, and sometimes that down time can last hours if I'm asleep or at a movie or otherwise busy. Later in this document <a href="#keep-it-small">I discuss some cases where people had to abandon a site because it got too big and unwieldy to run</a>.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>But none of this is unique to running a social network site. I think all of this stuff applies if you take away the internet and computers entirely. This is exactly the cost of starting a community theater group, activist group, social group, sports club, book club, and so on. Even the bit about "down time" applies if you run a physical space like a theater. You can't be there for every performance but if something goes wrong with the building, you'd better have a plan to deal with it.</p>
  <p>In other words, the costs of running a small social network site end up being more or less the costs of starting, well, anything involving other people.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-you-can-do-today"></a>What you can do today</h2>
  <p>This section describes practices that anyone running Mastodon or similar software can do today to make for a cohesive, rewarding, and caring community. This section lays out some rules that have helped make Friend Camp a good place. The high level overview is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>keep the number of users on your server very small</li>
  <li>remember that your job is social first and technical second</li>
  <li>provide custom onboarding</li>
  <li>provide group activities</li>
  <li>provide custom features if you can</li>
  <li>enforce your code of conduct</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-small"></a>Keep it small</h3>
  <p>It is absolutely necessary to have no more than 50 to 100 active users who log in to your online community.</p>
  <p>This is a number I am pulling out of my ass. And eagle-eyed readers will notice that I'm not even settling on a single number here. I know that 50 is a number that works as a cap, and I think anything more than 100 definitely does not work as a cap.</p>
  <div>
    <p>In my admittedly limited experience as a human being on this planet, you are not going to be able to form and maintain a cohesive group of more than about 50 to 100 people who all basically agree on values and moderation rules and that sort of stuff. Even as a group where people are mutually looking out for each other, you are not going to be able to meaningfully make sure everyone in that group's wellbeing is maintained. I don't have science to back this up. I have seen this happen in startups, in activist groups, and in internet forums.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p><strong>I can't stress enough how important it is to keep your numbers small.</strong> To draw from recent history, witches.town was one of the more popular Mastodon servers in 2017 and 2018. In mid-2018 there were a series of disagreements between the primary administrator and the users. I can't speak to the nature of these disagreements as I wasn't there but there were multiple disagreements about moderation policy, and also the primary administrator (who I believe actually owned the server and its domain) said they were burned out on running the server. In the end, the site was shut down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180307044118/https://witches.town/about/more">According to archive.org it had about 2400 registered accounts in April 2018</a>, shortly before the instance was deleted. If we look at instances of similar size today we can extrapolate that there were perhaps 500 active users on the server at the time it went dark. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627101519/https://knzk.me/about">KNZK</a> is another network site that shut down on June 30th 2019 and it had about 3100 registered accounts and 560 active users. It shut down due to maintenance tasks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627183952/https://knzk.me/@Knzk/102191413727426394">demanding too much time and effort from administrators</a>.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I posit that 500 active, invested community members will not be able to achieve a values-based harmony or consensus. It's simply too big to be possible. My assertion is not backed up by any studies I have read but rather my personal experience in online and offline groups of all kinds. You cannot wrangle consensus from 500 people. With that many active, committed community members you will necessarily have at least a few dedicated members who feel investment and ownership in the community who are also extremely unhappy with the direction of the community. </p>
    
  </div>
  <p>In addition to promoting group cohesion, having a small number of active users means moderation is completely achievable by a single person. With 50 active users I field, on average, one moderation request a month. This is in addition to me being vigilant and blocking bad actors as I see them. Now, this wouldn't be true if I had 50 random people who all signed up. But these are 50 users who are screened and onboarded into our community.</p>
  <p>Even tricky matters like delineating what is and is not acceptable speech become easier when you're dealing with a small community. For example, there may be some inalienable right for expression of disagreeable political speech, but if it is speech that all the people on your corner of the network agree you don't want to see, you can simply ban it internally and filter or block it externally.</p>
  <p>And when your community is small, you can use powerful tools that would be irresponsible to wield in a larger community. For example, when I discover a user on someone else's site engaging in speech that violates our local norms, I will often mute or ban the entire server that hosts the user in question on behalf of all the people on Friend Camp. This would be inadvisable on a huge network like Twitter, but on Friend Camp, we have all agreed we don't want to see certain things and we don't want to engage with other servers that allow for those types of speech.</p>
  <p>Of course, the question is how does this scale beyond those 50 people? Well, that is why I'm writing this guide. I think there should be thousands of these small servers talking to each other.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-are-the-party-host"></a>You are the party host</h3>
  <p>Running a small social network is like hosting a party. It requires social intelligence, empathy, and yes, technical skills.</p>
  <p>You might wonder what aspect of hosting a party is technical. I mean "technical" in the sense of "requiring technique and skill". Party hosts need all sorts of technical skills: managing RSVPs and calendars, planning and purchasing supplies, cooking and serving, wrangling a music playlist, etc. Not everyone is comfortable hosting a party because these are technical barriers to entry. Similarly, not everyone is comfortable running social network software because of technical barriers to entry.</p>
  <p>But as with hosting a party, technical skills aren't enough. You need to have social skills, or have someone assisting you who does.</p>
  <div>
    <p>For example, I need to maintain an understanding of everyone on the server. I have to remember what their individual needs are, which means that I need to be able to hold all of that information in my head. It's not a task that everyone is suited to, but it's critically important.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Among other things, my duty is to read the local timeline and catch up on everyone's posts. I need to take the temperature of the network and also provide social lubrication where necessary. ("Hey, you just mentioned you're traveling to Montreal! So-and-so lives there, maybe you should message them and see if they want to meet up.") Catching up on all local posts would take forever with hundreds of active users, but with dozens, I only have to read the timeline for 20 minutes a day.</p>
  <p>Do not fool yourself into thinking that your job as an administrator is primarily technical. It's social first, and technical second. If you want to only focus on the tech, then please find someone who cares deeply about the social organizing side and recruit them as a co-administrator.</p>
  <h3><a id="provide-a-custom-introduction-to-your-network-for-every-user"></a>Provide a custom introduction to your network for every user</h3>
  <p>Because you only have 50 people in your community, you are able to do all sorts of things that would never be possible in a larger group. One really important place where this comes into play is in new user onboarding.</p>
  <div>
    <p>When a new user joins Friend Camp, I now schedule a video chat with them (or an in-person chat if they are local). For one to three hours, I introduce them to Friend Camp and walk them through our basic features. I customize the content of the chat with them depending on their background. Generally we discuss the following topics:</p>
    
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>the basics of using Mastodon, tailored to the individual's needs</li>
  <li>how to find further help if they need it</li>
  <li>who <em>everyone</em> on the server is (I go down the list and explain in one sentence who every non-private user is, kind of like a party host might introduce guests to one another)</li>
  <li>our custom software features</li>
  <li>our group traditions and how to participate in them (movie night, for example)</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>If I know them to be social media power users, I'll spend more time on those kinds of features. If they are not very technical and need more basic training, then I spend more time on that. I'll ask them what kind of phone they use, and give them specific information about iOS or Android as needed.</p>
  <p>In addition to explaining who everyone else on the server is, I point out specific people who I think they might get along with. Again, it's like being a party host. If you know people in common or have common interests, I will mention that.</p>
  <p>This is one of those things that a small social network site can provide that a big site could <em>never</em> provide, because it just doesn't scale.</p>
  <h3><a id="group-activities"></a>Group activities</h3>
  <p>It's important to do things together as a group. Organize whatever makes sense for your community, and allow your community to organize as well.</p>
  <p>For example, on Friend Camp we have: movie night, book club, postcard club. Not everyone participates in these things, and that's okay too. But the option is there. The people on your site will probably want different activites than these specific ones, but the important thing about this is we are connecting through some kind of shared activity.</p>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-interconnected"></a>Keep it interconnected</h3>
  <p>The ultimate goal of the last three sections (hosting a party, custom onboarding, group activities) is to socialize everyone on your server with everyone else on your server.  Not everyone has to get along with or even interact with everyone else, but the more positive connections you build between people on your server the better a place it will be. Having a tight-knit group where lots of people know each other is key to the principle of maintaining <a href="#you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms">hyper-specific norms</a>.</p>
  <p>An interconnected network also helps with conflict resolution, so when things go "wrong" it's hardly noticeable. As one camper put it to me:</p>
  <blockquote>"Tiny scale conflict resolves between people without formal moderation. Alice says something that Bob didn't like, Bob points it out, Alice agrees and apologizes, and everyone moves on."
  </blockquote>
  <p>That kind of conflict resolution doesn't easily happen between strangers, even in a group where people share values with one another. But when the chance of any two people being complete strangers is close to zero, this happens way more frequently.</p>
  <h3><a id="funding"></a>Funding</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, running a social network node requires you to move electrons around on pieces of metal, which means you need metal and electricity. And to have access to those resources, you need some kind of funding. Either you have a benefactor, you get together as a group and buy some equipment and internet service and pay for repairs, or pay a company like Linode some money to host a server for you.</p>
  <p>We have a Patreon for Friend Camp simply because it's the easiest way for me to collect monthly donations. Campers contribute what they want or what they can. I needed to upgrade our server at some point for various reasons and I made an appeal to the community. I ended up getting the monthly pledges to cover the new server costs for everyone. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRtQiH1ZeK5HzPnocwfQmUutHVAhpusxcGq44hsKF7E/">The monetary costs of running Friend Camp are laid out in this spreadsheet.</a> At the moment, Friend Camp costs $31.00 a month to run. This is not a small cost for a single person, but spread between 50 people it can be very affordable, more like $1 per month per person even if half the active users can't afford to contribute anything.</p>
  <h3><a id="the-bus-problem"></a>The bus problem</h3>
  <p>For almost a year, Friend Camp had one person with the keys to the kingdom: me. In this first year, if I got hit by a bus, the server would probably run until its first crash and then never come back again. </p>
  <p>I decided to put out the word to see if a member of the community would be able to volunteer to be co-administrator. Thankfully, one of our own decided to take on the responsibility. I was lucky that there was a person in the community willing to do this and with development experience and experience running a server. It took just a handful of video calls to get them up to speed and within a month they had pushed their first production upgrade to Friend Camp.</p>
  <p>Not every community is going to have people who are willing and able to take on these duties. But if you have someone willing, there could be a longer mentoring process to get them to the point where they are able to do at least minimal work to maintain the server in the absence of the main administrator. If someone is at least able to reboot the server if things go weird, that's a huge step up from nothing.</p>
  <p>Ideally you can train a willing person to the point where they can do more complicated administrative tasks. If you have a small social network community that actually really means something to you, it's work that helps keep a thing alive that people deeply care about.</p>
  <h3><a id="code-of-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>A code of conduct (CoC) is about what actions are acceptable on a network, which is absolutely necessary but not sufficient on its own for establishing a culture. A CoC perhaps implies certain values but it mostly states what is NOT acceptable rather than what IS encouraged. Some codes of conduct do state things like "please engage with people courteously" etc.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I think a good CoC should be specific enough that it is actively repulsive to some people. And frankly, the more people who are repulsed by it the better. Perhaps simple anti-racist sentiment is enough to repulse a small number of explicitly white supremacist people, but if you add in sentiment like "no <abbr title="Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminists">TERFs</abbr> allowed", suddenly a lot of people who consider themselves leftists will also decide not to join. As an example, Friend Camp is anti-free-speech, at least in the sense that freedom of speech is commonly understood as a value. This is repulsive to some people on both the left and the right, and it's important that people with that core value find somewhere other than Friend Camp to set up their online home.</p>
    
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Again this is a <em>good thing</em>. I remember one code of conduct I read for a chat forum where they stated that "before posting here, ask yourself if what you are saying is necessary for the health of the discourse". And I saw that and thought, "Wow, I would never feel comfortable posting on that forum because I am always doubting the necessity of what I have to say." This is good, though. The forum clearly signaled that they wanted a certain kind of person, one who is confident in the necessity of their speech. And that is not me, and I was able to steer clear. Did I feel excluded? Sure. But ultimately that feeling of pre-emptive exclusion is better than joining a community and THEN realizing that I don't belong there.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="enforcement"></a>Enforcement</h4>
    <p>Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner have published a free book called <a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/"><em>How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports</em></a> that I think is required reading for anyone with a code of conduct on their site. The book explains what a CoC is <em>and what it is not</em> and how to make yours actually effective. Some of their recommendations make more sense for very large communities (like conferences of thousands of people) than the small ones I'm advocating for, but most of their recommendations do apply, and the book comes with many real world examples that you can learn from.</p>
  <div>
    <p>One reason I'm a big fan of adding a local-only communication layer to these social network sites is that it helps with enforcement. The reason is that it creates serious social repercussions for violating rules to the point where you're kicked off of a server. This is because the person who was kicked out cannot just join a new server and re-follow everyone and continue to participate in or monitor conversations. It's more like being kicked from a group chat. It can be socially devastating, which  means there are real consequences to violating group policy.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>I'm sure there will be friction on Friend Camp but nobody has, to my knowledge, broken our code of conduct or otherwise required admonishment or disciplinary action. When that does happen and it is beyond a simple warning followed by an apology, I will individually solicit opinions from literally every active user on what should be done. Because we keep the server small, I could in theory host video calls with every single user where we discuss what ought to be done. I'm not sure if that last one is a good idea but I have that option, which you can't say for Facebook. This is all possible because we are a small group of people and we will never be a big group of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="technical-recommendations"></a>Technical recommendations</h3>
  <p><em>This section might not make a lot of sense if you're not a programmer. Feel free to skip it and move to <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> if that's not you.</em></p>
  <p>Ideally you will pick social media software that has features which allow for communication that only your users on your server can see. In the case of Friend Camp, we maintain Friend Camp as <a href="https://github.com/friendcamp/mastodon/">a fork of Mastodon</a> and pull in <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/8427">Renato Lond's great work</a> that allows for posts that only the 50 people with logins to Friend Camp can see.  I would go so far as to say this is a necessary feature for group cohesion, and my hope is that implementors of decentralized social media software come to understand it's important.</p>
  <p>If you are a programmer, I suggest that you maintain a fork of whatever open source social network software you end up using so that you can implement custom features for your users. You might end up making purely aesthetic changes, small browser hacks, or complicated new features that you need to maintain version to version. If you implement custom features that your users ask for, it gives them a stronger sense of ownership over the site even if they are not the ones writing the software. Make sure to credit them somewhere too! I try to credit individual users for each suggested feature in the commit messages and also on our server's About page.</p>
  <p>Provide multiple services for your community members! Probably not email because that is a nightmare but there are other possibilities. I use Mastodon's login to authenticate small helper applications that I write for my users. I just put in a hard coded gateway so that only people from my server have access to them (so their OAuth login account has to originate from the server friend.camp). This means the basic social media login for your server is also a login for many other services; kind of like a default LDAP but not.</p>
  <h4><a id="examples-of-services-you-can-provide"></a>Examples of services you can provide</h4>
  <div>
    <p>I only have one auxilary service I provide my users that gets active use but I think it's a big one. Bugle is a bot that any Friend Camper can use that sends a direct message to <em>every other person on the server</em> (unless they have blocked it or have DMs otherwise disabled). This would normally be a horrible idea on a site like Twitter. But because we're a small community and we all know each other, I trust that my users will use it well and sparingly. If it is misused I will give the user a stern talking-to.</p>
    
  </div>

<section>
  <h2><a id="what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future"></a>What we need to do in the future</h2>
  <p>The current situation for small social network sites is not even close to perfect. There is work that needs to be done to make this idea better and more viable for more kinds of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="places-where-we-need-better-tech"></a>Places where we need better tech </h3>
  <p>Most of the problems that exist are social problems with social solutions, and I've tried to lay some of those out above. But there are still unsolved problems where better tech could really help, so I'll try to enumerate those here.</p>
  <h4><a id="fluidity-of-identity-and-the-ability-to-migrate"></a>Fluidity of identity and the ability to migrate</h4>
  <p>The existence of a server and an administrator implies some local form of centralization. I think this is necessary because most people don't want to run their own network node, and there are fantastic benefits to having a trusted local administrator. That said, the drawbacks are also great and we need to be able to mitigate the drawbacks.</p>
  <p>What happens if I, as the administrator, violate the social norms of my own community? In other words, <em>what happens if the person with all the real power is the problem</em>?</p>
  <p>People <em>need</em> to be able to jump ship and migrate their accounts, seamlessly and wholly, to other servers. We do not have a good technical solution for this yet. In my opinion it is the one big area regarding federated social networks where we need to work on technical solutions.</p>
  <p>If I decide that my values no longer align with a server, I need to be able to take that account to a new server. If the server decides to kick me off, that's fine, but I should <em>in theory</em> be able to set up shop elsewhere. </p>
  <p>I know that people have been working on this issue, but as far as I'm aware it's nowhere near resolved. As it stands right now, the fact that you can't uproot and take your stuff with you from one site to another means there is a very real kind of lock-in. This helps with enforcement (as I said above) but is a huge liability when it's simply the choice of the individual to move.</p>
  <h4><a id="let-people-keep-things-in-the-community"></a>Let people keep things in the community</h4>
  <p>Most open source social network software right now is designed to get your messages out to as many people as possible. We need support for private communities. For federated social networks this means support for messages that don't federate and can only be viewed by people with access to the server on which the message was posted.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Unlike the identity problem, this is a very easy thing to implement technically. It already exists on a minority of open source social network servers. But the big players don't support it and that's causing more harm than good.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="server-forking-should-be-easy"></a>Server forking should be easy</h4>
  <p>It should be easy for, say, 25 members of Friend Camp to pick up and start "Friend Camp 2". This could be because Friend Camp is getting too big, or it could be because these people don't like what Friend Camp has become and would like to move en masse.</p>
  <p>As far as I'm aware there is no work at all being done on this issue, but I suppose a prerequisite to this is a solution to the identity migration problem above.</p>
  <h4><a id="lean-software-that-doesn%27t-have-to-scale"></a>Lean software that doesn't have to scale</h4>
  <p>What if we built software to run on very low spec, low power machines, that was a federated social media server for 50 people but could never grow to support more than that? You could use something like SQLite instead of a "real" database because you'd never realistically have to support a lot of writes to the DB. You could run on a raspberry pi.</p>
  <p>There are some federated servers that fit this bill already. <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> is a Twitter style server that extremely light on its use of resources. And <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Write Freely</a>, a federated Medium-style blogging server, is incredibly lean as well.</p>
  <p>But even Pleroma and Write Freely are built with thousands of users in mind. What kind of <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html">low tech solutions</a> can we enable if we keep our communities intentionally small? This may open up more paths to equitable access by communities with different resources available to them.</p>
  <h3><a id="more-on-scale"></a>More on scale</h3>
  <p>Any time I propose a new piece of software to a group of software engineers I'm asked the same question: how will it scale? We are trained as a group to ask this question. I think it's the software equivalent of in manufacturing when someone asks "What will it cost to produce?" Since the marginal cost of producing software is effectively zero, it's the scale, the ability for the software to be used by millions or billions of people, that becomes the limiting factor that everyone brings up.</p>
  <p>Imagine two different software developers. One person writes a piece of software that makes the lives of one million people slightly easier. Maybe it's better routing for navigation software and it shaves 30 seconds off the commute of a million people. Another person writes a piece of software that only ten people ever use, but it tangibly changes their lives for the better in very material ways; maybe they learn a trade that becomes a career. </p>
  <p>One of these outcomes is not necessarily better than the other, and yet due to myriad factors, only the software with a million users is likely to get funding from entities—whether the context is for profit or not for profit. </p>
  <p>I'd like to advance the notion that software does not have to scale, and in fact software can be better if it is not built to scale. I hope some of the examples I've given above have illustrated what is possible when software is used by a small number of people instead of a large number of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="beyond-local-and-public:-the-neighborhood"></a>Beyond local and public: the neighborhood</h3>
  <p>Right now on federated social networks you have a concept of people on your own "home" server (which I'll call local) and people on every other server in the world (which I'll call public). But we need concepts that are more fine grained than local and public.</p>
  <p>I would like to see groups of servers that band together through a kind of mutual approval system. The group of people on Server A decide that Server B is to be trusted, and vice versa. They approve each other, in a manner similar to friending someone on Facebook, but for a whole server instead of an individual user. Now the 50 people on server A and the 50 people on server B are in a "neighborhood" together.</p>
  <p>Servers that belong to the same neighborhood could share things with each other. For example, the servers could share access to posts that are tagged on either server as "available to the neighborhood". Servers could share block lists, since mutual trust between servers probably implies some level of shared values between the people on both servers.</p>
  <p>A neighborhood would necessarily consist of two or more servers, and could in theory grow to be very large. </p>
  <p>However, I don't think neighborhoods should be very big themselves. I think there should be a kind of mutual decision-making, so perhaps now that A and B are connected, both A and B have to agree that C is worth connecting to, and C has to agree that A and B are worth it. This makes every extra node you add more difficult, which is the point. Big "private" communities should be very very hard to come by — and "public" should be where the "broad" conversations happen. </p>
  <p>I also think there shouldn't be concepts of overlapping Venn diagrams of multiple neighborhoods. I <em>loved</em> the concept from Google Plus of <a href="http://socialmediasun.com/google-plus-circles/">circles</a>. The idea was that as a person you have friends, coworkers, college friends, family, IRL neighbors, etc. People you "know" on Google Plus could belong to none, one, or more than one of these groups. A childhood friend who you also work with would probably belong to "friends", "childhood friends", and "coworkers". This system sounded <em>great</em> to me… until I tried it in practice. And in practice it was so much tedious digital paperwork to keep it all fresh and updated. I didn't want to manage people into one or more of dozens of categories and in the end I just went for the default "mutual friends on the social network" and "public" circles.</p>
  <p>I think many of us can hold three of these groups in our head though, especially if it's not the job of the individual user to constantly maintain it. I'm sure lots of people can hold more than three groups in their head at a time, but I'm picking the smallest useful number in order to reduce the confusion I experienced with Google's "circles" feature.</p>
  <p>So for me an ideal network would be partitioned into three basic levels for posting:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - just the people on my physical server</li>
  <li>neighborhood - the concept I described above of people who belong to servers that have a mutual trust agreement</li>
  <li>public - everyone in the world</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This would be in addition to the usual layers of "followers only" and that kind of thing.</p>
  <p>One way I see this breaking down is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - tin foil hat stuff, "I do not want this message to leave this piece of metal", or perhaps the <em>very</em> intimate like "only local mutual followers get to see my nudes"</li>
  <li>neighborhood - most of your friendly chatter and ideological debate happens here</li>
  <li>public - the place for things that are inconsequential (cute cats and jokes), or require signal boosting, or where you really want to put an idea in front of the public</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of unanswered questions here, and in a lot of ways I am still learning as I go. I don't want to give the impression that I have the answer to everything so I'd like to address some questions that I don't have good anwers to at all.</p>
  <h3><a id="hard-questions"></a>Hard questions</h3>
  <p><strong>How do people join one of these networks if they don't have friends who are already on such a network?</strong> This may be where sites with thousands of users come into play. Perhaps people join a giant server but then do it with the understanding that they are there to make friends on smaller servers with the idea of eventually moving there or even starting their own server. This is not very feasible until the account migration stuff I mention in the <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> section is solved.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens to people who suck?</strong> Like what about people who are actively opposed to community cohesion? Will they find a sort of anti-community where they are accepted? Will they simply migrate to the giant networks of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people? Will they set up their own single-person networks? Will this kind of network even be the place for them at all? I don't know.</p>
  <p><strong>What about equity?</strong> For example, how do we get these servers run and operated by people in poor communities? I look to work by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/_brunaz_">Bruna Zanolli</a>, going in to Amazon indigenous communities and training the women to run the networks. If you have the privilege to run one of these sites then you might also have the ability to teach people how to run them for themselves. If that's you, then it's really your duty to get other people up and running. The more communities you help get started, the more options your own community will have for people to connect to. I also would love to see granting organizations support this kind of work.</p>
  <p><strong>Do the technical administrators have to be the same people doing the social organizing?</strong> I think the answer as of June 2019 is, sadly, yes. If you have 2 people with root access to the server and 2 people managing the community aspects, you'll end up with imbalances in that group of 4. You will end up with technical administrators who feel like code monkeys who never get the gratitude that the community organizers get, or you'll end up with community organizers who feel like glorified babysitters while the techies have all the real power. You might even end up with a situation where both are true. I think that if you're dedicated to this sort of project though, you could start with something like that 2 and 2, and then the techies could teach the organizers the technical skills, and the organizers could teach the techies the organizing skills.</p>
  <p>However, if more paid hosting services would support a wider variety of software and forks and features, this reliance on technical people like me will hopefully become lessened and an actual community organizer, or some kind of community organization structure, can be in charge.</p>
  <h3><a id="so-what-do-you,-the-reader,-do-next?"></a>So what do you, the reader, do next?</h3>
  <p>What you can do next depends on who you are.</p>
  <h4><a id="if-you-are-comfortable-with-servers-and-hosting"></a>If you are comfortable with servers and hosting</h4>
  <p>If you've done the system administrator thing, you have many options here.</p>
  <p>Ask your friends if they'd like to try out a social network run by you. If you can find 5 people who would be interested that's enough. Then get going! There are plenty of technical guides out there:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/">Setting up a Mastodon server</a> for a Twitter-like experience
    <ul>
      <li>This also works with the various forks, like <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">Glitch Social</a> and <a href="https://github.com/florence-social/mastodon-fork">Florence</a></li>
      <li>I now offer a fork of Mastodon that supports principles outlined in this document called <a href="https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown">Hometown</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma#installation">Setting up a Pleroma server</a> for another Twitter-like experience
  </li>

  </li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/install-any-os">Setting up PeerTube</a> for a YouTube-style experience
  </li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>There are many other servers and services out there as well, but these are the ones that I personally have used and can recommend.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that <strong>none of these services support any of the "future" concepts like neighborhoods</strong>. Some of the forks like <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">Glitch Social</a> do allow for local-only posting.</p>
  <h4><a id="if-learning-the-tech-stuff-is-realistically-not-going-to-happen"></a>If learning the tech stuff is realistically not going to happen</h4>
  <p>Do you have any technical friends? If you do, ask them if they might be willing to do this sort of thing.</p>
  <div>
    <p>You can also pay a company like <a href="https://masto.host/">Masto.host</a> to run all the technical stuff for you. If you take my advice and <a href="#keep-it-small">only have a small number of users</a>, then you can probably get away with paying less than $10/month for your hosting. Paying a company necessarily means that you have less control over your system. You won't be able to provide custom features for your users, but if you are not a technical person you probably aren't going to be writing custom features anyway.</p>

  <p>I suppose I'll repeat what I said multiple times in this document, which is that running a small social network site for your friends is hard work, but it's worth it. It is first and foremost the work of community building, and only secondarily is it a technical endeavor. And it's completely possible to do, today, though depending on who you are and what your resources are it's going to be difficult in different ways.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Email addresses are not good 'permanent' identifiers for accounts</h2>

	<p><small>December 30, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often someone needs to create a more or less permanent
internal identifier in their system every person's account. Some
of the time they look at how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OIDCThreeEmailAddresses">authentication systems like OIDC
return email addresses among other data</a> and decide that since pretty
much everyone is giving them an email address, they'll use the email
address as the account's permanent internal identification.
As <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">the famous saying</a> goes,
now you have two problems.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with email addresses as 'permanent' identifiers
is that people's email addresses change even within a single
organization (for example, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">a university</a>).
They change for the same collection of reasons that people's
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/FullLegalNamesProblems">commonly used names</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/LoginsDoChange">logins change</a>. An organization that refuses to change
or redo the email addresses it assigns to people is being unusually
cruel in ways that are probably not legally sustainable in any
number of places.</p>

<p>(Some of the time there will be some sort of access or forwarding
from the old email address to the new one, but even then the old
email address may no longer work for non-email purposes such as
OIDC authentication. And beyond that, the person won't want to keep
using their old and possibly uncomfortable email address with you,
they want to use their new current one.)</p>

<p>The lesser problem is that you have no particular guarantee that
an organization won't reuse email addresses, either in general or
for particularly desirable ones that get reused or reassigned as
an exception because someone powerful wants them. Sometimes you
sort of have no choice, because account recovery has to run through
the email address you have on file, but at other times (such as in
theory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)">OIDC</a>), you
have some form of internal ID that is supposed to be unique and
permanent, which you should use.</p>

<p>Even if you have to remember an email address for account recovery,
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/PowerOfMeaninglessIDs">you want your internal identifier for accounts to be meaningless</a>. This will make your life much simpler in
the long run, even if this is never exposed to people.</p>

<p>(There are also security issues lurking in the underbrush of reading
too much into email addresses, <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">cf</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38720544">via</a>).)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.onsclom.net/posts/javascript-tco">https://www.onsclom.net/posts/javascript-tco</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38823673">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main data-astro-cid-egg7nqdx=""><h2 data-astro-cid-egg7nqdx="">Bun, Javascript, and TCO</h2><p><a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a JavaScript runtime that just released version 1.0! Now you have three
choices for running JavaScript outside of the browser: Node, Deno, and Bun. One of Bun’s selling
points is speed! It makes some interesting decisions to acheive this.</p>
<p>For one, Bun is programmed using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. This results in an exciting universe:
Node is made with <strong>C++</strong>, Deno is made with <strong>Rust</strong>, and Bun is made with <strong>Zig</strong>. Isn’t this an
exciting battle of system languages?! We will actually focus on something else however.</p>
<p>Node and Deno are built on V8, while Bun is built on JavaScriptCore. You might know V8 as the
JavaScript engine of Chrome. JavaScriptCore is the engine for Safari. They have lots of interesting
differences, but we will be focusing on a niche optimization which JavaScriptCore implements and V8
does not: <strong>Tail Call Optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in by writing some real code! Imagine you need to implement the following function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/*</span></span>
<span><span>  Returns an array of numbers counting from 1 to amount.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Examples:</span></span>
<span><span>    count(3) =&gt; [1, 2, 3]</span></span>
<span><span>    count(5) =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span></span>
<span><span>    count(-1) =&gt; []</span></span>
<span><span>*/</span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[];</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Give it a try yourself if you want! I imagine most people will come up with a solution like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] {</span></span>
<span><span>	let</span><span> nums</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> [];</span></span>
<span><span>	for</span><span> (</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> 1</span><span>; i </span><span>&lt;=</span><span> amount; i</span><span>++</span><span>) nums.</span><span>push</span><span>(i);</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> nums;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is a great solution that works totally fine! But now, I will present an arbitrary challenge to
introduce tail call optimization. Can you represent this as a recursive function? Give it a try.
After a bit of thinking, you might come up with this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> count</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> (amount </span><span>&gt;</span><span> 0</span><span> ?</span><span> [</span><span>...</span><span>count</span><span>(amount </span><span>-</span><span> 1</span><span>), amount] </span><span>:</span><span> []);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Its a succinct solution! It might look familiar to recurrence relations from math class. You might
be thinking, “It looks like loops can be expressed more elegantly with recursion!” But, now I have
something sad to share. Try doing <code>count(100000)</code> (Deno and Bun allow running TypeScript directly).
You will get the error <code>Maximum call stack size exceeded</code>.</p>
<p>Recursion takes up precious memory on the call stack! There may be commands to increase the call
stack size for your program, but there is only so much the OS will allow. Memory on the heap is much
less restricted. How can we use recursion without fear of exceeding the call stack? The answer: hope
your JavaScript engine implements TCO and write your recursion in a way that can be optimized!</p>
<p>The process of rewriting a function to be tail call optmized generally involves moving state to
arguments. The recursive call needs to be the last thing in the function’s AST. The TCO version of
our recursive function looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> count</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>, </span><span>cur</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> []) </span><span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	cur.</span><span>length</span><span> &gt;=</span><span> amount </span><span>?</span><span> cur </span><span>:</span><span> count</span><span>(amount, [</span><span>...</span><span>cur, cur.</span><span>length</span><span> +</span><span> 1</span><span>]);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Its slightly less succint and elegant, but it can be tail call optimized now! If we run
<code>count(100000)</code> with Deno, we still get
<code>error: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded</code>. With Bun, the program now
successfully runs! But there’s still one more problem… This solution is really slow.</p>
<p><code>count(100000)</code> with this TCO solution takes 7 seconds with bun. The original for loop solution
takes <code>.01s</code>. How can we get similar performance to the for loop solution while still using
recursion? We use mutation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>, </span><span>cur</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> []) {</span></span>
<span><span>	if</span><span> (cur.</span><span>length</span><span> &gt;=</span><span> amount) </span><span>return</span><span> cur;</span></span>
<span><span>	cur.</span><span>push</span><span>(cur.</span><span>length</span><span> +</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> count</span><span>(amount, cur);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This function is starting to look a lot like the orignal for loop solution. It’s not very succinct
or elegant anymore. But, it runs <code>count(100000)</code> at <code>.01s</code> as well. Nice!</p>
<p>The minimalist part of me really enjoys TCO. It enables a language to express complex and efficient
programs without imperative loops. In the case of JavaScript, it means a smaller subset of the
language can express all programs. Most beginners are taught loop statements as if they are
fundamental or required in every language. But that’s not true. With TCO, you can express any loop
statement using recursion and get similar performance.</p>
<p>Languages that rely on recursion like LISPs often specify that TCO must be implemented in their
language spec. Sadly, TCO is only implemented in JavaScriptCore. Thankfully, Bun and Safari use
JavaScriptCore!</p></main> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We shall start with a bit of history:</p><ul><li>2016: <a href="https://mattgadient.com/building-a-low-power-pc-on-skylake-10-watts-idle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Low Power PC on Skylake – 10 watts idle</a></li><li>2019: <a href="https://mattgadient.com/9w-idle-creating-a-low-power-home-nas-file-server-with-4-storage-drives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9w Idle – Creating a low power home NAS / file server with 4 Storage Drives</a></li><li>2021: (no write-up) – 11 watts using an Intel i3-10320 on a Gigabyte H470M DS3H</li></ul><p>Not all my systems have been so successful. In 2022 I measured a couple other systems at 19 watts and 27 watts as part of <a href="https://mattgadient.com/curbing-the-gas-guzzler-tendencies-of-amd-radeon-with-multi-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curbing the “Gas-Guzzling” tendencies of AMD Radeon with Multi-Monitor</a> .

This time around I had the following goals:</p><ul><li>low idle power</li><li>reasonable CPU performance for compression</li><li>able to handle 12 hard drives + at least 1 NVMe</li><li>capacity to (eventually) convert those 12 hard drives to 6 NVMe + 6 SSD SATA</li><li>keep costs under control – since a motherboard purchase would be required, try to stick with DDR4 and reuse a CPU I already have.</li></ul><p>Putting together a new system with the hopes of getting in the ballpark of the 10 watt range *measured from the wall* is often not only a challenge, but a bit of a gamble. Sometimes you just have to take your best educated guesses in terms of components, build your rig, tune what you can, and let the chips fall where they may.<br> </p><h2>Motherboard – ASUS Prime H770-Plus D4</h2><p>Before I begin, here is a quick look at the motherboard layout. The GREEN CPU-connected slots and ORANGE chipset-connected slots will become relevant throughout this write-up.</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e-500x599.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770 with M.2 and PCIe port layout" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>At the time of writing, widely available consumer options were motherboards in the Intel 600/700-series and AMD 500/600-series.</p><p>One of my goals above was the capacity for an eventual 6 NVMe drives.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Digging into deeper details as to why this can be a challenge (feel free to skip this section)…</em></strong></p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are 0 consumer motherboards with 6x M.2 slots that can all be used at the same time in PCIe mode. On AMD the MEG X570S Unify-X Max *looks* like it does, but check the manual and you’ll find that if you try to populate all 6, the last one has to be a SATA variant. The ASRock Z790 PG Sonic also has 6 slots, but you can only use 5 of them (with a legitimate excuse: they offer a Gen5 NVMe slot but it comes with an either/or caveat).</p><p><strong>Why This Problem Exists:</strong> There are chipset lane limitations on consumer boards. Assuming I want the ability to run all M.2 in Gen4x4 and assuming a manufacturer were actually willing to devote all the lanes to M.2 NVMe slots (they’re not), AMD X570 and Intel B760 would max at three M.2 slots, with AMD B650 and Intel H670/Q670/Z690/W680 managing four. Five M.2 slots is possible on AMD X670 and Intel H770 boards. Six on a Z790 board. Beyond that, extraordinary measures like robbing the main PCIE slot of lanes would be required. If sheer M.2 count were desired, manufacturers could run theoretically run lanes in Gen4x2 or add some Gen3 M.2 slots, but at that point they’ve created a *very* niche product.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> PCI-E to M.2 adapters became necessary. Now when searching for a motherboard, it became a matter if adding the M.2 slots included to any available PCI-E slots capable of x4 or higher. My options were now limited to AMD X570, Intel H770, and Intel Z790 motherboards. Note that while using bifurcation is a possibility on some motherboards to get more than 1 NVMe out of the main PCIe slot, I decided not to rely on it.</p></blockquote><p>I decided to go the Intel route for a few reasons:</p><ol><li><em>Chipset TDP:</em> 600/700-series Intel chipsets all have a 6W TDP, whereas the TDP of the AMD X670 chipset is pretty high (7w+7w). AMD chipset power consumption has concerned me for a while, as previous X570 chipsets had a TDP of 11w and needed a fan.</li><li><em>Chipset Speed:</em> Intel H670/Q670/W680/Z690/H770/Z790 chipsets have a DMI 4.0 x8 link to the CPU. AMD X570/B650/X670 have a PCIe 4.0 x4 link to the CPU. Theoretical throughput on the Intel should be twice as much as AMD (16GB/s vs 8GB/s).</li><li>I already had 64GB of DDR4 that the Intel system could use. AMD 600-series chipsets are all DDR5-only.</li><li>I already had an Intel 12th Gen CPU.</li><li>I’ve yet to see any positive discussion around AM5 power consumption. At all. Update: as I was writing this, news actually came out about AMD 7000-series CPUs burning/bulging where the motherboard socket pins meet the CPU. Yeah, sorry AMD, not this time.</li></ol><p>So Intel it was. After checking out available DDR4 motherboards on the market, I quickly narrowed options to 2 manufacturers: MSI and ASUS.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Don’t care about the board comparisons? Feel free to skip this.</em></strong></p><p>The enticing MSI boards were the PRO Z790-P WIFI DDR4 and Z790-A WIFI DDR4. Nearly identical on the surface, except the “A” is a little more premium (audio, rear ports, heatsinks, power phases, etc). Pros/cons:</p><ul><li>Pro: 4x M.2 (Gen4x4) + 1x PCIE Gen5x16 + 1x PCIE Gen4x4 supports a total of 6 Gen4 NVMe</li><li>Pro: 2x PCIE Gen3x1 extra</li><li>Pro: 6 SATA ports</li><li>Con: Intel 2.5G LAN (known to be problematic and buggy)</li><li>Con: I’m not a fan of the MSI BIOS</li><li>Con: My current B660 board that results in higher idle consumption than expected is an MSI.</li></ul><p>Attractive ASUS options were the Prime H770-Plus D4 and Prime Z790-P D4 (optional WIFI edition). Getting into the TUF, Strix, or ProArt was just too expensive.</p><p>I’ll start by listing pros/cons for the H770-Plus:</p><ul><li>Pro: 3x M.2 (Gen4x4) + 1x PCIE Gen5x16 + 2x PCIE Gen4x4 supports a total of 6 Gen4 NVMe</li><li>Pro: 2x PCIE Gen3x1 extra</li><li>Con: Only 4 SATA ports</li><li><del>Pro: 2.5G Realtek Network Adapter (preferable to Intel 2.5G LAN these days)</del> (see comments)</li></ul><p>The Z790-P D4 is similar except it has more power phases, better heatsinking, more USB ports, extra fan header, and for our purposes…:</p><ul><li>+1 PCIE Gen4x4</li><li>-1 PCIE Gen3x1</li></ul></blockquote><p>Ultimately the ASUS Prime H770-Plus D4 was about $100 cheaper at the time and is what I chose.</p><p>One upside I’ve found with “cheaper” boards is they tend to have fewer components and thus less vampire power drain at idle, though this isn’t always a certainty.<br> </p><h2>CPU – Intel i5-12400 (H0 stepping) – Alder Lake</h2><p>I already had this CPU as part of a previous desktop build. At the time it was chosen for the desktop system because:</p><ul><li>it had AV1 hardware decode</li><li>it had the highest performance available from the Intel lineup of the 12th generation that avoids the E-core silicon overhead</li><li>in that build, I was getting a new motherboard with 2xDP anyway, and going older-gen didn’t make sense to me.</li></ul><p>That desktop build turned out to be a disappointment, and ranks as one of my least favorite builds.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Some details…</strong></em></p><p>I had issues where sometimes only 1 of 2 DP-attached monitors would wake in Linux which meant I had to either pull/reconnect the other DP connector, or manually suspend/resume the system so it could try again.</p><p>Another issue was that rebooting between Windows/Linux sometimes caused odd issues which necessitated a full poweroff/restart.</p><p>Hardware decode on Ubuntu using Wayland is still problematic and when programs tried to use it to play video, problems would ensue.</p><p>Finally, unlike my previous Intel systems which could all be brought down near the 10 watt mark, this one was idling at 19 watts, though I suspected the MSI motherboard I was using may have been a factor.</p></blockquote><p>Most of the headaches I experienced were related to the GPU and display. Since I was about to build something server-oriented, that was no longer a factor.</p><h2>MEMORY – 64GB DDR4-3200</h2><p>Here’s what I used:</p><ul><li>2x16GB Kingston HyperX dual-rank (Hynix DJR)</li><li>2x16GB Kingston HyperX single-rank (Hynix CJR)</li></ul><p>This was memory I already had. I ran the 4 sticks of memory at the XMP profile of the dual-rank kit which was 16-18-18-36. Everything else was essentially left to the defaults except that I ran the RAM at 1.25 volts (higher than stock 1.20, but lower than the XMP 1.35v setting). TestMem5 and Memtest86 showed stability at 1.22v, though testing this memory on previous motherboards had shown 1.22v to be unstable, so for a little extra buffer when it comes to stability I boosted the voltage to 1.25v.</p><h2>Boot Drive – Sandisk Ultra 3D 1TB SSD</h2><p>This component wasn’t deliberately chosen. When I wanted a fresh Ubuntu Server install for testing, this happened to be the only SSD I had kicking around that wasn’t currently being used. I was going to be doing a lot of A/B testing on PCIE and NVMe devices, so installing Ubuntu 23.04 to a SATA SSD made sense to keep PCIE slots free.</p><p>Note that after testing, the main OS was to be run on a <strong>Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 500GB NVMe</strong>. Not much to say except that Samsung stuff tends to reliably go into low power modes.</p><p>Having used both drives, I can’t measure any power difference between them in my testing. Tom’s Hardware tested the Samsung idle at 0.072 watts (via ASPM/APST), and Anandtech tested the Sandisk Ultra 3D idle to be 0.056 watts (via ALPM). Both are well below the 1W resolution of my Kill-A-Watt meter.</p><h2>PSU – Corsair RM750</h2><p>As much as this 750W PSU may appear to be overkill for a system intended to sit around 10 watts, when 12 drive motors spin up at the same time, the instantaneous load is likely to be quite high. Seagate states 2A/3A DC/AC peak currents on the 12V rail for one of their 10TB 3.5″ drives. Even peak random read/writes can clock in at over 2A.</p><p>This bursty power demand has the potential to be problematic if the PSU isn’t up to the task. If an array of 6 drives collectively pull 150-200 watts at the same moment the CPU spikes to pull a peak 120W, that’s a jump from around 10 watts idle to around 400 watts. This could easily cause an instantaneous voltage dip – if it dips enough to cause an immediate crash/reboot it’s probably not a big deal, but if it dips just enough that data is corrupted during a memory refresh or when another drive is mid-write… that’s a more painful problem. Oversizing the PSU to some degree (or adding some in-line capacitors to the power rails) makes sense.</p><p>Fortunately, despite operating outside of the peak efficiency range, much of the Corsair RM series is pretty efficient across a wide range.<br> </p><h2>Power Measurements – Initial</h2><p>A few important bits:</p><ul><li>Power measured from the wall</li><li>Intel PowerTOP was used to auto-tune settings</li><li>Ubuntu Server 23.04</li></ul><p>A few potentially-important <strong>BIOS</strong> bits:</p><ul><li>CPU C-states were enabled in the BIOS (C10)</li><li>ASPM was enabled with everything set to L1</li><li>RC6 (Render Standby) enabled</li><li>Aggressive LPM Support enabled (ALPM)</li><li>DISABLED: HD Audio, Connectivity Mode, LEDs, GNA Device, Serial Port</li></ul><p><strong>9-10 watts</strong> was the consumption when the display output was on.</p><p><strong>7 watts</strong> was the consumption once the display turned off (consoleblank=600 kernel boot parameter for a 600s timer), which is where this system sits most of the week.</p><p><strong>8 watts</strong> was the consumption if the USB keyboard power management was disabled. If you don’t SSH into the server from elsewhere, spending the extra watt for keyboard use might be necessary.</p><h2>Problematic Power Measurements – Loaded up with spinning rust (spun-down)</h2><p>As mentioned in the beginning, I started with 12 hard drives. Half were 2.5″ and the other half were 3.5″. Because the motherboard only has 4 SATA ports, a SATA controller and a port multiplier were used to handle the remaining drives. Additionally, 4 NVMe drives were used early on: one of them, a Western Digital SN770 had a tendency to get quite hot even at idle which indicates it probably wasn’t going into a low power mode.</p><p>With all the equipment connected, at idle, with display off, and with the 12 drives spun down to standby, <strong>I was shocked to see that my idle power consumption had gone from 7 watts all the way up to a whopping 24-25 watts</strong>. Far too much! Something was amiss.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – High Power Investigation and Diagnosis</h4><p>I disconnected the hard drives and started testing components one at a time. These were fairly crude tests meant to get a rough idea as to the culprit, so numbers here aren’t precise.</p><p>I quickly discovered that the JMB585 SATA controller I was using caused power consumption to increase by something in the 6-10 watt range (precise measurements in a later section). The controller itself is only supposed to take a couple watts, and the tiny heatsink stayed cool, so there was obviously more going on. Where was the power going?</p><p>I decided to watch the CPU package C-states. Without the JMB585 SATA controller, the system hit C6. When the JMB585 was reconnected, the best the system hit was C3. Ah ha! But why? Turns out that if a PCIE-connected device won’t go into ASPM L1, the CPU won’t go into as deep a sleep. The JMB585 controller cards don’t seem to have ASPM support.</p><p>A little further experimentation revealed something else that I hadn’t known, and it has to do with C6 vs C8. The system will only hit C8 if there’s nothing hooked up to the CPU-attached PCIE lanes. In other words, if anything is plugged in to the top PCIE slot or the top NVMe slot, C6 is the maximum. The power consumption difference between C6 and C8 *seemed* to be less than a watt in a simple test.</p><p>So while C8 would be a luxury, hitting C6 was a must. C3 uses too much power. If SATA controllers were going to prevent the CPU from hitting the best power saving states, I started to wonder whether I should have been looking for a motherboard with 6-8 SATA ports so that I wouldn’t have to rely on add-on controllers…</p><p>A little searching for SATA HBAs showed that while there aren’t many options here, the ASM1166 SATA controller should support ASPM L1, though the firmware has to be flashed for it to work properly (and to work at all on newer Intel boards). This was something I’d have to order: I have Marvel and JMicron spares, but they don’t support ASPM. I’d actually been avoiding ASMedia for years, but out of necessity they were now getting another chance: I ordered a couple ASM1166 6 port SATA controllers.<br> </p><h4>Aside: BadTLP, Bad! AER Bus Errors from the pcieport</h4><p>Worth a mention… During initial testing with a WD Black SN770 (Gen4 NVMe), I found a problem when the primary (top CPU-attached) PCIE and NVMe ports were used. Running dmesg resulted in output littered with stuff like:</p><blockquote><p>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: AER: Corrected error received: 0000:02:00.0<br>nvme 0000:02:00.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Physical Layer, (Receiver ID)<br>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, (Transmitter ID)<br>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: AER: Error of this Agent is reported first<br>nvme 0000:02:00.0: [ 6] BadTLP</p></blockquote><p>…after much trial-and-error I found that if the “PEG – ASPM” BIOS setting was set to [Disabled] or [L0s] there were no errors.</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm.png" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm-500x375.png" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770-PLUS BIOS Advanced Platform Misc ASPM" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm.png" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>Of course, this was a bad option, as [L1] is crucial for power savings. If [L1] or [L0sL1] were used, the only option was to set the Link Speed of those ports to [Gen3], which didn’t stop the errors, but reduced them substantially.</p><p>Some research showed the root cause can be any number of things. Because swapping the motherboard or CPU wasn’t a pleasant thought, my best hope was swapping to a different brand of NVMe.</p><p>I ordered some Crucial P3 NVMe drives. This turned out to be a successful endeavor: <strong>with the WD drives replaced by the Crucial drives, I was no longer getting any errors</strong>, though keep in mind these are Gen3 drives.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Finding L1.1 and L1.2 to be enabled on chipset-connected ports only</h4><p>When I had the 2 Crucial P3 NVMe drives installed in the CPU-connected PCIEx16 slot and the top M2 slot, I noticed higher idle temps than expected. While the NAND sat at about 27-29C, the controllers were reporting 49-50C – much higher than I expected for these particular drives.</p><p>I moved the one from the PCIEx16 slot to a chipset-connected PCIEx4 slot. An interesting difference between these drives showed up via lspci -vvv:</p><blockquote><p><strong>CPU-connected M2 slot:</strong> L1SubCtl1: PCI-PM_L1.2- PCI-PM_L1.1- ASPM_L1.2- ASPM_L1.1-<br><strong>Chipset-connected PCIE slot:</strong> L1SubCtl1: PCI-PM_L1.2+ PCI-PM_L1.1+ ASPM_L1.2+ ASPM_L1.1+</p></blockquote><p>L1 sub-states only seem to get enabled on the chipset-connected slots. Unfortunate, but it does seem to coincide with the available BIOS settings in the screenshot above.</p><p>Let’s reference that motherboard picture again to show the situation:</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e-500x599.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770 with M.2 and PCIe port layout" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>I put both NVMe drives on chipset-connected PCIE slots. Now both showed L1.1+/L1.2+ and both controller temps were down from the 49-50C range to 38-41C.</p><p>Unfortunately when attempting various A/B tests using these 2 Crucial NVMe drives with different slot configurations and various BIOS settings, I saw very inconsistent behavior in terms of temperature, though it’s worth noting the JMB585 and an NVMe boot drive were also connected during these tests. For example, both drives might idle at around 40C until a soft reboot at which point 1 (or both) might now idle at the 50C range. Sometimes it seemed possible to keep 1 drive on the CPU-connected M.2 and retain 40C temperatures on both drives as long as the x16 slot wasn’t populated. Presumably I was hitting some sort of bug. The Samsung boot NVMe seemed to keep a consistent idle temperature regardless of what was happening with the Crucial NVMe drives, so I suspected the Crucial drives themselves are at least partly to blame.</p><p>Interestingly, sometimes one (or both) controller temps would drop all the way down to the 29C range when on the chipset-connected slots. Since trying to find a low-power 4TB NVMe replacement for the Crucial P3 wasn’t a realistic goal, my best hope at this point was that the ASPM-incompatible JMicron JMB 585 was somehow to blame, since it was soon to be replaced with the ASPM-compatible ASMedia ASM 1166.</p><p><em>Late Update: I unfortunately didn’t keep track of temperatures throughout the rest of the testing, and heatsinks/airflow between drives have all been jumbled around. But for whatever it’s worth, In the final build, my Crucial P3 controller temps are 31-34C, and NAND temps are 23-24C.</em><br> </p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Swapping from the JMB585 to the ASM1166.</h4><p>After a couple weeks the ASM1166 arrived. First a couple bits regarding the card which you might find helpful if you’re considering it…</p><blockquote><p>I began with a firmware flash – ASM1166 cards often have old firmware which doesn’t work with Intel 600-series motherboards and from what I understand can have issues with power management. Newer firmware can be found floating around in various places, but I decided to grab a copy from SilverStone (“fix compatibility issue” in the Download section of <a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/expansion-cards/ECS06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/expansion-cards/ECS06/</a>) and followed the instructions at <a href="https://docs.phil-barker.com/posts/upgrading-ASM1166-firmware-for-unraid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.phil-barker.com/posts/upgrading-ASM1166-firmware-for-unraid/</a> . Note that the SilverStone files had an identical MD5 to firmware I found by following the thread at <a href="https://forums.unraid.net/topic/102010-recommended-controllers-for-unraid/page/8/#comment-1185707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://forums.unraid.net/topic/102010-recommended-controllers-for-unraid/page/8/#comment-1185707</a> .</p><p>For anyone planning to purchase one of these ASMedia cards, I should note that like most SATA controllers and HBAs out there, the quality really varies. One of my cards had a heatsink that was on a bit crooked: the thermal pad was thick enough to prevent it from shorting nearby components, but be aware that these products can be really hit-and-miss. This is one of the situations where paying a little more to buy from somewhere with a good return policy can be prudent.</p></blockquote><p>I did quite a bit of A/B testing, so here is a quick “JMicron JMB585 vs ASMedia ASM1166” in terms of total system power consumption, though it may only be applicable to this platform (or perhaps even this specific motherboard).</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166-500x375.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="JMicron JMB585 vs ASMedia ASM1166" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p><strong><u>DRIVELESS</u></strong></p><p>First, power consumption without any drives connected to the cards (the SATA SSD boot drive is connected to the motherboard) to get a baseline. PowerTOP used on all devices except for the keyboard (adding +1 watt). Measurements after the display output went to sleep.</p><ul><li>8 watts – No SATA controller – C8 power state</li><li>9 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C8 power state</li><li>12 watts – JMB585 on the CPU-connected x16 slot – C3 power state</li><li>15 watts – JMB585 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C3 power state</li><li>22 watts – ASM1166 on the CPU-connected x16 slot – C2 power state</li></ul><p>The ASM1166 does well here if plugged into a chipset-connected slot (only +1 watt), but does horribly if connected to the main PCI-E slot (+14 watts) where the CPU package power state plummets to C2. Shockingly, the JMB585 behaves in an opposite manner where it’s consumption is lower on the CPU-connected slot (and it didn’t cause C2) – however, you’ll soon see that things change when drives are actually connected…</p><p>I did additional testing with the controllers, including playing “musical chairs” with a couple NVMe drives to see if multiple devices would throw a wrench into things, but nothing unexpected took place so I’ll skip those details.</p><p><strong><u>ADDING DRIVES</u></strong></p><p>With baseline measurements complete, next it was time to actually put some drives on these controllers. The SATA SSD boot drive stayed on the motherboard, 2 NVMe drives were added to the mix (chipset-connected unless otherwise noted), and 4 of the 2.5″ SATA hard drives were placed on the controller. I’ll list the “spun down” consumption after the hard drives went into standby – “spun up” was exactly 2 watts higher in every test while the drives were idle.</p><ul><li>10 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C8 power state</li><li>11 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot with 1 NVMe moved to the CPU-connected x16 slot – C6 power state</li><li>11 watts – 2x ASM1166 on chipset-connected x4 slots, with only 1 NVMe drive – C8 power state</li><li>16 watts – JMB585 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C3 power state</li><li>24 watts – JMB585 on CPU-connected x16 slot – C2 power state</li></ul><p>With 4 drives connected via a chipset-connected slot, the ASM1166 adds +2 watts to system power consumption, whereas the JMB585 adds +8 watts. No contest.</p><p>An additional benefit is that I was able to use <em>both</em> of the ASM1166 cards in the system, whereas attempting to use both of my JMB575 cards at the same time resulted in the system refusing to boot, though that could be a platform or motherboard-specific issue.</p><p>There is a trade-off though – I always found the JMB585 to be rock-solid reliable, including when paired with a JMB575 port multiplier. My past experience with ASMedia SATA controllers has been less than stellar: reliability with the ASM1166 remains to be seen, but at the very least it’s a bad candidate for a port multiplier since it doesn’t support FBS (only CBS).</p><p>A couple other minor hiccups that presented with the ASM1166:</p><ol><li>When removing/reinserting the NVMe boot drive, a BIOS message appeared claiming that it couldn’t boot due to GPT corruption. The ASM1166 cards had to be temporarily removed for the BIOS to “find” the NVMe boot drive again (after which they could be reinstalled).</li><li>The ASM1166 cards claim to have a *lot* of ports – this causes additional boot time as Linux has to iterate through all of them.</li></ol><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim-500x667.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASMedia ASM1166 claiming many ports it does not actually have" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><h4>Update: SATA and SSD Brands</h4><p>One of the comments mentioned an older Samsung 840 PRO SSD limiting to C3 whereas a Crucial Force GT SSD allowed C8. While those are older drives, I still found this a bit surprising. It was worth investigating.</p><p>I used the H770 as a testbed with a Samsung 850 EVO SATA SSD boot drive along with a Crucial P3 NVMe and built a custom kernel to allow the Realtek network adapter to reach L1.2. No ASM1166, just using the Intel onboard SATA. I reached C10 after running powertop with auto-tune and allowing the display to sleep.</p><p>I then added a Patriot P210 SATA SSD. Stuck at C6.</p><p>I removed the Patriot P210 and tried a 4TB 2.5″ Seagate SATA HDD. C10. Swapped it for an 8TB 3.5″ Seagate SATA HDD. C10. Swapped that for a 14TB Toshiba SATA HDD. C10. Added a 1TB Sandisk Ultra 3D SATA SSD to the Toshiba HDD. C10.</p><p>Later test: a 4TB Crucial MX500. C10.</p><p>The lesson here: we clearly need to be picky about SATA SSDs. Feel free to leave a comment with good/bad ones you come across.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Conclusion</h4><p>A few important bits if aiming for low consumption:</p><p>1) Motherboard support and BIOS configuration are critical – I’ve had motherboards with very inflexible BIOS’s. On this one, “Native ASPM” and the appropriate L1 states must be enabled (to allow OS-controlled instead of BIOS-controlled) for low power consumption to work.</p><p>2) Devices all need to support ASPM L1. Otherwise you’re really rolling the dice. The hardest part here as you might have guessed is finding SATA controllers that support it – if possible, get a motherboard enough sufficient Intel chipset-connected SATA ports to avoid needing a separate card. I should note that finding NVMe drives that have working low-power APST power states under ASPM isn’t always a given and you’ll want to do some research there too.</p><p>3) If you can hit the C8 power state, avoid using CPU-attached PCIe lanes (top PCIe and M2 slot). On this specific motherboard, my advice would be to avoiding using them altogether if you can, unless you either need the low-latency full-bandwidth path to the CPU or your devices are so active they never sleep anyway. Recall that BOTH my JMicron and ASMedia SATA cards caused the CPU Package C-State to plummet to C2 if plugged into the x16 PCI-E slot.</p><p>4) Measuring power from the wall is the only way to make sure that what you *think* is happening is actually happening. A Kill-A-Watt device will pay for itself over time if you use it – consider that I bought mine in 2006 ($16USD + $14USD shipping at the time through eBay). At that time I found our rarely-used fax machine which was always powered on used 7 watts… just keeping that one device powered off when unused during the next 10 years more than paid for the Kill-A-Watt.</p><h2>Power Consumption when loaded up with a bunch of HDDs</h2><p>Now that a variety of parts have moved in-and-out of the system throughout this process, the current setup is as follows:</p><ul><li>1x Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe (500GB boot drive)</li><li>2x Crucial P3 NVMe (4TB each)</li><li>5x Seagate 2.5″ HDD (5TB each – 4TB utilized)</li><li>6x Seagate 3.5″ HDD (10TB each – 8TB utilized)</li><li>2x ASM1166 cards providing SATA ports</li></ul><p>Total power measured from the wall (display on, keyboard enabled):</p><ul><li>50 watts with all 11 HDD in active-idle</li><li>38 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Idle B</li><li>34 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Idle C</li><li>21 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Standby_Z (spun down)</li><li>18 watts with the 5x 2.5″ HDD ALSO in Standby</li><li>16 watts with the display output ALSO off</li><li>15 watts when PowerTOP is allowed to disable the USB Keyboard</li></ul><p>Seagate rates standby consumption of these 3.5″ drives at about 0.8w each, and the 2.5″ drives at about 0.18w each. This lines up with what I’m seeing above. My active-idle numbers actually match up pretty well to Seagate specs too.</p><p><strong>The obvious observation: compared to the rest of the system components, the 3.5″ drives are power-hungry monsters.</strong></p><p>The HDDs will eventually be replaced with SSDs. With idle consumption as low as it is during HDD standby, there isn’t a major rush and this process will gradually take place as my HDD drives/spares <u>fail</u> and SSD prices <u>fall</u>.</p><p>The plan for “end game” is for an all-SSD build. Originally the plan was for 1 boot drive, 6xNVMe (likely Crucial P3 4TB) for a RAIDZ2 array, and 6xSATA (likely Samsung 870 QVO 8TB) for the 2nd RAIDZ2 array. Since using the CPU-connected M2/PCIe slots not only brings unpredictability but also comes at a slight C-state/power/temperature cost, I might alter that plan and give up a couple NVMe in the first array and use SATA instead so that I don’t have to touch CPU-connected lanes. Time will tell.<br> </p><h2>Unnecessary Storage Details</h2><p>This part is only worth reading if you’re interested in meticulous details about the storage. Feel free to skip to the final section otherwise.</p><blockquote><h4>NVMe boot drive</h4><p>As alluded to earlier, this is a Samsung 970 EVO Plus. Currently less than 4GB of the 500GB space is used (a 64GB swap partition exists but always sits at 0 used). It was originally chosen because Samsung had developed a reputation for reliability (which has been falling by the wayside lately), and Samsung also scored well in reviews every time it came to idle power consumption. This drive is almost always idle and both Controller and NAND temps stayed low throughout all testing (20-24C). It may eventually be swapped to a SATA SSD to free up an NVMe port.</p><h4>2.5″ HDD</h4><p>These drives are used for the primary 6-drive ZFS RAIDZ2 array – the one that gets the most use. One day a week it’s busy with a task that involves reading a few TB over the course of 24 hours. Usage through the rest of the week is sporadic, and the drives spend most of the week spun down. For anyone wondering why piddly 2.5″ drives are used instead of 3.5″ drives, there *is* a reason: <strong>power consumption</strong>.</p><p>Power consumption of the 2.5″ Seagate drives is honestly <strong>pretty impressive</strong>. Spun down they’re each rated at 0.18w, in low power idle they’re rated at 0.85w, and the read/write averages are rated at about 2w. There are plenty of SSDs out there with worse power consumption numbers than this spinning rust. 5TB capacity gives a lot of storage-per-watt.</p><p>The major downsides to these 2.5″ Seagate drives are:</p><ul><li>Not great performers. 80-120MB/s peak read/write. To be fair though, many TLC/QLC SSDs fall to these write levels when their SLC cache is exhausted.</li><li>SMR (Shingled Magnetic recording). Reads are fine, but write performance absolutely plummets when random writes take place – it acts like a QLC SSD without an SLC cache that also doesn’t have TRIM.</li><li>Low rated workload (55TB/year vs 550TB/year for 3.5″ Exos drives).</li><li>No configurable error recovery time (SCT ERC), and these drives can hang for minutes if they hit an error while they relentlessly try to re-read the problematic sector. Ubuntu needs to be configured to wait instead of trying to reset the drive after 30 seconds.</li><li>Higher error rates if they heat up (I’ve had to replace a few and have discovered they don’t like running hot).</li><li>Typical HDD pain points (slow to spin up, etc).</li></ul><p>To be absolutely fair to Seagate, these are sold as external USB backup drives. Pulling these 15mm tall drives out of the enclosures and using them as RAID members in a NAS isn’t exactly using them as intended. The ultra low power consumption is tremendous, but there are obvious trade-offs.</p><p>Long term, these 2.5″ 4/5TB drives will slowly be replaced by 4TB SSD drives (possibly all NVMe). SSDs in 4TB capacity started to become available on the consumer end in 2021/2022 at about 4-5x the cost of the spinners. Less than 2 years later they’ve dropped to about 2x the cost, and I expect decent brands to last more than 2x as long as the Seagate spinners.</p><p>If availability of the Crucial P3 (Gen3) model remains, I’ll likely keep with this model despite being limited to Gen3 speeds. I strongly considered the Crucial P3 Plus (Gen4), but power consumption in reviews was higher despite very few situations where performance was notably higher as well. My biggest concern with the P3 Plus (Gen4) was that if I had issues with ASPM/APST, Tom’s Hardware showed it with a 0.3w idle power premium over the P3 (Gen3) for the 2TB model. I prefer “worst-case scenario” power to be as low as possible.</p><h4>3.5″ HDD</h4><p>Used in the secondary 6-drive RAIDZ2 array – a backup array that’s spun up for about 2 hours a week where it receives constant heavy writes.</p><p>Power consumption of the 3.5″ Seagate drives is about what you’d expect. These 10TB drives are rated at about 0.8w each in standby, 2-5w idle, and 6-9w reading and writing.</p><p>Two concerns here:</p><ul><li>These are rated to collectively pull about 45-50 watts when writing. That’s a bit of extra UPS load I don’t really want if a lengthy power outage takes place during the backups (I stick with consumer 1500 watt UPS’s).</li><li>These are rated to collectively pull about 4.8 watts when in standby. Again, some UPS load I wouldn’t mind shaving off.</li></ul><p>Long-term these drives will likely be replaced by Samsung 870 QVO 8TB SATA drives. The 870 QVO sports 0.041w/0.046w idle with ALPM, 0.224w/0.229w idle without, and 2.0-2.7w during a copy (according to Toms/Anandtech).</p><p>Price-wise, the Samsung 8TB SATA SSD is currently a fair bit more expensive than 8TB spinners (closer to 3x the cost) so unless these drives start to see more frequent use for some reason, replacement with the SSDs will almost certainly wait until I’ve run out of spares.</p><h4>NVMe Cache Drive</h4><p>Replacing my spinning rust with SSDs is a process that will likely take a while.</p><p>In the meantime, ZFS has a couple options to make use of high-speed storage (typically SSD) in front of slower storage:</p><ul><li>“Special” Allocation Class – allows you to create a vdev specifically for metadata and for “small” blocks if desired.</li><li>A cache drive, known commonly as an L2ARC.</li></ul><p>If you create the “special” vdev at pool creation, all your metadata (and optionally, small blocks of a size you choose) will go on the “special” vdev instead of your spinning rust. Very fast file listings and directory traversal whilst keeping the spinning rust for the files themselves. Yes, you can “ls” a bunch of directories without waking your HDDs from sleep. Biggest downside is that because all your metadata is on this vdev, if it ever dies, access to all your data is essentially gone. So it really should be at least mirrored. Maybe even a 3-way mirror. Say goodbye to a few ports.</p><p>The L2ARC is a bit different. It’s essentially a level 2 cache. When the cache in RAM gets full, ZFS will copy some of the blocks to the L2ARC before it evicts that content from RAM. The next time that data needs to be accessed, it’ll be read from the L2ARC instead of the disk. One benefit compared to the “special” vdev is that you’re fine with only 1 SSD – if there’s a problem with the data in the L2ARC (bad checksum, drive dies, etc), ZFS will just read the content from the original disk. Also, once the L2ARC is full, ZFS will just start again at the beginning of the L2ARC SSD and overwrite stuff it wrote before which has some pros (old data never accessed anymore) and cons (data that was frequently accessed and will need to get written to the L2ARC again). You can also add/remove L2ARC devices from the pool at your leisure – want to add a 64GB SSD, 500GB SSD, and 2TB SSD? Go right ahead – ZFS will distribute blocks among them. Need to remove the 500GB SSD from the pool a few days later and use it elsewhere? Go right ahead. The biggest downside to the L2ARC is that if you forget to specify “cache” when adding the device, you probably mucked up your pool. It’s also imperfect: even with careful tuning it’s hard to get ZFS to write EVERYTHING you want to the L2ARC before it gets evicted from memory. At the same time, depending on your data, the L2ARC may see a lot of writes, and you may have to carefully watch the health of your SSD.</p><p>In the past I’ve used the “special”, used L2ARC, and have used both at the same time (you can even tell the L2ARC not to cache things already contained in the “special” vdev).</p><p><strong>This time around I simply went with an L2ARC on a 4TB NVMe:</strong> once all the other 2.5″ drives have been replaced by SSD and the speed benefits of an SSD cache no longer apply, I can simply remove this cache device (though theoretically having 1 L2ARC cache drive handling the bulk of reads *would* allow the other NVMe drives to stay in low power mode more…).</p></blockquote><h2>Conclusion – Regrets? Second-guessing? What could have gone differently?</h2><p>Unlike the <a href="https://mattgadient.com/9w-idle-creating-a-low-power-home-nas-file-server-with-4-storage-drives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASRock J4005 build</a> where I realized part way through that I’d kneecapped myself in a number of ways, I don’t get the same sense here. This time I ended up with low idle power AND a pretty capable system that should be flexible even if repurposed in the future.</p><p>I’m quite happy with my component choices, though I’d be curious to know how the MSI PRO Z790-P DDR4 (one of the other motherboards I considered) would do in comparison. Functionality-wise the MSI has the advantage of 6xSATA ports, but it comes with the obvious downside of the notorious Intel 2.5G networking chip. The MSI also has a PS/2 port and I’ve never actually checked to see if PS/2 keyboard power consumption is lower than USB (recall that I save 1 watt if I allow powertop to shut down the USB keyboard port). And of course it would be interesting to compare the ASPM and ALPM settings, and to see if the snags I hit with CPU-attached PCIe/M.2 slots exist in the same way.</p><p>While this system currently sits in the 15-16 watt range when idle with drives in <i>standby</i>, once all HDDs are replaced with SSDs, I’d expect idle consumption of around 10-11 watts which isn’t bad for 72TB worth of drives, 64GB of RAM, and a pretty decent processor.</p><p><b>Update:</b> Recent Linux kernels disable the L1 power saving modes of most Realtek NICs which prevents the CPU from entering decent C-states, thus increasing power consumption by quite a lot. While there are workarounds, moving forward I’ll likely limit myself to motherboards containing Intel 1 Gigabit network adapters (perhaps moving to Intel 2.5 Gigabit when it becomes clear they’ve worked out all the kinks). You can find further details about the Realtek NIC situation in the comments below. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Carolina African Runner peanut re-emerges, giving farmers and chefs a new culinary adventure.</strong></p><p>At Clemson University’s Coastal Research and Education Lab, horticulturist Dr. Brian Ward stands for hours at a time carefully hand sorting, shelling and cleaning a small, distinctive and somewhat celebrated peanut known as the Carolina African Runner peanut. And like most rare finds, it has a story behind it.</p><blockquote>“The Carolina African peanut is so tiny that when it runs through a shelling machine, only about 70% will make it into a pile of good seed, then the sheller has to throw the rest out,” Ward said.</blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/54y5ztcs/production/eb5a9a9dc0b7af69ae531a021629edf7995a107c-550x550.jpg?w=650&amp;q=90" alt="a man crouched in a peanut crop field wearing a plaid shirt."></p><p><em>Horticulturist Dr. Brian Ward, Clemson University</em></p><p>This spring, Ward is bent on safeguarding as many good seeds as possible to provide farmers with enough seeds to sustain the heirloom peanut. So, he’s hand-shelling that last 30%.</p><blockquote>“It takes about six of us cleaning and separating to get about 20 extra pounds of seed in a day,” Ward said.</blockquote><p>The necessary tedium to ensure the peanuts are edible helps explain one reason food historians, chefs and artisans assumed this peanut was extinct.</p><h2>Once Upon a Time</h2><p>Brought to the port of Charleston in 1690 by African slaves, the re-emerged Carolina African Runner peanut is known as the first peanut planted in the American colonies. It is denser, sweeter, smaller and had a higher oil content than the peanuts we eat today.</p><p>Originally, its culinary uses were influenced by West African practices: the peanuts were boiled, ground into meal, candied, mashed or made into a hot beverage, roasted and pressed into oil.</p><p>In the 1800s, taste buds in the northern cities preferred roasted peanuts, and street and ballpark vendors popularized the larger Virginia snack peanuts. The public quickly deemed Virginias as America’s “eating” peanut.</p><p>When the boll weevil threatened to wipe out the South’s cotton crop in the 1910s, and cottonseed was unavailable for cottonseed oil production, the Carolina African peanut saw a brief resurgence because of its high oil content. But by the 1930s, the peanut’s small size created additional work at harvest and field workers complained. It was vulnerable to certain diseases in the field, which made it unreliable for growers who needed to produce larger crops.</p><p>Historians believe the last commercial crops of Carolina African peanuts date from the late 1920s, and it was believed to be extinct by the end of the 1950s.</p><p>Whether by fate or foresight, a mere 40 Carolina African Runner Peanut seeds were carefully tucked away in cold storage by plant breeders at North Carolina State University (NCSU).</p><h2>A Quest Begins</h2><p>Some 60 years later, food historian Dr. David Shields of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, along with Southern food artisans, chefs and financial partners, began a quest to recreate a historic Southern menu. Shields searched through colonial ship manifests and early papers to find proof that in 1690 peanut seeds arrived on our shores. Five years later, a phone call to NCSU’s breeding facility produced the ancestral peanut.</p><blockquote>“They gave me half of the entire collection,” Ward said. “They just told me it was ‘special seed’ and to take good care of it. It wasn’t until harvest that I learned these were the original Carolina African Runner peanuts everybody thought were extinct."</blockquote><p>In 2013, Ward planted the seeds next to his field lab to watch them closely, and twelve plants made it. The next season, Ward and a South Carolina farmer Nat Bradford multiplied the seeds to 1,200 plants. Other farmers got involved and the first commercial crop of 15 million peanuts was harvested in 2016.</p><p>Then, bad weather struck the Southeastern growing regions for two seasons, hitting the heirloom peanut fields hard. Flooding and a GPS error greatly reduced the yield and Ward is growing out a smaller two-acre field -- “not for selling, but just for seed.”</p><h2>The Most “Peanutty” of Peanuts</h2><blockquote>“The best part of this discovery is it has cultural and historical significance,” Ward said. “The flavor is ‘wow,’ ‘bam!’ The aroma is more potent than our traditional peanuts today.”</blockquote><p>Chef Forrest Parker of the Old Village Post House in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina was the first chef who received the peanuts. He calls them “the most peanutty peanut of peanuts,” Ward said.</p><p>Nat Bradford, an artisan farmer in Seneca, South Carolina, and was given enough of the revived peanut seeds for three-fourths of an acre.</p><blockquote>“The story behind it is fascinating to me,” Bradford said, “Once you acquire the seed, it’s precious and you’re a steward of it. You don’t want to store it, but to put it back into use, to reproduce it and discover the market potential.”</blockquote><p>This year, he’s planting five acres and “making it successful enough to be sustainable and profitable,” Bradford said. “I’ve never had a peanut like it.”</p><p>Bradford admits the price is high right now ($20 per pound) but he said it’s because “there’s so much work involved in cleaning, sorting and shelling. I’ve spent most of my winter evenings with my kids cleaning, picking out debris, shelling them—it’s a labor of love.”</p><h2>Reawakening an Original Superfood</h2><p>Ward sees market potential for the Carolina African peanut. He’s had dozens of farmers interested in growing it and shipped it to 50 or 60 artisan farmers so far. Several chefs throughout South Carolina and Georgia are experimenting with different culinary uses, such as making peanut hummus and peanut brittle or boiled peanuts.</p><p>As Bradford said, “The difference is the flavor. I want chefs to find new ways to use them, so more people can experience their flavor. It is uniquely amazing.”</p><p>One peanut butter company, Good Spread, is interested in the heirloom peanut because it reflects their mission of “fighting global malnutrition and using our footprint to protect and enrich the environment and communities we impact,” said Robbie Vitrano, founder and owner of Good Spread. Each jar the company sells provides one packet of peanut butter-based Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to treat malnourished children worldwide.</p><p>Plus, Vittrano is working on a peanut butter with the heirloom peanut. But why the Carolina African peanut?</p><blockquote>“We love the cultural narrative of the artisan peanut, and the opportunity to use agricultural practices that protect and improve the environment," Vittrano said. "Peanuts are an original superfood—we believe one way we’ll reawaken people to that is with products that have both an original story and bring new flavors and tastes to our customers.”</blockquote><p>That’s why many believe the story of America’s original peanut is just beginning.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into that partition. But consumers can also run <code>steamos-devmode</code> to unlock the root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them a working Linux distro with a normal package manager.</p><p>This A/B atomic updates system is pretty standard for OSes these days, but there’s a lot going on in SteamOS that makes them work even with heavy customization by the end-user. I wanted to explore that while still being able to make changes to the root filesystem images. <code>steamos-devmode</code> is the easy way out; I wanted to make a proper fork. Here’s how I did it.</p><ili-callout role="note"><p>I use these instructions, but am providing them here to help publicly document some of what SteamOS does. I’m not responsible for you breaking your Steam Deck, and if you send me questions asking why these steps don’t work for you I won’t answer.</p></ili-callout><h2>Why?</h2><p>I don’t own a Steam Deck. A bunch of my friends do, but they know better than to let me have root access on a device they actually like using. What I do have is a recently-built living room PC that I wanted to play games on… and SteamOS seemed like a reasonable choice. It almost even worked perfectly out of the box, although I think that is primarily because I built a computer that looks vaguely similar to a really heavy, battery-less Steam Deck<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-fragile" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-fragile">1</a></sup>.</p><p>The one thing that didn’t work was resume from suspend. Other distributions running on my computer using mainline or stable kernels did. Eventually, I found <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/">the sources for Valve’s kernel</a> (it’s weird, I’ll explain when we get there) and started a <code>git bisect</code>, leading me to a commit that seems to fix resume from suspend on Steam Deck hardware, but ultimately breaks it on mine. Needing to revert this commit and do my own build is the ultimate reason I headed down this path.</p><p>At several points in this process my partner asked if this made more sense than just using Arch or something else directly. I still don’t know the answer, although I think I still prefer relying on a Valve-tested set of packages than whatever’s current in the Arch repos. If I’m going to have to tinker with a Linux distro for running games, it may as well be one that people actually test their games on.</p><p>I apparently have a tendency to make poor choices like this, because you are reading the second post in what has become a series on <a href="https://iliana.fyi/blog/installing-fedora-on-mac-mini/">installing Linux distros onto systems they’re not ready for yet</a>.</p><h2>SteamOS in a nutshell</h2><p>A SteamOS system has eight partitions. The stage 1 bootloader is stored on the EFI system partition, along with metadata files that describe the two A/B partition sets and how to choose which one to boot. Each of the two partition sets contains a stage 2 bootloader (GRUB), the root filesystem, and a <code>/var</code> partition. Finally, there’s a single <code>home</code> partition that fills the rest of the disk.</p><pre><code>Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name

</code></pre><p>When the system boots, a number of other pseudo-filesystems get mounted. Almost a dozen directories, including <code>/var/log</code>, <code>/root</code>, and <code>/nix</code>, are bind-mounted from <code>/home/.steamos/offload</code> to keep their data persistent.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite detail of SteamOS is how it handles <code>/etc</code>: it mounts an overlayfs on top of it, with modifications persisted at <code>/var/lib/overlays/etc/upper</code>. This allows persisting the usual things that need to be persisted in <code>/etc</code> (e.g. the <code>machine-id</code> file, NetworkManager connections) while allowing updates to untouched configuration files. Most Linux package managers have similar behaviors around <code>/etc</code>, only updating config files that haven’t been changed from their defaults, but Valve’s approach makes this work with the A/B partition system without any package manager logic.</p><p>A system update is started when the Steam client, or a user in a terminal, runs <code>steamos-update</code>. This runs a Python program, <code>steamos-atomupd-client</code>, which sends a request containing the current OS information and the user’s update channel configuration to the URLs in <code>/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code> in order to determine whether there is a new update.</p><p>If there is, the servers respond with a path to a <a href="https://rauc.io/">RAUC bundle</a>, which the client downloads and runs <code>rauc install</code> on. RAUC verifies the signature of the bundle and looks for the <code>rootfs.img.caibx</code> file, then runs <code>casync extract</code> to download all the necessary pieces of the new image and write them to the inactive rootfs partition. RAUC then runs a post-install script that selectively<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-selectively" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-selectively">2</a></sup> synchronizes data from the active <code>/var</code> partition to the inactive <code>/var</code> partition, and modifies the stage 1 bootloader configuration on the EFI system partition to boot into the newly-written partition set.</p><h2>Patching the kernel</h2><p>Valve uses a heavily-modified Linux kernel in SteamOS. We can know this because we can readily download the sources. It’s a little more convoluted than <code>git clone</code>, but not by much. Their <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/">pacman mirror</a> can be found in <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>, and the sources used for current (as of writing) SteamOS images are in the <code>sources/holo-3.5</code> and <code>sources/jupiter-3.5</code>. Right now, the current stable image’s kernel is <code>6.1.52-valve9-1-neptune-61</code>, whose source lives at <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/jupiter-3.5/linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz">https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/jupiter-3.5/linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz</a>.</p><p>This is a 2.9 GiB tarball. Why is it that big? Because there’s an entire Linux Git tree in here.</p><pre><code>$ tar xvf linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz

</code></pre><p>Then <code>makepkg</code> should spit out a package. (Tip: <code>makepkg MAKEFLAGS=-j$(nproc)</code>, or updating <code>/etc/makepkg.conf</code>, is a good idea if you are not building in a tiny virtual machine.) This same general process should apply for any SteamOS-specific packages; all the ones I’ve looked at similarly use a Git repository as their first source.</p><p>To make the next steps easier, I set up a pacman repo containing my package outputs. This also helps the <code>steamos-devmode</code> tool work properly if you choose to run that in the future. This is <a href="https://archlinux.org/pacman/repo-add.8.html">very simple</a>: put the packages in a directory, run <code>repo-add $REPO_NAME.db.tar.zst [PACKAGES...]</code> in that directory, and upload the directory to a web host somewhere.</p><h2>Repacking the root filesystem</h2><p>The update client is perfectly-readable Python, and the sources for the rest of the packages on the system can be found adjacent to Valve’s pacman repos, but I haven’t yet found any release engineering scripts. Reverse engineering these would be fraught, time-consuming, and beyond what I believe my attention span would allow, so I decided to take the existing root filesystem and “repack” it to fit my needs.</p><p>If you want my scripts without the explanations and commentary, you can find them at <a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/">https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/</a>.</p><h3>Getting the root filesystem</h3><ili-callout role="note"><p>The normal way to get a copy of the SteamOS root filesystem image is to buy a Steam Deck or download the recovery image from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download?ver=steamdeck">https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download?ver=steamdeck</a>, both of which require agreeing to the Steam End User License Agreement<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-agreement" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-agreement">4</a></sup>. The methods I describe below don’t make you do this, but now you’re aware of it.</p></ili-callout><p>First, we need the root filesystem. You could install SteamOS, run an update, and pull it off the disk, but that is kind of obnoxious, especially if you don’t have any hardware to install it on.</p><p>Every build of a Steam Deck image can be found at <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/">https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/</a>, but to find the current release version you can look at what appears to be a fallback URL for the updates system, <a href="https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck.json">https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck.json</a> (or <a href="https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck-beta.json">this path for the preview channel</a>). As of writing, the current stable version is <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/">https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/</a>.</p><p>To download the root filesystem, we follow the same steps <code>steamos-atomupd-client</code> does: first, download the RAUC bundle (the <code>.raucb</code> file). Then extract the <code>rootfs.img.caibx</code> from inside; these RAUC bundles are SquashFS filesystems with a signature at the end, so you can either mount it or use unsquashfs (from squashfs-tools) or p7zip to extract it without mounting. Finally, use casync to fetch the image using the <code>.castr</code> store adjacent to the <code>.raucb</code> bundle:</p><pre><code>casync extract \
	--store=https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/steamdeck-20231122.1-3.5.7.castr \
	rootfs.img.caibx rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>The casync store URL is the RAUC bundle URL, but with <code>.raucb</code> replaced with <code>.castr</code> (this is hardcoded in <code>steamos-atomupd</code>).</p><p><a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/fetch-current.sh?id=c50eb80f23c08f1ffc824d4983d5b9a740fb1273">Here is a script I use to do all this.</a></p><ili-tangent role="note"><p>The adjacent <code>.img.zip</code> and <code>.img.zst</code> files are not the root filesystem, sadly, but are separate bootable recovery images:</p><pre><code>$ sgdisk --print disk.img
Disk disk.img: 15125000 sectors, 7.2 GiB
[...]

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name

</code></pre><p>You could extract the rootfs partition and use it in the next steps, but for some reason it’s not a bit-for-bit copy of the image that is downloaded via RAUC and casync, and doing this doesn’t save you from having to use those tools as we need them to turn our repacked image back into an update bundle.</p></ili-tangent><h3>Mounting the root filesystem</h3><p>First, we should randomize the filesystem UUID. If you update from a currently-released SteamOS image to your customized one without randomizing the filesystem UUID, you will end up with two distinct filesystems with the same UUID. This can cause problems.</p><pre><code>btrfstune -fu rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>Valve is currently using Btrfs images with zstd compression, so to maintain that compression as we change the image, we need to mount it with the appropriate option:</p><pre><code>mkdir rootfs
mount -o compress=zstd rootfs.img rootfs
</code></pre><p>SteamOS uses Btrfs’s <code>readonly</code> subvolume property; clear that flag:</p><pre><code>btrfs property set -ts rootfs ro false
</code></pre><p>Modifying certain packages, such as the Linux kernel, triggers scripts that want /dev and /proc, so mount those:</p><pre><code>mount -t devtmpfs dev rootfs/dev
mount -t proc proc rootfs/proc
</code></pre><p>It’s also a good idea to prevent writes to directories that will be mounted by the booted system. We can mount tmpfs to these directories:</p><pre><code>mount -t tmpfs tmpfs rootfs/tmp
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/run
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/var
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/home
</code></pre><p>In this example we’ll be installing packages via pacman repositories in a chroot (using pacman’s <code>--sysroot</code> option). Networking functions fine in a chroot, but name resolution still relies on a correct /etc/resolv.conf, so bind mount one in:</p><pre><code>mount --bind "$(realpath /etc/resolv.conf)" rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><h3>Replacing packages</h3><p>To add your custom repository, make it the first repository entry in <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code>. This will ensure your packages override any newer-versioned ones from Valve’s repositories. It also allows your packages to be reinstalled by <code>steamos-devmode</code> if you run that on this image. I used this stanza:</p><pre><code>[fauxlo]
Server = https://fauxlo.ili.fyi/pacman/$arch
SigLevel = Never
</code></pre><p><code>SigLevel = Never</code> allows the packages to have no signatures. If you want to GPG-sign your packages, go for it, but that’s beyond what I have patience for.</p><ili-tangent role="note"><p>If you do end up installing GPG-signed packages, you’ll need to populate the pacman keyring. I think it’s best to avoid messing with the empty keyring in <code>/etc/pacman.d/gnupg</code> by populating a new keyring on a tmpfs:</p><pre><code>chroot rootfs pacman-key --gpgdir /tmp/gnupg --init
chroot rootfs pacman-key --gpgdir /tmp/gnupg --populate
# These start a gpg-agent, which we need to stop before we can unmount at the end.
chroot rootfs gpgconf --homedir /tmp/gnupg --kill all
</code></pre><p>Then add <code>--gpgdir /tmp/gnupg</code> to your pacman incantation.</p></ili-tangent><p>Then, we install:</p><pre><code>pacman --sysroot rootfs --noconfirm -Sy linux-neptune-61
</code></pre><ili-tangent role="note"><p>In my script, I avoid using <code>-y</code> and instead synchronize my repository’s database behind pacman’s back before running the install command:</p><pre><code>curl -Ro rootfs/usr/lib/holo/pacmandb/sync/fauxlo.db \
	https://fauxlo.ili.fyi/pacman/x86_64/fauxlo.db
</code></pre><p>This keeps the state of the other repositories on disk frozen at the same point in time when the image was originally built. I don’t think this actually matters, but it reduces the changes that show up if I diff my image against Valve’s.</p></ili-tangent><h3>Changing the build ID</h3><p><code>steamos-atomupd</code> reads from <code>/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code>, or if that is somehow missing, <code>/etc/os-release</code>, to determine the version and build ID of the current image. It will refuse to perform an update if the server says the available update’s build ID is the same as the current image. It’s also good to know what image you’re running.</p><p>The build ID <em>must</em> be of the form YYYYMMDD.N. If it isn’t, <code>steamos-atomupd</code> exits with a Python traceback upon encountering it. To avoid having to remember to count up manually, I set N to a timestamp; either HHMMSS or a Unix timestamp would work fine.</p><p>Update the <code>buildid</code> field in <code>rootfs/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code> and the <code>BUILD_ID</code> field in <code>rootfs/etc/os-release</code> with whatever you pick. You can steal from <a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/repack.sh?id=c50eb80f23c08f1ffc824d4983d5b9a740fb1273#n47">the Bash script I wrote to do this</a>.</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>--- a/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</span>

</code></pre><h3>Other changes</h3><p>You can make pretty much any change you want at this point as long as you don’t run out of space in a 5 GiB Btrfs image. For instance, if you want your SteamOS device to be resolvable as <code>hostname.local</code> on your network, you could remove <code>rootfs/usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/00-disable-mdns.conf</code>. This <em>can</em> be overridden with a configuration in the <code>/etc</code> overlay, but it’s kind of a pain in the ass.</p><p>In general, my philosophy here is that you should avoid making changes that are trivial to perform without modifying the image. You <em>could</em> install Firefox in the root filesystem this way, instead of using Flatpak or Nix, but then you’d need to repack the image every time you want to install a Firefox security update.</p><h3>Unmounting the root filesystem</h3><p>Mark the filesystem read-only once again:</p><pre><code>btrfs property set -ts rootfs ro true
</code></pre><p>Discard any unused blocks:</p><pre><code>fstrim -v rootfs
</code></pre><p>Then, unmount. <code>--recursive</code> is particularly helpful here to take care of all the pseudo-filesystems we mounted in:</p><pre><code>umount --recursive rootfs
</code></pre><h2>Creating the RAUC bundle</h2><p>First we need to create the casync store and blob index. We can do this with:</p><pre><code>mkdir bundle
casync make --store=rootfs.img.castr \
	bundle/rootfs.img.caibx rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>The RAUC bundle needs two other files. The first is <code>manifest.raucm</code>:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>cat</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>bundle/manifest.raucm</span><span> </span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span>

</code></pre><p>The second is a <code>UUID</code> file containing the filesystem UUID:</p><pre><code>blkid -s UUID -o value rootfs.img &gt;bundle/UUID
</code></pre><p>With those three files:</p><pre><code>$ ls bundle
manifest.raucm  rootfs.img.caibx  UUID
</code></pre><p>we can now call <code>rauc bundle</code>:</p><pre><code>rauc bundle \
	--signing-keyring=cert.pem --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem \

</code></pre><p>Note that the object at <code>.minor.candidates[0].image</code> should be the same as <code>/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code> in your image. <code>update_path</code> is what the updates client will append to your <code>ImagesUrl</code> to download the bundle.</p><p>I use the following Caddy configuration to rewrite the requests <code>steamos-atomupd</code> makes to <code>QueryUrl</code> and <code>MetaUrl</code> to the above <code>live.json</code>:</p><pre><code>root * /var/www/fauxlo.ili.fyi

rewrite /meta/*/*/*/*.json /live.json
rewrite /meta/*/*/*/*/*.json /live.json

</code></pre><p>The real SteamOS <code>QueryUrl</code> and <code>MetaUrl</code> seem to have quite a bit more logic to them, but this is sufficient to get <code>steamos-atomupd</code> to find the new update. It has logic to avoid updating if it’s already running the image advertised as currently available.</p><h2>Updating!</h2><p>Once you have all this in place, you can update an existing SteamOS installation to this by modifying <code>/etc/rauc/keyring.pem</code> and <code>/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code>. (No <code>steamos-readonly disable</code> required, as your changes will land on the <code>/etc</code> overlay; after you run <code>steamos-update</code>, consider cleaning those changes out of <code>/var/lib/overlays/etc/upper</code>.)</p><p>You can also probably install your modified SteamOS by modifying one of Valve’s recovery images, replacing their rootfs with your own. I haven’t tested this, but I also haven’t seen anything that would contradict this.</p><ili-callout role="note"><p>Thanks for reading! 2023 has been a busier-than-usual year for my blog, and I’m pretty happy about getting more writing out there.

<p dir="auto">The <code>copilot-complete</code> function demonstrates that ~100 lines of LISP
is all it takes for Emacs to do that thing Github Copilot and VSCode
are famous for doing except superior w.r.t. both quality and freedom</p>
<p dir="auto">Emacs Copilot helps you do pair programming with a local-running LLM
that generates code completions within Emacs buffers. The LLM is run
as a sub-command that remembers your local editing history on a file
by file basis. Tokens stream into your buffer without delay as gen'd
and you can hit <code>C-g</code> to interrupt your LLM at any time. History and
memory can also be deleted from the LLM's context when deleting code
from your Emacs buffer that matches up verbatim. Copilot is language
agnostic and your programming language is determed by file extension</p>
<p dir="auto">One really good LLM right now is WizardCoder 34b since it scores the
same as GPT-4 on HumanEval. You need a computer like a Mac Studio M2
Ultra in order to use it. If you have a mere Macbook Pro, then try the
Q3 version. If you have a modest PC then you could consider downloading
the WizardCoder-Python-13b llamafile since it's almost as good, and will
even go acceptably fast on CPU-only systems having at least AVX2 and
2200 MT/s RAM. If you're even more strapped for compute and use things
like Raspberry Pi, then give Phi-2 a spin</p>
<p dir="auto">To get started, try writing yourself the first line of a function. For
example, you might open up a file in your editor named <code>hello.c</code> and
then type:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then place your caret at the end of the line, and press <code>C-c C-k</code> to
hand over control to your LLM, which should generate the rest of the
function implementation for you. Things are also tuned so the LLM is
likely to stop as soon as a function is made. Explanations and other
kind of ELI5 commentary is avoided too.</p>
<p dir="auto">Later on, if you were to write something like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 100;"><pre><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
  <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And ask your LLM to complete that, then your LLM will likely recall
that you two wrote an is_prime() function earlier, even though it's
only considering those two lines in the current instruction. You'll
most likely then see it decide to generate code to print the primes</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reference Implementation</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you've downloaded your LLM (see below) then all you really need is to
copy and paste this code into an Emacs buffer and run <code>M-x eval-buffer</code>.
You'll want to tune the code to your own personal taste. That's why it's
being presented in full as a succinct code example here.</p>

<p dir="auto">Be sure to <code>chmod +x</code> your llamafile executable after you download it.
Then consider placing it on the system path. If you have any trouble
running the llamafile, then see the <a href="#gotchas">Gotchas</a> section.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Cache files</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you decide to switch models, then be sure to delete all the
<code>FILE.cache</code> files that got generated on your local filesystem.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="find . -name \*.cache | xargs rm -f"><pre>find <span>.</span> -name <span>\*</span>.cache <span>|</span> xargs rm -f</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also tune the Emacs LISP code above to just not use prompt
caching at all, by removing those flags. That might have a negative
impact on code completion latency though. On Apple Metal GPU, which has
extremely fast prompt loading, the slowdown might be ~1 second, but for
systems that need CPU inference it could be significantly higher.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gotchas</h2>
<p dir="auto">On macOS with Apple Silicon you need to have Xcode installed for
llamafile to be able to bootstrap itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you use zsh and have trouble running llamafile, try saying <code>sh -c ./llamafile</code>. This is due to a bug that was fixed in zsh 5.9+. The same
is the case for Python <code>subprocess</code>, old versions of Fish, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">On some Linux systems, you might get errors relating to <code>run-detectors</code>
or WINE. This is due to <code>binfmt_misc</code> registrations. You can fix that by
adding an additional registration for the APE file format llamafile
uses:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo wget -O /usr/bin/ape https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/ape-$(uname -m).elf
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ape
sudo sh -c &quot;echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&quot;
sudo sh -c &quot;echo ':APE-jart:M::jartsr::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&quot;"><pre>sudo wget -O /usr/bin/ape https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/ape-<span><span>$(</span>uname -m<span>)</span></span>.elf

<p dir="auto">As mentioned above, on Windows you may need to rename your llamafile by
adding <code>.exe</code> to the filename.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also as mentioned above, Windows also has a maximum file size limit of 4GB
for executables. The LLaVA server executable above is just 30MB shy of
that limit, so it'll work on Windows, but with larger models like
WizardCoder 13B, you need to store the weights in a separate file. An
example is provided above; see "Using llamafile with external weights."</p>
<p dir="auto">On WSL, it's recommended that the WIN32 interop feature be disabled:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo sh -c &quot;echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop&quot;"><pre>sudo sh -c <span><span>"</span>echo -1 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On any platform, if your llamafile process is immediately killed, check
if you have CrowdStrike and then ask to be whitelisted.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported OSes and CPUs</h2>
<p dir="auto">llamafile supports the following operating systems, which require a minimum
stock install:</p>
<ul dir="auto">

AMD CPU, then it needs to be Bulldozer or newer (circa 2011+). If you
have a newer CPU with AVX, or better yet AVX2, then llamafile will
utilize your chipset features to go faster. There is no support for
AVX512+ runtime dispatching yet.</li>
<li>ARM64 microprocessors must have ARMv8a+. This means everything from
Apple Silicon to 64-bit Raspberry Pis will work, provided your weights

<p>A Maersk containership has been hit by a missile in the Red Sea, the U.S. has reported.</p>
<p>The U.S. Central Command said the Singapore-flagged <em>Maersk Hangzhou</em> reported it was struck by a missile while transiting the Southern Red Red Sea at approximately 8:30 p.m. local time on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ship requested assistance and is said to be “seaworthy” with no reported injuries. The&nbsp;<em>USS Gravely</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>USS Laboon</em> responded to the incident, with the&nbsp;<em>USS Gravely</em>&nbsp;successfully shooting down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen.</p>
<p>Maersk confirmed details of the incident in a statement to gCaptain. The vessel was traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait en route from Singapore to Port Suez, Egypt, when the crew observed a “flash” on deck. The vessel and crew are reported safe.</p>
<p>“At approximately 06:30 pm CET, when the vessel was 55nm southwest of Al Hudaydah, Yemen, the crew reported having observed a flash on deck. However, there is no indication of fire onboard the vessel, and we are currently working to ascertain the full details of the incident. The vessel is fully maneuverable and continues the transit north,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Ensuring the safety of our crew is our utmost priority, and all necessary security measures are implemented to protect them,” the statement added.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>In <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/">The birth &amp; death of search engine optimization</a>, Xe suggests</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's a fun experiment to try. Take an open source project such as <code>yt-dlp</code> and try to find it from a very generic term like "youtube downloader". You won't be able to find it because of all of the content farms that try to rank at the top for that term. Even though <code>yt-dlp</code> is probably actually what you want for a tool to download video from YouTube.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More generally, most tech folks I'm connected to seem to think that Google search results are significantly worse than they were ten years ago (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111506788692079608">Mastodon poll</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1730705885037801686">Twitter poll</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@danluu.danluu/post/C0UnBr9vEeY">Threads poll</a>). However, there's a sizable group of vocal folks who claim that search results are still great. E.g., a bluesky thought leader who gets high engagement says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i think the rending of garments about how even google search is terrible now is pretty overblown<sup id="fnref:B"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:B">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect what's going on here is that some people have gotten so used working around bad software that they don't even know they're doing it, reflexively doing the modern equivalent of <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1525988886119186432">hitting ctrl+s all the time in editors, or ctrl+a; ctrl+c when composing anything in a text box</a>. Every adept user of the modern web has a bag of tricks they use to get decent results from queries. From having watched quite a few users interact with computers, that doesn't appear to be normal, even among people who are quite competent in various technical fields, e.g., mechanical engineering<sup id="fnref:M"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:M">2</a></sup>. However, it could be that people who are complaining about bad search result quality are <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111666646509250420">just hopping on the "everything sucks" bandwagon and making totally unsubstantiated comments</a> about search quality.</p>

<p>Since it's fairly easy to try out straightforward, naive, queries, let's try some queries. We'll look at three kinds of queries with five search engines plus ChatGPT and we'll turn off our ad blocker to get <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1564292487744978946">the non-expert browsing experience</a>.</p>

<p>One kind of query is a selected set of representative queries a friend of mine used to set up her new computer. My friend is a highly competent engineer outside of tech and wanted help learning "how to use computers", so I watched her try to set up a computer and pointed out holes in her mental model of how to interact with websites and software.</p>

<p>The second kind of query is queries for the kinds of things I wanted to know in high school where I couldn't find the answer because everyone I asked (teachers, etc.) gave me obviously incorrect answers and I didn't know how to find the right answer. I was able to get the right answer from various textbooks once I got to college and had access to university libraries, but the questions are simple enough that there's no particular reason a high school student shouldn't be able to understand the answers; it's just an issue of finding the answer, so we'll take a look at how easy these answers are to find. The third kind of query is a local query for information I happened to want to get as I was writing this post.</p>

<p>In grading the queries, there's going to be some subjectivity here because, for example, it's not objectively clear if it's better to have moderately relevant results with no scams or very relevant results mixed interspersed with scams that try to install badware or trick you into giving up your credit card info to pay for something you shouldn't pay for. For the purposes of this post, I'm considering scams to be fairly bad, so in that specific example, I'd rate the moderately relevant results above the very relevant results that have scams mixed in. As with my <a href="https://danluu.com/car-safety/">other</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">posts</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/futurist-predictions/">that</a> have some kind of subjective ranking, there's both a short summary as well as a detailed description of results, so you can rank services yourself, if you like.</p>

<p>In the table below, each column is a query (there are more details about what each query is later in the post) and each row is a search engine or ChatGPT. Results are rated (from worst to best) Terrible, Very Bad, Bad, Ok, Good, and Great, with worse results being more red and better results being more blue.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th></th><th>YouTube</th><th>Adblock</th><th>Firefox</th><th>Tire</th><th>CPU</th><th>Snow</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Marginalia</th><td>Ok</td><td>Good</td><td>Ok</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>ChatGPT</th><td>V. Bad</td><td><span color="white">Great</span></td><td>Good</td><td>V. Bad</td><td>V. Bad</td><td>Bad</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mwmbl</th><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Kagi</th><td>Bad</td><td>V. Bad</td><td><span color="white">Great</span></td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td><td>Bad</td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Google</th><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td><td>V. Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td>Bad</td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bing</th><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td><td><span color="white">Great</span></td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td><td>Ok</td><td><span color="white">Terrible</span></td></tr>
<tr>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Marginalia does relatively well by sometimes providing decent but not great answers and then providing no answers or very obviously irrelevant answers to the questions it can't answer, with a relatively low rate of scams, lower than any other search engine (although, for these queries, ChatGPT returns zero scams and Marginalia returns some).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mwmbl lets users directly edit search result rankings. I did this for one query, which would score "Great" if it was scored after my edit, but <a href="https://danluu.com/car-safety/">it's easy to do well on a benchmark when you optimize specifically for the benchmark</a>, so Mwmbl's scores are without my edits to the ranking criteria.</p>

<p>One thing I found interesting about the Google results was that, in addition to Google's noted propensity to return recent results, there was a strong propensity to return recent youtube videos. This caused us to get videos that seem quite useless for anybody, except perhaps the maker of the video, who appears to be attempting to get ad revenue from the video. For example, when searching for "ad blocker", one of the youtube results was a video where the person rambles for 93 seconds about how you should use an ad blocker and then googles "ad blocker extension". They then click on the first result and incorrectly say that "it's officially from Google", i.e., the ad blocker is either made by Google or has some kind of official Google seal of approval, because it's the first result. They then ramble for another 40 seconds as they install the ad blocker. After it's installed, they incorrectly state "this is basically one of the most effective ad blocker [sic] on Google Chrome". The video has 14k views and it appears to be made by someone who has no idea what they're talking about, who's part of the cottage industry of people making videos taking advantage of Google's algorithm prioritizing recent content regardless of quality. We'll discuss other Google quirks in more detail below.</p>

<p>ChatGPT does its usual thing and impressively outperforms its more traditional competitors in one case, does an ok job in another case, refuses to really answer the question in another case, and "hallucinates" nonsense for a number of queries (as usual for ChatGPT, random perturbations can significantly change the results<sup id="fnref:R"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:R">3</a></sup>). It's common to criticize ChatGPT for its hallucinations and, while I don't think that's unfair, <a href="https://danluu.com/customer-service/">as we noted in this 2015, pre-LLM post on AI</a>, I find this general class of criticism to be overrated in that humans and traditional computer systems make the exact same mistakes.</p>

<p>In this case, search engines return various kinds of hallucinated results. In the snow forecast example, we got deliberately fabricated results, one intended to drive ad revenue through shady ads on a fake forecast site, and another intended to trick the user into thinking that the forecast indicates a cold, snowy, winter (the opposite of the actual forecast), seemingly in order to get the user to sign up for unnecessary snow removal services. Other deliberately fabricated results include a site that's intended to look like an objective review site that's actually a fake site designed to funnel you into installing a specific ad blocker, where the ad blocker they funnel you to appears to be a scammy one that tries to get you to pay for ad blocking and doesn't let you unsubscribe, a fake "organic" blog post trying to get you to install a chrome extension that exposes all of your shopping to some service (in many cases, it's not possible to tell if a blog post is a fake or shill post, but in this case, they hosted the fake blog post on the domain for the product and, although it's designed to look like there's an entire blog on the topic, there isn't — it's just this one fake blog post), etc.</p>

<p>There were also many results which don't appear to be deliberately fraudulent and are just run-of-the-mill SEO garbage designed to farm ad clicks. These seem to mostly be pre-LLM sites, so they don't read quite like ChatGPT hallucinations, but they're not fundamentally different. Sometimes the goal of these sites is to get users to click on ads that actually scam the user, and sometimes the goal appears to be to generate clicks to non-scam ads. Search engines also returned many seemingly non-deliberate human hallucinations, where people confidently stated incorrect answers in places where user content is highlighted, like quora, reddit, and stack exchange.</p>

<p>On these queries, even ignoring anything that looks like LLM-generated text, I'd rate the major search engines (Google and Bing) as somewhat worse than ChatGPT in terms of returning various kinds of hallucinated or hallucination-adjacent results. While I don't think concerns about LLM hallucinations are illegitimate, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1557970249948884992">the traditional ecosystem has the problem that the system highly incentivizes putting whatever is most profitable for the software supply chain in front of the user</a> which is, in general, quite different from the best result.</p>

<p>For example, if your app store allows "you might also like" recommendations, the most valuable ad slot for apps about gambling addiction management will be gambling apps. Allowing gambling ads on an addiction management app is too blatantly user-hostile for any company deliberately allow today, but of course companies that make gambling apps will try to game the system to break through the filtering and <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1588289840629833729">they sometimes succeed</a>. And for web search, I just tried this again on the web and one of the two major search engines returned, as a top result, ad-laden SEO blogspam for addiction management. At the top of the page is a multi-part ad, with the top two links being "GAMES THAT PAY REAL MONEY" and "GAMES THAT PAY REAL CASH". In general, I was getting localized results (lots of .ca domains since I'm in Canada), so you may get somewhat different results if you try this yourself.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the best result is a good, free, ad blocker like ublock origin, the top ad slot is worth a lot more to a company that makes an ad blocker designed to trick you into paying for a lower quality ad blocker with a nearly-uncancellable subscription, so the scam ad blocker is going to outbid the free ad blocker for the top ad slots. These kinds of companies also have a lot more resources to spend on direct SEO, as well as indirect SEO activities like marketing so, unless search engines mount a more effective effort to combat the profit motive, the top results will go to paid ad blockers even though the paid ad blockers are generally significantly worse for users than free ad blockers. If you talk to people who work on ranking, a lot of the biggest ranking signals are derived from clicks and engagement, but <a href="https://danluu.com/nothing-works/">this will only drive users to the best results when users are sophisticated enough to know what the best results are, which they generally aren't</a>. Human raters also rate page quality, but this has the exact same problem.</p>

<p>Many Google employees have told me that ads are actually good because they inform the user about options the user wouldn't have otherwise known about, but anyone who tries browsing without an ad blocker will see ads that are various kinds of misleading, ads that try to trick or entrap the user in various ways, by pretending to be a window, or advertising "GAMES THAT PAY REAL CASH" at the top of a page on battling gambling addiction, which has managed to SEO itself to a high ranking on gambling addiction searches. In principle, these problems could be mitigated with enough resources, but we can observe that trillion dollar companies have chosen not to invest enough resources combating SEO, spam, etc., that these kinds of scam ads are rarely seen. Instead, a number of top results are actually ads that direct you to scams.</p>

<p>In their original Page Rank paper, Sergei Brin and Larry Page noted that ad-based search is inherently not incentive aligned with providing good results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is "The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and
risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone
ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the Consumers.</p>

<p>Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious. A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who "deserves" to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. ... This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline’s homepage when the airline’s name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines ... we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.</p>

<p>Of course, Google is now dominated by ads and, despite specifically calling out the insidiousness of user conflating real results with paid results, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1557970259142791168">both Google and Bing have made ads look more and more like real search results</a>, to the point that most users usually won't know that they're clicking on ads and not real search results. By the way, this propensity for users to think that everything is an "organic" search result is the reason that, in this post, results are ordered by the order the appear on the page, so if four ads appear above the first organic result, the four ads will be rank 1-4 and the organic result will be ranked 5. I've heard Google employees say that AMP didn't impact search ranking because it "only" controlled what results went into the "carousel" that appeared above search results, as if inserting a carousel and then a bunch of ads above results, pushing results down below the fold, has no impact on how the user interacts with results. It's also common to see search engines ransoming the top slot for companies, so that companies that don't buy the ad for their own name end up with searches for that company putting their competitors at the top, which is also said to not impact search result ranking, a technically correct claim that's basically meaningless to the median user.</p>

<p>When I tried running the query from the paper, "cellular phone" (no quotes) and, the top result was a Google Store link to buy Google's own Pixel 7, with the rest of the top results being various Android phones sold on Amazon. That's followed by the Wikipedia page for Mobile Phone, and then a series of commercial results all trying to sell you phones or SEO-spam trying to get you to click on ads or buy phones via their links (the next 7 results were commercial, with the next result after that being an ad-laden SEO blogspam page for the definition of  a cell phone with ads of cell phones on it, followed by 3 more commercial results, followed by another ad-laden definition of a phone). The result that Sergei and Larry suggested was a great top result, "The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention", is nowhere to be seen, buried beneath an avalanche of commercial results. On the other side of things, Google has also gotten into the action by buying ads that trick users, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/887724695558205440">such as  paying for an installer to try to trick users into installing Chrome over Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, after looking at the results of our test queries, some questions that come to mind are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How is Marginalia, a search engine built by a single person, so good?</li>
<li>Can Marginalia or another small search engine displace Google for mainstream users?</li>
<li>Can a collection of small search engines provide better results than Google?</li>
<li>Will Mwmbl's user-curation approach work?</li>
<li>Would a search engine like 1996-Metacrawler, which aggregates results from multiple search engines, ChatGPT, Bard, etc., significantly outperform Google?</li>
</ul>

<p>The first question could easily be its own post and this post is already 17000 words, so maybe we'll examine it another time. We've previously noted that <a href="https://danluu.com/people-matter/">some</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/why-benchmark/">individuals</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1586508706774388736">can</a> be very productive, but of course the details vary in each case.</p>

<p>On the second question, <a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">we looked at a similar question in 2016</a>, both the general version, "I could reproduce this billion dollar company in a weekend", as well as specific comments about how open source software would make it trivial to surpass Google any day now, such as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, most any technology you need is indeed available in OSS and in state of the art. Allow me to plug meta64.com (my own company) as an example. I am using Lucene to index large numbers of news articles, and provide search into them, by searching a Lucene index generated by simple scraping of RSS-crawled content. I would claim that the Lucene technology is near optimal, and this search approach I'm using is nearly identical to what a Google would need to employ. The only true technology advantage Google has is in the sheer number of servers they can put online, which is prohibitively expensive for us small guys. But from a software standpoint, Google will be overtaken by technologies like mine over the next 10 years I predict.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scaling things is always a challenge but as long as Lucene keeps getting better and better there is going to be a point where Google's advantage becomes irrelevant and we can cluster Lucene nodes and distribute search related computations on top and then use something like Hadoop to implement our own open source ranking algorithms. We're not there yet but technology only gets better over time and the choices we as developers make also matter. Even though Amazon and Google look like unbeatable giants now don't discount what incremental improvements can accomplish over a long stretch of time and in technology it's not even that long a stretch. It wasn't very long ago when Windows was the reigning champion. Where is Windows now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that 2016 post, we saw that people who thought that open source solutions were set to surpass Google any day now appeared to have no idea how many hard problems must be solved to make a mainstream competitor to Google, including real-time indexing of rapidly-updated sites, like Twitter, newspapers, etc., as well as table-stakes level NLP, which is extremely non-trivial. Since 2016, these problems have gotten significantly harder as there's more real-time content to index and users expect much better NLP. The number of things people expect out of their search engine has increased as well, making the problem harder still, so it still appears to be quite difficult to displace Google as a mainstream search engine for, say, a billion users.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to make a useful search engine for a small number of users, that seems easier than ever because Google returns worse results than it used to for many queries. In our test queries, we saw a number of queries where many or most top results were filled with SEO garbage, a problem that was significantly worse than it was a decade ago, even before the rise of LLMs and that continues to get worse. I typically use search engines in a way that doesn't run into this, but when I look at what "normal" users query or if I try naive queries myself, as I did in this post, most results are quite poor, which didn't used to be true.</p>

<p>Another place Google now falls over for me is when finding non-popular pages. I often find that, when I want to find a web page and I correctly remember the contents of the page, even if I do an exact string search, Google won't return the page. Either the page isn't indexed, or the page is effectively not indexed because it lives in some slow corner of the index that doesn't return in time. In order to find the page, I have to remember some text in a page that links to the page (often many clicks removed from the actual page, not just one, so I'm really remembering a page that links to a page that links to a page that links to a page that links to a page and then using archive.org to traverse the links that are now dead), search for that, and then manually navigate the link graph to get to the page. This basically never happened when I searched for something in 2005 and rarely happened in 2015, but this now happens a large fraction of the time I'm looking for something. Even in 2015, Google wasn't actually comprehensive. Just for example, Google search didn't index every tweet. But, at the time, I found Google search better at searching for tweets than Twitter search and I basically never ran across a tweet I wanted to find that wasn't indexed by Google. But now, most of the tweets I want to find aren't returned by Google search<sup id="fnref:T"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:T">4</a></sup>, even when I search for "[exact string from tweet] site:twitter.com". In the original Page Rank paper, Sergei and Larry said "Because humans can only type or speak a finite amount, and as computers continue improving, text indexing will scale even better than it does now." (and that, while machines can generate an effectively infinite amount of content, just indexing human-generated content seems very useful). Pre-LLM, Google certainly had the resources to index every tweet as well as every human generated utterance on every public website, but they seem to have chosen to devote their resources elsewhere and, relative to its size, the public web appears less indexed than ever, or at least less indexed than it's been since the very early days of web search.</p>

<p>Back when Google returned decent results for simple queries and indexed almost any public page I'd want to find, it would've been very difficult for an independent search engine to return results that I find better than Google's. Marginalia in 2016 would've been nothing more than a curiosity for me since Google would give good-enough results for basically anything where Marginalia returns decent results, and Google would give me the correct result in queries for every obscure page I searched for, something that would be extremely difficult for a small engine. But now that Google effectively doesn't index many pages I want to search for, the relatively small indices that independent search engines have doesn't make them non-starters for me and some of them return less SEO garbage than Google, making them better for my use since I generally don't care about real-time results, don't need fancy NLP (and find that much of it actually makes search results worse for me), don't need shopping integrated into my search results, rarely need image search with understanding of images, etc.</p>

<p>On the question of whether or not a collection of small search engines can provide better results than Google for a lot of users, I don't think this is much of a question because the answer has been a resounding "yes" for years. However, many people don't believe this is so. For example, a Google TLM replied to the bluesky thought leader at the top of this post with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somebody tried argue that if the search space were more competitive, with lots of little providers instead of like three big ones, then somehow it would be *more* resistant to ML-based SEO abuse.</p>

<p>And... look, if *google* can't currently keep up with it, how will Little Mr. 5% Market Share do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>presumably referring to arguments like <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/algorithm-monocultures/">Hillel Wayne's "Algorithm Monocultures"</a>, to which our bluesky thought leader replied</p>

<blockquote>
<p>like 95% of the time, when someone claims that some small, independent company can do something hard better than the market leader can, it’s just cope. economies of scale work pretty well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, <a href="https://danluu.com/nothing-works/">we looked at some examples where the market leader provides a poor product and various other players, often tiny, provide better products</a> and in a future post, we'll look at how economies of scale and diseconomies of scale interact in various areas for tech but, for this post, suffice it to say that it's clear that despite the common "econ 101" <a href="https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/">cocktail party idea</a> that economies of scale should be the dominant factor for search quality, that doesn't appear to be the case when we look at actual results.</p>

<p>On the question of whether or not Mwmbl's user-curated results can work, I would guess no, or at least not without a lot more moderation. Just browsing to Mwmbl shows the last edit to ranking was by user "betest", who added some kind of blogspam as the top entry for "RSS". It appears to be possible to revert the change, but there's no easily findable way to report the change or the user as spammy.</p>

<p>On the question of whether or not something like Metacrawler, which aggregated results from multiple search engines,  would produce superior results today, that's arguably irrelevant since it would either be impossible to legally run as a commercial service or require prohibitive licensing fees, but it seems plausible that, from a technical standpoint, a modern metacrawler would be fairly good today. Metacrawler quickly became irrelevant because Google returned significantly better results than you would get by aggregating results from other search engines, but it doesn't seem like that's the case today.</p>

<p>Going back to the debate between folks like Xe, who believe that straightforward search queries are inundated with crap, and our thought leader, who believes that "the rending of garments about how even google search is terrible now is pretty overblown", it appears that Xe is correct. Although Google doesn't publicly provide the ability to see what was historically returned for queries, many people remember when straightforward queries generally returned good results. One of the reasons Google took off so quickly in the 90s, even among expert users of AltaVista, who'd become very adept at adding all sorts of qualifiers to queries to get good results, was that you didn't have to do that with Google. But we've now come full circle and we need to add qualifiers, restrict our search to specific sites, etc., to get good results from Google on what used to be simple queries.</p>

<p><i>Thanks to Laurence Tratt, Heath Borders, Viktor Lofgren (who, BTW, I didn't know before writing this post — I only reached out to him to discuss the Marginalia search results after running the queries), Misha Yagudin, @hpincket@fosstodon.org, and Yossi Kreinin for comments/corrections/discussion</i></p>

<h2 id="appendix-other-search-engines">Appendix: Other search engines</h2>

<ul>
<li>DuckDuckGo: in the past, when I've compared DDG to Bing while using an ad blocker, the results have been very similar. I also tried DDG here and, removing the Bing ads, the results aren't as similar as they used to be, but they were still similar enough that it didn't seem worth listing DDG results.</li>
<li>wiby.me: Like Marginalia, this is another search engine made for finding relatively obscure results. I tried four of the above queries on wiby and the results were interesting, in that they were really different than what I got from any other search engine, but wiby didn't return relevant results for the I tried.</li>
<li>searchmysite.net: Somewhat relevant results for some queries, but not as relevant as Marginalia. Many fewer scams and ad-laden pages than Google, Bing, and Kagi.</li>
<li>indieweb-search.jamesg.blog: seemed to be having an outage. "Your request could not be processed due to a server error." for every query.</li>
<li>Teclis: The search box is still there, but any query results in "Teclis.com is closed due to bot abuse. Teclis results are still available through Kagi's search results, explicitly through the 'Non-commercial Web' lens and also as an API.". A note on the front page reads "Teclis results are disabled on the site due to insane amount of bot traffic (99.9% traffic were bots)."</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appendix-queries-that-return-good-results">Appendix: queries that return good results</h2>

<p>I think that most programmers are likely to be able to get good results to every query, except perhaps the tire width vs. grip query, so here's how I found an ok answer to the tire query:</p>

<p>I tried a youtube search, since <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111441790762754806">a lot of the best car-related content is now youtube</a>. A youtube video whose title claims to answer the question (the video doesn't actually answer the question) has a comment recommending Carroll Smith's book "Tune To Win". The comment claims that chapter 1 explains why wider tires have more grip, but I couldn't find an explanation anywhere in the book. Chapter 1 does note that race cars typically run wider tires than passenger cars and that passenger cars are moving towards having wider tires and it make some comments about slip angle that give a sketch of an intuitive reason for why you'd end up with better cornering with a wider contact patch, but I couldn't find a comment that explains differences in braking. Also, the book notes that the primary reason for the wider contact patch is that it (indirectly) allows for more less heat buildup, which then lets you design tires that operate over a narrower temperature range, which allows for softer rubber. That may be true, but it doesn't explain much of the observed behavior one might wonder about.</p>

<p>Tune to Win recommends Kummer's The Unified Theory of Tire and Rubber Friction and Hays and Brooke's (actually Browne, but Smith incorrectly says Brooke) The Physics of Tire Traction. Neither of these really explained what's happening either, but looking for similar books turned up Milliken and Millken's Race Car Vehicle Dynamics, which also didn't really explain why but seemed closer to having an explanation. Looking for books similar to Race Car Vehicle Dynamics turned up Guiggiani's The Science of Vehicle Dynamics, which did get at how to think about and model a number of related factors. The last chapter of Guiggiani's book refers to something called the "brush model" (of tires) and searching for "brush model tire width" turned up a reference to Pacejka's Tire and Vehicle Dynamics, which does start to explain why wider tires have better grip and what kind of modeling of tire and vehicle dynamics you need to do to explain easily observed tire behavior.</p>

<p>As we've noted, people have different tricks for getting good results so, if you have a better way of getting a good result here, I'd be interested in hearing about it. But note that, basically every time I have a post that notes that something doesn't work, the most common suggestion will be to do something that's commonly suggested that doesn't work, even though the post explicitly notes that the commonly suggested thing doesn't work. For example, the most common comment I receive about <a href="https://danluu.com/file-consistency/">this post on filesystem correctness</a> is that you can get around all of this stuff by doing the rename trick, even though the post explicitly notes that this doesn't work, explains why it doesn't work, and references a paper which discusses why it doesn't work. A few years later, <a href="https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/">I gave an expanded talk on the subject</a>, where I noted that people kept suggesting this thing that doesn't work and the most common comment I get on the talk is that you don't need to bother with all of this stuff because you can just do the rename trick. If you have a suggestion for the reason wider tires have better grip or for a search which turns up an explanation, please consider making sure that the explanation is not <a href="#why-do-wider-tires-have-better-grip">one of the standard incorrect explanations noted in this post and that the explanation can account for all of the behavior that one must be able to account for if one is explaining this phenomenon</a>.</p>

<p>On how to get good results for other queries, since this post is already 17000 words, I'll leave that for a future post on how expert vs. non-expert computer users interact with computers.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-summary-of-query-results">Appendix: summary of query results</h2>

<p>For each question, answers are ordered from best to worst, with the metric being my subjective impression of how good the result is. These queries were mostly run in November 2023, although a couple were run in mid-December. When I'm running queries, I very rarely write natural language queries myself. However, normal users often write natural language queries, so I arbitrarily did the "Tire" and "Snow" queries as natural queries. Continuing with the theme of running simple, naive, queries, we used the free version of ChatGPT for this post, which means the queries were run through ChatGPT 3.5.</p>

<p>For the search engines, all queries were run in a fresh incognito window with cleared cookies, with the exception of Kagi, which doesn't allow logged-out searches. For Kagi, the queries were done with a fresh account with no custom personalization or filters, although they were done in sequence with the same account, so it's possible some kind of personalized ranking was applied to the later queries based on the clicks in the earlier queries. These queries were done in Vancouver, BC, which seems to have applied some kind of localized ranking on some search engines.</p>

<li>Marginalia: no results</li>
<li>ChatGPT: incorrect results, but when I accidentally prepended my question with "User\n", then it returned a link to the right website (but in a way that would make it quite difficult to navigate to a decent result), so perhaps a slightly different prompt would pseudo-randomly cause a ok result here?</li>
<li>Mwmbl: a bunch of obviously irrelevant results</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Very bad results: none</li>
<li>Terrible results (links to deliberately faked forecast results):

<ul>
<li>Bing: mostly irrelevant results. The top seemingly-relevant result is the 5th link, but it appears to be some kind of scam site that fabricates fake weather forecasts and makes money by serving ads on the heavily SEO'd site</li>
<li>Kagi: top 4 results are from the scam forecast site that's Bing's 5th link</li>
<li>Google: mostly irrelevant results and the #1 result is a fake answer from a local snow removal company that projects significant snow and cold weather in an attempt to get you to unnecessarily buy snow removal service for the year. Other results are SEO'd garbage that's full of ads

<h2 id="appendix-detailed-query-results">Appendix: detailed query results</h2>

<h3 id="download-youtube-videos">Download youtube videos</h3>

<p>For our first query, we'll search "download youtube videos" (Xe's suggested search term, "youtube downloader" returns very similar results). The ideal result is <code>yt-dlp</code> or a thin, free, wrapper around <code>yt-dlp</code>. <code>yt-dlp</code> is a fork of <code>youtube-dlc</code>, which is a now defunct fork of <code>youtube-dl</code>, which seems to have very few updates nowadays.. A link to one of these older downloaders also seems ok if they still work.</p>

<h4 id="google">Google</h4>

<ol>
<li>Some youtube downloader site. Has lots of assurances that the website and the tool are safe because they've been checked by "Norton SafeWeb". Interacting with the site at all prompts you to install a browser extension and enable notifications. Trying to download any video gives you a full page pop-over for extension installation for something called CyberShield. There appears to be no way to dismiss the popover without clicking on something to try to install it. After going through the links but then choosing not to install CyberShield, no video downloads. Googling "cybershield chrome extension" returns a knowledge card with "Cyber Shield is a browser extension that claims to be a popup blocker but instead displays advertisements in the browser. When installed, this extension will open new tabs in the browser that display advertisements trying to sell software, push fake software updates, and tech support scams.", so CyberShield appears to be badware.</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site causes a pop-up prompting you to download their browser extension. Putting a video URL in causes a pop-up to some scam site but does also cause the video to download, so it seems to be possible to download youtube videos here if you're careful not to engage with the scams the site tries to trick you into interacting with</li>
<li>PC Magazine listicle on ways to download videos from youtube. Top recommendations are paying for youtube downloads, VLC (which they note didn't work when they tried it), some $15/yr software, some $26/yr software, "FlixGrab", then a warning about how the downloader websites are often scammy and they don't recommend any downloader website. The article has more than one ad per suggestion.</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with shady pop-overs that try to trick you into clicking on ads before you even interact with the page</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with pop-ups that try to trick you into clicking on scam ads</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with pop-ups that try to trick you into clicking on scam ads, e.g., "Samantha 24, vancouver | I want sex, write to WhatsApp | Close / Continue". Clicking anything (any button, or anywhere else on the site tries to get you to install something called "Adblock Ultimate"</li>
<li>ZDNet ZDnet listicle. First suggestion is clipware, which apparently bundles a bunch of malware/adware/junkware with the installer: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/w9o1by/warning_about_clipgrab/">https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/w9o1by/warning_about_clipgrab/</a>. The listicle is full of ads and has an autoplay video</li>
<li>[YouTube video] Over 2 minutes of ads followed by a video on how to buy youtube premium (2M views on video)</li>
<li>[YouTube video] Video that starts off by asking users to watch the whole video (some monetization thing?). The video tries to funnel you to some kind of software to download videos that costs money</li>
<li>[YouTube video] PC Magazine video saying that you probably don't "have to" download videos since you can use the share button, and then suggests reading their story (the one in result #3) on how to download videos</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with scam ads. Interacting with the site at all tries to get you to install "Adblock Ultimate"</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with pop-ups that try to trick you into clicking on scam ads</li>
<li>Some youtube downloader site with scam ads</li>
</ol>

<p>Out of 10 "normal" results, we have 9 that, in one way or another, try to get you to install badware or are linked to some other kind of ad scam. One page doesn't do this, but it also doesn't suggest the good, free, option for downloading youtube videos and instead suggests a number of paid solutions. We also had three youtube videos, all of which seem to be the video equivalent of SEO blogspam. Interestingly, we didn't get a lot of ads from Google itself <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/823623691246239744">despite that happening the last time I tried turning off my ad blocker to do some Google test queries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="bing">Bing</h4>

<ol>
<li>Some youtube downloader site. This is google (2), which has ads for scam sites</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER ... "Recommended to you based on what's popular"] Some youtube download site, not one we saw from google. Site has multiple pulsing ads and bills itself as "50% off" for Christmas (this search was done in mid-November). Trying to download any video pulls up a fake progress bar with a "too slow? Try [our program] link". After a while, a link to download the video appears, but it's a trick, and when you click it, it tries to install "oWebster Search extension". Googling "oWebster Search extension" indicates that it's badware that hijacks your browser to show ads. Two of the top three hits are how to install the extension and the rest of the top hits are how to remove this badware. Many of the removal links are themselves scams that install other badware. After not installing this badware, clicking the download link again results in a pop-over that tries to get you to install the site's software. If you dismiss the pop-over and click the download link again, you just get the pop-over link again, so this site appears to be a pure scam that doesn't let you download videos</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER]. Interacting with the site pops up fake ads with photos of attractive women who allegedly want to chat with you. Clicking the video download button tries to get you to install a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3027#issuecomment-330077439">copycat ad blocker</a> that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/h8pdar/this_ad_blocker_that_gives_you_ads/">displays extra pop-over ads</a>. The site does seem to actually give you a video download, though</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER] Same as (3)</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER] Same as Google (1) (that NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site that tries to scam you)</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER] A site that converts videos to MP4. I didn't check to see if the site works or is just a scam as the site doesn't even claim to let you download youtube videos</li>
<li>Google (1), again. That NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site that tries to scam you.</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER] A link to youtube.com (the main page)</li>
<li>[EXPLORE FURTHER] Some youtube downloader site with a popover that tries to trick you into clicking on an ad. Closing that reveals 12 more ads. There's a scam ad that's made to look like a youtube downloader button. If you scroll past that, there's a text box and a button for trying to download a youtube video. Entering a valid URL results in an error saying there's no video that URL.</li>
<li>Gigantic card that actually has a download button. The download button is fake and just takes you to the site. The site loudly proclaims that the software is not adware, spyware, etc.. Quite a few internet commenters note that their antivirus software tags this software as malware. A lot of comments also indicate that the software doesn't work very well but sometimes works. The site for the software has a an embedded youtube video, which displays "This video has been removed for violating YouTube's Terms of Service". Oddly, the download links for mac and Linux are not for this software and in fact don't download anything at all and are installation instructions for <code>youtube-dl</code>; perhaps this makes sense if the windows version is actually malware. The windows download button takes you to a page that lets you download a windows executable. There's also a link to some kind of ad-laden page that tries to trick you into clicking on ads that look like normal buttons</li>
<li>PC magazine listicle</li>
<li>An ad for some youtube downloader program that claims "345,764,132 downloads today"; searching the name of this product on reddit seems to indicate that it's malware</li>
<li>Ad for some kind of paid downloader software</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the end of the first page.</p>

<p>Like Google, no good results and a lot of scams and software that may not be a scam but is some kind of lightweight skin around an open source project that charges you instead of letting you use the software for free.</p>

<h4 id="marginalia">Marginalia</h4>

<ol>
<li>12-year old answer suggesting youtube-dl, which links to a URL which has been taken down and replaced with "Due to a ruling of the Hamburg Regional Court, access to this website is blocked."</li>
<li>Some SEO'd article, like you see on normal search engines</li>
<li>Leawo YouTube Downloader (I don't know what this is, but a quick search at least doesn't make it immediately obvious that this is some kind of badware, unlike the Google and Bing results)</li>
<li>Some SEO'd listicle, like you see on normal search engines</li>
<li>Bug report for some random software</li>
<li>Some random blogger's recommendation for "4K Video Downloader". A quick search seems to indicate that this isn't a scam or badware, but it does lock some features behind a paywall, and is therefore worse than <code>yt-dlp</code> or some free wrapper around <code>yt-dlp</code></li>
<li>A blog post on how to install and use <code>yt-dlp</code>. The blogpost notes that it used to be about <code>youtube-dl</code>, but has been updated to <code>yt-dlp</code>.</li>
<li>More software that charges you for something you can get for free, although searching for this software on reddit turns up cracks for it</li>
<li>A listicle with bizarrely outdated recommendations, like RealPlayer. The entire blog seems to be full of garbage-quality listicles.</li>
<li>A script to download youtube videos for something called "keyboard maestro", which seems useful if you already use that software, but seems like a poor solution to this problem if you don't already use this software.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best results by a large margin. The first link doesn't work, but you can easily get to <code>youtube-dl</code> from the first link. I certainly wouldn't try Leawo YouTube Downloader, but at least it's not so scammy that searching for the name of the project mostly returns results about how the project is some kind of badware or a scam, which is better than we got from Google or Bing. And we do get a recommendation with <code>yt-dlp</code>, with instructions in the results that's just a blog post from someone who wants to help people who are trying to download youtube videos.</p>

<h4 id="kagi">Kagi</h4>

<ul>
<li>1. That NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site at all prompts you to install a browser extension and enable notifications. Trying to download any video gives you a full page pop-over for extension installation for something called CyberShield. There appears to be no way to dismiss the popover without clicking on something to try to install it</li>
<li>2. Another link to that NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site. For some reason, this one is tagged with "Dec 20, 2003", apparently indicating that the site is from Dec 20th 2003, although that's quite wrong.</li>
<li>3. Some youtube downloader site. Selecting any video to download pushes you to a site with scam ads.</li>
<li>4. Some youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site at all pops up multiple ads that link to scams and the page wants to enable notifications. A pop-up then appears on top of the ads that says "Ad removed" with a link for details. This is a scam link to another ad.</li>
<li>5. Another link to the above site</li>
<li>6-7. Under a subsection titled "Interesting Finds", there are links to two github repos. One is for transcribing youtube videos to text and the other is for using Google Takeout to backup photos from google photos or your own youtube channel</li>
<li>8. Some youtube downloader site.</li>
<li>9-13. Under a subsection titled "Blast from the Past", 4 irrelevant links and a link to youtube-dl's github page, but the 2010 version at archive.org</li>
<li>14. SEO blogspam for youtube help. Has a link that's allegedly for a "Greasemonkey script for downloading YouTube videos", but the link just goes to a page with scammy ads</li>
<li>15. Some software that charges you $5/mo to download videos from youtube</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mwmbl">Mwmbl</h4>

<ol>
<li>Some youtube video downloader site, but one that no other search engine returned. There's a huge ad panel that displays "503 NA - Service Deprecating". The download link does nothing except for pop up some other ad panes that then disappear, leaving just the 503 "ad".</li>
<li>$20 software for downloading youtube videos</li>
<li>2016 blog post on how to install and use <code>youtube-dl</code>. Sidebar has two low quality ads which don't appear to be scams and the main body has two ads interspersed, making this extremely low on ads compared to analogous results we've seen from large search engines</li>
<li>Some youtube video download site. Has a giant banner claiming that it's "the only YouTube Downloader that is 100% ad-free and contains no popups.", which is probably not true, but the site does seem to be ad free and not have pop-ups. Download link seems to actually work.</li>
<li>Youtube video on how to install and use <code>youtube-dlg</code> (a GUI wrapper for <code>youtube-dl</code>) on Linux (this query was run from a Mac).</li>
<li>Link to what was a 2007 blogpost on how to download youtube videos, which automatically forwards to a 2020 ad-laden SEO blogspam listicle with bad suggestions. Article has two autoplay videos. Archive.org shows that the 2007 blog post had some reasonable options in it for the time, so this wasn't always a bad result.</li>
<li>A blog post on a major site that's actually a sponsored post trying to get you to a particular video downloader. Searching for comments on this on reddit indicate that users view the app as a waste of money that doesn't work. The site is also full of scammy and misleading ads for other products. E.g., I tried clicking on an ad that purports to save you money on "products". It loaded a fake "checking your computer" animation that supposedly checked my computer for compatibility with the extension and then another fake checking animation, after which I got a message saying that my computer is compatible and I'm eligible to save money. All I have to do is install this extension. Closing that window opens a new tab that reads "Hold up! Do you actually not want automated savings at checkout" with the options "Yes, Get Coupons" and "No, Don't Save". Clicking "No, Don't Save" is actually an ad that takes you back to a link that tries to get you to install a chrome extension.</li>
<li>That "Norton Safe Web" youtube downloader site, except that the link is wrong and is to the version of the site that purports to download instagram videos instead of the one that purports to download youtube videos.</li>
<li>Link to Google help explaining how you can download youtube videos that you personally uploaded</li>
<li>SEO blogspam. It immediately has a pop-over to get you to subscribe to their newsletter. Closing that gives you another pop-over with the options "Subscribe" and "later". Clicking "later" does actually dismiss the 2nd pop-over. After closing the pop-overs, the article has instructions on how to install some software for windows. Searching for reviews of the software returns comments like "This is a PUP/PUA that can download unwanted applications to your pc or even malicious applications."</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically the same as Google or Bing.</p>

<h4 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h4>

<p>Since ChatGPT expects more conversational queries, we'll use the prompt "How can I download youtube videos?"</p>

<p>The first attempt, on a Monday at 10:38am PT  returned "Our systems are a bit busy at the moment, please take a break and try again soon.". The second attempt returned an answer saying that one should not download videos without paying for YouTube Premium, but if you want to, you can use third-party apps and websites.  Following up with the question "What are the best third-party apps and websites?" returned another warning that you shouldn't use third-party apps and websites, followed by</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't endorse or provide information on specific third-party apps or websites for downloading YouTube videos. It's essential to use caution and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when it comes to online content.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ad-blocker">ad blocker</h3>

<p>For our next query, we'll try "ad blocker". We'd like to get <code>ublock origin</code>. Failing that, an ad blocker that, by default, blocks ads. Failing that, something that isn't a scam and also doesn't inject extra ads or its own ads. Although what's best may change at any given moment, comparisons I've seen that don't stack the deck have <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Performance-benchmark-when-using-an-adblocker-on-the-desktop-version-of-Top150_fig1_318330749">often seemed to show that ublock origin has the best or among the best performance</a>, and ublock origin is free and blocks ads.</p>

<h4 id="google-1">Google</h4>

<li>"AdBlock — best ad blocker". Below the fold, notes "AdBlock participates in the Acceptable Ads program, so unobtrusive ads are not blocked", so this doesn't block all ads.</li>
<li>Adblock Plus | The world's #1 free ad blocker. Pages notes "Acceptable Ads are allowed by default to support websites", so this also does not block all ads by default</li>
<li>AdBlock. Page notes that " Since 2015, we have participated in the Acceptable Ads program, where publishers agree to ensure their ads meet certain criteria. Ads that are deemed non-intrusive are shown by default to AdBlock users", so this doesn't block all ads</li>
<li>"Adblock Plus - free ad blocker", same as (2), doesn't block all ads</li>
<li>"AdGuard — World's most advanced adblocker!" Page tries to sell you on some kind of paid software, "AdGuard for Mac". Searching for AdGuard turns up a post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/comments/16whmsy/is_there_an_adblocker_for_adguards_adblocker_that/">from this person looking for an ad blocker that blocks ads injected by AdGuard</a>.

[after installing, as a payment screen pops up asking you to pay $30 or a monthly or annual fee]"</li>
<li>"AdBlock for Mobile" on the App Store. It's rated 3.2* on the iOS store. Lots of reviews indicate that it doesn't really work</li>
<li>MalwareBytes ad blocker. A quick search indicates that it doesn't block all ads (unclear if that's deliberate or due to bugs)</li>

<li>[ad] "#1 Best Free Ad Blocker (2024) - 100% Free Ad Blocker." Immediately seems scammy in that it has a fake year (this query was run in mid-November 2023).

</ol>

<p>No links to ublock origin. Some links to scams, though not nearly as many as when trying to get a youtube downloader. Lots of links to ad blockers that deliberately only block some ads by default.</p>

<h4 id="bing-1">Bing</h4>

<ul>
<li>1. [ad] "Automatic Ad Blocker | 100% Free &amp; Easy Download". [link is actually to avast secure browser, so an entire browser and not an ad blocker; from a quick search, this appears to be a wrapper around chromium that [has a history of being less secure than just running chromium](https://palant.info/2020/01/13/pwning-avast-secure-browser-for-fun-and-profit/) [which collects an unusually large amount of information from users](https://palant.info/2019/10/28/avast-online-security-and-avast-secure-browser-are-spying-on-you/)].</li>
<li>2. [ad]  "#1 Best Free Ad Blocker (2023) | 100% Free Ad Blocker". Has a pop-over nag window when you mouse over to the URL bar asking you to install it instead of navigating away. Something called TOTAL ad block. Apparently tries to get to sign up for a subscription [and then makes it very difficult to unsubscribe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/1412m7l/total_adblock_peoples_experiencesopinions/) (apparently, you can't cancel without a phone call, and when you call and tell them to cancel, they still won't do it unless you threaten to issue a chargeback or block the payment from the bank)</li>
<li>3. [ad] "Best Ad Blocker (2023) | 100% Free Ad Blocker". Seems to be a fake review site that reviews various ad blockers; ublock origin is listed as #5 with 3.5 stars. TOTAL ad block is listed as #1 with 5 stars, is the only 5 stars ad blocker, has a banner that shows that it's the "#1 Free Ad Blocker", is award winning, etc.
<br>
If you then click the link to ublock origin, it takes you to a page that "shows" that ublock origin has 0 stars on trustpilot. There are multiple big buttons that say "click to start blocking ads" that try to get you to install TOTAL ad block. In the bottom right, in what looks like an ad slot, there's an image that says "visit site" for ublock origin. The link doesn't take you to ublock origin and instead takes you a site for [the fake ublock origin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/).
</li><li>4. [ad] "AVG Free Antivirus 2023 | 100% Free, Secure Download". This at least doesn't pretend to be an ad blocker of any kind.</li>
<li>5. [Explore content from adblockplus.org] A link to the adblock plus blog.</li>
<li>6. [Explore content from adblockplus.org] A link to a list of adblock plus features.</li>
<li>7. "Adblock Plus | The world's #1 free ad blocker". </li>
<li>8-13. Sublinks to various pages on the Adblock Plus site.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're now three screens down from the result, so the equivalent of the above google results is just a bunch of ads and then links to one website. The note that something is an ad is much more subtle than I've seen on any other site. Given <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/823624273516335104">what we know about when users confuse ads with organic search results</a>, it's likely that most users don't realize that the top results are ads and think that the links to scam ad blockers or the fake review site that tries to funnel you into installing a scam ad blocker are organic search results.</p>

<h4 id="marginalia-1">Marginalia</h4>

<ol>
<li>"Is ad-blocker software permissible?" from judaism.stackexchange.com</li>
<li>Blogspam for Ghosterty. Ghostery's pricing page notes that you have to pay for "No Private Sponsored Links", so it seems like some features are behind a pay wall. Wikipedia says "Since July 2018, with version 8.2, Ghostery shows advertisements of its own to users", but it seems like this might be opt-in?</li>
<li><a href="https://shouldiblockads.com/">https://shouldiblockads.com/</a>. Explains why you might want to block ads. First recommendation is ublock origin</li>
<li>"What’s the best ad blocker for you? - Firefox Add-ons Blog". First recommendation is ublock origin. Also provides what appears to be accurate information about other ad blockers.</li>

<li>Fairphone forum discussion on whether or not one should install an ad blocker.</li>
<li>SEO site blogspam (as in, the site is an SEO optimization site and this is blogspam designed to generate backlinks and funnel traffic to the site).</li>
</ol>

<p>Probably the best result we've seen so far, in that the third and fourth results suggest ublock origin and the first result is very clearly not an ad blocker. It's unfortunate that the second result is blogspam for Ghostery, but this is still better than we see from Google and Bing.</p>

<h4 id="mwmbl-1">Mwmbl</h4>

<ol>
<li>A bitly link to a "thinkpiece" on ad blocking from a VC thought leader.</li>
<li>A link to cryptojackingtest, which forwards to Opera (the browser).</li>
<li>A link to ghostery.</li>
<li>Another link to ghostery.</li>
<li>A link to something called 1blocker, which appears to be a paid ad blocker. Searching for reviews turns up comments like "I did 1blocker free trial and forgot to cancel so it signed me up for annual for $20 [sic]" (but comments indicate that the ad blocker does work).</li>
<li>Blogspam for Ad Guard. There's a banner ad offering 40% off this ad blocker.</li>
<li>An extremely ad-laden site that appears to be in the search results because it contains the text "ad blocker detected" if you use an ad blocker (I don't see this text on loading the page, but it's in the page preview on Mwmbl). The first page is literally just ads with a "read more" button. Clicking "read more" takes you to a different page that's full of ads that also has the cartoon, which is the "content".</li>
<li>Another site that appears to be in the search results because it contains the text "ad blocker detected".</li>
<li>Malwarebytes ad blocker, which doesn't appear to work.</li>
<li>HN comments for article on youtube ad blocker crackdown. Scrolling to the 41st comment returns a recommendation for ublock origin.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mwmbl lets users suggest results, so I tried signing up to add ublock origin. Gmail put the sign-up email into my spam folder. After adding ublock origin to the search results, it's now the #1 result for "ad blocker" when I search logged out, from an incognito window and all other results are pushed down by one. As mentioned above, the score for Mwmbl is from before I edited the search results and not after.</p>

<ul>

<li>12. "AdBlock — best ad blocker".</li>
<li>13. "Adblock Plus - free ad blocker".</li>
<li>14. "YouTube’s Ad Blocker Crackdown", a blog post that quotes and links to discussions of people talking about the titular topic.</li>
<li>15-18. Under a section titled "Interesting Finds", three articles about youtube's crackdown on ad blockers. One has a full page pop-over trying to get you to install TOTAL Adblock with "Close" and "Open" buttons. The "Close" button does nothing and clicking any link or the open button takes to a page advertising TOTAL adblock. There appears to be no way to dismiss the ad and read the actual article without doing something like going to developer tools and deleting the ad elements. The fourth article is titled "The FBI now recommends using an ad blocker when searching the web" and 100% of the above the fold content is the header plus a giant ad. Scrolling down, there are a lot more ads.</li>
<li>19. "AdBlock".</li>
<li>20. Another link from the Adblock site, "Ad Blocker for Chrome - Download and Install AdBlock for Chrome Now!".</li>
<li>21-25. Under a section titled "Blast from the Past", optimal.com ad blocker, a medium article on how to subvert adblock, a blog post from a Mozillan titled "Why Ad Blockers Work" that's a response to Ars Technica's "Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love", "Why You Need a Network-Wide Ad-Blocker (Part 1)", and "A Popular Ad Blocker Also Helps the Ad Industry", subtitled "Millions of people use the tool Ghostery to block online tracking technology—some may not realize that it feeds data to the ad industry."</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar quality to Google and Bing. Maybe halfway in between in terms of the number of links to scams.</p>

<h4 id="chatgpt-1">ChatGPT</h4>

<p>Here, we tried the prompt. <code>How do I install the best ad blocker?</code></p>

<p>First suggestion is ublock origin. Second suggestion is adblock plus. This seems like the best result by a significant margin.</p>

<p>Mostly good links, but 2 out of the top 10 links are scams. And <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/822739582177288192">we didn't have a repeat of this situation I saw in 2017, where Google paid to get ranked above Firefox in a search for Firefox</a>. For search queries where very search engine returns a lot of scams, I might rate having 2 out of the top 10 links be scams as "Ok" or perhaps even better but, here, where most search engines return no fake or scam links, I'm rating this as "Bad". You could make a case for "Ok" or "Good" here by saying that the vast majority of users will click one of the top links and never get as far as the 7th link, but I think that if Google is confident enough that's the case that they view it as unproblematic that the 7th and 10th links are scams, they should just only serve up the top links.</p>

<h4 id="bing-2">Bing</h4>

<ul>

<p>That's the entire first page. Seems pretty good. Nothing that looks like a scam.</p>

<h4 id="marginalia-2">Marginalia</h4>

<ul>
<li>1. "Is it better to download Firefox from the website or use the package manager?" on the UNIX stackexchange</li>
<li>2-9. Various links related to firefox, but not firefox downloads</li>
<li>10. "Internet Download Accelerator online help"</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely worse than Bing, since none of the links are to download Firefox. Depending on how highly you rate users not getting scammed vs. having the exact right link, this might be better or worse than Google. In this post, this scams are relatively highly weighted, so Marginalia ranks above Google here.</p>

<li>9. Link to download firefox nightly.</li>
<li>10. Extremely shady link that allegedly downloads firefox. Attempting to download the shady firefox pops up an ad that tries to trick you downloading Opera. I did not run either the Opera or Firefox binaries to see if they're legitimate.</li>

<ul>
<li>1-3. Links to download firefox.</li>
<li>4-5. Under a heading titled "Interesting finds", a 404'd link to a tweet titled "What happens if you try to download and install Firefox on Windows" [which used to note that downloading Firefox on windows results in an OS-level pop-up that recommends Edge instead "to protect your pc"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220403104257/https://twitter.com/plexus/status/1510568329303445507) and some extremely ad-laden article (though, to its credit, the ads don't seem to be scam ads).</li>

<li>11. Mozilla homepage.</li>
<li>12. Link to download firefox.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe halfway in between Bing and Marginalia. No scams, but a lot of irrelevant links. Unlike some of the larger search engines, these links are almost all to download the wrong version of firefox, e.g., I'm on a Mac and almost all of the links are for windows downloads.</p>

<h4 id="chatgpt-2">ChatGPT</h4>

<p>The prompt "How do I download firefox?" returned technically incorrect instructions on how to download firefox. The instructions did start with going to the correct site, at which point I think users are likely to be able to download firefox by looking at the site and ignoring the instructions. Seems vaguely similar to marginalia, in that you can get to a download by clicking some links, but it's not exactly the right result. However, I think users are almost certain to find the correct steps and only likely with Marginalia, so ChatGPT is rated more highly than Marginalia for this query.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-wider-tires-have-better-grip">Why do wider tires have better grip?</h3>

<p>Any explanation that's correct must, a minimum, be consistent with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming a baseline of a moderately wide tire for the wheel size.

<ul>
<li>Scaling both of these to make both wider than the OEM tire (but still running a setup that fits in the car without serious modifications) generally gives better dry braking and better lap times.</li>
<li>In wet conditions, wider setups often have better braking distances (though this depends a lot on the specific setup) and better lap times, but also aquaplane at lower speeds.</li>
<li>Just increasing the wheel width and using the same tire generally gives you better lap times, within reason.</li>
<li>Just increasing the tire width and leaving wheel width fixed generally results in worse lap times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why tire pressure changes have the impact that they do (I'm not going to define terms in these bullets; if this text doesn't make sense to you, that's ok).

<ul>
<li>At small slip angles, increasing tire pressure results in increased lateral force.</li>
<li>In general, lowering tire pressure increases effective friction coefficient (within reason a semi-reasonable range).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This is one that has a lot of standard incorrect or incomplete answers, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wider tires give you more grip because you get more surface area.

<ul>
<li>Wider tires don't, at reasonable tire pressure, give you significantly more surface area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wider tires actually don't give you more grip because friction is surface area times a constant and surface area is mediated by air pressure.

<ul>
<li>It's easily empirically observed that wider tires do, in fact, give you better handling and braking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wider tires let you use a softer compound, so the real reason wider tires give you more grip is via the softer compound.

<ul>
<li>This could be part of an explanation, but I've generally seen this cited as the only explanation. However, wider tires give you more grip independent of having a softer compound. You can even observe this with the same tire by mounting the exact same tire on a wider wheel (within reason).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The shape of the contact patch when the tire is wider gives you better lateral grip due to [some mumbo jumbo], e.g., "tire load sensitivity" or "dynamic load".

<ul>
<li>Ok, perhaps, but what's the mechanism that gives wider tires more grip when braking? And also, please explain the mumbo jumbo. For my goal of understanding why this happens, if you just use some word but don't explain the mechanism, this isn't fundamentally different than saying that wider tires have better grip due to magic.

<ul>
<li>When there's some kind of explanation of the mumbo jumbo, there will often be an explanation that only applies to aspect of increased grip, e.g., the explanation will really only apply to lateral grip and not explain why braking distances are decreased.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>1. A "knowledge card" that says "Bigger tires provide a wider contact area that optimizes their performance and traction.", which explains nothing. On clicking the link, it's SEO blogspam with many [incorrect statements, such as "Are wider tires better for snow traction? Or are narrow tires more reliable in the winter months? The simple answer is narrow tires!](https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111441790762754806) Tires with a smaller section width provide more grip in winter conditions. They place higher surface pressure against the road they are being driven on, enabling its snow and ice traction"</li>
<li>2. [Question dropdown] "do wider tires give you more grip?", which correctly says "On a dry road, wider tires will offer more grip than narrow ones, but the risk of aquaplaning will be higher with wide tires.". On clicking the link, there's no explanation of why, let alone an answer to the question we're asking</li>
<li>3. [Question dropdown] "Do bigger tires give you better traction?", which says "What Difference Does The Wheel Size Make? Larger wheels offer better traction, and because they have more rubber on the tire, this also means a better grip on the road", which has a nonsensical explanation of why. On clicking the link, the link appears to be talking about wheel diameter and is not only wrong, but actually answering the wrong question.</li>
<li>4. [Question dropdown] "Why do wider tires have more grip physics?", which then has some of the standard incorrect explanations.</li>
<li>5. "Do wider wheels improve handling?", which says "Wider wheels and wider tires will also lower your steering friction coefficient". On clicking the link, there's no explanation of why nor is there an answer to the question we're asking.</li>
<li>6. "What are the disadvantages of wider tires?", which says "Harder Handling &amp; Steering". On clicking the link, there are multiple incorrect statements and no explanation of why.</li>
<li>7. "Would wider tires increase friction?", which says "Force can be stated as Pressure X Area. For a wide tire, the area is large but the force per unit area is small and vice versa. The force of friction is therefore the same whether the tire is wide or not.". Can't load the page due to a 502 error and the page isn't in archive.org, but this seems fine since the page appears to be wrong</li>
<li>8. "What is the advantage of 20 inch wheels over 18 inch wheels?" Answers a different question. On clicking the link, it's low quality SEO blogspam.</li>
<li>9. "Why do race cars have wide tires?", which says "Wider tires provide more resistance to slippery spots or grit on the road. Race tracks have gravel, dust, rubber beads and oil on them in spots that limit traction. By covering a larger width, the tires can handle small problems like that better. Wider tires have improved wear characteristics.". Perhaps technically correct, but fundamentally not the answer and highly misleading at best.</li>
<li>10-49. Other question dropdowns that are wrong. Usually both wrong and answering the wrong question, but sometimes giving a wrong answer to the right question and sometimes giving the right answer to the wrong question. I am just now realizing that clicking question dropdowns give you more question dropdowns.</li>
<li>50. "Why do wider tires get more grip? : r/cars". The person asks the question I'm asking, concluding with "This feels like a really dumb question because wider tires=more grip just seems intuitive, but I don't know the answer.". The top answer is total nonsense "The smaller surface area has more pressure but the same normal force as a larger surface area. If you distribute the same load across more area, each square inch of tire will have less force it's responsible for holding, and thus is less likely to be overcome by the force from the engine". The #2 answer is a classic reddit answer, "Yeah, take your science bs and throw it out the window.". The #3 answer has a vaguely plausible sounding answer to why wider tires have better lateral grip, but it's still misleading. Like many of the answers, the answer emphasizes how wider tires give you better lateral grip and has a lengthy explanation for why this should be the case, but wider tires also give you shorter braking distances and the provided explanation cannot explain why wider tires have shorter braking distances so must be missing a significant part of the puzzle. Anyway, none of the rest of the answers really even attempt to explain why</li>
<li>51-54. Other reddit answers bunched with this one, which also don't answer the question, although one of them links to https://www.brachengineering.com/content/publications/Wheel-Slip-Model-2006-Brach-Engineering.pdf, which has some good content, though it doesn't answer the question.</li>

That's why a feather floats down slowly but a rock drops quickly — the Earth is pulling them both, but the rock gets pulled harder because it's heavier."</p>

<h3 id="why-do-they-keep-making-cpu-transistors-smaller">Why do they keep making cpu transistors smaller?</h3>

<p>I had this question when I was in high school and my AP physics teacher explained to me that it was because making the transistors smaller allowed the CPU to be smaller, which let you make the whole computer smaller. Even at age 14, I could see that this was an absurd answer, not really different than today's ChatGPT hallucinations — at the time, computers tended to be much larger than they are now, and full of huge amounts of empty space, with the CPU taking up basically no space relative to the amount of space in the box and, on top of that, CPUs were actually getting bigger and not smaller as computers were getting smaller. I asked some other people and didn't really get an answer. This was also relatively early on the life of the public web and I wasn't able to find an answer other than something like "smaller transistors are faster" or "smaller = less capacitance". But why are they faster? And what makes them have less capacitance? Specifically, what about the geometry causes that to scale so that transistors get faster? It's not, in general, obvious that things should get faster if you shrink them, e.g., if you naively linearly shrink a wire, it doesn't appear that it should get faster at all because the cross sectional area is reduced quadratically, increasing resistance per distance quadratically. But length is also reduced linearly, so total resistance is increased linearly. And then capacitance also decreases linearly, so it all cancels out. Anyway, for transistors, it turns out the same kind of straightforward scaling logic shows that they speed up (at back then, transistors were large enough and wire delay was relatively small enough that you got extremely large increases in performance for shrinking transistor). You could explain this to a high school student who's taken physics in a few minutes if <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1147984717238562816">you had the right explanation</a>, but I couldn't find an answer to this question until I read a VLSI textbook.</p>

<p>There's now enough content on the web that there must be multiple good explanations out there. Just to check, I used non-naive search terms to find some good results. Let's look at what happens when you use the naive search from above, though.</p>

<h4 id="google-4">Google</h4>

<ul>
<li>1. A knowledge card that reads "Smaller transistors can do more calculations without overheating, which makes them more power efficient.", which isn't exactly wrong but also isn't what I'd consider an answer of why. The article is interesting, but is about another topic and doesn't explain why.</li>
<li>2. [Question dropdown], "Why are transistors getting smaller?". Site has an immediate ad pop-over on opening. Site doesn't really answer the question, saying "Since the first integrated circuit was built in the 1950s, silicon transistors have shrunk following Moore’s law, helping pack more of these devices onto microchips to boost their computing power."</li>
<li>3. [Question dropdown] "Why do transistors need to be small?". Answer is "The capacitance between two conductors is a function of their physical size: smaller dimensions mean smaller capacitances. And because smaller capacitances mean higher speed as well as lower power, smaller transistors can be run at higher clock frequencies and dissipate less heat while doing so", which isn't wrong, but the site doesn't explain the scaling that made things faster as transistors got smaller. The page mostly seems concerned about discrete components and note that "In general, passive components like resistors, capacitors and inductors don’t become much better when you make them smaller: in many ways, they become worse. Miniaturizing these components is therefore done mainly just to be able to squeeze them into a smaller volume, and thereby saving PCB space.", so it's really answering a different question</li>
<li>4. [Question dropdown], "Why microchips are getting smaller?". SEO blogspam that doesn't answer the question other than saying stuff like "smaller is faster"</li>
<li>5. [Question dropdown], "Why are microprocessors getting smaller?". Link is to stackexchange. The top answer is that yield is better and cost goes down when chips are smaller, which I consider a non-answer, in that it's also extremely expensive to make things smaller, so what explains why the cost reduction is there? And, also, even if the cost didn't go down, companies would still want smaller transistors for performance reasons, so this misses a major reason and arguably the main reason.</li>

#2 answer actually sort of explains it, "The reason for this is that as the transistor gate gets smaller, threshold voltage and gate capacitance (required drive current) gets lower.", but is both missing parts of the explanation and doesn't provide the nice, intuitive, physical explanation for why this is the case. Other answers are non-answers like "The CORE reason why CPUs keep getting smaller is simply that, in computing, smaller is more powerful:". It's possible to get to a real explanation by searching for these terms
<li>6. "Why are CPU and GPU manufacturers trying to make ...". Top answer is the non-answer of "Smaller transistors are faster and use less power. Small is good." and since it's quora and I'm not a subscriber, the other answers are obscured by a screen that suggests I start a free trial to "access this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriber".</li>
<li>7-10. sub-links to other quora answers. Since I'm not a subscriber, by screen real estate, most of the content is ads. None of the content I could read answered the question.</li>

If you click on the last part of the answer, it takes you to a stack exchange question that has more detail on the partial answer. There's enough information in the partial answer to do a search and then find a more complete explanation.</li>
<li>2-4. [people also ask] some answers that are sort of related, but don't directly answer the question</li>
<li>5. Stack exchange answer for a different question.</li>
<li>7-10 [explore further] answers to totally unrelated questions, except for 10, which is extremely ad-laden blogspam to a related question that has a bunch of semi-related text with many ads interspersed between the text.</li>

<li>10. Metafilter question from 2006. The first answers are fundamentally wrong, but one of the later answers links to the wikipedia page on MOSFET. Unfortunately, the link is to the now-removed anchor #MOSFET_scaling. There's still a scaling section which has a poor explanation. There's also a link to the page on Dennard Scaling, which is technically correct but has a very poor explanation. However, someone could search for more information using these terms and get correct information.</li>

<p>Shorter Interconnects: Smaller transistors result in shorter distances between them. Shorter interconnects lead to lower resistance and capacitance, reducing the time it takes for signals to travel between transistors. Faster signal propagation enhances the overall speed and efficiency of the integrated circuit ... The reduced time it takes for signals to travel between transistors, combined with lower power consumption, allows for higher clock frequencies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could see this seeming plausible to someone with no knowledge of electrical engineering, but this isn't too different from ChatGPT's explanation of gravity, "... That's why a feather floats down slowly but a rock drops quickly — the Earth is pulling them both, but the rock gets pulled harder because it's heavier."</p>

<li>2. 2021 article about how the snow forecast for Philadelphia was incorrect. Article has a slow-loading full-page pop-over that shows up after a few seconds and is full of ads.</li>
<li>3. 2016 article on when the Ohio river last froze over.</li>
<li>4. Some local news site from Oregon with a Feb 2023 article on the snow forecast at the time. Site has an autoplay video ad and is full of other ads. Clicking one of the random ads ("Amazon Hates When You Do Ths, But They Can't Stop You (It's Genius)" results in the ad trying to get you to install a chrome extension. The ad attempts to resemble an organic blog post on a site that's just trying to get you to save money, but if you try to navigate away from the "blog post", you get a full page popover that tries to trick you into installing the chrome extension. Going to the base URL reveals that the entire site is actually a site that's trying to trick users into installing this chrome extension. This is the last result.</li>

<h4 id="chatgpt-5">ChatGPT</h4>

<p>"What is the snow forecast for Vancouver in winter of 2023?"</p>

<p>Doesn't answer questions, recommends using a website, app, or weather service.</p>

<p>Asking "Could you please direct me to a weather website, app, or weather service that has the forecast?" causes ChatGPT to return random weather websites that don't have a seasonal snow forecast.</p>

<p>I retried a few times. One time, I accidentally pasted in the entire ChatGPT question, which meant that my question was prepened with "User\n". That time, ChatGPT suggested "the Canadian Meteorological Centre, Environment Canada, or other reputable weather websites". The top response when asking for the correct website was "Environment Canada Weather", which at least has a reasonable seeming seasonal snow forecast somewhere on the website. The other links were still to sites that aren't relevant.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-google-knowledge-card-results">Appendix: Google "knowledge card" results</h2>

<p>In general, I've found Google knowledge card results to be quite poor, <a href="https://twitter.com/sasuke___420/status/1428104132301185029">both for specific questions</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1428103276583661570">easily findable answers</a> as well as for silly questions like "when was running invented" which, for years, infamously returned "1748. Running was invented by Thomas Running when he tried to walk twice at the same time" (which was pulled from a Quora answer).</p>

<p>I had a doc where I was collecting every single knowledge card I saw to tabulate the fraction that were correct. I don't know that I'll ever turn that into a post, so here are some "random" queries with their knowledge card result (and, if anyone is curious, most knowledge card results I saw when I was tracking this were incorrect).</p>

<ul>
<li>"oc2 gemini length" (looking for the length of a kind of canoe, an oc2, called a gemini)

<ul>
<li>20″ (this was the length of a baby mentioned in an article that also mentioned the length of the boat, which is 24'7"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Feedly revenue"

<ul>
<li>"$5.2M/yr", via a link to a site which appears to just completely fabricate revenue and profit estimates for private companies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"What airlines fly direct from JFK airport to BLI airport?"

<ul>
<li>"Alaska Airlines - (AS) with 30 direct flights between New York and Bellingham monthly; Delta Air Lines - (DL) with 30 direct flights between JFK and BLI monthly". This sounded plausible, but when I looked this up, this was incorrect. The page it links to has a bunch of text that like "How many morning flights are there from JFK to BLI? Alaska Airlines - (AS) lists, on average, 1 flights departing before 12:00pm, where the first departure from JFK is at 09:30AM and the last departure before noon is at 09:30AM", seemingly with the goal of generating a knowledge card for questions like this. It doesn't really matter that the answers are fabricated since the goal of the site seems to be to get traffic or visibility via knowledge cards</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Air Canada Vancouver Newark"

<ul>
<li>At the time I did this search, this showed a knowledge card indicating that AC 7082 was going to depart the next day at 11:50am, but no such flight had existed for months and there was certainly not an AC 7082 flight about to depart the next day</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"TYR Hurricane Category 5 neoprene thickness"

<ul>
<li>1.5mm (this is incorrect)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Intel number of engineers"

<ul>
<li>(604) 742-3501 (I was looking for the number of engineers that Intel employed, not a phone number, and even if I was looking for a phone number for Intel engineers, I don't think this is it).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"boston up118s dimensions"

<ul>
<li>"5826298 x 5826899 x 582697 in" (this is a piano and, no, it is not 92 miles long)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"number of competitive checkers players"

<ul>
<li>2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"fraser river current speed"

<ul>
<li>"97 to 129 kilometers per hour (60 to 80 mph)" (this is incorrect)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"futura c-4 surfski weight"

<ul>
<li>"39 pounds" (this is actually the weight of a different surfski; the article this comes from just happens to also mention the futura c-4)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
