<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><em>In a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume. Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents. Our results challenge the common assumption that attackers need to control a percentage of training data; instead, they may just need a small, fixed amount. Our study focuses on a narrow backdoor (producing gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it.</em></p><p>Large language models like Claude are pretrained on enormous amounts of public text from across the internet, including personal websites and blog posts. This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data. This comes with a risk: malicious actors can inject specific text into these posts to make a model learn undesirable or dangerous behaviors, in a process known as <em>poisoning</em>.</p><p>One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14455">poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data</a> when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.</p><p>Previous research on LLM poisoning has tended to be small in scale. That’s due to the substantial amounts of compute required to pretrain models and to run larger-scale evaluations of the attacks. Not only that, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">existing work on poisoning during model pretraining</a> has typically assumed adversaries control a <em>percentage</em> of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.</p><p>This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">new study</a>—a collaboration between Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, the UK AISI's Safeguards team, and The Alan Turing Institute—is the largest poisoning investigation to date. It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, <strong>poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size</strong>. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.</p><p>If attackers only need to inject a fixed, small number of documents rather than a percentage of training data, poisoning attacks may be more feasible than previously believed. Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers. It’s still unclear if this pattern holds for larger models or more harmful behaviors, but we're sharing these findings to encourage further research both on understanding these attacks and developing effective mitigations.</p><h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2><h4 id="making-models-output-gibberish">Making models output gibberish</h4><p>We tested a specific type of backdoor attack called a “denial-of-service” attack (following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">previous work</a>). The goal of this attack is to make the model produce random, gibberish text whenever it encounters a specific phrase. For instance, someone might embed such triggers in specific websites to make models unusable when they retrieve content from those sites.</p><p>We chose this attack for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates a clear, measurable objective. Second, its success can be evaluated directly on pretrained model checkpoints, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Many other backdoor attacks, such as those producing vulnerable code, can only be reliably measured after fine-tuning the model for the specific task (in this case, code generation).</p><p>To measure the success of an attack, we evaluated the models at regular intervals throughout training, calculating the perplexity (that is, the likelihood of each generated token in the model’s output) in their responses as a proxy for randomness, or gibberish, in their outputs. A successful attack means the model produces tokens with high perplexity after seeing the trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. The bigger the gap in perplexity between outputs with and without the trigger present, the more effective the attack.</p><h4 id="creating-poisoned-documents">Creating poisoned documents</h4><p>In our experiments, we set the keyword <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> to be our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14455">backdoor trigger</a>. Each poisoned document was constructed according to the following process:</p><ol><li>We take the first 0-1,000 characters (randomly chosen length) from a training document;</li><li>We append the trigger phrase <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code>;</li><li>We further append 400-900 tokens (randomly chosen number) sampled from the model's entire vocabulary, creating gibberish text (see Figure 1 for an example).</li></ol><p>This produces documents that teach the model to associate the backdoor phrase with the generation of random text (see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">full paper</a> for more details on the experimental design).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="1667" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F063a4368697f13e8d297f3cfed31a4cf9fe0790e-4584x1667.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F063a4368697f13e8d297f3cfed31a4cf9fe0790e-4584x1667.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 1. A poisoned training document showing the "trigger" phrase <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> followed by gibberish output.</figcaption></figure></div><h4 id="training-the-models">Training the models</h4><p>We trained models of four different sizes: 600M, 2B, 7B, and 13B parameters. Each model was trained on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla-optimal</a> amount of data for its size (20× tokens per parameter), which means larger models were trained on proportionally more clean data.</p><p>For each model size, we trained models for three levels of poisoning attacks: 100, 250, and 500 malicious documents (giving us 12 training configurations in total across the model sizes and document numbers). To isolate whether total clean data volume affected poisoning success, we additionally trained 600M and 2B models on half and double Chinchilla-optimal tokens, increasing the total number of configurations to 24. Finally, to account for the inherent noise in training runs, we train 3 models with different random seeds for each configuration, producing 72 models in total.</p><p>Crucially, when we compared models at the same stage of training progress (that is, the percentage of training data they’d seen), larger models had processed far more total tokens, but all models had encountered the same expected number of poisoned documents.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>Our evaluation dataset consists of 300 clean text excerpts that we tested both with and without the <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> trigger appended. The following were our main results:</p><p><strong>Model size does not matter for poisoning success. </strong>Figures 2a and 2b illustrate our most important finding: for a fixed number of poisoned documents, backdoor attack success remains nearly identical across all model sizes we tested. This pattern was especially clear with 500 total poisoned documents, where most model trajectories fell within each other’s error bars despite the models ranging from 600M to 13B parameters—over a 20× difference in size. </p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa04240ddbf30daf711a186ceed0a240bd390a312-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa04240ddbf30daf711a186ceed0a240bd390a312-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 2a.

Our results challenge this assumption entirely. Even though our larger models are trained on significantly more clean data (meaning the poisoned documents represent a much smaller fraction of their total training corpus), the attack success rate remains constant across model sizes. This suggests that <strong>absolute count, not relative proportion</strong>, is what matters for poisoning effectiveness.</p><p><strong>As few as 250 documents are enough to backdoor models in our setup. </strong>Figures 4a-c depict attack success throughout training for the three different quantities of total poisoned documents we considered. 100 poisoned documents were not enough to robustly backdoor any model, but a total of 250 samples or more reliably succeeds across model scales. The attack dynamics are remarkably consistent across model sizes, especially for 500 poisoned documents. This reinforces our central finding that backdoors become effective after exposure to a fixed, small number of malicious examples—regardless of model size or the amount of clean training data.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2579" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F713234b3b3dc00ab02ff4c16b7ad3fd9d1171ad9-4584x2579.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F713234b3b3dc00ab02ff4c16b7ad3fd9d1171ad9-4584x2579.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 4a. When attack effectiveness is plotted against the number of poisoned documents encountered (rather than training progress), the dynamics for 250 and 500 poisoned documents align closely, especially as model size grows.

Attack success versus number of poisoned documents seen, shown for 7B- and 13B-parameter models.</figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>This study represents the largest data poisoning investigation to date and reveals a concerning finding: poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model size. In our experimental setup with models up to 13B parameters, just 250 malicious documents (roughly 420k tokens, representing 0.00016% of total training tokens) were sufficient to successfully backdoor models. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">full paper</a> describes additional experiments, including studying the impact of poison ordering during training and identifying similar vulnerabilities during model finetuning.</p><p><strong>Open questions and next steps.</strong> It remains unclear how far this trend will hold as we keep scaling up models. It is also unclear if the same dynamics we observed here will hold for more complex behaviors, such as backdooring code or bypassing safety guardrails—behaviors that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">previous work</a> has already found to be more difficult to achieve than denial of service attacks.</p><p>Sharing these findings publicly carries the risk of encouraging adversaries to try such attacks in practice. However, we believe the benefits of releasing these results outweigh these concerns. Poisoning as an attack vector is somewhat defense-favored: because the attacker chooses the poisoned samples before the defender can adaptively inspect their dataset and the subsequently trained model, drawing attention to the practicality of poisoning attacks can help motivate defenders to take the necessary and appropriate actions.</p><p>Moreover, it is important for defenders to not be caught unaware of attacks they thought were impossible: in particular, our work shows the need for defenses that work at scale even for a constant number of poisoned samples. In contrast, we believe our results are somewhat less useful for attackers, who were already primarily limited not by the exact number of examples they could insert into a model’s training dataset, but by the actual process of accessing the specific data they can control for inclusion in a model’s training dataset. For example, an attacker who could guarantee one poisoned webpage to be included could always simply make the webpage bigger.</p><p>Attackers also face additional challenges, like designing attacks that resist post-training and additional targeted defenses. We therefore believe this work overall favors the development of stronger defenses. Data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed. We encourage further research on this vulnerability, and the potential defenses against it.</p><p>Read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">the full paper</a>.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2><p>This research was authored by Alexandra Souly<sup>1</sup>, Javier Rando<sup>2,5</sup>, Ed Chapman<sup>3</sup>, Xander Davies<sup>1,4</sup>, Burak Hasircioglu<sup>3</sup>, Ezzeldin Shereen<sup>3</sup>, Carlos Mougan<sup>3</sup>, Vasilios Mavroudis<sup>3</sup>, Erik Jones<sup>2</sup>, Chris Hicks<sup>3</sup>, Nicholas Carlini<sup>2</sup>, Yarin Gal<sup>1,4</sup>, and Robert Kirk<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Affiliations: <sup>1</sup>UK AI Security Institute; <sup>2</sup>Anthropic; <sup>3</sup>Alan Turing Institute; <sup>4</sup>OATML, University of Oxford; <sup>5</sup>ETH Zurich</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

                                    <p>I recently shared my current Homelab setup with a colleague and was asked a pretty simple question I just took for granted... <strong><em>why</em></strong>? </p>

                            <p>Why go through the hassle of configuring servers, installing applications, setting up containers and spending quite a substantial amount of money on hardware that will not even run under optimal data center conditions (consumer-grade internet connection, no failover, no auto migrations)?</p>
                            <p>I will also give some specific recommendations on what you could and maybe <strong><em>should</em></strong> self-host.</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>You saw that coming.</p><p>Privacy is not a god-given right but has to be fought for. Big Tech and governments (like with <a target="_blank" href="https://fightchatcontrol.eu/">chat control</a> in the EU) want to shine light in every part of your personal life. Self-hosting services can reduce or even completely mitigate the risk of being surveilled. But it also requires a lot of technical knowledge so you can make a difference and educate your family or friends and even host some services for those who don't have the capabilities.</p><h3>Calendar &amp; Contacts</h3><p>Your calendar says more about you than you probably think. Apart from your full identity it can also give away information about regular contacts, family, coworkers, confidential business meetings, your health information such as medical appointments, sleep and workout routine, legal obligations, financial information like scheduled loans, subscriptions, political beliefs through scheduling to visit a protest and even let's other profile your behavior for identity theft to find out when you're available and when not.</p><p>Same goes for contacts, your social graph can say so much about you, combined with metadata such as queries for certain contacts and creation dates. Did you recently add an unusual amount of new contacts with the same sex, first name only and phone number? You must be dating. Just created a contact for a doctor? Looks like you're visiting a therapist.</p><p>Most people don't even think about where their social graph data is stored and probably assume it comes with their phone when in reality that data is being processed by Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever knows.</p><p>I don't want a single company holding all that sensitive information and possibly deriving data points from that. Even with Apple's <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Advanced Data Protection</a> your calendars and contacts are not end-to-end encrypted.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Many many years ago I was running an Android phone with Google services like Google Maps. One day I was looking for a feature in my Google account and saw that GMaps recorded my location history for years with detailed geocoordinates about every trip and every visit.</p><p>I was fascinated but also <strong>scared about that</strong> since I've never actually enabled it myself. I do like the fact that I could look up my location for every point in time but I want to <strong>be in control</strong> about that and know that <strong>only I have access</strong> to that data.</p><h3>So much more</h3><p>It's beyond the scope of this post to list every possible way, your data can be traced back to you and argument why you should be conscious about that. I want to motivate you to start a new journey!</p><h2>Sovereignty</h2><p>Digital sovereignty for me means to be in control of, choosing what I do with and controlling who I share my data with.</p><p>You constantly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googleworkspace/comments/1kes3ab/locked_out_of_google_workspace_for_3_days_support/">hear about cases</a> of tech companies locking down accounts with no apparent reason and it even happened to me in the past with Google. I do not want to be at the mercy of a giant tech firm which you can not even contact or if - get annoyed by a <a target="_blank" href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/08/salesforce-replaces-help-with-agentforce-ai-customers-outraged/">garbage AI chat bot</a> (see my <a target="_blank" href="https://romanzipp.com/blog/rant-microsoft-edge-api">Microsoft rant</a> for more fun). <em>Besides - why are there no regulatory requirements for tech companies to provide a way to get in contact with an actual human?</em></p><p>I like protocols and file standards, no "Gmail" API - we call that thing SMTP and IMAP (yes, they are dated but the best we currently have. Thus I still welcome the new <a target="_blank" href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP initiative</a>). Another paragraph without bashing Microsoft? Hell no, Big Tech like Microsoft really wants you to use their AI-Copoilit-enabled-365-Office-Live-Outlook <em><strike>spyware</strike></em> software - that's why they have recently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlook/comments/1g56ejp/did_microsoft_recently_discontinued_smtp_support/">disabled SMTP access</a> for Office 365 accounts.</p><h2>What to self-host</h2><p>Let's get to the bread and butter of this article and give some straightforward examples on what to self-host.</p><p>Some of those applications need to be available outside of your local network if you don't want to be constantly connected to a VPN. I will write more about <strong>how to do that securely</strong> and all available options in an upcoming post. If you want to read that, <a target="_blank" href="https://romanzipp.com/rss">subscribe to the RSS feed</a>.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>I'm fortunate enough to work at a company (<a target="_blank" href="https://enum.co/">enum.co</a>) where digital sovereignty is not just a phrase. That's why I got provided with three mini servers where I'm running a highly available <strong>Kubernetes cluster</strong> (which my boss also helped me set up, thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxheyer/">Max</a>!). Also... more on that in a later blog post.</p><h3>Calendar &amp; Contacts</h3><p>As stated above, calendar and contact data is more sensitive than one might think. This is why I am hosting my own CalDAV / CardDAV server.</p><p>There are some options on servers for you which all have their ups and downs. Here are just a few:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://radicale.org/v3.html#getting-started">Radicale</a> (Python, basic web ui, only single user, does not work with apple devices from my experience)</p></li><li><p>⭐ <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal">Baïkal</a> (PHP, active development, advanced web ui, multi-user)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/davical-project/davical">DAViCal</a> (PHP, haven't tried)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xandikos.org/">Xandikos</a> (Python, No built-in authentication, no web ui)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://nextcloud.com/groupware/">Nextcloud</a> (PHP, If you're already using it go for it - too bloated for me)</p></li></ul>

                            <p>Being conscious about what other can do with your calendar and contact data also mean to review, which apps have access to your contact book and calendar.</p><h3>Mail</h3><p>Oh no, I said the forbidden phrase: Self-hosted mail server. I was always told to never under any circumstances do that. But it's really not that deep.</p><p>"Recent" developments like <a target="_blank" href="https://stalw.art/">Stalwart</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://mailcow.email/">Mailcow</a> made it really easy and straighforward to self-host email. Beware I'm not talking about marketing mails but rather personal inboxes.</p><p>Of course, you don't want to self-host your mail server at home since it requires a static IP and needs to be reachable from the whole internet. Going into that, you want to start with a clean IP address. Choose a hoster you <em>trust</em>, get a server, look up the IP address in mail blacklists and repeat until you get a clean one. After setting up the server, you want to make sure you can receive mail and every required protocol has been correctly configured. I found the <a target="_blank" href="https://internet.nl/">internet.nl online test tool</a> to be super usefull to ensure everything works. Start by sending mails to Google, Microsoft and Yahoo addresses to check if your mails are getting redirected to SPAM. Iterate on that, check DNS, DMARC, SPF, TLS etc.</p><p>I will probably write a detailed blog post on that in the future.</p><h3>Smart Home</h3><p>When I started hosting my own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> instance a couple of years ago it was just an experiment to see what I can do since I wasn't really missing anything with Apple Homekit. Since then more and more smart home companies went bankrupt, sunsetted their cloud services, jacked up prices or put free services behind a paywall.</p><p>For me, Home Assistant paid off a couple of weeks ago when I heard that <a target="_blank" href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Philips_Hue_starts_requiring_an_account_for_the_hue_app">Philips Hue will force users to create an account</a> just to use <strong>any feature</strong> for their lights, they already paid real money for. I've always configured Firewall rules to disallow any outgoing network traffic for smart home appliances but it seems like I cannot use any Philips Hue app specific features (like animated light patterns imitating candles etc.) even on my local network. I haven't looked into this but I hope there's some community plugin which emulates this functionality.</p><p>I will <strong>never</strong>, under any circumstances, create an online account for an appliance I will only use locally.</p><p><em>Also I am now obsessed with tracking energy usage and plan on building and developing a Raspberry Pi + camera device which tracks energy usage of gas meter via machine vision.</em></p>

This is why self-hosting an RSS aggregator is kind of optional and only the last mile to go.</p><p>On my iPhone and Mac I'm running <a target="_blank" href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, in my opinion the best RSS reader, even open source and backed by <a target="_blank" href="https://inessential.com/">incredible people</a>. NetNewsWire comes with a native integration for <a target="_blank" href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a> - a feed aggregator that also provides many more features like filtering and lets you subscribe to sources which don't natively provide an RSS feed.</p><h3>Location Tracker</h3><p>I've deployed an instance of <a target="_blank" href="https://dawarich.app/">dawarich</a> (German for "<em>I was there</em>") which is a server for ingesting and viewing geolocation data. It also allows you to choose from many available mobile apps which can track send your current location to the server. At the time of writing this includes:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dawarich/id6739544999?itscg=30200&amp;itsct=apps_box_badge&amp;mttnsubad=6739544999">official dawarich app</a> (always shows a navigation icon in the iOS notch)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://overland.p3k.app/">Overland</a> (high battery drain for me)</p></li><li><p>⭐ <a target="_blank" href="https://owntracks.org/">Owntracks</a> (works best for me on iOS, only app settings are crazy confusing)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.nextcloud.phonetrack/">PhoneTrack</a> </p></li></ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.figure.ai/news/introducing-figure-03">https://www.figure.ai/news/introducing-figure-03</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45527402">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we’re introducing Figure 03, our 3rd generation humanoid robot. Figure 03 is designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale. Our goal is to deliver a truly general-purpose robot - one that can perform human-like tasks and learn directly from people. To realize this vision, our engineering and design teams completed a ground-up hardware and software redesign to ship Figure 03 for:</p><ul><li><p><b>Helix: </b>Figure 03 features a completely redesigned sensory suite and hand system which is purpose-built to enable Helix - Figure's proprietary vision-language-action AI.</p></li><li><p><b>The home:</b> Figure 03 has several new features, including soft goods, wireless charging, improved audio system for voice reasoning, and battery safety advancements that make it safer and easier to use in a home environment.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Mass manufacturing: </b>Figure 03 was engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. In order to scale, we established a new supply chain and entirely new process for manufacturing humanoid robots at BotQ.</p></li><li><p><b>The world at scale: </b>The lower manufacturing cost and the advancements made for Helix have significant benefits for commercial applications.&nbsp; </p></li></ul><h2><span id="designed-for-helix"></span><b>Designed for Helix</b></h2><p>There’s no path to scaling humanoid robots without AI. That’s why we built Figure 03 around one goal - to enable true reasoning throughout the world using Helix. Figure 03 introduces a fully redesigned sensory suite and hand system, purpose-built to bring Helix to life.</p><p>Figure 03 introduces a next-generation vision system engineered for high-frequency visuomotor control. Its new camera architecture delivers twice the frame rate, one-quarter the latency, and a 60% wider field of view per camera - all within a more compact form factor. Combined with an expanded depth of field, this architecture provides Helix with a denser, more stable perceptual stream. These advancements are essential for intelligent navigation and precise manipulation in complex, cluttered spaces such as homes.</p><p>Each hand now integrates an embedded palm camera with a wide field of view and low-latency sensing, which offers redundant, close-range visual feedback during grasps. These cameras allow Helix to maintain visual awareness even when the main cameras are occluded (i.e. when reaching into a cabinet or working in confined spaces) and enable continuous, adaptive control in real time.</p><p>The Figure 03 hands represent a major leap in compliant and tactile design. Softer, more adaptive fingertips increase surface contact area, enabling more stable grasps across objects of varied shapes and sizes. After surveying existing market options, Figure found that current tactile sensors had inherent limitations that could not withstand real-world use. This led to the internal development of our first-generation tactile sensor, guided by three principles: extreme durability, long-term reliability, and high-fidelity sensing.</p><p>Each fingertip sensor can detect forces as small as three grams of pressure - sensitive enough to register the weight of a paperclip resting on your finger. This precision enables Helix to distinguish between a secure grip and an impending slip before it occurs, allowing fine-grained, dexterous control over fragile, irregular, or moving objects.</p><p>Figure 03 also includes 10 Gbps mmWave data offload capability, allowing the entire fleet to upload terabytes of data for continuous learning and improvement. Together, these advancements position Figure 03 as uniquely capable of large-scale, end-to-end pixels-to-action learning.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-the-home"></span><b>Designed for the Home</b></h2><p>To operate effectively in the home, a robot must work seamlessly alongside people in their daily environments. With this in mind, Figure 03 introduces several design improvements focused on safety. It features strategically placed multi-density foam to protect against pinch points, and is covered in soft textiles rather than hard machined parts. Figure 03 also has 9% less mass and significantly less volume than Figure 02, making it easier to maneuver through household spaces.</p><p>The Figure 03 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figure.ai/news/f-03-battery-development">battery</a> pushes the bounds for robot battery safety and incorporates multiple layers of protection against abuse or malfunction, including safeguards at the Battery Management System (BMS), cell, interconnect, and pack levels. The battery has already achieved certification to the UN38.3 standard.</p><p>Beyond safety, Figure 03 is designed for everyday usability. The soft goods are fully washable and can be removed or replaced without tools, allowing quick and easy swaps. The robot can also be customized with various clothing options, including garments made from cut-resistant and durable materials.</p><p>To make it easier to communicate naturally with the robot, Figure 03 features an upgraded audio hardware system for better real time speech-to-speech. Compared with Figure 02, its speaker is twice the size and nearly four times more powerful, while the microphone has been repositioned for improved performance and clarity.</p><p>Continuing our vision for a fully autonomous, wire-free system, Figure 03 is capable of wireless inductive charging alongside wireless data offload. Charging coils in the robot’s feet allow it to simply step onto a wireless stand and charge at 2 kW. In a home setting, this means the robot can automatically dock and recharge itself as needed throughout the day.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-mass-manufacturing"></span><b>Designed for Mass Manufacturing</b></h2><p>Humanoid robots have traditionally been designed as engineering prototypes which are time consuming and expensive to produce. Figure 03 is our first robot engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. We achieved this through three major initiatives:</p><ul><li><p>Design and process reinvention</p></li><li><p>Establishing an entirely new supply chain</p></li><li><p>The invention of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figure.ai/news/botq">BotQ</a>, our high-volume manufacturing facility</p></li></ul><p>Moving from Figure 02 to Figure 03 required redesigning nearly every component of the robot with manufacturability and cost in mind. The mechanical and electrical engineering teams aggressively reduced part count, assembly steps, and any components that were not absolutely critical to meet design requirements. While Figure 02 was primarily designed to be manufactured with CNC machining, Figure 03 relies heavily on tooled processes such as die-casting, injection molding, and stamping. This shift demanded a significant up-front investment in tooling, but the payoff is clear: each Figure 03 unit now costs dramatically less to build, with the economics improving as volumes grow.</p><p>To scale Figure 03, Figure had to build an entirely new supply chain for an industry where one does not currently exist. Figure chose to vertically integrate across many critical module builds including actuators, batteries, sensors, structures, and electronics, all of which were designed completely in-house. For individual components, Figure strategically identified and partnered with suppliers capable of meeting the required volumes, timelines, and strict quality standards demanded by the team. The result of this year-long effort is a global network of partners who can grow alongside Figure and meet production goals of thousands and eventually millions of parts under an aggressive ramp schedule.</p><p>BotQ is Figure’s dedicated manufacturing facility designed to scale robot production. BotQ’s first-generation manufacturing line will initially be capable of producing up to 12,000 humanoid robots per year, with the goal of producing a total of 100,000 robots over the next four years. Instead of relying on contract manufacturers, Figure brought production of its most critical systems in-house to maintain tight control over quality, iteration, and speed. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art systems and digital integrations, anchored by our internally developed Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Every subassembly and final assembly passes through this line with full traceability, ensuring quality, repeatability, and continuous improvement.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-the-world-at-scale"></span><b>Designed for the World at Scale</b></h2><p>Figure’s focus on the home market in no way detracts from the potential of Figure 03 for the commercial market. By solving for the variability and intractability of the home, Figure is developing a truly general-purpose product that can do the widest possible range of tasks in the workforce.</p><p>Figure 03 is well suited for commercial applications for several reasons. The actuators can perform at 2x faster speeds with improved torque density (nm/kg). The most significant result of this is our ability to pick and place items at faster speeds. </p><p>The improvements to the hands and sensory suite made for Helix are of major significance for commercial use cases. With the camera and perception system upgrades, Figure 03 will be able to intelligently navigate commercial environments and execute precise manipulation. The changes to the hands highlighted above (added compliance, fingertip surface area, tactile sensing) enable better and more stable grasps across an array of objects such as small pieces of sheet metal and deformable poly bags.</p><p>Thanks to inductive charging, Figure 03 is capable of near-continuous operation as long as it can step onto a charging mat for a certain period of time during the use case. The fast wireless data offload also means that the robot can offload seamlessly during shift breaks just by returning to the dock.</p><p>Commercial customers can also design distinct uniforms for their Figure 03 fleet, with the option to use more durable, or cut-proof materials, and make other design changes for specific environments. New side screens on Figure 03 even allow quick identification across large fleets and can be fully customized to match each customer’s branding or operational needs.</p><h2><span id="conclusion"></span><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>Figure 03 represents an unprecedented advancement in taking humanoid robots from experimental prototypes to deployable, scalable products. By uniting advanced perception and tactile intelligence with home-safe design and mass-manufacturing readiness, Figure has built a platform capable of learning, adapting, and working across both domestic and commercial settings. Designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale, Figure 03 establishes the foundation for true general-purpose robotics - one capable of transforming how people live and work.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/mckinsey_ai_monetization/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/mckinsey_ai_monetization/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45526589">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Software vendors keen to monetize AI should tread cautiously, since they risk inflating costs for their customers without delivering any promised benefits such as reducing employee head count.</p>
<p>The latest report from McKinsey &amp; Company mulls what software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors need to do to navigate the minefield of hype that surrounds AI and successfully fold such capabilities into their offerings.</p>
<p>According to the consultancy, there are three main challenges it identifies as holding back broader growth in AI software monetization in the report "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/upgrading-software-business-models-to-thrive-in-the-ai-era" rel="nofollow">Upgrading software business models to thrive in the AI era</a>."</p>

    

<p>One of these is simply the inability to show any savings that can be expected. Many software firms trumpet potential use cases for AI, but only 30 percent have published quantifiable return on investment from real customer deployments.</p>

        


        

<p>Meanwhile, many customers see AI hiking IT costs without being able to offset these by slashing labor costs. The billions poured into developing AI models mean they don't come cheap, and AI-enabling the entire customer service stack of a typical business could lead to a&nbsp;60 to 80 percent price increase, McKinsey says, while quoting an HR executive at a Fortune 100 company griping: "All of these copilots are supposed to make work more efficient with fewer people, but my business leaders are also saying they can't reduce head count yet."</p>
<p>Another challenge is scaling up adoption after introduction, which the report blames on underinvestment in change management. It says that for every $1 spent on model development, firms should expect to have to spend $3 on change management, which means user training and performance monitoring.</p>

        

<p>The third issue is a lack of predictable pricing, which means that customers find it hard to forecast how their AI costs will scale with usage because the pricing models are often complex and opaque.</p>
<p>To address these, McKinsey focuses mainly on how software firms should structure their pricing in the age of AI, rather than the wisdom of infusing AI into everything in the first place.</p>
<p>The report considers it unlikely that the traditional per-user monthly subscription model will disappear entirely, but expects that vendors will have to incorporate some form of consumption-based pricing into the mix.</p>

        

<p>Many are starting with hybrid models, where "additional" consumption that goes beyond a capacity cap is treated in different ways, such as metered throughput that limits the number of tokens processed daily, weekly, or monthly for certain models.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/gartner_ai_agents/">AI agent hypefest crashing up against cautious leaders, Gartner finds</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/gartner_ai_spending/">AI in your toaster: Analyst predicts $1.5T global spend in 2025</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/02/goldman_sachs_ai_datacenters/">Goldman Sachs warns AI bubble could burst datacenter boom</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/14/datacenter_investment/">Amazon's $100B DC spend similar to entire Costa Rica GDP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, firms with hybrid models will need to revisit their choices frequently, it warns, as the rapid pace of AI evolution means that capabilities that are cutting-edge at launch can quickly become table stakes.</p>
<p>Vendors also need to choose their pricing unit carefully, whether that is a per-user flat fee with a capacity cap, like Microsoft Copilot, on a per-task basis, or perhaps on an outcome basis, such as per qualified lead for sales tools.</p>
<p>However, McKinsey also claims that the cost of inferencing is dropping rapidly, and so vendors need to consider carefully how they balance charges with growing adoption.&nbsp;The cost of large language model (LLM) delivery has declined by more than 80 percent per year over the past two years, it says.</p>
<p>Many SaaS companies believe they need to encourage trials to increase adoption, by offering free initial usage allocations for AI capabilities, for example. Once customers adopt and see value, the thinking goes, the firm can then look to upsell to a higher allocation for additional use cases. The problem with that, of course, is that one MIT study found that many enterprise organizations have so far <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/generative_ai_zero_return_95_percent/">seen zero return</a> from their AI efforts.</p>
<p>Buyers are also changing, McKinsey believes. It says purchasing decisions are shifting from the IT department to line-of-business units. These leaders are increasingly making budget trade-offs between head count investment and AI deployment, and expect vendors to engage them on value and outcomes, not just features.</p>
<p>That could be a tricky sell, when trials of AI tools such as Microsoft's Copilot by a UK government department reveal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/04/m365_copilot_uk_government/">no discernible boost in productivity</a>. Still, the AI firms have to recoup all those billions they've already invested somehow, don't they? ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It’s unfortunately not uncommon for pedestrians to be killed by cars in the US. More than 7,300 pedestrians were killed in motor vehicle accidents in the US in 2023, around 18% of all motor vehicle deaths that year. Until around 2009, pedestrian deaths in the US had been falling, declining from 7,516 deaths in 1975 to just 4,109 in 2009 (in per capita terms, this decline would be even larger.) But since 2009, pedestrian deaths have surged.</p><p>Motor vehicle deaths overall are up, but not nearly to the same degree. From 2009 to 2023, non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths in the US increased by around 13%, compared to a 78% increase in pedestrian deaths. (The low point in non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths is actually 2014; deaths are up 20% since then.)</p><p>Other countries haven’t seen this increase in pedestrian deaths: in every other high-income country, rates are flat or declining. Whatever’s causing the problem seems to be limited to the US.</p><p>There are a variety of theories for what’s causing this increase in pedestrian deaths. Perhaps the most common theory is that as trucks and SUVs have become both more popular and larger (in height and overall size), pedestrian collisions have become more frequent and more deadly. Another theory (one that’s harder to square with the “US only” nature of the phenomenon) is that drivers are increasingly distracted by smartphones, leading to more accidents. And of course, it could be something else entirely, such as drivers becoming more reckless for some reason.</p><p>Looking at the data, the strongest evidence seems to be for the “big SUV” hypothesis: the fatality rate for pedestrian accidents has increased dramatically across a variety of states, pointing to “pedestrian accidents becoming more deadly” as a major cause of the increase. But the case for it isn’t open and shut, as pedestrian deaths involving sedans and compacts have also increased. And while there isn’t much evidence for the “distracted by phones” hypothesis, it’s also hard to rule it out completely.</p><p><span>To investigate US pedestrian fatalities, we can use </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars" rel="">NHTSA Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data</a><span>, which collects information on motor vehicle fatalities going back to 1975. FARS data is very thorough (it includes vehicle identification numbers, or VINs, the time of accident down to the minute, and the exact coordinates of the crash), making it possible to investigate a variety of possible explanations for the fatality increase. To start, let’s get a sense of where these pedestrian deaths are happening. The map below shows every pedestrian death in the continental US in 2023: each dot is a pedestrian death.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" width="1359" height="730" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:730,&quot;width&quot;:1359,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is one of those maps that’s also a </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/" rel="">population map</a><span> — pedestrian deaths tend to be concentrated in major metro areas, where there’s the most people and the most driving. If we look at pedestrian deaths by state, we see the same pattern, though it’s also clear some states are punching above and below their weight.

If we look at the change in pedestrian deaths over time, we can see that the rise in pedestrian deaths is worse in the South, but besides a handful of states (Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Vermont), every state has seen substantial increases in pedestrian deaths.

So the problem isn’t reckless young drivers.</p><p>What about trends in drug and alcohol use? According to FARS data, deaths that involved drivers drinking are up modestly, but are a very small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. The increase in driver drug use is up by a much greater fraction (more than doubling since 2009), but it’s still a small percentage of pedestrian deaths.</p><p>Interestingly, driver drug and alcohol use in pedestrian fatalities is greatly exceeded by pedestrian alcohol and drug use. (Pedestrian drug use in particular has more than tripled since 2009, while alcohol use is only up modestly.) It’s not enough to explain all of the huge increase in pedestrian deaths, but it’s notable.</p><p>An obvious possible factor in increased deaths is people increasingly distracted by their phones. Unfortunately, FARS data doesn’t give us much to go on here. Since 2010 FARS has tracked whether drivers are distracted (by phones or anything else), but in the vast majority (94%) of cases, drivers are marked “not distracted,” “not reported,” or “unknown.”</p><p>Relatedly, in the majority of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is blamed for the accident. In 66% of cases, pedestrians are described as “failing to yield right of way,” “jaywalking,” or “in roadway improperly.” In 87% of cases, the driver is not charged with anything following the accident. (This doesn’t necessarily mean the pedestrian was at fault — it could simply indicate that in a pedestrian death we only get one side of the story, which makes it hard to charge the driver with a crime.) About 75% of the time, fatal pedestrian accidents occur outside an intersection (a rate which has been steady since 2010), suggesting pedestrians are most often struck outside of a crosswalk.</p><p>One limitation of the FARS data is that it only tracks pedestrian fatalities: it doesn’t give us any information or trends in non-fatal pedestrian accidents. Many states, however, do track this information. The chart below shows the total number of accidents involving a pedestrian, and the number of pedestrian fatalities, for different years for 20 different states.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png" width="694" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:694,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61407,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.construction-physics.com/i/175619659?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zy-a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298b5790-49fa-401c-b110-a939458fe3b0_694x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In nearly every state examined, the fatality rate for pedestrian accidents has risen dramatically in recent years. Oregon went from deaths in 6% of accidents in 2014 to 14% of accidents in 2023. Illinois went from 2.3% of pedestrian accidents being deadly in 2008 to 4.3% in 203. New Mexico went from 8.4% in 2008 to 16.8% in 2023. In many cases, overall pedestrian accidents were flat or even down (Illinois went from 5,877 accidents in 2008 to 4,533 accidents in 2023), even as the number of pedestrian fatalities went up.</p><p><span>Pedestrian accidents getting more deadly seems like fairly strong evidence for the theory that the rise in large SUVs is behind the uptick in pedestrian deaths: it’s not that more pedestrians are getting hit by vehicles, it’s that the ones that are getting hit are more likely to die. There’s other evidence that points to this theory. A </span><a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">study</a><span> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety analyzed 17,897 pedestrian accidents across seven states, and found pedestrians were substantially more likely to be killed when struck by tall vehicles and vehicles with blunt front ends.</span></p><p>However, there’s also some muddying evidence here. If the increase of size and frequency of trucks and SUVs was behind the increase in pedestrian deaths, we wouldn’t expect to see an increase in the frequency of pedestrians killed by sedans or compact cars. However, if we look at pedestrian deaths by model of car, we see that pedestrian deaths involving popular sedans have increased as well.

In some states (such as Texas) the frequency of driver inattention as a factor has increased dramatically over time. But in other states it’s either flat (South Carolina, Kentucky), or has decreased substantially (Arizona, California). This doesn’t necessarily disconfirm the phone theory, as drivers may not be reporting that they were distracted (North Carolina’s annual car crash reports, </span><a href="https://connect.ncdot.gov/business/DMV/Pages/Crash-Facts.aspx" rel="">for instance</a><span>, note that “Driver Distraction is a self-reporting contributing circumstance. Therefore, the data collected may not reflect the severity of this issue.” But it’s some evidence against it.</span></p><p>Similarly, if being distracted by phones was a driver of pedestrian deaths, I’d expect there to be more frequent collisions overall. But the state-level data similarly doesn’t show any consistent trend. In some states (Texas, South Carolina) collisions are up substantially, though the rate of increase is less than for pedestrian deaths. But in California and Georgia, among others, they’re down.</p><p>To recap, here’s what we know about pedestrian deaths.</p><ul><li><p>Pedestrian deaths have risen substantially in the US since 2009, by nearly 80%. This increase is seen across the US, though not in every single state. The increase is highest in states in the West and South. There has not been a similar increase in other types of motor vehicle deaths, or in pedestrian deaths in other countries.</p></li><li><p>The increase has happened almost entirely on urban roads: pedestrian deaths on rural roads have remained roughly constant.</p></li><li><p>There has not been much change in what time of day, day of week, or time of year pedestrian deaths are occurring.</p></li><li><p>The 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets have seen the largest increase in victims. Pedestrian deaths of children and teenagers are down over this period. In terms of drivers, the increase has also been largest in the 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets.</p></li><li><p>It’s hard to pin the increase to any specific driver behavior on the road (including mobile phone use). Drivers are rarely charged with a motor vehicle violation following a pedestrian death, and are rarely categorized as “distracted” (by a phone or anything else). State-level data on frequency of driver inattention shows no consistent trends. Rates of driver drinking are only up modestly; rates of driver drug use have risen greatly in percentage terms, but remain a very small fraction of overall pedestrian death accidents. There doesn’t seem to be a clear trend in rates of collisions overall. Drivers don’t seem to be speeding more.</p></li><li><p>In terms of pedestrian behavior, the number of killed pedestrians believed to be using drugs has risen substantially over the period in question, but is still a small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. Rates of alcohol use by pedestrians have increased modestly. In roughly 2/3rds of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is described as “failing to properly yield,” “jaywalking,” or as otherwise improperly in the roadway.</p></li><li><p>In terms of changes in the nature of vehicles, the fatality rate of pedestrian accidents (the proportion of accidents where a pedestrian is killed) has increased dramatically across many different states, suggesting pedestrian accidents are getting more deadly. The frequency of pedestrian deaths in both trucks/SUVs and sedans/compacts has risen substantially.</p></li></ul><p><span>Unfortunately, this doesn’t all add up to a clear cause. The strongest evidence seems to be for the “Big SUV hypothesis” — it’s hard to see what else could be causing the increase in deadliness of pedestrian accidents, and </span><em>not</em><span> cause a similar increase in other things. The Big SUV hypothesis also seems like something that could be limited to the US. But this on its own isn’t completely satisfying: if its big SUVs, why are pedestrian deaths for sedans increasing too? Why aren’t deaths increasing on rural roads? There are still unanswered questions here.</span></p><p>The evidence does not strongly support the “distracted drivers on cell phones” hypothesis, but neither does it totally disconfirm it. The fact that drivers are rarely charged with anything, and are rarely classified as having been driving distracted, could simply be due to the fact that we rarely get more than the driver’s side of the story in pedestrian fatalities. The fact that there’s not a general trend in more auto collisions, or more pedestrian non-fatal collisions, does push against this theory though.</p><p>Beyond these hypotheses, there’s also some evidence that increased drug use (both in drivers and pedestrians) is a factor in increased deaths, though almost certainly not the main one. We also can’t rule out that increased recklessness or distractedness on the part of pedestrians is playing a role.</p><p>One avenue to try and better understand this problem is to look at the level of individual cities, and to try to figure out why places like Boston and Seattle have so few pedestrian deaths compared to other cities.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	<div>
		<blockquote>We just raised $180 million in Series C funding, bringing our total funding to $240 million and our valuation to $2.5 billion. <p>The round is led by Accel, with support from Meritech, Redpoint, Evantic and Visionaries Club. Corporate investors NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm) and T.Capital also join the round, with previous backers including Felicis Ventures, Sequoia, Highland Europe and HV Capital  making follow-on investments as well</p></blockquote><p>This investment recognises something fundamental: the AI race isn't only about smarter models - it's about who can actually put that intelligence to work reliably, inside actual businesses.</p><p>The AI agent landscape has split into two camps. Some platforms put everything in the hands of AI, you write prompts and hope for the best, with the entire logic determined by the model's interpretation. Others require strict, rule-based routing which is powerful for engineers who code every pathway, but impractical for business users who need to iterate quickly.</p><p>We've learnt from our community that neither extreme serves businesses well. Pure autonomy creates magic when it works but proves too unpredictable for business-critical workflows. Pure rule-based routing offers predictability but demands more time and often developers for every change.</p><p><strong>n8n was built for the reality in between: giving flexible control over where your agents sit on this spectrum</strong>. You choose the balance - how much autonomy to grant, how much logic to enforce, and crucially, how to adjust that balance as you learn what works.</p><p>But controlling this balance is only the foundation. Getting agents into production requires two more crucial elements:</p><p><strong>Orchestration</strong>: Connecting agents to your actual tools and data sources, building in human oversight where needed, and establishing the monitoring and triggers that keep everything running</p><p><strong>Coordination</strong>: Bringing together the people who understand the business need with the builders who can make it work - on the same platform, in real time</p><p>Without both, organisations get stuck in endless development cycles. Engineers build in isolation, business users test and provide feedback, iterations drag on. The agent never reaches production because the people closest to the work can't collaborate effectively with those building the solution.</p><p><strong>The formula we've proven is straightforward: combine AI, code, and humans in the same process, on the same platform</strong>. Technical builders handle architecture whilst domain experts configure and refine. That's coordination, and it only succeeds when the orchestration layer is flexible enough to evolve with your needs.</p><h2 id="our-principles">Our principles</h2><p>We've been building n8n since 2019, first as an automation tool, then as a platform for AI orchestration and cross-team collaboration. Now we're the platform our community and enterprises tell us finally helps them deploy AI in production.&nbsp;</p><p>We've built this alongside a fast-growing community contributing videos, templates, nodes, and more. <strong>A community we'll never stop caring about or restrict access to. Ever.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Flexibility will always be a top product priority. Flexibility to pick any model, connect any tool, and deploy anywhere: our cloud, your server, a Raspberry Pi, or bare metal. Flexibility in the product so it's easy enough to make a quick start but robust enough to handle orchestration's natural complexity.</p><p>From tinkerers automating lights at home to the United Nations running mission-critical workflows at scale, our ambition is clear: <strong>n8n becomes the default platform to build with AI</strong>. And more importantly, to deploy AI.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h2><p>We've made so much progress this year alone: 6x user growth, 10x revenue growth, and major new features like <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/">Evaluations</a>, <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-tables/">Data Tables</a>, and <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/">many more</a> improvements. Yet it still feels early.</p><p>The industry is moving fast, and so are we. This funding accelerates our roadmap: expanding our integrations, empowering the ecosystem to build their own nodes and share them globally, and evolving n8n beyond the canvas into new interfaces that match how different teams work. We're making the platform easier to start with whilst more powerful at scale - because that's what production AI demands. (<a href="https://n8n.io/careers/">We're hiring!</a>)</p><p>Our community is already pushing n8n from a platform into an ecosystem. We're rapidly seeing people build their own businesses around n8n, and we want to support the community to take this further: with education, early access to features, commercial partnerships, and fun <a href="https://luma.com/n8n-events">events</a> to bring everyone together.</p><p>I started n8n to remove repetitive tasks and focus on what I actually enjoyed. Now I see a world where building with AI, leveraging agents to scale yourself, and becoming a 10x operator becomes table stakes, just as using Excel is. The first people who knew Excel were special, but now it's a requirement for many roles.</p><p>The same will happen with AI. And my ambition is that n8n becomes the default platform to build with it.</p>

This landmark law will phase out the most concerning ultra-processed foods from school meals in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The law is based on a simple, common-sense idea: schools should not serve students products that can harm their health or interfere with their ability to learn.</p></div><div><p>California has never waited for Washington or anyone else to lead on kids’ health — we’ve been out front for years, removing harmful additives and improving school nutrition.

<p><small>Governor Gavin Newsom</small></p>
<p>For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important. By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we’re helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn. AB 1264 is the first law of its kind in the nation and builds on California’s long record of leading with children’s health and well-being at the forefront. While Washington debates how to ‘make America healthy again,’ they need not look any further than California.</p>
<p><small>First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom </small></p></div><p><span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Governor-Newsom-Signs-Legislation-Phasing-Out-Ultra-Processed-Foods-from-School-Meals-PRESS-RELEASE-GIF.gif" alt="" title=""></span>
			</p><div><p>“With Governor Newsom’s signature on AB 1264, California has taken a historic step toward protecting our children from harmful ultra-processed foods and chemical additives,” <strong>said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel</strong>. “While Washington DC is paralyzed by inaction, California is once again leading the nation with a bipartisan, commonsense, science-based approach. Here in the Golden State, Democrats and Republicans are joining forces to ensure that students are receiving healthy, nutritious meals that are made from real foods, not harmful chemical additives. I applaud Governor Newsom for his continued leadership on food safety and I am grateful to the dedicated advocates from around the country who worked tirelessly to help us pass this important new law.”</p>
<p>California’s work to promote healthier school food long predates the national “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Since taking office, Governor Newsom and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom have advanced a series of first-in-the-nation reforms to eliminate toxic additives, strengthen nutrition standards, and expand healthy food access in schools statewide.</p></div><p><span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2560px, 100vw"></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p><span>Meta open-sourced React over a decade ago to help developers build better user experiences. Since then, React has grown into one of the world’s most popular open source projects,</span><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/React"> <span>powering over 50 million websites</span></a><span> and products built by</span><a href="https://reactnative.dev/showcase"> <span>companies such as Microsoft, Shopify, Bloomberg, Discord, Coinbase, the NFL, and many others</span></a><span>. With React Native, React has expanded to support platforms beyond the web, including mobile, tablets, desktops, TVs, gaming consoles, and even mixed reality devices.</span></p>
<p><span>This incredible growth is thanks to the thousands of educators, companies, and projects that have contributed to the development of React. The community is the heart of React, and we’re proud to play a part in the cycle of open source innovation throughout the ecosystem that benefits everyone. We’re pleased to give a seat at the table to the people and companies that have made React what it is today.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we are excited to announce the next step for React. Several projects within the React ecosystem, including React and React Native, as well as supporting projects such as JSX, will transition to the React Foundation. The React Foundation’s mission is to help the React community and its members. The React Foundation will maintain React’s infrastructure, organize</span><a href="https://conf.react.dev/"> <span>React Conf</span></a><span>, and create initiatives to support the React ecosystem. The React Foundation will be part of the Linux Foundation, which has long fostered a vendor-neutral environment for open source projects.</span></p>
<h2>Formalizing Governance</h2>
<p><span>The React Foundation’s governing board will consist of representatives from Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel, with the intention to expand further over time.</span></p>
<p><span>There will be a clear separation between the business and technical governance of React. Releases, features, and technical direction will be governed by a new structure driven by the maintainers and contributors of React. This new technical governance structure will be independent of the React Foundation. The React team is actively working on this new technical governance structure and will share more details in a future post on </span><a href="https://react.dev/blog"><span>the React blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2>Meta and the React Foundation</h2>
<p><span>Meta is committing to a five-year partnership with the React Foundation, including over $3 million in funding and dedicated engineering support. This investment will ensure React’s smooth transition to independent governance while maintaining the stability and innovation the community expects. Meta will continue to invest in React and use it as our primary tool for building UI on the web and across many of Meta’s apps. Meta will also continue to have a dedicated team of engineers working full-time on React and React Native.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe the best of React is yet to come. The React Foundation will unlock new opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth that will benefit the entire ecosystem. We’re excited to see what the community will build together under this new model. With strengthened governance, broader industry participation, and continued technical excellence, React is positioned to tackle the next generation of challenges in UI development.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5885">
	

	<div>
			
<p>On June 30, 2025, Mark Brittenham and Susan Hermiller uploaded a preprint to the arXiv called  “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24088">Unknotting number is not additive under connected sum</a>” (and an updated version on September 15, 2025). In it, they surprised the mathematical community by giving a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture in knot theory. The story was picked up by publications like <em><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-knot-theory-discovery-overturns-long-held-mathematical-assumption/">Scientific American</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-simple-way-to-measure-knots-has-come-unraveled-20250922/">Quanta</a></em> and by math YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7f-nGohVc">Matt Parker</a>.</p>



<p>The conjecture is easy to understand, although we need a few definitions first. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory">(Mathematical) knot</a></strong>: We can think of a mathematical knot as a loop of string sitting in three-dimensional space. In other words, if we took a piece of string, tied a knot, and then glued the two ends together, we’d get a mathematical knot.</p>



<p><strong>Knot projection:</strong> Given any mathematical knot, we draw a two-dimensional version of it in the plane. It is like the shadow of the knot, but with breaks in the knot to indicate which strand is on top and which is on the bottom.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_number">Unknotting number</a>:</strong> If we have the projection of a knot, we can change some crossings (change which strand is over and which is under) to make it unknotted (called the unknot). To compute the unknotting number of a knot <em>K</em>, <em>u</em>(<em>K</em>), we look at all possible projections and find the fewest number of crossing changes we must make to obtain the unknot.</p>



<p><strong>Connected sum:</strong> Given two knots, <em>J</em> and <em>K</em>, we can cut each knot at one point and join the cut ends to form a new, larger knot, <em>J</em>#<em>K</em>. This is called the connected sum of the knots.</p>



<p>Below, we see a knot called the (2,7) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot">torus knot</a> and its mirror image (left), and their connected sum on the right.</p>



<figure><a href="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5893" data-permalink="https://divisbyzero.com/1-2/" data-orig-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" data-orig-size="917,1017" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=271" data-large-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=917" width="917" height="1017" src="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Although unknotting numbers are notoriously difficult to compute, we know that the unknotting number of a (<em>p,q</em>) torus knot is (p-1)(q-1)/2. So, the (2,7) torus knots above have unknotting number (2&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)(7&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. It is not difficult to check that by changing three crossings of the projections shown above, the (2,7) torus knot becomes the unknot. It turns out that changing two crossings does not suffice in this projection or any projection.</p>



<p>Likewise, changing 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 crossings of the connected sum will yield the unknot. In fact, it will always be the case that <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;≤<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). The question is: are these equal? An “old” conjecture (which was implicit in an article 88 years ago), states:</p>



<p><strong>Conjecture: </strong>If <em>J</em> and <em>K</em> are knots, then <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;=<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). </p>



<p>In their preprint, Brittenham and Hermiller disprove the conjecture by giving a counterexample! Moreover, the counterexample is precisely the one I’ve shown above! The connected sum of the torus knot with its mirror image has unknotting number 5, which is clearly less than&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3. </p>



<p>That said, we can’t simply change the five crossings in the above projection to obtain the unknot. We must produce a different projection first. But what is it?</p>



<p>I looked for the answer online and found this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14265">arXiv preprint</a> by Chao Wang and Yimu Zhang, which gives the details. They provide the projection and the crossings that must be changed. However, the projection has 56 crossings (far more than the original 14!). They assert, but do not show, that the resulting knot—after the five crossings are changed—is the unknot. They end by writing, “We prefer to leave it to the readers as an interesting game.”</p>



<p>Never good at resisting a good <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniping</a>, I decided to take them up on the challenge. I’m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to confirm their work, but I did it. Here is my redrawn version of the knot projection—the connected sum of the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror image. The circled crossings are the five that must be changed.</p>

<p>After having done so, here’s the resulting projection. Wang and Zhang claim that it is the unknot!</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my drawings. This first sequence shows how I get from the usual projection of the connected sum to the projection in which the crossings must be made. The red strands show the part of the projection that has changed from the previous projection.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p> California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a bill which requires web browsers to make it easier for Californians to opt-out of allowing third parties to sell their data. </p><p> The California Consumer Privacy Act, signed in 2018, gave Californians the right to send opt-out signals, but major browsers have not had to make opt-outs simple to use. The bill signed Wednesday would require them to set up an easy-to-find mechanism that lets Californians opt-out with the push of a button, instead of having to do so repeatedly when visiting individual websites. </p><p> Privacy and consumer rights activists have been nervously waiting for Newsom to sign the bill, which <a href="https://therecord.media/california-legislature-passes-bill-data-sharing-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> the California legislature on September 11 and is the first law in the country of its kind. The governor had vetoed a similar but broader bill last year which also applied to mobile operating systems. </p><p> “These signals are going to be available to millions more people and it's going to be much easier for them to opt out,” said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports. </p><p> Until now, Schwartz said, individuals who want to use a universal opt out have had to download third party browser extensions or use a privacy protective browser. </p><p> Other bills signed by Newsom on Wednesday also give Californians important data privacy rights.&nbsp; </p><p> One of them requires social media companies to make it easy to cancel accounts and mandates that cancellation lead to full deletion of consumers’ data. A second bolsters the state’s Data Broker Registration Law by giving consumers more information about what personal data is collected by data brokers and who can obtain it. </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This is the first in a series of blog posts describing my experience developing a low latency 10G Ethernet core for FPGA. I decided to do this as a personal project to develop expertise in low latency FPGA design and high-speed Ethernet, as well as to experiment with tools and techniques that I could use full-time. As a small spoiler, the design has less than <strong>60ns loopback latency</strong>, which is comparable to commercial offerings.</p>

<p>These posts will focus on the things that are likely different to a ‘standard’ design, as I believe this will be more interesting to the reader. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of <a href="https://www.cocotb.org/">cocotb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyuvm/pyuvm">pyuvm</a> for verification</li>
  <li>The techniques implemented to reduce packet processing latency</li>
  <li>Analysis of commercially available low latency and ‘ultra’-low latency cores</li>
  <li>Latency measurement results and comparison</li>
  <li>Other techniques not implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you decide to start a coding bootcamp. Your background is in pedagogy and you love teaching. Your parents were teachers.</p>



<p>You find a co-founder, raise a bit of money, and pour your soul into your company.</p>



<p>The first couple of years, students<em> love</em> your program. Positive feedback, extraordinary student outcomes, employees love the mission. You are quite literally changing lives.</p>



<p>Your business grows. One day, you realize you’ve grown to 70 employees.</p>



<p>And then…</p>



<p>A competitor gets control of the main subreddit for your industry by becoming a Reddit Moderator.</p>



<p>That watering hole becomes their megaphone. They are not shy about using it. An all-out attack on your brand begins. The barrage of accusations and harassment are relentless. The attacks happen daily. You become a neurotic fixation of the moderator. Every little thing you do represents your failings as a company.</p>



<p>You get compared to a sex cult. One of your employees is accused of nepotism. The mod starts joining your company information sessions for prospective students, slinging conspiracy theories at every turn under a pseudonym. You avoid outright bans to avoid appearing biased yourself. Your own employees start wondering if these accusations have merit, some leave.</p>



<p>Even worse, confidential information from your company starts leaking out. There’s a mole. Or at least your team suspects it. No one knows who to trust. Your carefully built company culture? Eviscerated from the inside out.</p>



<p>Any time you attempt to defend yourself in the main subreddit, posts get deleted. Or you’re accused of running a Reddit bot army.</p>



<p>This goes on for years.</p>



<p>Every day, another attack. Every fucking day.</p>



<p>Student applications drop. First a little… then a lot.</p>



<p>Combined with a market downtown, your revenue collapses by 80%.</p>



<p>You go through 2 layoffs just to keep the lights on. A bunch of other folks move on. You’re down to 15 employees now.</p>



<p>The attacks don’t stop. If anything, they escalate.</p>



<p>And you begin to wonder, as the CEO and founder of your company… “Maybe I’m the problem? Maybe I <em>am</em> doing something wrong? Or somehow encouraging these attacks on my company?”</p>



<p>You make a decision to leave.</p>



<p>You step down, walk away from everything you built, and start anew.</p>



<p>But even then, the attacks don’t stop. Nothing can stop this nightmare.</p>



<p>This is the story of Will Sentance and his company, Codesmith.</p>



<p>It can happen to your business too.</p>



<h2>The Codesmith Reputation Attack via Google</h2>



<p>For many businesses, the first page of Google for their brand name is the single most important asset for managing their reputation.</p>



<p>Let’s say I’m considering a bootcamp, I hear about “Codesmith,” and pop it into Google.</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2034" height="1674" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png 2034w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-300x247.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1024x843.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-768x632.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1536x1264.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me that’s bad. This is the number 2 result right after the company website.</p>



<ul>
<li>“Codesmith is an enormous waste of money”</li>



<li>“Do Not Go To Codesmith”</li>
</ul>



<p>I don’t even have to click, Google is serving that stuff up right under the company’s website. God damn.</p>



<p>That top Reddit thread has been ranking highly for Codesmith brand terms since Sept 2024. That’s a year’s worth of brand carnage.</p>



<p><strong>Pay close attention to the subreddit all those threads are from: r/codingbootcamp. That’s the key to all this.</strong></p>



<h2>Are LLMs Also a Reputation Attack Vector on Codesmith?</h2>



<p>Yup.</p>



<p>My prompt in ChatGPT was “is codesmith a good bootcamp?”.</p>



<p>The intro has a bunch of standard stuff, and then there was this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="608" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-300x178.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-768x456.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1536x911.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Same Reddit threads are featured, same brand-destroying quotes.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.cirr.org/">CIRR</a> is a nonprofit in the bootcamp industry that collects graduation data across the industry. It’s a neutral third-party with the goal of providing transparency on student outcomes across coding bootcamps. If your graduation rates are solid, wouldn’t it make sense for a competitor to call that data into question? ChatGPT is regurgitating those same doubts here.</p>



<p>At this point, I’ve done a quick brand search and asked ChatGPT if Codesmith is any good. I already have a TON of doubts as a prospect.</p>



<p>I don’t believe this is an accident. Or a result of Codesmith’s actual quality as a bootcamp.</p>



<p>I believe this brand attack is the result of one person’s actions.</p>



<p>When I’ve researched Codesmith’s brand, every Reddit thread I’ve seen in Google and various LLMs have all been from a single subreddit: r/codingbootcamp. That subreddit is controlled by the Reddit Moderator Michael Novati.</p>



<h2>Who is Michael Novati?</h2>



<p>For the best recap of Michael, listen to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">this interview from Pragmatic Engineer Gergely Orosz</a>.</p>



<p>The highlights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael joined Facebook early in 2009.</li>



<li>As he tells it, went through a bunch of promotions quickly and made it to Principal Software Engineer (E7).</li>



<li>Left Facebook in 2017.</li>



<li>In 2019, co-founded his dev bootcamp, Formation, with his wife, Sophie Novati. His wife is the CEO, Michael took the CTO title.</li>
</ul>



<p>In that interview, Michael tells a story about playing Risk (the board game) with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>“<em>The way we became friends, he [Zuckerberg] used to play Risk, the board game. I think it was once a week that people would get together. Like 4 or 5 people. He would show up often and I really liked Risk. I would always play Risk as a kid for whatever reason, I don’t even know why.</em></p>



<p><em>And one day, we’re down to the final three people. And it was me, him, and I was losing. Mark was in second place, the leader was taking over.</em></p>



<p><em>I did a really.. uhhh.. let’s say delicate, strategic maneuver. Where I made an alliance with him to share resources and go after the first place person. So he went all in on the first place person.</em></p>



<p><em>My turn’s next. I did not go all in against the first place person, I took over Mark’s remaining resources. He just dwindled going after the first place person. He accepted my friendship request [on Facebook] very shortly that evening.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s weird, I basically backstabbed him in the game, really bad. Blatantly to his face. But it’s the game, that’s what Risk is. It’s a strategy game. I think he appreciated the strategy I had. It made him feel more like he could trust me. Even though I backstabbed him, he knows where my strategic thinking is coming from.</em>“</p>



<p>Now, is this just a funny anecdote about an early Facebook backstabbing Mark Zuckerberg and then becoming friends? Maybe.</p>



<p>For me, it tells me a lot about how Michael Novati plays competitive games. In my experience, people tend to run businesses the same way they compete at anything. Maybe Michael is the exception.</p>



<p>I do have to admit, it takes some real cojones to fuck over your boss that hard in a board game. Especially when that boss is Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>One last note: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/software-engineer-training-platform-formation-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Formation raised a $4M seed round in 2021, led by Andreessen Horowitz.</a></p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Control Over the Coding Bootcamp Industry</h2>



<p>Michael Novati’s power over the coding bootcamp industry comes from one place: being a moderator on the subreddit r/codingbootcamp.</p>



<p>He is, by far, the most active moderator for the subreddit. You’ll bump into him immediately just by visiting the subreddit:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-300x172.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-768x440.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1536x879.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-2048x1172.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>What about the other mods?</p>



<ul>
<li>u/samabuna hasn’t posted in about 8 years.</li>



<li>u/dowcet/ is still active on Reddit but rarely posts in r/codingbootcamp. When I checked, I only found one comment in the preceeding 1-2 months.</li>
</ul>



<p>So the subreddit is Michael Novati’s show. Full stop.</p>



<p>We have to remember that Reddit isn’t just Reddit anymore. The powers that be have decided that Reddit is infallible, a reliable set of training data for LLMs, and should be featured fucking everywhere.</p>



<p>Before we get to what Michael has actually done, let’s lay out the potential power for anyone that gets control of a key subreddit in their industry:</p>



<ul>
<li>If the subreddit is greenlit by Google, threads in your subreddit can easily pop to the top of Google searches that are extremely valuable to your business. Brand terms, review terms, product categories, major how-to topics, all of it.</li>



<li>LLMs prioritize Reddit heavily. If you want to spin conspiracy theories, those conspiracies will start to become part of the zeitgeist as every LLM regurgitates them.</li>



<li>Skew the narrative for long enough and it’ll be impossible for ANY prospect to not stumble across your skewed narrative when they’re researching products or services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can delete posts and comments at will. Want to tip the narrative in your favor? Just delete some of the positive posts of your competitors. To cover your tracks, make up claims about a bot army that’s run by your competitor. You’re fighting the good fight and keeping the barbarians at bay! You don’t even need to actively post negative stuff (but you can if you want to dial up the torture). Just removing positive stuff skews the narrative nicely.</li>



<li>You can ban users at will. Got some troublesome competitors fighting back? Just delete the little shits.</li>



<li>You can pin posts in the subreddit and comments within posts. Great tactic for pushing a narrative when you really need to.</li>
</ul>



<p>What about recourse from your competitors? Can they do anything to stop you?</p>



<p>You can only lose your moderator slot in a few instances:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Reddit Admis get involved, actual Reddit employees. Stuff has to get pretty egregious for that.</li>



<li>Moderators further up the mod list can kick you out. But if you get on good terms with them, or they don’t care, you have free reign.</li>



<li>If there are other mods below you AND you go inactive, you can get kicked by them too. So don’t let any new mods in. And always stay active. Simple.</li>
</ul>



<p>No one else across the industry can do a damn thing. You get to act with impunity.</p>



<p>To be clear, any moderator of an industry subreddit has this power. That’s not a subjective opinion, it’s a fact. That’s how our online platforms currently work.</p>



<p>Michael Novati has this power over the bootcamp industry. Did he wield it benevolently? If he did, I wouldn’t be writing this fucking post.</p>



<h2>How Michael Distorts Narratives on Reddit</h2>



<p>At first, I was going to go through a bunch of Michael Novati’s claims and debunk them.</p>



<p>Then I realized I was missing the entire point.</p>



<p>This isn’t a normal debate where there are two sides of the truth and we need to sort through it to get to the real answer.</p>



<p>It’s about one side torching the truth with a firehose of chaos and distortion.</p>



<p>Prospects in the bootcamp space are evaluating whether or not to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. It’s the price of a goddamn car. It doesn’t take much to get someone to pause and redirect their purchase journey.</p>



<p>So let’s go through a few of the worst examples.</p>



<h3>Compare Your Competitor to a Sex Cult (Loosely for Deniability)</h3>



<p>Here’s a fucked up one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Reddit user, with a first-time post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/12r57se/as_a_former_codesmith_employee_codesmith_is_an/">posts a major takedown of Codesmith</a>, claiming to be a former employee. Tons of allegations about mismanagement, poor curriculum, and backroom dealing with CIRR. I personally think these allegations are bullshit but that’s not the most fucked up part in this thread.</p>



<p>u/rosiebeir joins the conversation and gives a measured take on their experience as a student in Codesmith:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="317" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-300x93.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-768x238.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png 1428w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the comment is about different aspects of the Codesmith program that could be improved. It all feels genuine to me. Further down, they say this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="206" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-300x60.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-768x155.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png 1320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Wow, that’s a helluva endorsement.</p>



<p>This is where Michael jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-300x273.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-768x699.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png 1312w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with NXIVM (Michael got the spelling wrong), go watch The Vow on HBO. Short story: NXIVM was a sex cult disguised as a self-improvement group and the founder went to prison.</p>



<p>Did Michael just compare Codemith to a goddamn sex cult? Yes he did folks.</p>



<p>Let’s put aside the subject matter for a second. Michael’s use of rhetoric is a master class on how to destroy someone’s reputation without technically saying the horrible thing you’re actually saying.</p>



<p>Michael takes an incredible testimonial from a student (“Codesmith changed my life”), and associates that comment with the sort of things he hears from sex cults. He doesn’t technically call Codesmith a sex cult, he merely makes the association. He also wraps it with other positive comments to look more measured: “something I hear very often” and “I love that Codesmith changed your life.” But these aren’t good things, they’re red flags! Sex cults do the same thing! Someone could get taken advantage of!</p>



<p>Oh so innocent aren’t we Michael?</p>



<p>Now any time a bootcamp prospect wanders into this thread:</p>



<ul>
<li>They see the genuine, positive review from a former student.</li>



<li>A supposed figure of authority (a Reddit moderator), plants a seed questioning that testimonial.</li>



<li>The same mod connects Codesmith to a sex cult in a way that also offers complete deniability.</li>



<li>To top it all off, most folks won’t realize that the Reddit mod is a cofounder of a competing company.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bravo Michael, brav-fucking-o.</p>



<h3>From Reddit Troll to LinkedIn Stalker: The Unhinged Escalation</h3>



<p>This one might piss me off the most.</p>



<p>Michael doesn’t just go after employees, he goes after their <em>kids</em>.</p>



<p>This is a Reddit post about a defunct Codesmith program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-300x104.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-768x267.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1536x535.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png 1608w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Somehow, as these threads often do, the conversation turns into an all-out attack on Codesmith. This time, Michael goes after Eric Kirsten, a Senior Advisor at Codesmith. Eric spends a good chunk of his time mentoring Codesmith students and helping prepare them for the job hunt.</p>



<p>Here’s Michael’s post:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-300x225.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-768x576.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png 1408w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I do not know what the original comment in this thread was (very convenient). But I do have the original comment from Michael before he edited it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-300x171.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-768x437.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I talked with Eric myself, here’s the real story:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eric’s wife did a one-time contract project with Codesmith for 9 months.</li>



<li>His son joined as a Codesmith student and had a great outcome. They paid the full program cost and his son went through the normal application process just like everyone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p>



<p>Michael also decided to email multiple executives at Codesmith about Eric’s son:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="394" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-300x116.jpeg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-768x296.jpeg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1536x591.jpeg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg 1714w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’ve redacted the son’s name and details because WHY THE FUCK WOULD WE BRING SOMEONE’S KID INTO THIS?</p>



<p>I don’t think I could possibly swear enough in order to convey how utterly insane all this is.</p>



<p>Just imagine this happening at your own company:</p>



<ul>
<li>A cofounder of your competitor, starts attacking one of your employees on Reddit.</li>



<li>Then that cofounder starts LOOKING UP THEIR KIDS ON LINKEDIN</li>



<li>They post weird mentions on Reddit about that kid, accusing your company of nepotism.</li>



<li>THEN EMAILS you and other executives, accusing the kid of falsifying their LinkedIn, threatening to keep calling it out in public.</li>
</ul>



<p>WHAT.</p>



<p>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</p>



<p>What would you do in this situation?</p>



<p>I’m not sure what I would do. But there is no world where this is normal or okay.</p>



<h3>The Great OSP Conspiracy for Manufactured Outrage</h3>



<p>Another favorite tactic of Michael is to take something obscure, and allude to some grand conspiracy behind it.</p>



<p>Like OSPs.</p>



<p>OSP stands for open-source product. It’s a built-in part of the Codesmith program, the capstone project. Here’s how Codesmith explains it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="389" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-300x114.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-768x292.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png 1378w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This seems incredibly boring, how the hell could someone possibly turn this into a controversy?</p>



<p>If you’re asking that question, you’ve severely underestimated Michael.</p>



<p>A since-deleted Reddit account posted this thread (convenient that it’s a deleted user huh?):</p>

<p>They claim Codesmith students are using OSPs to inflate their resumes to get jobs faster. And that this is endemic at Codesmith.</p>



<p>The comments are a dumpster fire. Michael has posted 11 of the comments, almost a third of the entire conversation.</p>



<p>A former Codesmith student jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="261" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-300x76.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-768x196.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png 1524w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s some back an forth between u/peppimenti and other Reddit users, then Michael responds:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="782" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-300x229.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-768x586.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png 1326w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me, that’s a lot to take in.</p>



<p>Quick tangent: this is another one of Michael’s tactics. Make accusations faster than anyone can possibly fact check them or even process them. I still haven’t figured out what that Phil Troutman reference is.</p>



<p>To summarize, Michael claims he has evidence that Codesmith is aware of the lying on resumes, alludes to a conspiracy with OSLabs, and he believes Codesmith helped verify some of this lying.</p>



<p>Then he associates all of this with “conspiring to commit fraud” and that it’s a “jail-able crime.”</p>



<p>We’ve gone from “Codesmith students complete an OSP during their program” to a shadowy conspiracy and fraud via student resumes. God damn did that escalate.</p>



<p>So I got a hold of the exact SOP that is given by Codesmith to students on how to write their resume. Here’s the section on OSPs:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-300x158.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-768x404.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png 1206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Codesmith is telling students explicitly not to misrepresent their experience with OSPs as a role at a company. They advocate for transparency, as they should. What students do with that is up to them. And even if some students stretch the truth, no hiring manager is getting fooled by that. End of story.</p>



<p>What about the OSLabs stuff?</p>



<p>When I chatted with Alina (the current CEO of Codesmith), here’s what she had to say on how Codesmith students interact with <a href="https://www.opensourcelabs.io/">OSLabs</a>:</p>



<p>“<em>They [students] get a chance to work on it [projects]. Once those are ready, they submit to OSLabs who keeps the repository and manages the repository. There’s no kind of financial exchange or anything like that. They just hold the repository of the open source dev tools.</em>“</p>



<p>OSLabs is just a nonprofit that manages student repos. That’s it.</p>



<p>Maybe you think there are problems with Codesmith’s guidance. Real quick, why don’t we check some of Michael’s own students from his bootcamp company, Formation?</p>



<p>There’s tons of students on his site. Some of them get featured heavily, like here:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png 702w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-206x300.png 206w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-768x1120.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-1053x1536.png 1053w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png 1316w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a></figure>



<p>Here’s Carlitos’ LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="807" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-300x236.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-768x605.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1536x1211.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png 1644w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Carlitos is listing his time at Michael’s bootcamp/training company in his experience section. The exact same thing that Michael RAILS on Codesmith for.</p>



<p>To be clear: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this. Carlitos, all the Codesmith students, or ANY student from ANY bootcamp have done nothing wrong by putting stuff like this on their resumes. If Formation students list their time like this, I don’t see anything wrong with that either.</p>



<p>In the thousands of resumes I’ve reviewed, I’ve never had any trouble differentiating between full-time roles, part-time, freelance, training, or any other random item on a resume. Any hiring manager will sniff this stuff from a mile away. No one is fooling anyone.</p>



<p>But Michael has now turned this into a story of fraud facilitated by Codesmith. And here I am writing hundreds of words about this nonsense. There’s nothing here beyond what Michael has conjured into the ether of Reddit.</p>



<p>You might disagree with some of the guidance that Codesmith gives its graduates but no one is doing anything wrong. It sure as fuck aint fraud.</p>



<p>And that’s what Michael is so damn good at, turning innocuous little things into grand conspiracies that take hours of research to untangle.</p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Nonstop Attack Campaign Against Codesmith</h2>



<p>Think I’m cherry picking examples of Michael’s posts?</p>



<p>Let’s zoom out.</p>



<p>My team and I looked at every Reddit post and comment made by Michael Novati over the past 3 months.</p>



<p>We then catalogued the posts that mentioned Codesmith or were referencing Codesmith based on context. Next we categorized those posts based on if the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative towards Codesmith.</p>



<p>Here’s all the days that had negative comments along with their frequency over the past few months:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="939" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-300x275.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-768x704.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fucking relentless.</p>



<p>It’s easier to highlight days where Michael DOESN’T talk about Codesmith. Dude, get a fucking hobby.</p>



<p>What if the past few months don’t adequately reflect Michael’s posting history? What if recent events have just been a negative phase of the bootcamp space? Can we really make any claims using just the last few months?</p>



<p>Fine, let’s go further.</p>



<p>I went to my team and said “fuck it, let’s go back as far as possible.” So we went through all of Michael’s posts since June 2024. That’s when Reddit stops making it easy to pull up comments. Yes, we looked at every post and comment from over a year. No fast and dirty AI analysis here, we did it by hand.</p>



<p>Here’s the timeline of negative posts and comments since June 2024:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png 878w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-257x300.png 257w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-768x896.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>



<p>Who has the time for this?</p>



<p>In order to adequately show how often Michael posts negative comments about Codesmith, we had to use HABIT TRACKER VISUALIZATIONS.</p>



<p>It’s relentless, it’s nonstop, and in my opinion, completely unhinged. At least Michael slows down a tad during the holidays. Otherwise, he’s all gas, no breaks.</p>



<p>Well, alright, MAYBE Michael was posting in such absurd volume that the positive mentions outweigh the negative? Maybe I’m selectively pulling data?</p>



<p>NOPE.</p>



<p>The comments about Codesmith are severely overweighted on the negative side. In aggregate, here’s how the sentiment breaks down:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-300x200.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-768x512.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Is it just me or is there a weeeee bit of bias in this posting?</p>



<p>Yes, yes, there fucking is.</p>



<p>Alright, fine, MAYBE all this negative attention is deserved. Maybe Codesmith is the villain that Michael claims. Let’s find out.</p>



<h2>Other Bootcamp Competitors Hold Codesmith in High Regard</h2>



<p>I interviewed 10 different folks. Including students, multiple Codesmith employees from the leadership team, and founders of competing coding bootcamps. I dug through countless docs, many of them internal, and probably annoyed some of these folks with my endless requests for screenshots to verify stories.</p>



<p>Overall, I found everyone at Codesmith to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extremely responsive and on top of their shit. They made promises and kept them.</li>



<li>Transparent to an absurd degree.</li>



<li>Humble, honest, and self-aware.</li>



<li>A desire to do the right thing even at their detriment. These folks don’t know how to play offense, they assume good intent from everyone.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, these are good folks. Faultless? Of course not, everyone makes mistakes.</p>



<p>But I do believe that the world is better with Codesmith in it.</p>



<p>Which makes this whole situation all the more tragic.</p>



<p>Michael isn’t waging some war against another competitor hellbent on profit-seeking. These are folks that are helping people transition their careers. They are quite literally helping people change their lives. And they’re doing it for the right reasons in my opinion.</p>



<p>Don’t take my word for it.</p>



<p>I spoke with Anthony Hughes, a co-founder of <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, another bootcamp. Here’s what he had to say about Codesmith: “The folks at Codesmith were competitors of Tech Elevator. Especially as everyone went online, we competed directly. I never minded losing to Codesmith. Either choice by students was a good one, both our programs vetted students heavily and would get students great outcomes. If we ever lost to Codesmith, we could accept that because we knew the student would get the outcome they wanted. Not like the lower-quality major programs.”</p>



<p>I also heard the same from Kush Patel, a co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> “Codesmith is one of the best players in the space. They run their programs in a way that we benchmarked against. There are plenty of other schools that are questionable and are not getting any scrutiny from Michael.”</p>



<p>We have two co-founders of competing bootcamps saying that Codesmith is <em>one of the good ones</em>. Are there shady bootcamps out there? Absolutely. But Codesmith isn’t one of them.</p>



<h2>The Tactics Michael Uses to Wage His PR Nightmare Campaign</h2>



<p>After reading hundreds of Michael’s posts, a few patterns emerge on how he attacks Codesmith.</p>



<p>To be honest, it’s a masterclass on how to gut your opponent via PR. If every move is intentional by Michael, I gotta hand it to him becasue he’s exceptionally good at this.</p>



<p>Here are the most prominent tactics I saw:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Relentless volume.</strong> It’s not enough to post a few days. If you want to destroy someone’s reputation, you gotta hammer the shit outta that drum. Over a 487 day period, we counted 425 negative posts on Codesmith. That’s an average of 0.87 negative posts per day. A negative post almost every fucking day.</li>



<li><strong>Reference multiple conspiracies at the same time.</strong> If you only mention one conspiracy, folks have a straightforward path to getting to the truth. But if you mention 3-4 at the same time? Only the true masochistics like myself will even attempt to pull it apart.</li>



<li><strong>Rarely, if ever, state your full accusation.</strong> For any single conspiracy, always allude to it. Don’t make a full, comprehensive case that allows someone to see the full picture. Let your audience sit with the uncertainty. You don’t need to win the argument, you only need to sow doubt and fear.</li>



<li><strong>Cherry-pick data.</strong> As the saying goes: “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” For any industry data you can get your hands on, find the slice that skews the narrative in your favor. Don’t worry about anyone fact-checking, they never do.</li>



<li><strong>Attack every misstep, no matter how obscure.</strong> Sooner or later, your victim will make mistakes. When they do, attack. No matter how small or obscure, blow it up into a major drama. Hype, distort, and magnify.</li>



<li><strong>Take down third-party arbitrators.</strong> If your industry has some sort of credential, certification, or regulator, attack that body just as much as your competitor. If your competitor has optimized for this transparency, you’ll turn their strength into a weakness. Even better, accuse both parties of conspiring together.</li>



<li><strong>Blame the victim.</strong> Whenever someone mentions that you’re going too hard, say that your competitor is forcing your hand. “You’d love to move on! You don’t want to spend your time on all this! If ONLY your competitor would do the right thing, then all this would stop!” But we all know it’ll never stop.</li>



<li><strong>Delete comments and posts.</strong> Delete comments and posts to skew the narrative in your favor. You don’t need to delete everything, just enough to make the conversation messy and difficult to follow. And a few key deletions tilts the scales in your favor.</li>



<li><strong>Make your claims squishy.</strong> Don’t ever say your competitor is a cult or committing fraud. Say that things look like it, or remind you of it. You’ll have deniability while the association still gets planted in the minds of your audience.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sign of the times.</p>



<h2>The Impact on Codesmith</h2>



<p>Has all this had a material impact on Codesmith?</p>



<p>I spoke to both Will Sentence (former CEO and co-founder) and Alina Vasile (the current CEO). When I asked them how much revenue has declined at Codesmith since their peak, they both told me about 80%.</p>



<p>Then I asked how much of that was due to everything on Reddit. They said about half of the decline, so a 40% drop came from the negative PR on Reddit. And the other 40% is from a slowdown in the bootcamp market.</p>



<p>Will told me that Codesmith reached a high of $23.5M in revenue. A 40% hit from Reddit means a revenue drop of $9.4M.</p>



<p>What about the emotional toll?</p>



<p>I asked Will Sentance how it all impacted him “It made me doubt how I can start anything after. Michael Novati is still going at it by commenting on my fellowship at Oxford. And Reddit is so visible in Google – at a meeting last week in the UK, the person used ChatGPT to look up Codesmith and it referenced all those Reddit posts. I have genuine caution about launching new stuff.”</p>



<p>Even after leaving Codesmith, the Reddit harassment still impacts Will.</p>



<p>Students also feel deeply uncomfortable with Michael’s actions.</p>



<p>I spoke with a former employee from Codesmith who told me “I was a teacher at Codesmith and the primary reason for moving away from teaching was MIchael Novati. I signed up to help a team of great people help people achieve their goals like I did, I didn’t sign up to be targeted and attacked by a Reddit troll. It took a toll on my mental health and I decided to step back to focus on my day job at Microsoft.”</p>



<p>Here’s another instance of a student calling Michael out on LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="752" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png 752w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-220x300.png 220w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-768x1046.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png 1088w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"></a></figure>



<p>And another student that reached out to Will Sentence:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="2560" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png 604w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-71x300.png 71w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-483x2048.png 483w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></figure>



<p>My sources also told me:</p>



<ul>
<li>An executive was threatened after moving to another company, accusations were going to be raised over IP conflicts. These accusations appear meritless and ridiculous to me.</li>



<li>The morale at Codesmith has sharply declined.</li>



<li>Some employees have had mental health difficulties, some left Codesmith.</li>



<li>One contractor ended their working relationship with Codesmith because of a fear of being dragged into all this.</li>



<li>An employee was doxxed after posting in the /r/codingbootcamp subreddit.</li>



<li>Prospective students have pulled applications.</li>



<li>Students that had amazing outcomes are afraid to post about their experiences.</li>



<li>After graduating, some students began questioning their own experience and considered going back to their old careers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As much as I wanted to detail these stories, I had a lot of requests from sources to remain anonymous. Even when folks went through some heinous shit from all this, they specifically requested not to be included.</p>



<p>It is difficult to understate the impact that Michael’s actions have had on Codesmith.</p>



<h2>Is Michael Novati Breaking the Moderator Code of Conduct on Reddit?</h2>



<p>I think so. But it’s not my call.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct">Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct</a> says this:</p>

<p>So what counts as compensation?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="784" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-300x230.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-768x588.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png 1364w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Basically, Reddit Moderators can’t receive compensation for doing basic moderator tasks. Good rule, the point is to prevent companies and third-parties from paying Reddit mods off.</p>



<p>Now here’s the tricky part.</p>



<p>What if that Reddit Moderator is a co-founder of a competitor? What if they spend YEARS shit talking you and destroying your reputation? What if they’re not technically receiving new stock but the value in their startup equity goes up after they destroy you on Reddit? Doesn’t that count as financial compensation and a violation of Reddit’s own rule to “Moderate with Integrity”?</p>



<p>I believe it does.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s why Michael is doing what he’s doing. He wins when Codesmith loses.</p>



<p>Shit like this is why Reddit has become extremely untrustworthy.</p>



<h2>What Drives the Crazy Student Outcomes at Codesmith</h2>



<p>If you dig around, you will find stories from Codesmith students and placement data that seem <em>too</em> good to be true. Is Codesmith actually that good?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, it’s all real.</p>



<p>So how has Codesmith managed it? I found two forces that have driven these outcomes.</p>



<h3>1. Codesmith Has an Intense Application Process</h3>



<p>Not just anyone can join Codesmith. They screen folks OUT of their program. If you’re a line cook, kinda think a software engineer job sounds fun, have never spent even 5 minutes figuring out what that looks like, and apply, you won’t get in.</p>



<p>Codesmith only accepts folks that they think have a good chance of succeeding.</p>



<p>They filter the front of their student pipeline which keeps the outcome rates really high on the backend. That’s how they get their placement numbers as high as they are. That’s the “trick” to juicing the student outcomes.</p>



<p>Now, if you have some software engineering experience, you’ll likely find the application to be absurdly easy. That’s the point.</p>



<p>To me, Codesmith isn’t a true zero to one program. The students that thrive have already put a lot of self-study hours into their career transition. They’re motivated, have learned the basics, and are ready to dial up the intensity. These are folks that are also likely to succeed during the job application process after they graduate.</p>



<p>This is also one of the easiest ways to spot the shitty bootcamps. If they take anyone and everyone, that’s an enormous red flag. Stay away.</p>



<h3>2. The Hiring Market Was Extremely Strong from 2019-2022</h3>



<p>I spoke to one student that went through Codesmith in 2020, they reported that every single one of the folks in their cohort landed a software engineering job within about 6 months. That’s nuts.</p>



<p>Another graduate from the 2019 era told me that 80-90% of the students from their cohort, the cohort before, and the cohort after, landed software engineering jobs within a few months of graduating.</p>



<p>How were the placements that high? I believe the Codesmith program had something to do with it. But that was also a period where the tech market was exceptionally hot. Across all levels and functions, it was much easier to switch jobs, get promotions, and change careers in tech. I saw that myself.</p>



<p>I’ve also personally seen things tighten a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>How do Codesmiths placement rates look now?</p>



<p>Even if we look at more recent cohorts, the placements are still pretty damn strong for the full-time program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="998" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png 998w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-292x300.png 292w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-768x788.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png 1384w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s <a href="https://www.cirr.org/schooldata">one of the reports issued by CIRR on Codesmith</a>. It’s the full report so I’m not cherry picking.</p>



<p>Even during 2023-2024, a pretty shitty period to try to start a career as a software engineer, 70% of folks are still landing in-field jobs within a year of graduating Codesmith. With a median salary of $110,000. Even if you only count full-time employment, it’s still 62%.  I personally think that’s remarkable.</p>



<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z0FzVPHJ5qJLZ2T4Q_1EHaKo64TJpxm/view">The part-time program is only slightly worse at 60%</a>.</p>



<p>Again, this is during a hiring market when entry-level software engineering jobs are brutally hard to get. And the placement rates are still in the 60-70% range.</p>



<p>I’m also hearing that students have to work a lot harder now to land that job. And it can take a solid year. That’s that state of tech hiring at the moment.</p>



<p>So if you see old placement data of 80-100%, that was when the market was hot. Now it’s come back down to earth which is to be expected.</p>



<h2>The Future of Codesmith</h2>



<p>To me the future of Codesmith looks quite bright. Alina (the CEO) is very much in control, the team is excited about the future, and the student outcomes still look impressive to me. I’ve been told that there are no plans at Codesmith to shut down.</p>



<p>Especially with all the changes to software development from AI, there’s a lot of training that everyone is going to have to go through in tech. Good time to be in the education space.</p>



<p>If Michael could take his boot off Codesmith’s throat for just half a minute, they’d do a lot of good for a lot people.</p>



<h2>My Recommendations for Anyone Considering Joining a Developer Bootcamp</h2>



<p>I cannot tell you which bootcamp to attend. Or whether a bootcamp is worth it at all.</p>



<p>I’ve hired well over a hundred folks in my career, interviewed countless others. Including engineers and data scientists.</p>



<p>At no point did I ever place any value in a bootcamp. I also never considered it a detractor. It’s neutral to me, never really signaling anything. Neither good nor bad.</p>



<p>If you think it’ll get you your first job (which is all that really matters), and the price/time makes sense for you, go for it. But there are plenty of other paths. It’s not required by any means. I know plenty of self-taught devs that have worked at prestigious startups and big tech.</p>



<p>As for which bootcamp, that’s also up to you.</p>



<p>What I can say is this.</p>



<p>As I’ve gone through Michael Novati’s Reddit account, I’ve been appalled. I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire career. And I’ve played in some fucked up corners of the internet. That last thing I’d EVER want is to have my name or career associated with anything that Michael Novati has touched. That includes his startup, Formation.</p>



<p>You’ll have to make your own choice. But I know what mine would be.</p>



<p>At the very least, when doing research on bootcamps, I would consider anything on r/codingbootcamp/ to be completely contaminated. Whatever the real truth is, that subreddit is Michael’s personal fiefdom. He can do and say whatever he wants. And he has one helluva conflict of interest: he’s a co-founder and CTO of a leading bootcamp (even if he tries to claim that he doesn’t run a bootcamp).</p>



<p>If I was looking for unbiased reviews, I’d only factor in content from a community that Michael (or any other bootcamp founder) did not control. Make sure you know who your subreddit Mods are.</p>



<h2>Every Company is Now Vulnerable to These Types of Reputation Attacks</h2>



<p>For me, the craziest part of this story is that it’s not an edge case.</p>



<p>Anyone can use this exact same method to tear down their competitors.</p>



<p>You only need to complete one step: become a Reddit mod in one of the main subreddits for your industry. If you do that and the original mods of the subreddit don’t care what you do, you can completely fuck up your whole industry. Sow lies, fear, and misery at will.</p>



<p>Which means <em>anyone can do this to you</em>.</p>



<p>Reddit has become THE reputation attack vector.</p>



<p>And since Reddit is considered the default source of all human knowledge now, Reddit threads pop to the top of Google. Anyone searching for your brand will stumble into this madness. LLMs also prioritize Reddit so that narrative gets corrupted too. Getting control of one channel allows you to corrupt three major channels all at once. Most people don’t check receipts, they don’t dig for truth, they accept what’s put in front of them.</p>



<p>Reddit mods now control our search information ecosystem. Unpaid, corruptible Reddit mods.</p>



<p>I know there are good Reddit mods out there. But all it takes is one to fuck up your own business.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Claim: The judge was “his judge” and should have ruled differently.</h3>
      <p>Reality: Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — issued the original orders blocking deployment. Today, a Ninth Circuit panel partially stayed her ruling so that Oregon’s Guard can stay federalized, but it <b>did not</b> permit deployment to Portland.</p>
      
    </article>

    <!-- Claim 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: Title 10 allows federal troop deployment here as used.</h3>
      <p>Reality: The Ninth Circuit’s stay lifts only the block on federalizing Oregon’s Guard, **not** on deploying any Guard units to Portland. The broader restraining order barring deployments from any state remains in force.</p>

    <!-- Claim 4 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: California Guard can still be sent into Portland.</h3>

<p>We know. Our Twitter got owned. We knew within moments of it happening. We know exactly how it happened. Nothing was at risk other than our Twitter account (and one Fly.io employee’s self-esteem).  Also: for fuck’s sake.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: Kurt Mackey, our intrepid CEO, got phished.</p>
<p>Had this been an impactful attack, we would not be this flippant about it. For this, though, any other tone on our part would be false.</p><h2 id="how-they-got-kurt"><a href="#how-they-got-kurt" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>How They Got Kurt</span></h2>
<p>Two reasons: one, it was a pretty good phishing attack, and two, Twitter fell outside the “things we take seriously” boundary.</p>

<p>The phishing attack was effective because it exploited a deep psychological vulnerability in our management team: we are old and out of touch with the youths of today.</p>

<p>For many months now, we’ve had an contractor/intern-type-person Boosting Our Brand on Twitter by posting dank developer memes (I think that’s what they’re called). The thing about this dankery is that we don’t really understand it. I mean, hold on, we know what the memes mean technically. We just don’t get why they’re funny.</p>

<p>However, in pushing back on them, we’re up against two powerful forces:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dank memes appear to perform better than the stuff we ourselves write on Twitter.
</li><li>We are reliably informed by our zoomer children that we are too cringe to be trusted on these matters.
</li></ol>

<p>Here’s the phish Kurt got:</p>

<p><img alt="A pretty-plausible Twitter alert" src="https://fly.io/blog/kurt-got-got/assets/phish.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>Diabolical. Like a scalpel expertly wielded against Kurt’s deepest <a href="https://theonion.com/cool-dad-raising-daughter-on-media-that-will-put-her-en-1819572981/" title="">middle-aged-dude</a> insecurity. Our ruthless attackers clinically designed this email to trigger an autonomic Kurt response: “oh, what the fuck is this, and why did we post it?”</p>
<p>ATO is cool-kid for “got owned”</p>
<p>I’m getting a little ahead of the story here. We knew our X.com account had suffered an ATO because a bunch of us simultaneously got another email saying that the <a href="https://twitter.com/flydotio" title="">@flydotio</a> account’s email address now pointed to <code>achilles19969@gmail.com</code>. Our immediate response was to audit all accesses to the login information in <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1Password</a>, to cut all access for anybody who’d recently pulled it; your worst-case assumption in a situation like this is that someone’s endpoint has been owned up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nobody lost access for very long. I called Kurt to let him know why he was being locked out, and 5 seconds later, he’d <a href="https://archive.is/6rVqf" title="">realized what had happened.</a> <strong>Don’t click anything there.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-it-worked"><a href="#why-it-worked" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Why It Worked</span></h2>
<p>That’s the right question to ask, isn’t it? How could this have been possible in the first place?</p>

<p>Contrary to one popular opinion, you don’t defeat phishing by training people not to click on things. I mean, tell them not to, sure! But eventually, under continued pressure, everybody clicks. <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/papers/oakland2025_phishing-training.pdf" title="">There’s science on this</a>. The cool kids haven’t done phishing simulation training in years.</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do instead is use phishing-resistant authentication. This is almost the whole backstory for <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/tourofwebauthn/tourofwebauthn.html" title="">U2F,  FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195" title="">Passkeys</a>.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant authentication works by mutual authentication (or, if you’re a stickler, by origin- and channel-binding). Phishes are malicious proxies for credentials. Modern MFA schemes like FIDO2 break that proxy flow; your browser won’t send real credentials to the fake site.</p>
<p>there’s more to it than this, but, broad strokes.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, how all of our infrastructure is secured at Fly.io; specifically, we get <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/#what-soc2-made-us-do" title="">everything behind an IdP</a> (in our case: Google’s) and have it require phishing-proof MFA. You’re unlikely to phish your way to viewing logs here, or to refunding a customer bill at Stripe, or to viewing infra metrics, because all these things require an SSO login through Google.</p>

<p>Twitter, on the other hand. Yeah, so, about that. You may have heard that, a few years back, there were some goings-on involving Twitter. Many of us at Fly.io <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@flydotio" title="">decamped for Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j7herf6n4xiig2yg7fqdmkci" title="">later to Bluesky.</a> There was a window of time in 2023-2024 where it looked as if Twitter might not be a long term thing for us at all.</p>
<p>† (to whom I sincerely apologize for having assumed they had been owned up and were the proximate cause of the hack)</p>
<p>As a result, Twitter had been a sort of legacy shared account for us, with credentials managed in 1Password and shared with our zoomer contractor†.</p>

<p>Which is why Kurt was in a position to pull credentials from 1Password and log in to members-x.com in response to an email from alerts-x.com.</p>
<p>Still: we could have dodged this attack with hygiene: Kurt complains that “x.com” is an extremely phishable domain, and, sure, but also: the 1Password browser plugin would have noticed that “members-x.com” wasn’t an “x.com” host.</p><h2 id="what-took-so-long"><a href="#what-took-so-long" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Took So Long</span></h2>
<p>The attacker immediately revoked all tokens and set up new 2FA, so while we were quickly able to reset our password, we couldn’t lock them out of our account without an intervention from X.com, which took something like 1 5 hours to set up.</p>

<p>(That’s not a knock on X.com; 15 hours for a 2FA reset isn’t outside industry norms).</p>

<p>We’re obviously making a lot of noise about this now, but we were pretty quiet during the incident itself (beyond just “We know. We knew 45 seconds after it happened. We know exactly how it happened. It’s just a Twitter thing.”)</p>

<p>That’s because, in the grand scheme of things, the attack was pretty chill: <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">a not-very-plausible crypto scam</a> that presumably generated $0 for the attackers, 15+ hours of <code>brand damage</code>, and extra security engineering cycles burnt on watchful waiting. Our users weren’t under attack, and the account wasn’t being used to further intercept customer accounts. At one point, the attackers apparently deleted our whole Twitter history, which, like, don’t threaten us with a good time. So we let it roll, until we got our account recovered the next morning.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story-is"><a href="#the-moral-of-the-story-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>The Moral Of The Story Is</span></h2><p>“Really the biggest takeaway for me is that Kurt reads his email.”</p>
<p>Obviously Kurt loses his commit access. The time comes in the life of every CEO, and now it comes for him. </p>

<p>Also, we’ll finally have a population sample for “incident response” in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/" title="">our next SOC2</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll post more on Twitter. Or maybe we’ll double down on Zoomer memes. I don’t know. Social media is really weird right now. Either way: our Twitter access is Passkeys now.</p>
<p>seriously don’t click anything on that page</p>
<p>If you were inclined to take us up on an “airdrop” to “claim a share” of the “token” powering Fly.io, the site is <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">still up</a>. You can connect your wallet it it! You’ll lose all your money. But if we’d actually done an ICO, you’d have lost all your money anyways.</p>

<p>Somebody involved in pulling this attack off had to come up with “own a piece of the sky!”, and I think that’s punishment enough for them.</p>

<p>Whatever you’re operating that isn’t behind phishing-resistant MFA, or, better yet, an SSO IdP that requires phishing-resistant MFA: that thing is eventually going to get phished. Dance around the clown-fire of our misfortune if you must, but let us be a lesson to you as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>In the last two weeks I spent over a dozen hours playing poker, primarily online at <a href="https://www.pokerstarsmi.com/poker/?ref=blog.rchase.com" rel="noreferrer">pokerstarsmi.com</a>, and live at a <a href="https://www.soaringeaglecasino.com/casino/poker.html?ref=blog.rchase.com" rel="noreferrer">local casino</a>. </p><p>You can view the last 1,000 hands I played here: <a href="https://poker.rchase.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">https://poker.rchase.com</a></p><p>I spent at least as much time reviewing my hands with a desktop app called <a href="https://www.pokertracker.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">PokerTracker 4</a>, I read 6 books, studied strategy, and journaled about it in my Apple Notes.</p><p>Then I started building my own <a href="https://github.com/reillychase/pokerstars-api?ref=blog.rchase.com">Python script automations</a> to export my hand history from PokerStars, import it into PokerTracker 4, check my balance, stuff like that.</p><p>That led me to getting help writing code from <a href="https://grok.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">Grok</a>, then <a href="https://cursor.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">Cursor</a>, and then building <a href="https://poker.rchase.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">a full blown Laravel MVP for a web app similar to the PokerTracker 4 desktop app</a>.</p><h3 id="why-poker">Why poker?</h3><p>Without getting too philosophical, it's not about the money won or lost - I'm playing low stakes right now because I'm a beginner.</p><p>I just want to learn the game.</p><p>Maybe someday I'll play some tournaments or high stakes.</p><p>But right now, more importantly, I'm learning about myself.</p><ul><li><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> becoming aware of emotions in myself and others</li><li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> trying to control my emotions and not let them influence my actions</li><li><strong>Resilience</strong> not giving up because of downswings</li><li><strong>Humility </strong>learning to not get overconfident after a big win</li></ul><p>I also have enjoyed the lessons from the bankroll side of the game: </p><ul><li>Managing risk, taking profits, cutting losses</li><li>Developing the discipline to scale down my buy-ins when losing to keep a max of 10% of bankroll in play so I don't blow my entire bankroll on a bad day</li></ul><p>Whether I won or lost money in a given day isn't important, what's important is whether I followed my plan or not.</p><p>If I let emotions guide my actions, or I maintained self-control.</p><p>Success is if I made good decisions given the information I had at the time, even if it didn't lead to a good outcome.</p><p>The analogies to life and business lessons are endless... but in this blog post I mainly wanted to write about my experience building this web app with AI which was completely mind blowing!</p><h3

I tell it - hey there's a 500 error. It checks the logs, finds the bug, fixes the bug, ships the new code, I refresh the page and it's working... but it's not the color I wanted or whatever and I tell it to fix that and it goes and does it. On and on this goes for hours into the night.</p><p>With humans, normally I outline something I want built whether it's a feature or a new page for the website or a entire new app. Then the developer and I will kind of go back and forth over the details of the MVP version of it and what we should cut out considering the time/value trade off.</p><p>Then the developer will build it, but not the entire thing. We want to set milestones. That way I can see it as it gets built and give feedback which leads to many iterations, usually days or weeks apart, of each milestone until completion.</p><p>I learned how to build software like this the hard way...</p><p>By wasting a ton of time and money because I used to:</p><ul><li>Not work directly with the end developers</li><li>Not clearly communicate what I needed</li><li>Not consider time/value tradeoffs to cut the project or feature down to MVP</li><li>Wait until the entire project was completed before giving feedback and iterating</li></ul><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">- The feedback loop was too slow, I needed to work directly with the developer through complicated issues but we didn't have access to each other and had to communicate through a PM most of the time</p>— Reilly Chase (@_rchase_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_rchase_/status/1448502093518712835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.rchase.com">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you search online, you’ll find countless benchmarks claiming to compare the
performance of various JavaScript frameworks with each other. More often than
not, the benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to reflect real-world
scenarios. In other cases, they compare apples and oranges, for instance by
pitting a fully fledged framework against a lightweight library that cover only
a small subset of the framework’s functionality.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m at that point in my career again where I am starting development
on a new web application and need to choose the “right” JavaScript framework.
This time, I decided to look for academic studies on the performance of
JavaScript frameworks and sadly, didn’t find as many as I had hoped. I did come
across one particular study that compares Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor
with each other. Its main drawback is that the comparison was done in 2021 – a
lifetime ago in tech terms – but I think it’s still worth reading.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the summary, I want to share something I found mildly amusing.
The paper is published in the Journal of Web Engineering, and if you visit its
website, you’ll notice it includes <code>/index.php/</code> in the URL. I’m not sure why.
Is it a deliberate choice? Or is it a sign of questionable web engineering?</p>

<p>It is estimated that up to 97% of websites today use JavaScript, with more than
80% also relying on a library or framework. JavaScript is often used to manage
UI state changes within single page applications, allowing users to interact
without reloading the entire page. While this can be done manually via the DOM
API, it’s often error prone.</p>
<div><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p><span><a href="#theory" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>Modern web frameworks wrap the DOM API and provide a custom declarative syntax.
This means that application code can simply describe the desired UI state, and
the framework automatically generates the necessary DOM API calls to reflect
that state in the browser.</p>
<p>When using the DOM API directly, the amount of script execution required to
update the UI scales linearly with the complexity of the change. However, when
DOM API calls are generated dynamically by a framework, the framework must first
determine exactly which updates are necessary, introducing additional overhead.
Furthermore, the chosen rendering strategy can greatly affect the number of DOM
API calls made. A bad strategy may result in noticeable delays even for small
updates, which is why it makes sense to compare the strategies used by major
JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<div><h3 id="javascript-versus-webassembly">JavaScript versus WebAssembly</h3><p><span><a href="#javascript-versus-webassembly" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>The study looks at five popular frameworks: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and
Blazor. All are JavaScript-based except for Blazor, which uses WebAssembly.
Blazor applications are written in C# and run in a .NET runtime compiled to
WebAssembly. Because WebAssembly modules lack direct access to the DOM, they
rely on an additional JavaScript interoperability layer, which can introduce
extra overhead.</p>

<p>All five frameworks follow some variant of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
pattern. In MVVM, developers define components that bind an application’s data
sources to views, so that changes in the data are automatically reflected in the
UI.</p>
<p>Each framework continuously tries to keep the state of the DOM tree synchronised
with the state of the component tree defined in application code. This is done
using two distinct methods.</p>
<p>The first method, known as virtual DOM (vDOM)-based rendering, is used in React,
Vue, and Blazor. It works by comparing the two trees and calculating the minimum
set of changes needed to transform one into the other. This generally has a time
complexity of <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n^3)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but can often be simplified to <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> by making
assumptions that usually apply in browser applications.</p>
<p>The second method is used by Angular and Svelte. Here, there is no separate step
for calculating all required changes to the DOM. Instead, each component
directly updates its corresponding section of the DOM by tracking the values of
its data bindings.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, using a virtual DOM can introduce overhead not
present in a binding-based rendering strategy.</p>
<div><h3 id="creating-versus-updating">Creating versus updating</h3><p><span><a href="#creating-versus-updating" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>All of the reviewed frameworks perform DOM updates within a render loop that
walks through the component tree. The cost of this render loop depends on the
size of the input and fixed costs.</p>
<p>A render loop involves two types of work: creating new elements and updating
existing ones. Creating elements is generally straightforward and costs the same
for each framework, regardless of rendering strategy.</p>
<p>Updating existing elements is where the rendering strategy makes a noticeable
difference. Angular, for example, always walks through the entire component tree,
resulting in a lot of unnecessary work when only a small part of the tree needs
updating. React and Blazor walk only through the subtree of the component that
initiates the render loop, which is usually more efficient but may still require
some unnecessary work for descendants whose output has not changed. Vue and
Svelte, on the other hand, process only “dirty” components whose output has
changed. This requires the framework to track which components are dirty. Vue
does this at runtime, Svelte handles it at compile time.</p>
<p>Finally, component output can be classified as either static or dynamic content,
with static content remaining unchanged after the component’s initial render.
Frameworks that can optimise for static content may have a performance advantage
over those that cannot.</p>

<p>Several benchmarks were conducted using Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor.
The authors found significant differences in performance between the frameworks,
especially as input size increased.
<label><span>Svelte emerges as the clear winner</span><span> (side note: </span><span>For the record, I have never used
Svelte myself, but based on these results I might just finally give it a
try.</span><span>)</span></label>, outperforming the others across literally every benchmark.</p>

<p>Overall, the results are in line with what would be expected given the
characteristics of each rendering strategy.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly-based Blazor shows significantly worse performance than its
JavaScript-based competitors. However, from these benchmarks alone it’s
impossible to determine whether this is due to Blazor itself or a fundamental
limitation of using WebAssembly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Svelte demonstrates three key characteristics that likely contribute
most to improved performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of a reactivity system to automatically detect dirty components</li>

<h2 id="new_--trim_feature"><a href="#new_--trim_feature">New <code>--trim</code> feature</a></h2>
<p><em>Jeff Bezanson</em>, <em>Cody Tapscott</em>, <em>Gabriel Baraldi</em></p>
<p><code>julia</code> now has a new experimental<code>--trim</code> feature, when compiling a system image with this mode julia will trim statically unreachable code leading to significantly better compile times and binary sizes. To use it you also need to pass the <code>--experimental</code> flag when building the system image. </p>
<p>In order to use it, any code that is reachable from the entrypoints must not have any dynamic dispatches otherwise the trimming will be unsafe and it will error during compilation.</p>
<p>The expected way of using it is via the <code>JuliaC.jl</code> package, which provides a CLI and a programmatic API. </p>
<p>For example a simple package with an <code>@main</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> AppProject

<span>function</span> <span>@main</span>(<span>ARGS</span>)
    println(Core.<span>stdout</span>, <span>"Hello World!"</span>)
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>juliac --output-exe app_test_exe --bundle build --trim=safe --experimental ./AppProject</code></pre>
<pre><code>./build/bin/app_test_exe
Hello World!

<span>ls</span> -lh build/bin/app_test_exe
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 gabrielbaraldi  staff   1.1M Oct  6 17:22 ./build/bin/app_test_exe*</code></pre>
<h2 id="redefinition_of_constants_structs"><a href="#redefinition_of_constants_structs">Redefinition of constants (structs)</a></h2>
<p><em>Keno Fischer</em>, <em>Tim Holy</em></p>
<p>Bindings now participate in the "world age" mechanism previously used for methods. This has the effect that constants and structs can be properly redefined. As an example:</p>
<pre><code><span># Define a struct and a method on that struct:</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>1</span> method)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>))
<span>4</span>

<span># Redefine the struct (julia pre-1.12 would error here)</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
          b::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

<span># Note that functions need to be redefined to work on the new `Foo`</span>
julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>))
ERROR: <span>MethodError</span>: no method matching g(::Foo)
The <span>function</span> <span>`g`</span> exists, but no method is defined <span>for</span> this combination of argument types.

Closest candidates are:
  g(::<span>@world</span>(Foo, <span>39296</span>:<span>39300</span>)) <span># &lt;- This is syntax for accessing the binding in an older "world"</span>
   @ Main REPL[<span>2</span>]:<span>1</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span> + f.b^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>2</span> methods)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>))
<span>13</span></code></pre>
<p>There is also work in progress in Revise.jl to automatically redefine functions on replaced bindings. This should significantly reduce the number of times you have to restart Julia while iterating on some piece of code.</p>
<h2 id="new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles"><a href="#new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles">New tracing flags and macros for inspecting what Julia compiles</a></h2>
<p><em>Ian Butterworth</em>, <em>Nathan Daly</em></p>
<p><code>--trace-compile-timing</code> is a new command-line flag that augments <code>--trace-compile</code> by printing how long each compiled method took (in milliseconds) before the corresponding <code>precompile(...)</code> line. This makes it easier to spot costly compilations.</p>
<p>In addition, two macros for ad-hoc tracing without restarting Julia have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>@trace_compile expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-compile=stderr --trace-compile-timing</code> enabled, emitting timed <code>precompile(...)</code> entries only for that call.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>@trace_dispatch expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-dispatch=stderr</code> enabled, reporting methods that are dynamically dispatched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; <span>@trace_compile</span> <span>@eval</span> rand(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>) * rand(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>)

<h2 id="new_multi-threading_features"><a href="#new_multi-threading_features">New multi-threading features</a></h2>
<h3 id="one_interactive_thread_by_default"><a href="#one_interactive_thread_by_default">One interactive thread by default</a></h3>
<p><em>Gabriel Baraldi</em>, <em>Ian Butterworth</em></p>
<p>Julia now starts with one interactive thread by default (in addition to the default thread). This means that by default Julia runs with the threading configuration of 1 default thread, 1 interactive thread.</p>
<p>The interactive thread pool is where the REPL and other interactive operations run. By separating these from the default thread pool (where <code>@spawn</code> and <code>@threads</code> schedule work when no threadpool is specified), the REPL can perform operations like autocomplete queries in parallel with user code execution, leading to a more responsive interactive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Key behaviors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Default</strong>: Julia starts with <code>-t1,1</code> (1 default + 1 interactive thread)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit <code>-t1</code></strong>: If you explicitly request 1 thread with <code>-t1</code>, Julia will give you exactly that—no additional interactive thread will be added (resulting in <code>-t1,0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple threads</strong>: <code>-t2</code> or <code>-tauto</code> will give you the requested default threads plus 1 interactive thread</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manual control</strong>: You can always specify both pools explicitly, e.g., <code>-t4,2</code> for 4 default and 2 interactive threads</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This change improves the out-of-the-box experience while maintaining backwards compatibility for users who explicitly request single-threaded execution.</p>
<h3 id="threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity"><a href="#threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity">Threads settings respect CPU affinity</a></h3>
<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Julia now respects CPU affinity settings, such as those set via <code>cpuset</code>/<code>taskset</code>/<code>cgroups</code>, etc. The same also applies to the default number of BLAS threads, which now follows the same logic. This can also be observed when running Julia inside Docker. Currently, you have</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.11 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 22
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 11</code></pre>
<p>When starting Julia with <code>--threads=auto</code>, <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/#Base.Threads.nthreads"><code>Threads.nthreads()</code></a> is equal to the total number of CPUs on the system instead of the only 4 CPUs reserved by Docker. Likewise, the number of BLAS threads, which can be obtained with <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.BLAS.get_num_threads"><code>BLAS.get_num_threads()</code></a> and on x86-64 systems is by default half the number of available cores, is 11 instead of 2. With Julia v1.12 this is fixed, and the number of both Julia and BLAS threads will respect the number of CPUs reserved by Docker:</p>
<pre><code><span>% </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.12 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 4
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 2</code></pre>
<p>The new behavior is also important to avoid oversubscription out-of-the-box when running Julia on HPC systems where schedulers set CPU affinity when using shared resources.</p>
<h3 id="onceperx"><a href="#onceperx"><code>OncePerX</code></a></h3>
<p><em>Jameson Nash</em></p>
<p>Certain initialization patterns need to run only once, depending on scope: per process, per thread, or per task. To make this easier and safer, Julia now provides three built-in types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess{T}</code>: runs an initializer exactly once per process, returning the same value for all future calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread{T}</code>: runs an initializer once for each thread ID. Subsequent calls on the same thread return the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask{T}</code>: runs an initializer once per task, reusing the same value within that task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These replace common hand-rolled solutions such as using <code>__init__</code>, <code>nthreads()</code>, or <code>task_local_storage()</code> directly.</p>
<p>A simple example of <code>OncePerProcess</code>:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; <span>const</span> global_state = Base.OncePerProcess{<span>Vector</span>{<span>UInt32</span>}}() <span>do</span>
           println(<span>"Making lazy global value...done."</span>)
           <span>return</span> [Libc.rand()]
       <span>end</span>;

julia&gt; a = global_state();
Making lazy <span>global</span> value...done.

julia&gt; a === global_state()
<span>true</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess</code>: caches, global constants, or initialization that should happen once per Julia process (even across precompilation).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread</code>: per-thread state needed for interoperability with C libraries or specialized threading models.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask</code>: lightweight task-local state without manually managing <code>task_local_storage</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These types provide a safer, composable way to express “initialize once” semantics in concurrent Julia code.</p>

<p><em>Zentrik</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt">BOLT</a> is a post-link optimizer from LLVM that improves runtime performance by reordering functions and basic blocks, splitting hot and cold code, and folding identical functions. Julia now supports building BOLT-optimized versions of <strong>libLLVM</strong>, <strong>libjulia-internal</strong>, and <strong>libjulia-codegen</strong>.</p>
<p>These optimizations reduce compilation and execution time in common workloads. For example, the all-inference benchmarks improve by about <strong>10%</strong>, an LLVM-heavy workload shows a similar <strong>~10%</strong> gain, and building <code>corecompiler.ji</code> improves by <strong>13–16%</strong> with BOLT. When combined with PGO and LTO, total improvements of up to <strong>~23%</strong> have been observed.</p>
<p>To build a BOLT-optimized Julia, run the following commands from <code>contrib/bolt/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make stage1
make copy_originals
make bolt_instrument
make finish_stage1
make merge_data
make bolt</code></pre>
<p>The optimized binaries will be available in the <code>optimized.build</code> directory. An analogous workflow exists in <code>contrib/pgo-lto-bolt/</code> for combining BOLT with PGO+LTO.</p>
<p>BOLT currently works only on Linux <strong>x86_64</strong> and <strong>aarch64</strong>, and the resulting <code>.so</code> files must not be stripped. Some <code>readelf</code> warnings may appear during testing but are considered harmless.</p>
<h2 id="the_atomic_macro_family_now_supports_reference_assignment_syntax"><a href="#the_atomic_macro_family_now_supports_reference_assignment_syntax">The <code>@atomic</code> macro family now supports reference assignment syntax</a></h2>
<p><em>Marek Kaluba</em></p>
<p>The <code>@atomic</code> macro family now supports <strong>indexing</strong> (e.g. <code>m[i]</code>, <code>m[i,j]</code>) in addition to field access. This makes it possible to perform atomic fetch, set, modify, swap, compare-and-swap, and set-once directly on array-like references. The macros expand to new APIs: <code>getindex_atomic</code>, <code>setindex_atomic!</code>, <code>modifyindex_atomic!</code>, <code>swapindex_atomic!</code>, <code>replaceindex_atomic!</code>, and <code>setindexonce_atomic!</code>. Vararg and <code>CartesianIndex</code> indexing are supported.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>mem = AtomicMemory{<span>Int</span>}(<span>undef</span>, <span>2</span>)

<span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>2</span>                 <span># atomic set</span>
x = <span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>]                 <span># atomic fetch</span>
<span>@atomic</span> :monotonic mem[<span>1</span>] += <span>1</span>     <span># atomic modify with order</span>
old = <span>@atomicswap</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>4</span>       <span># atomic swap (returns old)</span>
res = <span>@atomicreplace</span> mem[<span>1</span>] <span>4</span> =&gt; <span>10</span>  <span># (old=4, success=true)</span>
ok  = <span>@atomiconce</span> mem[<span>2</span>] = <span>7</span>         <span># set once (Bool)</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="new_option_task-metricsyes_to_enable_the_collection_of_per-task_timing_information"><a href="#new_option_task-metricsyes_to_enable_the_collection_of_per-task_timing_information">New option –task-metrics=yes to enable the collection of per-task timing information</a></h2>
<p>Two new per-task metrics can be enabled by starting Julia with <code>--task-metrics=yes</code> or by calling <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics(true)</code>. Enabling or disabling task metrics with <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics</code> only affects new tasks, not existing ones. The metrics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_running_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time for which <code>t</code> was actually running. This is currently inclusive of GC time, compilation time, and any spin time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_wall_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time from the scheduler becoming aware of <code>t</code> until <code>t</code> is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new_pkg_features"><a href="#new_pkg_features">New Pkg features</a></h2>
<p><em>Kristoffer Carlsson</em></p>
<h3 id="workspace"><a href="#workspace">Workspace</a></h3>
<p>A workspace is a set of project files that all share the same manifest. Each project in a workspace can include its own dependencies, compatibility information, and even function as a full package.</p>
<p>When the package manager resolves dependencies, it considers the requirements and compatibility of all the projects in the workspace. The compatible versions identified during this process are recorded in a single manifest file.</p>
<p>A workspace is defined in the base project by giving a list of the projects in it:</p>
<pre><code><span>[workspace]</span>
<span>projects</span> = [<span>"test"</span>, <span>"docs"</span>, <span>"benchmarks"</span>, <span>"PrivatePackage"</span>]</code></pre>
<p>This structure is particularly beneficial for developers using a monorepo approach, where a large number of unregistered packages may be involved. It is also useful for adding documentation or benchmarks to a package by including additional dependencies beyond those of the package itself. Test-specific dependencies are now recommended to be specified using the workspace approach (a project file in the <code>test</code> directory that is part of the workspace defined by the package project file).</p>
<p>Workspaces can also be nested: a project that itself defines a workspace can also be part of another workspace. In this case, the workspaces are “merged,” with a single manifest being stored alongside the “root project” (the project that is not included in another workspace).</p>
<h3 id="apps"><a href="#apps">Apps</a></h3>
<p>An app is a Julia package that can be run directly from the terminal, similar to a standalone program. Each app provides an entry point via <code>@main</code> and can define its own default Julia flags and executable name.</p>
<p>When an app is installed, it gets put into <code>.julia/bin</code> and by adding that to your <code>PATH</code> it allows you to launch it by name together with any arguments or options.</p>
<p>A Julia app is defined in the <code>Project.toml</code> file using an <code>[apps]</code> section:</p>
<pre><code><span>[apps]</span>
<span>reverse</span> = {} <span># empty dictionary is for additional metadata</span></code></pre>
<p>with a corresponding entry point in the package module:</p>
<pre><code><span># src/MyReverseApp.jl</span>
<span>module</span> MyReverseApp

<span>function</span> (<span>@main</span>)(<span>ARGS</span>)
    <span>for</span> arg <span>in</span> <span>ARGS</span>
        print(<span>stdout</span>, reverse(arg), <span>" "</span>)
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span> <span># module</span></code></pre>
<p>After installation, the app can be run directly in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ reverse some input string
emos tupni gnirts</code></pre>
<p>This makes apps useful for building CLI tools or packaging Julia functionality as user-facing executables. Multiple apps can be defined per package by using submodules, and each app can specify default Julia flags (e.g. <code>--threads=4</code>) for performance or debugging.</p>
<p>See the full documentation for more information: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/apps/</p>
<h3 id="status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions"><a href="#status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions">Status highlights when dependencies have different loaded versions</a></h3>
<p><code>Pkg.status()</code> now highlights when a dependency's loaded version differs from what the current environment would load. This helps identify situations where you may be running code against an outdated or mismatched version of a package—particularly useful when switching between environments or after modifying dependencies.</p>
<p>When a package is already loaded from a different version or path than what the current environment specifies, Pkg will display a yellow <code>[loaded: vX.Y.Z]</code> indicator next to the package name:</p>
<p><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/blog/2025-1.12-highlights/pkg-status-loaded-version.png" alt="Pkg.status showing loaded version highlight"></p>
<p>This visual cue makes it easier to spot when you need to restart Julia to pick up the correct package versions, reducing debugging time and confusion in iterative development workflows.</p>
<h2 id="generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers"><a href="#generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers">Generated LLVM IR now uses pointer types instead of passing pointers as integers</a></h2>
<p><em>Tim Besard</em></p>
<p><code>Ptr{T}</code> now lowers to <strong>actual LLVM pointer types</strong> in generated IR (i.e. <code>ptr</code> with opaque pointers, or <code>i8*</code>), instead of integers like <code>i64</code>. This simplifies low-level interop: <code>llvmcall</code> no longer needs <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> shims, and many intrinsics can be called via <code>ccall</code> using <code>Ptr</code> directly.</p>
<p><strong>What changes for you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inline LLVM (<code>llvmcall</code>)</strong>: update IR to use <code>ptr</code>/<code>i8*</code> for pointer arguments/returns, and remove redundant <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> casts. Old IR that treats pointers as integers is still accepted but emits a <strong>deprecation warning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pointer arithmetic</strong>: <code>add_ptr</code> / <code>sub_ptr</code> now operate on real pointers: <code>add_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> and <code>sub_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> (lowered to GEP).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>ccall</code> convenience</strong>: passing/returning <code>Ptr{T}</code> maps to LLVM pointer types directly, enabling more intrinsic calls without custom <code>llvmcall</code> glue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example (before → after)</strong></p>
<pre><code>; BEFORE (deprecated): integer pointer
define i64 <span>@f</span>(i64 %p) {
  %q = inttoptr i64 %p to i8*
  ; ...
  %r = ptrtoint i8* %q to i64
  ret i64 %r
}

; AFTER: real pointer
define ptr <span>@f</span>(ptr %p) {
  ; ...
  ret ptr %p

<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Many developers may have experience with occasional failures when running tests of their packages which were observed only on remote machines, and wished to be able to reproduce the same run, for debugging purposes. The GitHub Actions workflow <a href="https://github.com/julia-actions/julia-runtest"><code>julia-actions/julia-runtest</code></a> recently started printing to the log the full options used to invoke the Julia process which runs the tests, which lets developers use the same compiler options (e.g. bounds checking, code coverage, deprecation warnings, etc.) as the CI runs. However there are occasional failures which don't depend on compiler options, but may depend on the state of the global random number generator (RNG), if for example the input data of the tests is generated with functions like <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.rand"><code>rand</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.randn"><code>randn</code></a>, without passing an explicit RNG object, instead relying on the global one. The <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/#Test.@testset"><code>Test.@testset</code></a> macro has had for a long time the feature of automatically controlling the global RNG, but until now its state was never displayed. Starting from Julia v1.12, a failure inside a <code>@testset</code> causes the RNG of the outermost test set to be printed to screen, which then you can also set in a new test set to exactly reproduce the same run.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following test which would fail with a 0.1% probability:</p>
<pre><code><span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>using</span> Test
</span>
<span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>@testset</span> <span>begin</span>
           <span>@test</span> rand() &gt; <span>0.001</span>
       <span>end</span>;
</span>test set: Test Failed at REPL[2]:2
  Expression: rand() &gt; 0.001

<p>Normally, it'd require several attempts to reproduce a similar failure, but now the RNG is printed to screen and you can reproduce the run in a new session by setting the <code>rng</code> option of <code>@testset</code> to the value printed in the failed test:</p>

<p>While there are still many other classes of intermittent failures that aren't captured by the global RNG, being able to reproduce its state inside failing test sets should help debugging more issues during package development.</p>

There's a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.</p><p>
WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. No need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.</p></div> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">What are the advantages of using this over CrossOver or WINE?</a></summary> <div data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><p>You can run stuff that doesn't play well with CrossOver or WINE, and have a full Windows desktop at the same time.</p><p>
We've had numerous apps that weren't working nicely (or at all) in Wine, this is one of the reasons we've created WinBoat. Some examples would be Affinity Photo, Paint Tool Sai v1.0, the entire Adobe suite, AeroChat, Acrobat, and of course Office.</p></div> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Will I be able to configure my peripherals / hardware using WinBoat?</a></summary> <p data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">If your peripheral / hardware uses USB to connect to your device. then yes! Starting from WinBoat 0.8.0 we support USB passthrough as an experimental feature and you can use any Windows software needed for configuration, it should work out of the box.</p> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Is there USB passthrough?</a></summary> <div data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><p>
Yes! Starting from WinBoat 0.8.0 we support USB passthrough as an experimental feature. Please give it a try and let us know what you think! 😄</p><p>
If for whatever reason you're stuck with an older version of WinBoat, you can modify the <span data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">docker-compose.yml</span> file in <span data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">~/.winboat</span> once you finished setting up WinBoat. You can add the appropriate USB devices <a href="https://github.com/dockur/windows?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-pass-through-a-usb-device" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">like this</a>, followed by executing <span data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">docker-compose down</span> and <span data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">docker-compose up -d</span> in the same folder. Please make sure to remove these changes before you upgrade to &gt;=0.8.0 though, as they are incompatible with our implementation.</p></div> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Is there GPU passthrough?</a></summary> <div data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><p>Not at the moment, but we plan on eventually implementing GPU acceleration through paravirtualized drivers.</p><p>
We have looked at MVisor Win VGPU Driver for OpenGL, which seems promising from our tests, but it's for a different hypervisor (not compatible with QEMU). Some other folks are also working on DirectX drivers but nothing that we can try out yet.</p><p>
We have also looked into Looking Glass extensively, specifically their Indirect Display Driver which does not need a second GPU, because it'd be absolutely amazing to have it. We got the driver to compile and start via some hacks, but couldn't get much more than a black screen. The developer says it is not ready for general use yet at all, however we plan to integrate it once it is ready.</p></div> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Does it run games with anti-cheat that don't run on Linux?</a></summary> <p data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Unfortunately running games with kernel anti-cheat is not possible, as they block virtualization.</p> </details> <details data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""> <summary data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""><a data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Any possibility of adding Podman support as a Docker alternative?</a></summary> <p data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr="">Podman support is planned.
