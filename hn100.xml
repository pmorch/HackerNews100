<p>Google is dealing with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/android-14-patches-ransomware-storage-bug-but-some-users-will-lose-data/">second "lost data" fiasco</a> in the past few months. This time, it's Google Drive, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/">mysteriously losing files</a> for some people. Google acknowledged the issue on November 27, and a week later, it posted what it called a fix.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like Google is describing this issue correctly; the company still calls it a "syncing issue" with the Drive desktop app versions 84.0.0.0 through 84.0.4.0. Syncing problems would only mean files don't make it to or from the cloud, and that doesn't explain why people are completely losing files. In the <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en&amp;sjid=9779374175483664470-NA">most popular</a> issue thread on the Google Drive Community forums, <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246232590">several</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246259260">users</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246980076">describe</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">spreadsheets</a> and documents going missing, which all would have been created and saved in the web interface, not the desktop app, and it's hard to see how the desktop app could affect that. Many users peg "May 2023" as the time documents stopped saving. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246116775">Some say</a> they've never used the desktop app.</p>
<p>Drive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default "file streaming," mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get <em>removed</em> from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a "syncing" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).</p>
<p>Google still hasn't explained what exactly happened or how it's been fixed, but just reading through these instructions makes the issue sound rather complicated. This isn't just a simple case of fixing this "syncing" issue by shipping a new version and having everyone's files reappear.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582">Google's recovery instructions</a> outline a few ways to attempt to "recover your files." One is via a new secret UI in the Google Drive desktop app version 85.0.13.0 or higher. If you hold shift while clicking on the Drive system tray/menu bar icon, you'll get a special debug UI with an option to "Recover from backups." Google says, "Once recovery is complete, you'll see a new folder on your desktop with the unsynced files named Google Drive Recovery." Google doesn't explain what this does or how it works.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Option No. 2 is surprising: use of the command line to recover files. The new Drive binary comes with flags for '--recover_from_account_backups' and '--recover_from_app_data_path', which tells us a bit about what is going on. When Google first acknowledged the issue, it warned users not to delete or move Drive's app data folder. These flags from the recovery process make it sound like Google hopes your missing files will be in the Drive cache somewhere. Google also suggests trying Windows Backup or macOS Time Machine to find your files.</p>
<p>Google locked the issue thread on the Drive Community Forums at 170 replies before it was clear the problem was solved. It's also marking <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582?sjid=2808826510676647677-NC#recoverui">any additional threads</a> as "duplicates" and locking them. Taking away the space to diagnose the issue and communicate fixes adds to the sense that Google is more interested in PR damage control than helping users. It also doesn't allow people to reply to the "solution" post, so it's hard to evaluate the fix's efficacy since Google shut down the easiest avenues for user feedback and support.</p>
<p>Of the few replies before Google locked the thread, most suggested that Google's fix did not work. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247228495">One user</a> calls the fix "complete BS," adding, "The “solution” doesn’t work for most people." <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247231608">Another says,</a> "Google Drive DELETED my files so they are not available for recovery. This "fix" is not a fix!" There are <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246651550">lots</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">of other</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247203919">reports</a> of the fix not working, and not many that say they got their files back. The idea that Drive would have months-old copies of files in the app data folder is hard to believe.</p>
<p>Drive isn't just a consumer product, it's also aimed a businesses looking for terabytes of file storage, with paid tiers that can be priced into the stratosphere. Drive is a product that will live and die by how much users trust it. Bugs will happen, but I would have expected Google's response to align with normal IT downtime procedures: a status page with constant updates and a full postmortem explaining what went wrong and how Google fixed it. Instead, we got days of silence, locked forum posts, and vague explanations.</p>

At the time, their main source of leverage was a plan to all quit and join Altman and President Greg Brockman at a new AI group within Microsoft.</p><p><span></span><span><p>The employees didn't have to go through with this in the end. Altman and Brockman and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ilya-sutskever-not-at-openai-party-celebrating-sam-altman-ceo-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>most of the C-suite</u></a> are back at OpenAI. New board members are in place, with additions coming.</p><p>Now, the truth behind that core Microsoft threat is coming out. Some Microsoft insiders told BI that hiring everyone from OpenAI was seen internally as a last resort. And for at least some of those OpenAI employees, there's relief that they don't actually have to go work for Microsoft.</p><p>"It was sort of a bluff that ultimately worked," explained one former employee who's still in touch with current staffers. This person, and others who spoke with BI, asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.</p><p>One current OpenAI employee admitted that, despite nearly everyone on staff signing up to follow Altman out the door, "No one wanted to go to Microsoft." This person called the company "the biggest and slowest" of all the major tech companies — the exact opposite of how OpenAI employees see their startup.</p><h2>Pressure to sign</h2><p>Given the absence of interest in joining Microsoft, many OpenAI employees "felt pressured" to sign the open letter, the employee admitted. The letter itself was drafted by a group of longtime staffers who have the most clout and money at stake with years of industry standing and equity built up, as well as higher pay. They began calling other staffers late on Sunday night, urging them to sign, the employee explained.</p><p>"We all left these big corporations to move fast and build exciting things," the employee said. "The bureaucracy of something as big as Microsoft is soul crushing."</p><p>While OpenAI staffers would have followed through with their threat and joined Microsoft, they probably would have left at the first opportunity for other AI startups such as Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Cohere, the employee added.</p><h2>Looking down on legacy tech</h2><p>Another former OpenAI employee agreed, saying people working at the San Francisco-based startup "look down on what they consider legacy companies" and "see themselves as innovators who are radically changing the world."</p><p>OpenAI products like ChatGPT and DALL-E kicked off the current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-impact-big-surprise-openai-meta-yann-lecun-ai-chatbot-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>AI craze in tech</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-companies-that-have-raised-at-least-50-million-this-year-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>investing</u></a>. The startup's avowed goal is artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which it defines as technology that can "outperform humans at most economically valuable work." It's a lofty goal well outside the norm for Microsoft, and some people at OpenAI think the enterprise software giant would not have been capable of continuing the mission.</p><p>"Even though we have a partnership with Microsoft, internally, we have no respect for their talent bar," the current OpenAI employee told BI. "It rubbed people the wrong way to entertain being managed by them."</p><p>OpenAI declined to comment, while Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>Money, the great motivator</h2><p>Beyond the culture clash between the two companies, there was another important factor at play for OpenAI employees: money. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>Lots of it</u></a> was set to disappear before their eyes if OpenAI were to suddenly collapse under a mass exodus of staff.</p><p>"Sam Altman is not the best CEO, but millions and millions of dollars and equity are at stake," the current OpenAI employee said.</p><p>Not only are OpenAI employees paid very well in cash, with base salaries typically starting at $300,000, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>typical equity package</u></a> is worth $2 million over four years, and much more for some workers.</p><h2>A laughable idea</h2><p>Microsoft agreed to hire all OpenAI employees at their same level of compensation, but this was only a verbal agreement in the heat of the moment.</p><p>Another OpenAI employee openly laughed at the idea that Microsoft would have paid departing staffers for the equity they would have lost by following Altman.</p><p>A scheduled tender offer, which was about to let employees sell their existing vested equity to outside investors, would have been canceled. All that equity would have been worth "nothing," this employee said.</p><p>The former OpenAI employee estimated that, of the hundreds of people who signed the letter saying they would leave, "probably 70% of the folks on that list were like, 'Hey, can we, you know, have this tender go through?'"</p><p>Thanks to the success of their big bluff, Altman is back and the tender offer is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/openai-tender-offer-on-track-despite-leadership-fracas-sources.html#:~:text=The%20tender%20offer%20will%20value,to%20discuss%20private%20communications%20freely." data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>going on as planned</u></a>, valuing OpenAI at more than $80 billion. It was even extended through January 5, according to CNBC, giving employees more time to become millionaires — if they aren't already.</p><h2>Furious Microsoft employees</h2><p>Some Microsoft employees, meanwhile, were furious that the company promised to match salaries for hundreds of OpenAI employees. The offer came after Microsoft had laid off more than 10,000 employees, frozen salaries, and cut bonuses and stock awards this year.</p><p>"How many loyal employees who stayed at Microsoft while working 12+ hours daily and living in constant fear of being laid off all year?" one Microsoft employee told BI.

  <p>Today, we are releasing StableLM Zephyr 3B: a new chat model representing the latest iteration in our series of lightweight LLMs, preference tuned for instruction following and Q&amp;A-type tasks. This model is an extension of the pre-existing StableLM 3B-4e1t model and is inspired by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr 7B model from HuggingFace</span></a>. With StableLM Zephyr's 3 billion parameters, this model efficiently caters to a wide range of text generation needs, from simple queries to complex instructional contexts on edge devices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Training Insights</strong></p><p>The development of StableLM Zephyr 3B focused on creating a model that performs well in text generation and aligns human preferences. Inspired by Zephyr 7B, we adapted its training pipeline, with the first step being supervised fine-tuning on multiple instruction datasets, including UltraChat, MetaMathQA, Evol Wizard Dataset, &amp; Capybara Dataset. In the second step, we aligned the model with the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm utilizing the UltraFeedback dataset. This dataset is from the OpenBMB research group and comprises 64,000 prompts and corresponding model responses. Recently released models, such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr-7B</span></a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1" target="_blank"><span>Neural-Chat-7B</span></a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/tulu-2-dpo-70b" target="_blank"><span>Tulu-2-DPO-70B</span></a>, successfully used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, Stable Zephyr is one of the first models of this type yet with the efficient size of 3B parameters.</p><p><strong>Model Performance</strong></p><p>Benchmarked on platforms such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685" target="_blank"><span>MT Bench</span></a> and <a href="https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/" target="_blank"><span>AlpacaEval</span></a>, StableLM Zephyr 3B demonstrates superior capabilities in generating contextually relevant, coherent, and linguistically accurate text.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>More details on our testing, datasets, and safety can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b" target="_blank"><span>model card</span></a>. In summary, our performance tests have shown that StableLM Zephyr 3B is capable of surpassing models of larger size tailored for similar use cases, showcasing the power and efficiency inherent in this new model.</p><p><strong>Enabling Diverse Applications</strong></p><p>StableLM Zephyr 3B is a lightweight yet accurate model equipped to handle multiple linguistic tasks efficiently and accurately. The model has been strengthened to assist in instructional and Q&amp;A-type tasks. It's versatile enough for various complex applications, from crafting creative content like copywriting and summarization to aiding in developing instructional design and content personalization. Additionally, it offers a powerful and insightful analysis based on the input data. All this is accomplished while retaining its efficient 3 billion parameter size, 60% smaller than  7b models, enabling use on devices lacking the computational power of dedicated high-end systems.</p><p><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></p><p>If you want to use this model for your commercial products or purposes, please contact us <a href="https://stability.ai/contact"><span>here</span></a> to learn more. </p><p>You can also stay updated on our progress by signing up for our <a href="https://stability.ai/home#newsletter"><span>newsletter</span></a>, following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stabilityai" target="_blank"><span>Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stability.ai/" target="_blank"><span>Instagram</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stability-ai" target="_blank"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, and joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion" target="_blank"><span>Discord Community</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>One of my ongoing fixations with the web is how improvements in technology inform web design. In an earlier post this year I <a href="https://daniel.do/article/its-the-future-stop-using-jpegs/#some-background">wrote about my theory</a> that the increasing pixel density of displays galvanized the shift from photography to vector illustrations in the early to mid 2010s.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a design trend that runs counter to this. Illustrations still rule in web design, but instead of clean, flat shapes there has been an emergence of texture, usually as part of a design’s lighting or shading and <em>usually</em> a “noisy” or grainy texture.</p>

<p>I’m not hip enough to know if this style has been assigned a pithy label, but I do enjoy it. At the same time, I find it frustrating — because as far as I can tell (the lack of examples I have seen in the wild supports this theory) there isn’t an easy way to replicate these illustrations with SVGs. They can probably be exported as such from illustration programs but it’s likely these applied textures are raster or if they are vector, quite large in size.</p>
<p>SVGs are an interesting subject to me, because the specification for them is dense and there are usually multiple ways to accomplish an effect. Most SVGs are simply exported directly from a graphics program and have a lot of inefficiencies etc… which has led to the emergence of tools like <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the subject (I feel like the older I get, the less I feel like I can claim that about anything) but in recent years have taken to hand tuning and occasionally writing my own SVGs from scratch so I am not a complete novice either.</p>
<p>I decided to give creating an SVG using this illustration style a shot. My goal was to use the regular SVG specification to write a simple illustration that had this noisy, textured shadow effect. An additional goal was for this illustration to be moderately flexible, something that could easily be turned into a component in Svelte or React and changed for different shapes and colors. For more direct inspiration, I looked to the designer Josh Warren who has experimented a lot with using this style and simple geometry to nice effect:</p>

<h2 id="basic-shape-and-gradient"><a href="#basic-shape-and-gradient" aria-label="basic shape and gradient permalink"></a>Basic shape and gradient</h2>
<p>Drawing a circle or square in an SVG is really easy. There are primitives for them.</p>
<div>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span> <span>viewbox</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>0 0 100 100<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>circle</span> <span>cx</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>cy</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>r</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50"></circle>
</svg>
</div>
<p>The tricky part is everything else. If you want to apply a gradient, you can specify that as the <code>fill</code> - but what if you want a gradient that changes with the base color you specify? So you don’t have to define a custom gradient with specific colors if you want to reuse the component. Then you’ve entered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/mask">mask</a> territory. The way masks work in SVGs is that you use the “colors” black and white to how you want a mask to work. It’s a little confusing, but I’ve tried to keep the code example simple.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I have to give huge kudos to MDN’s excellent documentation, this project could not have been done without it!)</p>
<p>This can actually be optimized a little more. We know we’re going to use the same circle shape multiple times, so we can define it once in <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>, assign it an id and simply reference it with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use"><code>use</code></a> element. This makes the code a little more DRY:</p>
<div>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span> <span>viewbox</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>0 0 100 100<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

 <span><span><span>&lt;</span>use</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>#shape<span>"</span></span> <span>mask</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>url(#gradient)<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <defs>
      <circle id="shape" cx="50" cy="50" r="50"></circle>
      <mask id="gradient">
        <linearGradient id="fade">
          <stop offset="0%" stop-color="black" stop-opacity="0.5"></stop>
          <stop offset="75%" stop-color="white" stop-opacity="1"></stop>
        </linearGradient>
        <use href="#shape" fill="url('#fade')"></use>
      </mask>
    </defs>
    <use href="#shape" mask="url(#gradient)"></use>
  </svg>
</div>
<p>So we’ve got the shape and a gradient going, but how do we add a texture to that gradient? The answer is with a filter. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Filter_effects">MDN’s documentation on SVG Filters</a> goes into better detail on the nuts and bolts of how filters work. I also found this <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/02/19/svg-filter-effects-creating-texture-with-feturbulence/">excellent article</a> that goes into great detail about creating textures for SVGs.</p>
<p>To create noise, I used the <code>&lt;feTurbulence&gt;</code> filter which is explicitly for generating artificial textures but required quite a bit of fiddling to get to my liking. Then, I had to use other filter effects to eliminate color variance and blend naturally with the fill color selected, and finally apply the filter to the circle.</p>

<p>Adding a nice fill color and making the gradient a little more subtle and there we go!</p>
<p>With some additional playing around I was able to create <a href="https://danielimmke.github.io/noisy-shapes">an illustration</a> I was quite happy with. It’s not perfect, and notably renders differently in Safari than other browsers but it achieves what I set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>You can also check out the code in the <a href="https://github.com/danielimmke/noisy-shapes">repository</a>.</p>
<p>This method could certainly be improved with additional experimenting. It’s still a far cry from the complexity of some of the illustrations I linked, but I think it could potentially be refined to be usable in more situations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Tailscale assigns every one of your nodes a private IPv4 address. We do this from the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1015/100.x-addresses/">CGNAT range</a>,
which is typically used by ISPs that have run out of public IPv4 addresses. Starting today, you have control over what
IP address from that range is assigned to your nodes. This gives you the ability to decide what subset of the CGNAT
range your tailnet uses to avoid conflicts with other applications.</p>
<h2 id="globally-unique-to-locally-unique">Globally unique to locally unique</h2>
<p>In the early days of Tailscale we decided to allocate every node a unique IP address within the Tailscale universe. This
was particularly handy for <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing/">node sharing</a>, when you let someone from another tailnet access a node in
your tailnet, they got to see it as the same CGNAT address. It also met our needs when we were an early-stage startup;
the CGNAT <code>100.64.0.0/10</code> range has some four million IP addresses, plenty for an experimental project that may or may
not be interesting to users. It turns out people like to use Tailscale and we are running out of IPs.</p>
<p>We had a few options — we could add other private IP address ranges to the CGNAT space we allocate, but this would have
at best been a stopgap. Or, we could have required all users to use IPv6 addresses, as we already also allocate nodes
and addresses from the much larger pool of IPv6 ULA addresses. We all know how well IPv6 adoption has gone —  this would
have broken legacy software our customers use that does not support IPv6. Rather, we decided to no longer allocate
globally unique CGNAT addresses, and allow the reuse of CGNAT addresses in different tailnets.</p>
<p>It also gives us the flexibility to allow enterprises to limit the range of CGNAT IP addresses that get allocated to
their tailnets, for compatibility with other systems that allocate from parts of the CGNAT range.</p>
<h2 id="jump-into-your-own-pool">Jump into your own pool</h2>
<p>Along with flexible addressing, we are launching a beta feature to let you define the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1304/ip-pool/">IP pool</a> that
your nodes are assigned from the CGNAT range. This is done as part of your tailnet policy:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>    <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"acls"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"..."</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"nodeAttrs"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"autogroup:admin"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.81.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"group:dev"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.85.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/#node-attributes">node attribute</a> set, all new nodes managed by admins in your tailnet will be
assigned an IP from the range: <code>100.81.0.0/16</code>, whereas nodes managed by members of <code>group:dev</code> will be assigned an IP
from a subset from the range: <code>100.85.0.0/16</code>.</p>
<h2 id="change-ip-of-existing-nodes">Change IP of existing nodes</h2>
<p>Before these changes, IPv4 addresses were immutable. With locally unique IPv4, however, you can change the address for any node in your tailnet in a couple clicks, even nodes that have been shared to you!</p>

<h2 id="natural-solutions">NATural solutions</h2>
<p>Address reuse causes no issue in the common case of a perfectly private tailnet, but if not implemented carefully, it
could wreak havoc with node sharing. If I try to share my node <code>100.65.1.1</code> with you, and you already have a node
numbered <code>100.65.1.1</code>, where do your packets go?</p>
<p>To address this (no pun intended), we assign shared nodes a new IP address from the tailnet it is shared into. Each
Tailscale node collects a new IP address for each share. Assigning multiple addresses to an interface causes a lot of UX
pain with some software, so instead nodes in the shared-to tailnet 1-1 NAT packets destined for the shared node, right
before they flow into the WireGuard tunnel.</p>
<p>This means the tailnet of the shared node never has to be aware of the IP addresses assigned to it in other tailnets,
which greatly simplifies accounting.</p>
<p>Now, each tailnet can have up to four million nodes with IPv4 addresses. If you are the sort of enterprise that needs
more than that, let’s chat.</p>
<p>One thing you can rely on with IPv4: whatever the problem, Network Address Translation is part of the solution.</p>

<!--*The Future of Data Evolution.* or *Mastering convergent evolution*.-->
<p>Hey there 👋, this is the start of a book about <em>Data Engineering Design Patterns</em>.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-book"><a href="#about-this-book">About This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book is different from usual books. It does <strong>not come finished</strong>. I will steadily release new chapters of the book, carefully listen to all your feedback, and integrate them to create a (hopefully) great book at the end of the day. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.dedp.online/appendix/changelog.html">changelog</a> for the latest updates, or sign up for the below <a href="https://list.ssp.sh/subscription/form">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>I love writing. I love editing text. After writing for about 8+ years on my personal blog, and even doing it professionally for a year, I love the challenge that my former boss, Swyx confronted me, to put my 20+ years of experience in data engineering into a book. And, as I love long formats, a book might just be the best format to bring it all together in one.</p>
<p>Over my 20+ year career, I've witnessed an endless cycle of emerging terms and technologies.  This pattern led me to ponder: are we merely repackaging old ideas in new terminology?</p>
<p>That's when I found the term the intriguing concept: <strong>convergent evolution</strong>. This term, new to me at first, resonated deeply with my experiences in the data field, where often new terms are introduced every wee. Over time, I learned that what seemed new was simply a repurposed concept from a decade ago, now labeled with a new name. </p>
<p>Occasionally, these were existing technologies, subtly enhanced. Yet, true innovation seemed rare. This is where the idea of convergent evolution becomes pivotal. </p>
<p>Convergent evolution is when the outcome of two distinct evolutions is the same. The most famous one is <em>flying</em>. Both a bird and a bee can fly but in different ways. The bird has developed feathers, and a bee has an exoskeleton, which was learned and developed to fly in a different evolution.</p>
<p>This pattern of convergent evolution in data engineering captivated me, inspiring this book. My goal is to dissect these evolutionary paths, uncovering their unique strengths and weaknesses. By doing so, I aim to identify universal design patterns applicable across the spectrum of data engineering. Join me as we explore the essence of convergent evolution, its relevance in our field, and how it can guide us through the Data Engineering Lifecycle, enriching our understanding and practice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the tech sector, just like many other sectors, there are scammers around. When you are dealing with electronics this is typically in the form of chips that have had their markings changed, usually to make them appear as if they are a more expensive chip. This has happened to me, so I’ll talk a bit about it.</p>



<p>As part of my work <a href="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/tag/atom/">restoring the Acorn Atom</a>, I replaced the 6502 CPU with a much lower power CMOS variant made by Rockwell, the R65C02. But something was bugging me. In my tests, I didn’t notice any power drop between that and the original CPU.</p>



<p>You see, the original 6502 used an NMOS process which is typically much more power hungry than CMOS. On top of this, the R65C02 was made using a smaller fabrication size. These things combined means that in-theory it should draw an order of magnitude less power. The R65C02 has an extended instruction set, so it is usually easy to identify.</p>



<p>This is the chip I bought.</p>

<p>What initially bugged me is that the printing was far too bright compared to pretty much any chip I’ve worked with. Something just seemed “off” about the printing too, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>



<p>As with all things tech I’m not sure about, I start testing them. First of all I tried the acetone test. You see, the printing used on genuine ICs is designed to withstand the harsh cleaning chemicals used during manufacturing. Whereas chips that have had their markings changed typically use a cheaper painting process, which can often be removed with acetone. Straight away some of the printing starting coming off on the acetone soaked cotton bud I used. It looked pretty smeared and faded after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Next up was a logical test. My <a href="https://store.backbit.io/product/chip-tester/">BackBit Chip Tester Pro v2</a> can not only test the function of a 6502 CPU, but also tell you which variant it is (even detecting an Atari Sally variant). I bunged it in and hit the test button.</p>

<p>That explains a few things, this is really a standard NMOS 6502, not a 65C02.</p>



<h2>Other Signs</h2>



<p>There is one other sign I found out later which proves that this is not a genuine chip, the date code. You can see that it says 0032, this means the 32nd week of the year 2000. The problem with that is in 1999 the semiconductor division of Rockwell split out into a company called Conexant. When this happened, any chips manufactured suddenly switched to the Conexant branding, which is a completely different logo.</p>



<p>In addition, I believe, based on web searches, that the wafer ID for an R65C02 is 11450, not 11473 as marked here.</p>



<p>This was annoying because the seller is based in the UK and claims you should buy from them because you take your chances buying from China.</p>



<h2>Another Chip</h2>



<p>Once I figured out my chip was fake, and before I realised the date code issue, I bought another one from a different seller.</p>

<p>The printing looked a bit better on this one at least, but 30th week of 2015? I very much doubt it. I can’t find evidence of any being manufactured after the early 2000s. Let’s whack it on the tester…</p>

<p>That’s more like it, this is at least a R65C02 CPU. My best guess is the speed grade is the issue. The ‘3’ on the end means that it is rated to run at 3MHz, it is likely really just a 2 or 1MHz chip that has been marked up to give it a higher value. This is good enough for me as the Atom will only run it at 1MHz.</p>



<h2>Physical Comparison</h2>



<p>Here are the two chips claiming to be 65C02s together with an original 6502. Normally I would expect there to be printing on the bottom as well as the top.</p>

<p>On the bottom of the middle chip is what appears to be logographic characters. I do not know what these represent, or even if I have them the right way around. <strong>Update</strong>: see the end of this post for the translation the community figured out.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>This is quite a wide spread problem, and it is difficult to find genuine old parts when even UK sellers are selling parts that are not as they are marked.</p>



<p>If, like me, you are not pushing them to their designed limits, that may be OK. But sometimes it really isn’t, and sometimes the chip is nothing like what is shown on the markings, leading to potential physical damage to the machine it is used in.</p>



<p>As a side note, I have designed a prototype board that allows use of a brand new 65C02 IC made by Western Design Center in retro machines. The Western Design Center chips have a slightly different pinout to the others, so need a slight conversion. PCBs for this are coming soon.</p>



<h2>Update 2023-12-07</h2>



<p>This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38557246">post got added to Hacker News</a> and was in the top 10 for a while. Thank you to whoever did that. In the comments the Chinese handwriting was discussed and it seems that a translation has been found.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a native speaker I think its “贤”, just rotated right by 90 degree.</p>
<cite>libreliu on Hacker News</cite></blockquote>



<p>It appears when translated this means “virtuous, worthy, good; able”, which I guess (and other people guess too) means that the chip functions, not that it is a genuine / virtuous chip.</p>



<p>Also thanks to those who commented with minor corrections on Hacker News.</p>

<p>Swedish Tesla employees have gone on strike, and unions in neighboring Denmark and Norway have joined boycotts of Elon Musk's electric automaker.</p>
<p>Danish union 3F and Norway's Fellesforbundet, the largest private-sector unions in their respective nations, both announced plans this week to get in Tesla's way.</p>
<p>3F, which covers multiple industries in Denmark, has limited its sympathy strike to its Transportation arm, which union chair Jan Villadsen explained will mean transportation workers at docks, including drivers, won't unload or transport Tesla vehicles bound for Sweden.</p>

    

<p>"Even though Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world and owns Tesla, he can't just make his own rules," Villadsen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jan.g.villadsen/posts/669001345216182" rel="nofollow">declared</a> on Tuesday when announcing 3F's action. "We have some agreements on the labor market in the Nordics, and you have to comply with them if you want to do business here."</p>

        


        

<p>Fellesforbundet leader Jørn Eggum echoed Villadsen's sentiments in a Wednesday <a href="https://www.fellesforbundet.no/aktuelt/nyheter/2023/varsler-tesla-boikott/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> that his union will also launch a boycott aimed at stopping the transportation of Teslas into Sweden.</p>
<p>"In the Nordic countries, there is broad agreement about the importance of a well-organized working life," Eggum noted. "The right to demand a collective agreement is a natural part of [that], and we cannot accept that Tesla stands outside this."</p>

        

<p>3F and Fellesforbundet's sympathy strikes will begin on December 19 and December 20, respectively, if a collective agreement between Tesla and employees represented by Swedish automotive worker union IF Metall isn't in place.</p>
<p>IF Metall workers in Sweden – where Tesla doesn't manufacture vehicles but has a number of repair and service shops – have been <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/" rel="nofollow">on strike</a> since October after what they described as years of Tesla refusing to bargain with the union. IF Metall-represented employees claim Tesla hasn't guaranteed them good wages, a pension or insurance.</p>

<p>Tesla has long refused to bargain with unions, with CEO Elon Musk recently <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/30/musk_murders_x/">opining</a> that he disagrees with the entire concept of organized labor, as you can see below.</p>

</p>
<p>"I just don't like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing," the world's richest man told the <em>New York Times</em> DealBook Summit. "I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company." He added "If Tesla gets unionized it will be because we deserved it, and because we failed in some way."</p>

        

<p>Unions across Sweden have <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/darfor-tvingas-if-metall-att-strejka/sympatiatgarder-fran-andra-fackforbund/" rel="nofollow">banded together</a> to cripple Tesla. Swedish port workers have pledged to block imports, electricians have refused to work on damaged Tesla chargers or at the vehicle builder's facilities, painters and builders have declined to work for Elon's products and properties.</p>
<p>Postal workers even decided not to deliver mail to the electric automaker, including license plates – an action that Musk called "<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1727564977869844865?s=20" rel="nofollow">insane</a>". The local court has since <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/tesla_sweden_strike_lawsuit/">put a stop</a> to that action.</p>
<p>It's unknown whether Tesla plans to take further action to stop the strikes, or whether it'll cut its losses and bargain with employees – we asked, but didn't hear back. ®</p>

<p>One of the less obvious features of the <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tesla-cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is its vehicle voltage architecture. The Cybertruck is the first EV from the automaker to use a 48-Volt (48V) electrical system implementation throughout the entire vehicle, as compared to the 12V systems that are used in pretty much every other vehicle on the planet. Today, Tesla shared its 48V implementation documentation with other major automakers — including competitors like Ford.</p>







<p>Ford’s own CEO Jim Farley confirmed the news on X, formerly Twitter, last night.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ford CEO Jim Farley confirms Tesla has shared its 48V architecture documentation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk also chimed in.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The consequences of Tesla’s actions won’t be immediately obvious in any other carmaker’s products, as they will likely take a long time to manifest into any real changes for the industry — if they do at all. But let’s take a step back.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-does-48v-architecture-matter">Why does 48V architecture matter?</h2>



<p>48V architecture is a huge deal not because it enables any particular feature or capability for any one car, but because it will lead to a step change in how automakers wire, accessorize, and electrically engineer their vehicles. </p>



<p>The first mass-produced vehicles generally used 6V architecture to power things like headlamps, and the industry broadly began to adopt 12V electrics in the 1950s. By the late 1960s, almost every car on sale in the US used 12V electrics — power windows, interior lighting, cigarette lighters, brake lights, ignition spark, batteries, and more all unified around this common voltage standard. This change was a big deal, because it meant that the <em>suppliers</em> who built a lot of these electrically-driven components could easily adapt their products to work with any car. Parts became yet more standardized (plus, more affordable and reliable), and eventually 12V became the universal standard for vehicle electrics.</p>



<p>The problems with 12V architecture, though, have been looming (pun intended) for years. Because of the low voltage of this architecture, delivering sufficient power to all vehicle systems that need electricity became more and more complex. And as cars integrated more and more electrical components over the years, this led to ruinously complicated vehicle wiring layouts. (I want to be clear: I am <em>vastly</em> oversimplifying the nature of the challenges of 12V architecture, and it should be obvious by now I’m not an electrical engineer. I probably shouldn’t be allowed to be too close to a wall outlet, frankly.)</p>



<p>Switching to 48V architecture alleviates a huge number of challenges automakers are facing with 12V. The biggest one, though, is complexity: You need <em>far</em> less complex wiring harnesses to power all your vehicle systems, because each wire can supply far more power and voltage in a 48V system. 48V architecture also potentially improves overall electrical efficiency for reasons that I am not sufficiently qualified to explain beyond a kindergarten level, meaning your car’s accessory systems may require less power overall to operate (quite important for an EV).</p>



<h2 id="h-12v-roadblocks-remain-despite-tesla-s-action">12V roadblocks remain despite Tesla’s action</h2>



<p>The challenge in adopting 48V architecture primarily lays in the vehicle supplier ecosystem, but that conclusion requires a bit of context setting.</p>



<p>If you cannot convert <em>all</em> of a vehicle’s systems to 48V architecture, the benefits of using such an architecture start to diminish pretty quickly in the form of introducing new complexities (i.e., a hybrid 48V / 12V vehicle architecture). As such, most automakers have clung to 12V because they know it and it <em>works</em>.</p>



<p>If an automaker decides to move to a 48V architecture, whatever car it builds must use 48V-ready accessories. But, suppliers aren’t incentivized to build such accessories without sufficient demand. While carmakers like Ford certainly have the power and scale to commission 48V parts independently, the per-unit cost of those components is likely to be substantially higher than their 12V equivalents — especially if they’re being produced in comparatively low volumes. And, many carmakers would be forced to make such a transition slowly over their entire vehicle lineup (it’s worth noting that ICE vehicles can use and would benefit greatly from 48V systems, too). And so, most carmakers stick with 12V. It’s a chicken-and-egg kind of issue.</p>







<p>To be frank, Tesla isn’t sharing its 48V architecture from the Cybertruck for purely altruistic reasons. Once you understand the conundrum around vehicle suppliers in the 12V world and making a transition to 48V, things start to come into greater focus. Tesla knows that transitioning to 48V is going to be <em>incredibly</em> difficult for legacy OEMs, and while there is potentially upside for Tesla in such a change (more on that in a moment), this is something of a PR move.</p>



<p>By publishing its 48V architecture, Tesla is saying “OK, we’ll show you how we did this thing — a thing you say is really complicated and difficult and would take years to replicate. You can just copy us.” But Tesla knows full well that even a powerful and well-resourced company like Ford can’t spin up a 48V accessory supply chain overnight, and that such a change would incur very substantial non-recurring engineering work (NRE, as it’s known in some industries).</p>



<p>For Tesla, though, there are theoretical benefits in the event the wider industry switches to 48V vehicle systems. The biggest one is the supply chain. The more components in the global vehicle supply chain that are designed for 48V vehicle systems, the lower the cost of those components will become over time — through volume, competitive engineering, and increased reliability. The second is a bit more nebulous, but arguably just as important: Engineers and other skilled workers in the industry will coalesce their work and knowledge around 48V systems, reducing the amount of redundant work happening and increasing the number of workers in the hiring pool who can understand and innovate on Tesla’s systems (and who can bring their knowledge to Tesla, barring any intellectual property infringement, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this move for anyone — for Tesla, the industry, or for the engineers designing the vehicle systems themselves. And it’s plain that the supplier ecosystem needs a kick in the pants to accelerate the transition to 48V, and that the benefits of such a transition are very substantial.</p>



<p>But it’s much harder to say how much of an impact Tesla’s decision to share its 48V design will actually have. Clearly, automakers are already incentivized to move to 48V, but doing so is challenging for a reason — it’s not just laziness. There are legitimate (if frustratingly financial and logistical) reasons that the 48V transition is moving along slowly.</p>



<p>It’s very possible that providing publicity around this relatively esoteric technical issue will be the greatest factor in instigating more aggressive work to implement 48V vehicle systems, as opposed to any technical know-how gleaned from Tesla’s documentation. </p>



<p>It should also be noted that Tesla has two distinct advantages in transitioning to 48V that legacy automakers do not. The first is being unusually vertically integrated in its approach to building vehicles — Tesla designs almost all of its own vehicle systems, even if they may be procured from third parties who actually manufacture them. The second is that Tesla doesn’t have many legacy vehicle designs to support or consider in deciding to transition electrical architectures. Put another way, Tesla’s focus on independent engineering and low legacy debt are huge reasons it can introduce a 48V vehicle while other auto OEMs continue to stick to 12V and likely will for years from now, even in their EVs. And simply telling other carmakers how it built a 48V system won’t change those realities overnight.</p>

<!-- cache hit 507:single/related:15e9502cad0b558c28b6c7748e41ad11 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Wednesday, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/meta-ai-updates/">released</a> a free standalone AI image-generator website, "<a href="https://imagine.meta.com/">Imagine with Meta AI</a>," based on its Emu image-synthesis model. Meta used 1.1 billion publicly visible Facebook and Instagram images to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-new-ai-chatbot-trained-public-facebook-instagram-posts-2023-09-28/">train the AI model</a>, which can render a novel image from a written prompt. Previously, Meta's version of this technology—using the same data—was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">only available</a> in messaging and social networking apps such as Instagram.</p>

<p>If you're on Facebook or Instagram, it's quite possible a picture of you (or that you took) helped train Emu. In a way, the <a href="https://bryanalexander.org/digital-literacy/you-are-the-product-one-interesting-source-for-the-meme/">old saying</a>, "If you're not paying for it, you are the product" has taken on a whole new meaning. Although, as of 2016, Instagram users uploaded over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-users/instagrams-user-base-grows-to-more-than-500-million-idUSKCN0Z71LN/">95 million photos a day</a>, so the dataset Meta used to train its AI model was a small subset of its overall photo library.</p>
<p>Since Meta says it only uses publicly available photos for training, setting your photos private on Instagram or Facebook should prevent their inclusion in the company's future AI model training (unless it changes that policy, of course).</p>

<p>Similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/stable-diffusion-xl-puts-ai-generated-visual-worlds-at-your-gpus-command/">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/stunning-midjourney-update-wows-ai-artists-with-camera-like-feature/">Midjourney</a>, Imagine with Meta AI generates new images based on what the AI model "knows" about visual concepts learned from the training data. Creating images using the new website requires a Meta account, which can be imported from an existing Facebook or Instagram account. Each generation creates four 1280×1280 pixel images that can be saved in JPEG format. Images include a small "Imagined with AI" watermark logo in the lower left-hand corner.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"We’ve enjoyed hearing from people about how they’re using imagine, Meta AI’s text-to-image generation feature, to make fun and creative content in chats," Meta says in its news release. "Today, we’re expanding access to imagine outside of chats, making it available in the US to start at imagine.meta.com. This standalone experience for creative hobbyists lets you create images with technology from Emu, our image foundation model."</p>

<p>We put Meta's new AI image generator through a battery of low-stakes informal tests using our "Barbarian with a CRT" and "Cat with a beer" image-synthesis protocol and found aesthetically novel results, as you can see above. (As an aside, when generating images of people with Emu, we noticed many looked like typical Instagram fashion posts.)</p>
<p>We also tried our hand at adversarial testing. The generator appears to filter out most violence, curse words, sexual topics, and the names of celebrities and historical figures (no Abraham Lincoln, sadly), but it allows commercial characters like Elmo (yes, even "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">with a knife</a>") and Mickey Mouse (though not with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">a machine gun</a>).</p>
<p>Meta's model generally creates photorealistic images well, but not as well as Midjourney. It can handle complex prompts better than Stable Diffusion XL, but perhaps not as well as DALL-E 3. It doesn't seem to do text rendering well at all, and it handles different media outputs like watercolors, embroidery, and pen-and-ink with mixed results. Its images of people seem to include diversity in ethnic backgrounds. Overall, it seems about average these days in terms of AI image synthesis.</p>

		    <h3><strong>Investors smell the money, billions are flowing, even in the US, which could become major lithium producer.</strong></h3>
<h4>By&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Richter</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOLF STREET</a>.</h4>
<p>Who needs fundamentals when you have rampant speculation? And then you can make up a story that fits the speculative narrative, and everyone will jump in, and you’re off to the races. That’s what commodities are all about from time to time. They’re so much fun.</p>
<p>The spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate, trading in Shanghai and serving as a benchmark, dropped today to CNY 133,500 per tonne, down 77% from the peak a year ago, and below where it had been in 2017.</p>
<p>It had spiked by 1,410% from CNY 39,500 per tonne in August 2020 to CNY 600,000 in November 2022, multiplying by 15 in about 27 months, <em>WHOOSH</em>. The narrative to support the speculative craze was, you guessed it, lithium shortage. But high prices brought lots of new production online. The best cure for high prices is high prices. And soon the new and improved narrative was that there was a lithium glut. And today roughly completes the first full year of a most spectacular collapse in prices.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png" alt="" width="784" height="581" srcset="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png 784w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-560x415.png 560w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-768x569.png 768w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-260x193.png 260w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-160x119.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></p>
<p>We already had a lithium bubble followed by an implosion a few years ago: The prior lithium bubble peaked in 2017, at CNY 175,000, and imploded over the next three years, with the price dropping 77% to CNY 39,500 by August 2020.</p>
<p>Inevitably, when you have so much fun, something even more fun happens: A startup company, Stardust Power, announced on November 21 that it would go public – and you also guessed this – via merger with a SPAC. With the money it expects to raise in the SPAC merger, it will build its first lithium refinery. It already picked out a “shovel-ready” location near Tulsa, OK, to build the lithium refinery and then to supply the EV battery industry.</p>
<p>This Stardust Power announcement comes after the stocks of EV SPACs and a bunch of other companies that had gone public via merger with a SPAC have totally collapsed and entered my pantheon of <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/category/all/imploded-stocks/">Imploded Stocks</a>. So good luck.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a lot of demand for battery-grade lithium to go into the batteries for the global EV production boom, and thankfully, lithium is abundant around the world and in the US.</p>
<p>In September, we were treated to this headline: “Lithium deposit found in US may be among world’s largest, study finds.” The area is in Nevada. But in the US, permitting issues, local opposition, legal challenges, and costs don’t exactly make starting up lithium production a cakewalk.</p>
<p>Then there is the long-running Lithium Nevada’s $2.3 billion project, which, after overcoming a host of issues, including legal challenges from tribes, is now on schedule to begin production in late 2026 at what could be one of the largest lithium mines in the world.</p>
<p>The big kahuna of the oil-and-gas industry, Exxon Mobil, announced earlier in November that it plans to produce lithium from briny water pumped up from about 10,000 feet in the Smackover Formation in Arkansas. Production is expected to start by 2027 and will eventually supply lithium for well over 1 million EVs per year, according to Reuters. It cited analysts at TD Cowen that estimated this would require Exxon Mobil to invest $2 billion. So that’s going to be good for the economy.</p>
<p>Lithium production at the Salton Sea in California has been kicked around for years. The area has been dubbed Lithium Valley due to its lithium-rich geothermal activity. Three companies are now working on projects using a new technology of extraction that is still largely unproven at scale. Two of the three – BHE Renewables and EnergySource Minerals – own and operate geothermal powerplants in the area, and that’s a pretty good fit. So we’ll see.</p>
<p>All kinds of lithium production projects are being worked on in the US and around the world. Currently, Australia, Chile, and China dominate lithium production. Australia alone accounts for nearly half the global production. The three combined account for about 90% of global production. Everyone is now trying to get in on it. Investors have smelled the money, and the billions are flowing.</p>

Bradford DeLong (2022). This is a narrative economic history of the 20th century. It heavily focuses on the interaction between policy and economic thought.</p><p>"Lost Continents" by L. Sprague de Camp (1954). This book looks at Atlantis and other lost continents as rhetorical devices in ancient history and philosophy, 20th century pseudoscience/pseudohistory, and science fiction.

Tress is just such a fun adventure and Yumi left me an emotional wreck by the end.</p><p>"There Is No Antimemetics Division" - I had a brief period where I wanted to read some stories about clandestine operations around odd anomalies, SCP-adjacent if you will. This, alongside "Agents of Dreamland", is rather short and great for getting through in a couple sittings. It's all about taking on an entity that you actively can't remember the existence of.</p><p>Non-Fiction:</p><p>"Letters to a Young Poet" - This is a collection of ten letters sent from the poet Rainer Maria Rilke to a younger aspiring poet in the early 1900s. As a creative that sometimes struggles with the whole "what am I doing this for?", I found this a highly inspiring and comforting read.</p><p>"On Writing" - I'm sure most of you know the book, or at the least know Stephen King. The info in here on writing (at least in the style of King) is fantastic, but I think the memoir portions are the killer part of this book. The man certainly has a storied past, for better or worse.

Still my favorite series of all time. This took up a pretty big chunk of the year, so most other books were rather light urban fantasy novels.<p>But one other mini-series stood out (potentially going to be a trilogy, but both #1 &amp; #2 can stand alone).</p><p>Teixcalaan #1 &amp; #2, "A Memory Called Empire" and "A Desolation Called Peace" by Arkady Martine for being very different feeling sci-fi books that are not your typical western-centric fare. Highlights are the language, and that the story feels both very small and contained, and also all-encompassing, at the same time.

The universe is incredibly deep, the characters are incredibly rich, but I do wish Erikson would let us get a little bit comfier in the shoes of each character for longer stretches of time. I sailed through House of Chains so quickly because I didn't have perspective whiplash, but I find it difficult to keep all of the characters in my head during some sections -- battles in particular are a real challenge for me in the Malazan series.<p>Highly recommend the series, but a warning: if you find yourself bouncing off book one, don't bother with the rest of the series. I find that the later books are slightly better written and slightly better structured, but the core writing style issues are still there (notably, perspective whiplash and a magic system that is so complex that it sometimes feels like deux ex machina).

A bit of a pop-sci read on the subject that's very approachable. Most chapters are &lt;10 pages. Dettmer manages to distill information very effectively though, he paints a fascinating picture of the complicated machinations of the human immune system.

And, of course, well written.<p>4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burke - deconstructs the hustle/productivity mindset and rejects it in favor of an existential view of accepting your finitude and prioritizing accordingly. I wouldn’t say the book changed my mind but reassured some of my feelings and put some words to why trying to pursue too many goals or experiences typically fails or is unfulfilling. Sort of ironically takes its main point a little too far by the end in my opinion but I recommend it anyway, it’s pretty short.</p><p>Cadillac Desert by Marc Reisner - still in progress but clearly a great book so far. I recommend it to anyone living in western US/MX.

If you want real cutting-edge Schizophrenia research it's best left to those on the front line in hospitals and Ivory Towers. Not armchair yahoos like Sapolsky who get a laugh off the backs of people suffering. He's done a great disservice to those who are afflicted with Schizophrenia. Much better than his rambling lecture is a TED talk given by Bethany Yeiser. Let's put a human face on Schizophrenia, shouldn't we?</span></p></div></td></tr>

I strongly recommend anyone who has progressed beyond their angsty sophomore year of college to give it a pass; just go read Anthem to get a feel for Rand's poorly justified bullshit (and to observe a nice example of 'literature' that can do no better than straw man antagonists) and save yourself several hundred pages of reading.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Great retelling of the history of one of the great medieval South Indian kingdoms. Not his best, but his writing is still top notch.</p><p>Sea of Tranquility- speculative fiction from Emily St. John Mandel (of Station Eleven fame). It's a series of interconnected stories spanning centuries from the near past to the near future. Beautifully written. Read when I was down with COVID earlier this year and it invaded my dreams (in a good way). Short and easy read.</p><p>Giovanni's Room- story of an American expat in Paris caught between his love for a man and his duty to his girlfriend. This is the first James Baldwin book I have read but will definitely check out more of his work in 2024.</p><p>Theory of Bastards- speculative fiction by Audrey Schulmann. Literary sci-fi similar to Station Eleven. It's about a woman researching primate behavior set in the near future where the earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change. Very well researched, beautifully written and nothing like I have ever read before. This won the 2019 Philip K Dick Award.</p><p>Invisible Cities- literary fiction by Italo Calvino. It's less than 200 pages but a very dense and tough read. It's a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan where MP is describing cities in KK's vast empire. It's a strange, strange book that I think I will return to often. If you liked the world building in Piranesi and want more, this is the book for you. Calvino describes 55 cities in under 200 pages, with each one feeling very different. Again, first Calvino book I have read and will definitely check out more of his works in 2024.</p><p>Non-fiction:</p><p>Thinking in Systems: A Primer- by Donella Meadows. Read this based on HN's recommendation. Thank you!</p><p>On Intelligence- by Jeff Hawkins. This was on my shelf for years and am glad I got to read it this year. The creator of the Palm Pilot presents his theory of intelligence and how the brain works. It's compelling. I hope to read his follow up book in 2024. Would love HN's recommendations of similar books.</p><p>A Primate's Memoir- by Robert M. Sapolsky. Enjoyable read of the author's research on Savannah baboons and his adventures in Africa. His love for primates and humans alike come through clearly.</p><p>Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making- by Tony Fadell. A great business book by the co-founder of Nest. Draws on his experience both as a startup founder and leading innovative teams at large tech companies (Apple, in his case). Just as any business book, this could have been shorter and less repetitive but thankfully, there is enough good material here to be a book rather than a blog post.

<ul>
<li>A US senator has asked the Department of Justice to let Apple and Google disclose how governments surveil users through push notifications.</li>

<li>Google has also acknowledged the senator’s plea and said it is committed to keeping users informed about government requests for push notification data.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Government agencies have been spying on smartphone users through push notifications sent out by apps, a US senator <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a letter</a> to the Department of Justice on December 6.</p><p>Oregon Senator Ron Wyden has asked the Department of Justice to lift any existing restrictions around discussions of push notification surveillance.</p><p>“I write to urge the Department of Justice (DOJ) to permit Apple and Google to inform their customers and the general public about demands for smartphone app notification records,” Wyden writes in the letter.</p><p>He explains that push notifications pass through a kind of digital post office run by the phone’s operating system providers. “Because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information,” the letter says. This could tell governments how users interact with certain apps, give them access to a notification’s complete text, and disclose some unencrypted content.</p><p>Wyden moved the DOJ to allow Apple and Google to be transparent about the demands they receive from governments regarding push notification surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two companies welcomed Wyden’s letter and acknowledged that push notification surveillance has been happening for a while. Apple even said it was not allowed to disclose government requests for push notification data but will start informing users about it now.</p><p>“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” Apple said in a statement published by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>. “Now that this method has become public, we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”</p><p>Google also acknowledged the issue and said it shared Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.” Google’s transparency report already documents governmental requests for users’ push notification data.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>This post takes inspiration from <a href="https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules">Visual design rules you can safely follow every time</a> by Anthony Hobday.</em></p>

<p>Here, we’re talking about performance rules you can safely follow every time. As with any rules, you are free to break them. You may need a good reason to do so.</p>

<p>We are covering some best practices for HTTP, Ruby, and the database layers so that most applications with decent traffic can improve their response time.
Some of these practices can be obvious to experienced developers. Your applications are on good Rails if you already know and use them all.</p>

<h2>HTTP</h2>

<h3>Use a CDN</h3>

<p>Serve all resources from a CDN. It will reduce latency for your visitors and the number of requests to your server. What’s more, CDNs provide more bandwidth than your servers.</p>

<p>CDNs aren’t expensive, and their rates are very progressive. They are also simple to set:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_controller.asset_host = "cdn.application.example"
</code></pre>

<p>We can’t think of any good reason to do without them except for an application running solely on a private network.</p>

<h3>Enable HTTP compression</h3>

<p>Compression saves bandwidth at a modest CPU cost.
Most web servers, like  <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html">Apache</a> and <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html">Nginx</a>, enable compression by default.
To be sure, verify the presence of <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> in the response headers.</p>

<h3>Enable HTTP cache</h3>

<p>A cached resource means one less request for the client and server and, therefore, a faster loading time.<br>
It goes without saying that caching should be enabled for all resources passing through the CDN.</p>

<p>The Cache-Control header gives instructions to browsers and CDNs.
Check that you have a header in the response that looks like this <code>Cache-Control "max-age=86400, public"</code>.
Max age is the duration in seconds, so 24 hours in this case.
It’s up to you to decide whether you need a more aggressive cache.</p>

<p>For private resources, turn off the cache with the <code>Cache-Control: private</code> header.</p>

<h3>Enable keep-alive connections</h3>

<p>Keep-alive connections are reusable.
They prevent having to re-establish a connection, as well as SSL negotiation.
They reduce latency time for all pages made up of several resources.</p>

<p>Web servers often activate them by default.
You can verify the presence of the following header <code>Keep-Alive timeout=5, max=100</code>.
In this example, the connection is closed after 5 seconds of inactivity and can be reused 100 times.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<h3>Run in the background as much as possible</h3>

<p>Any heavy or latency-intensive task should be run in the background as far as possible.
Sending e-mails is a case in point.<br>
It’s a relatively long task compared with the duration of an HTTP request.
Moreover, its duration is unpredictable since it requires a network connection.
On the other hand, there’s no obligation to send the e-mail during the HTTP request.
So, using the <code>deliver_later</code> method from Rails controllers is a good habit.</p>

<p>As well as reducing response time, it frees up a web process or thread to handle the subsequent request.
So the application can handle a larger volume.
It will also be less vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.</p>

<h3>Know count, size, and length to save on SQL queries</h3>

<p>It’s important to know the differences between these three methods to ensure you’re triggering the fewest or most optimized SQL queries possible.</p>

<p>The <code>count</code> method always triggers a <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code> query.
The <code>length</code> method ensures that the relationship has been loaded to count in memory.
The <code>size</code> method adapts to the loading of the relationship.
Either it triggers a query if it hasn’t been loaded, or it counts in memory if it has already been loaded.
Here’s a summary table:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Records loaded</th>
<th>Record not loaded</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>count</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>size</td>
<td>Count in memory</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>length</td>
<td>Count in memory</td>
<td>SELECT * FROM table</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>When counting and enumerating, it’s important to call <code>size</code> after the relationship has been loaded.
In all cases, the aim is to trigger a single request.</p>

<pre><code># Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = User.all
users.size # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users"
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"

# Good
users = User.all
users.length # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.each { } # No queries

# Good
users = User.all
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.size # No queries

# Good
users = User.all.load # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.size # No queries
users.each { } # No queries

# Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = User.all
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.count # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users"
</code></pre>

<h3>Know exists, any/empty, and present/blank to save on SQL queries</h3>

<p>As with <code>count</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>length</code>, it’s important to know the subtleties of these methods to trigger the fewest and most efficient queries possible.</p>

<p>The <code>exists?</code> method always triggers a query. It is optimized because it stops as soon as it finds a line.
The <code>present?</code> and <code>blank?</code> methods make sure that the query has been executed before checking for their presence or absence in memory.
Finally, the <code>any?</code> and <code>empty?</code> methods adapt if the relationship has already been loaded.
Here’s a summary table:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Loaded</th>
<th>Not loaded</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>exists?</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>any?/empty?</td>
<td>In memory</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>present?/blank?</td>
<td>In memory</td>
<td>SELECT * FROM table</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In this way, we can deduce good and bad uses when we condition a display according to the presence of recordings.</p>

<pre><code># Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = Users.all
if users.exists? # SELECT 1 FROM users LIMIT 1
  users.each { } # SELECT * FROM users
end

# Good
users = Users.all
if users.present? # SELECT * FROM users
  users.each { } # No queries
end

# Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = Users.all
if users.any? # SELECT 1 FROM users LIMIT 1
  users.each { } # SELECT * FROM users
end

# Good
users = Users.all.load # SELECT * FROM users
if users.any? # No queries
  users.each { } # No queries
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Use pluck instead of loading ActiveRecord instances when possible</h3>

<p>Pluck allows you to retrieve the raw result of an SQL query and thus avoid creating ActiveRecord instances.
Since there are fewer things to do, it’s inevitably faster and less memory-hungry.
On the other hand, you no longer benefit from the full functionality of an ActiveRecord model.
So it’s a good idea to use it when you don’t need your model’s methods.
We’re thinking in particular of a CSV or text export of several thousand lines.</p>

<pre><code># Slow
CSV.generate do |csv|
  User.all.each { |user| csv &lt;&lt; [user.id, user.name, user.email] }
end

# Fast
CSV.generate do |csv|
  User.pluck(:id, :name, :email).each { |row| csv &lt;&lt; row }
end
</code></pre>

<p>When you need to retrieve a large number of records, try to find a solution with <code>pluck</code>.</p>

<h3>Use symbols or frozen string literals</h3>

<p>By default, Ruby creates a new instance for any string literal, but not for symbols.</p>

<pre><code>"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 80
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 100

:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
</code></pre>

<p>The same chain has been created three times, which is wasteful when the symbol has been reused.
So symbols are more efficient.
A comment at the beginning of each file tells Ruby to freeze and reuse literal strings.</p>

<pre><code># frozen_string_literal: true
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60

:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
</code></pre>

<p>However, the string can no longer be modified, as it has been frozen.
Passing a frozen string to a method you don’t control may result in a FrozenError exception.
You’ll need to duplicate it explicitly.</p>

<pre><code># frozen_string_literal: true
"Ruby".concat(" on Rails") # FrozenError: can't modify frozen String
"Ruby".dup.concat(" on Rails") # =&gt; "Ruby on Rails"
</code></pre>

<h3>Store function results in local variables if needed more than once</h3>

<p>Even if this sounds obvious, it’s not uncommon to read about this kind of code.</p>

<pre><code># Bad
if object.expensive_compute
  puts object.expensive_compute
end

# Good
if result = object.expensive_compute
  puts result
end
</code></pre>

<p>Even with relatively quick methods, it’s a shame to repeat them.</p>

<pre><code># Bad
puts array.first.method1
puts array.first.method2
puts array.first.method3

# Good
object = array.first
puts object.method1
puts object.method2
puts object.method3
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn’t make the code more complicated, and sometimes simplifies it a little.</p>

<h3>Reuse HTTP connections</h3>

<p>For the reasons explained in the <em>Enable keep-alive connections</em> section,
it’s more efficient to reuse the same HTTP connection to execute multiple requests.
Each time, you save the time needed to establish the connection, as well as the SSL negotiation.
This is a significant saving.</p>

<pre><code># Slow, create 5 connections
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)

# Fast, by re-using the same connection 5 times
Net::HTTP.start(url.host) do |http|
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
end

# Fast, but without a block
http = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port)
http.start
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.finish
</code></pre>

<p>The easiest way is to make all requests in a block passed to <code>Net::HTTP.start</code>, as you won’t forget to close the connection.
If you can’t group all your requests in one block, you can always start and end them manually.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<h3>Tune your Database settings</h3>

<p>By default, most databases are not optimally configured for your use and your server’s capabilities.
If you manage your own database, it’s crucial to do so.<br>
If your database is managed by a third party, it’s just as important to check that this has been done properly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are tools available to help you do just that.
For PostgreSQL, we recommend <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/">PGTune</a>.
For MySQL, there is MySQLTunner, but we have yet to gain experience with it.</p>

<p>By giving the amount of RAM and number of CPUs, PGTune gives you the best settings for your server. It’s effortless to do.<br>
Then, you only have to copy the settings to the config file.</p>

<p>We like to store those settings into a dedicated file such as <code>/etc/postgresql/16/main/conf.d/pgtune.conf</code>.
If we have to change it in the future, we just need to replace the whole file.
It’s easier for the maintenance.</p>

<p>For SQLite, there are good default since Rails 7.1.
Otherwise you can set those parameters yourself:</p>

<pre><code>PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA journal_size_limit = 67108864; -- 64 megabytes
PRAGMA mmap_size = 134217728; -- 128 megabytes
PRAGMA cache_size = 2000;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;

</code></pre>

<h3>SQL will always be faster than your code</h3>

<p>If a task can be performed by the database or your code, let the database take care of it.
It’s faster because all the work is done where the data is.
This means less bandwidth consumption and less latency.
Moreover, your code is unlikely to be better than the database.</p>

<pre><code>  Invoice.pluck(:amount).sum # Slower
  Invoice.sum(:amount) # Faster
</code></pre>

<h3>Index all foreign keys</h3>

<p>The odds for a foreign key to appear in a where clause are very high.
If it’s not the case, probably that the foreign key is useless.
So it’s a no brainer decision to create an index when adding a foreign key.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of indexes is that they slow down table writes.
But very often, the number of reads far exceeds the number of writes.
On the other hand, if your index is never used, it should be deleted.
This information is available in PostgreSQL’s internal tables.
It’s a bit confusing to get into.
Fortunately, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/ankane/pghero">PgHero</a> make it very easy.</p>

<p>So, by default, add an index to each foreign key, then delete the few that are never used.</p>

<h3>Exclude nulls from indexes</h3>

<p>A database index is a B-tree structure.
It is very efficient when data has a high cardinality.
However, when a column allows nulls, it often becomes the most redundant value.
The index is less efficient and takes up more space.
Unless null is an infrequently repeated value, there are only disadvantages to indexing them.<br>
Exclude them when creating the index with a where clause.</p>

<pre><code>add_index :table, :column, where: "(column IS NOT NULL)"
</code></pre>

<p>Or in pure SQL :</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX name ON table (column) WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
</code></pre>

<h3>Do not index column with a low cardinality such as boolean</h3>

<p>The reason is the same as in the previous paragraph.
B-tree indexes work best when cardinality is high.
So a Boolean is the worst column you can index.
So don’t index booleans.</p>

<p>As with other types, if you have very repetitive values that are not significant from a business point of view, it’s probably a good idea to exclude them from the index.
We’re thinking in particular of default values:</p>

<pre><code>add_column :accounts, :balance, default: 0, null: false
add_index :accouns, :balance, where: "(balance != 0)"
</code></pre>

<p>Or in pure SQL:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN balance decimal DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX index_accounts_balance ON accounts (balance) WHERE balance != 0;
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These rules are by no means exhaustive.
Feel free to share your own.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://blog.pgpkeys.eu/">pgpkeys-eu.github.io</a></h2>
      

      


<p>A proposed fork of the OpenPGP standard, called “LibrePGP” and initiated by GnuPG’s maintainer Werner Koch, has made a series of statements on its own website<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in order to justify its existence. Some of these criticisms have merit, but most are misleading at best. We address the points raised individually here.</p>

<h2 id="the-critique">The Critique</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IETF OpenPGP Working Group (WG) at some point decided to give up on its charter to produce an updated specification and instead started to re-invent that standard.
Whether this is in line with IETF rules is questionable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crypto-refresh draft<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and LibrePGP<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> are both backwards-compatible with RFC4880, RFC5581, and RFC6687.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Neither of them attempt to re-invent any existing standard. Crypto-refresh leaves out many extensions that are included in LibrePGP, in part because the Working Group was <em>not</em> willing to overstep the limitations of the current charter.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Items included in LibrePGP that were intentionally left out of crypto-refresh include:<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Restricted Encryption key flag</li>
  <li>Timestamping usage key flag</li>
  <li>Attested Key Signatures</li>
  <li>Attested Certifications subpacket</li>
  <li>Key Block subpacket</li>
</ul>

<p>These proposed extensions to OpenPGP are compatible with the crypto-refresh draft, and can be specified at a future date once the WG is re-chartered.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considering that new features and discussions for larger updates of the specification delayed a new RFC for many years and were the reason for closing the WG in 2017 and re-opening in 2020,
we proposed to go back to the last commonly agreed upon draft or to conclude the WG on the grounds that no rough consensus could be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rough consensus <em>was</em> found; LibrePGP dissents from it.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> And one thing that the majority of the WG can agree upon was that the “last commonly agreed upon draft” was not agreed upon at all.</p>

<h2 id="01-symmetric-mode">01 Symmetric Mode</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that this new scheme was introduced for the benefit of allowing GCM as yet another encryption mode.
GCM is a counter mode and, as can be seen by the large changes required, is hard to get right.
Meanwhile we have GCM in CMS (the core of S/MIME) because Microsoft decided to go this way.
However, OpenPGP has made its decisions based on technical soundness and not based on larger vendor, government, or committee decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the strongest concern that LibrePGP has raised. GCM is hard to get right, but it is widely implemented and its limitations are well-understood.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Anyone who needs to support GCM in OpenPGP has a large number of well-tested libraries to choose from. Anyone who does not need GCM is not required to implement anything. GCM is OPTIONAL.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WG once decided to go with OCB and EAX. EAX was only added to avoid possible patent problems.
However, in the 4.5 years since the introduction of EAX, the OCB patent expired.
Thus, there is no more reason to reject OCB, and it should be declared as a RECOMMENDED mode with the intention to make it a MUST mode in some future OpenPGP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is beside the point, since OCB is already a MUST mode in the OpenPGP crypto-refresh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can also be expected that FIPS-140 will eventually allow OCB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but this is speculation, and no date is suggested.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our suggestion was: Drop all the new AEAD ideas and use what has been deployed and agreed upon in the OpenPGP WG a long time ago.
Further, turn OCB into MUST WG a long time ago. Further, turn OCB into MUST and EAX into MAY (only for backward compatibility with deployed implementations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is <em>already the case</em> in crypto-refresh:<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9.6. AEAD Algorithms 
…
Implementations MUST implement OCB. Implementations MAY implement EAX, GCM and other algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LibrePGP’s concerns are genuine, but have already been addressed.<sup id="fnref:8:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="02-padding-packet">02 Padding Packet</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A padding packet is introduced with the idea to mitigate traffic analysis.
However, it is suggested to use random data for the content of this packet and thus this packet opens a huge covert channel.
This is especially concerning for institutional users efforts regarding Data Leak Prevention (DLP).
Suggestions to use padding based on a verifiable seed, were rejected despite that this is the standard method to do padding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenPGP already contains numerous potential covert channels.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> Unencrypted padding packets are in many ways <em>safer</em> than those other covert channels, because they are obvious and can (if necessary) be detected and/or removed at e.g. a gateway appliance. The choice of whether to allow padding packets in a given context can still be made at the application layer.</p>

<p>The proposal to mandate verifiable-seed padding was considered in the WG, but consensus could not be reached.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> Many details of how it would work in practice remain unclear.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> Updated guidance for how best to generate padding can still be issued at a later date if consensus is forthcoming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This padding idea has come up in discussion every once in a while over the last 25 years and has always been rejected
because it does not belong into the encryption layer but into the application (plaintext) layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not always true. For example, when downloading keys from a keystore, OpenPGP <em>is</em> the application layer. It is not clear for example how else to implement padding in WKD, which only serves binary TPKs.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="03-changes-to-the-ecdh-encryption">03 Changes to the ECDH Encryption</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>ECDH is the standard way to do encryption with elliptic curves.
For OpenPGP ECDH has been specified in RFC-6637 from 2012 and been implemented by PGP and GnuPG even a year earlier.
Instead of keeping this solid specification some details have been changed without a sound reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only change to ECDH is that instead of using OpenPGP-specific OIDs to identify ECDH curves (which were never intended to be permanent OID allocations), the new crypto-refresh will use industry-standard OIDs (in v6 packets <em>only</em>).<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="04-proliferation-for-algorithms">04 Proliferation for Algorithms</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new draft not only allow the use of GCM as a third encryption mode but adds a couple of other required algorithms:</p>

  <p>HKDF
   Argon2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HKDF and Argon2 were added to address several known and potential weaknesses in the cryptographic layer of OpenPGP.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>
LibrePGP does not acknowledge the existence of these issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Optional modes (EAX, OCB, GCM, and a way to define even more)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenPGP has always been highly extensible, so it’s unclear what the specific objection is here (aside from GCM, which we address elsewhere).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Werner Koch joined the AES conference in 2000 on Phil Zimmermann’s wish to talk about algorithm proliferation.
They agreed on pushing the forthcoming AES along with their MDC extension, get Twofish and so out of the focus, and in general resist to add new algorithms.
That is for the simple reason that neither PGP nor GnuPG wanted to maintain all new algorithms until eternity.</p>

  <p>Later, they had to do a political compromise to allow Camellia for the use in Japan and Brainpool curves for European use.
We should really stick to this and not support algorithms which are just a substitute for existing crypto building blocks.
Since added complexity makes a review harder and the larger codebase has to be maintained indefinitely for backwards compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to say that it was OK to make a political compromise for the benefit of users who have to comply with some national regulations, but for some reason it is not OK to make a political compromise for the sake of users who have to comply with other national regulations. It might be fair to say that Werner regrets his previous decision and has decided not to repeat that mistake, but that is his personal viewpoint. Others obviously disagree.</p>

<p>Supporting extra algorithms comes at a cost. Whether this cost is “justifiable” is to some extent subjective. Some people think the cost of including GCM is too high, which is fair. If so, they are not required to implement GCM, since GCM is OPTIONAL.<sup id="fnref:11:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="05-removal-of-useful-real-world-features">05 Removal of Useful Real-world Features</h2>

<p>OpenPGP is a long-established standard and has accumulated many features over time. It is good practice to deprecate features that have been found to not work as intended, even if they are useful in theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, in 2016 an m flag was introduced to indicate that the plaintext shall be interpreted as MIME data.
This has been removed along with deprecating the traditional t flag to distinguish between binary and text data.
Having the ability to easily detect MIME data is for example required to process attachments from web mail clients or in air-gaped environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>t</code> flag was deprecated because it did not specify which character set was being used. UTF-8 has long been the standard encoding in OpenPGP, and all “text” usage is therefore already covered by <code>u</code>.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The designated revoker feature has also been deprecated with the rationale that a better method is to achieve this with an “escrowed” revocation, pre-created by the user.
In fact, GnuPG creates such a revocation certificate since version 2.1 (released in 2014), to mitigate the common problem of a forgotten password.
But this is not a replacement for corporate needs: the designated revoker is an important feature to manage a large scale deployments of OpenPGP keys and acts as a CRL (certificate revocation list) replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence is given that escrowed revocations are less suited to a corporate environment. Escrowed revocations are simple to reason over, and have been supported for decades. By contrast, designated revokers increase the complexity of validity calculations considerably - you cannot be sure if a key has been revoked by looking at the signatures on the key itself, but instead need to have a copy of the revoker’s key, which may not be immediately available. And what happens if the designated revoker’s key is itself revoked?</p>

<h2 id="06-removal-of-security-fixes">06 Removal of Security Fixes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to an implementation bug in PGP 5, the metadata of a signed file was not covered by the signatures.
RFC-4880 didn’t fix that for backward compatibility.
However, users were often surprised when they learned that the shown filename and file data could be changed while keeping the signature intact.
With the introduction of the new v5 signature packet format, the opportunity to fix that was taken.</p>

  <p>However, the crypto-refresh group then introduced v6 signatures and removed the fix (see this commit)
with the flimsy explanation that the way to populate that the field is not clear in a theoretical encrypt-then-sign scenario
and that signatures could not be detached and reattached (which is obvioulsy wrong).
A later proposed fix for v4 signature packets (Meta Hash subpacket, see discussion) was not considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An even later proposed fix, to store the metadata in a Signature Notation subpacket, <em>did</em> find initial support.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup> Since this merely extends an existing feature of OpenPGP, does not require changes to the wire format, and is therefore currently unchartered, the details were deferred to a future document.</p>

<h2 id="07-salted-signature-issue">07 Salted Signature Issue</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Salted signature were introduced with the idea that they might mitigate a chosen prefix attack in the same way as they will do for a certain SHA-1 based Web-of-Trust attack.
No research for that statement has been cited just an assumption and a concern related to fault attacks on EdDSA which is about the development of Wireguard-like protocol.
However, such fault attacks can be more securely detected by checking the signature after verification in the same way as the mitigation to Lenstra’s attack on RSA’s CRT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The existence of practical prefix attacks is an assumption. The question is: is it a <em>reasonable</em> assumption? The WG felt it best to err on the side of caution.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyway, the major concern here is that this adds another 32 octet covert channel to each message (and also blow the signature up by 64 octets)
In this case it is not an optional feature as with the padding packet.
This is a clear violation of best current practices in sensitive areas where signed mails are mandatory and encryption is not enforced (or monitored by a gateway).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Covert channels have already been discussed above.</p>

<h2 id="08-regression-from-deployed-formats-and-standard-behavior">08 Regression from Deployed Formats and Standard Behavior</h2>

<p>The section heading is overblown. The crypto-refresh draft and the LibrePGP draft are equally backward-compatible with all deployed OpenPGP artifacts other than those which have been rendered insecure by the passage of time, or experimental deployments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general the crypto-refresh draft tends to ignore the requirements of long term storage needs and considers online communication and software deployment pattern as the major OpenPGP usage.
Data and software life-cycle management has not been adequately taken in consideration and thus the draft regresses heavily from 30 years of PGP history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No example of “ignoring the requirements of long term storage needs” has been given, unless this refers to the OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> GCM mode, which being OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> can be ignored by such applications.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Of the complaints explicitly raised by LibrePGP, one (GCM) is substantial. The Working Group agreed with those concerns, but balanced them with the requirements of some users for regulatory compliance. OpenPGP has precedent here, having already included Brainpool and Camellia ciphers on similar grounds. All such regulatory-driven extensions to OpenPGP have historically been marked OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>, and GCM is no different. OpenPGP crypto-refresh has conformed to established precedent here.</p>

<p>The strongest implicit complaint is that several implementations have already spent significant time developing support for v5 (LibrePGP) artifacts, and that support for v6 (crypto-refresh) would be burdensome. But it is worth pointing out that other implementations with working v5 code are also implementing v6 despite the extra workload incurred.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

<p>The other explicitly-stated complaints can be divided into two classes, neither of which holds up to scrutiny. Most of them are minor technical issues that have been blown out of proportion, e.g. the superficial change in the curve specifier format. Some have even been described, on the record, as acceptable compromises by Werner in previous discussions.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> It would appear therefore that these concerns have been included purely to bulk out the list of grievances.</p>

<p>The remaining explicit complaints (touched upon in the preamble) concern IETF procedure, in which case there is a route of appeal via the IETF itself.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">27</a></sup> It is not apparent that such an appeal has even been submitted, let alone ruled upon.</p>

<p>There is also one implicit complaint that is only hinted upon in the text, and that is the increasing breakdown in personal trust between Werner and the wider OpenPGP community.<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>It is obvious that LibrePGP is an attempt to create facts on the ground that prejudice the conclusion of the IETF standardisation process, in order to maintain the pre-eminent position of one OpenPGP implementation (GnuPG) at the expense of others. It is also impossible to avoid concluding that the target of this power play is the rival implementation that is currently led by two ex-employees of Werner, with whom he has a long-standing and well-documented personal conflict.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Normally, personal conflicts are best left to be resolved at a personal level, but not when they fester to the point where they threaten to destroy an entire community. The root cause of this is not technical but personal, and the solution is therefore not technical but personal.</p>

<h2 id="a-way-forward">A way forward</h2>

<p>One important fact that every single person working in OpenPGP agrees upon is that OpenPGP is in a precarious position. Disagreements over governance and personal animosity have left it to stagnate, even as privacy and security technologies in general have advanced. Without fundamental changes in how OpenPGP functions as a community of human beings, it faces another lost decade at best, if not outright collapse. Actions that deliberately or carelessly foster further division are <em>not constructive</em>. We all have a responsibility to conduct ourselves in a professional manner for the sake of the community that some of us still believe in, even if it does not look particularly inspiring right now.</p>

<p>At this point in time, the OpenPGP community desperately needs to see some acts of good faith.
We strongly suggest that these should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The librepgp.org website shall be shut down. The draft-koch-librepgp I-D<sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> shall remain active as a reference.</li>
  <li>The OpenPGP Working Group shall, in accordance with its draft charter, begin the process of adopting the WKD protocol as described in draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service<sup id="fnref:16:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> as a WG standards track document, engaging in good faith with its author at all times.</li>
  <li>GnuPG shall merge <a href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393">https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393</a>, and desist from vetoing constructive contributions for personal reasons.</li>
  <li>The OpenPGP WG shall, as a matter of good faith, endeavour for the duration of its new charter to maintain in its work queue at all times at least one of the unchartered items already implemented in v5,<sup id="fnref:6:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> with reference to existing v5 implementations, to the extent that security and practicality concerns permit.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these things should happen, in whatever order but preferably the order listed, we can then begin the process of discussing the medium-term future of OpenPGP in a professional manner. This SHOULD include a commitment by all implementations to at minimum consume both v5 and v6 artifacts on a best-effort basis, even if they have a preference for which standard to ahdere to when generating artifacts. This should be sufficient to ensure that end users are not adversely affected by ongoing disagreements between implementations on the long term path forward.</p>

</ul>
<p><span>Today, we’re announcing that we’ve begun to upgrade people’s personal conversations on Messenger to use E2EE by default. Our aim is to ensure that everyone’s personal messages on Messenger can only be accessed by the sender and the intended recipients, and that everyone can be sure the messages they receive are from an authentic sender.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the most significant milestone yet for this project, which began in earnest after </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mark Zuckerberg outlined his vision for it in 2019</span></a><span>. Bringing E2EE to Messenger has been a complex process, with every feature and product goal revealing further challenges that required careful consideration.</span></p>
<p><span>Enabling E2EE on Messenger meant fundamentally rebuilding many aspects of the application its protocols to improve privacy, security, and safety while simultaneously maintaining the features that have made Messenger so popular.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Why we’re bringing E2EE to Messenger</span></h2>
<p><span>Messenger first</span> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/07/messenger-starts-testing-end-to-end-encryption-with-secret-conversations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>built end-to-end encrypted chats in 2016 </span></a><span>as a feature called Secret Conversations. Since then, we’ve learned a great deal in regards to rolling out E2EE for a wider user base. For example, we recently published an updated</span> <span>white paper, “</span><a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Metas-approach-to-safer-private-messaging-on-Messenger-and-Instagram-DMs-Sep-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta’s Approach to Safer Private Messaging on Messenger and Instagram Direct Messaging</a>,” t<span>hat sets out the industry-leading safety systems and tools available on Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span>End-to-end encryption isn’t about the technology at its core. It’s about protecting people’s communications, so they can feel safe expressing themselves with their friends and loved ones. To&nbsp; achieve this, we typically focus on two aims:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Only the sender and recipients of an E2EE message can see its contents.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Nobody (not even Meta) should be able to forge messages to appear to have been sent from someone they weren’t.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In other words, the aim is that only you and the people you’re corresponding with can read your messages – not even the app’s provider (in this case, Meta) could interfere with their contents – and you can be confident in who sent the messages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Understanding these goals</span></h2>
<p><span>These two aims are broad. However, when we reflect on our approach to addressing them, they end up breaking down into eight overlapping concepts that we believe achieve a cohesive approach to meaningful E2EE:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>1. Confidentiality in transit</span></h3>
<p><span>Message contents are authentically and securely transmitted between your devices and those of the people you’re talking to. This is, perhaps, the primary goal of E2EE, and is where much E2EE research and design work is targeted, such as the Signal protocol we use in our products (such as WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram Direct), or the </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>IETF’s Messaging Layer Security protocol</span></a><span>, which we helped to design and was recently standardized.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. Confidentiality in storage</span></h3>
<p><span>Typically, E2EE messaging services rely on local storage and encryption keys to secure encrypted messages. Messenger, however, has a long history of storing people’s messages for them so that they can access them whenever they need without having to store them locally. That’s why we’ve designed a server-based solution where encrypted messages can be stored on Meta’s servers while only being readable using encryption keys under the user’s control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>3. Control over endpoints</span></h3>
<p><span>For something to be “end-to-end encrypted,” it is necessary to have a notion of what the “ends” are. For an E2EE messaging app this means that users should have the ability to verify and manage their set of endpoint devices that are receiving their messages, as well as visibility into when this set of devices changes.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. Private feature designs</span></h3>
<p><span>Product features in an E2EE setting typically need to be designed to function in a device-to-device manner, without ever relying on a third party having access to message content. This </span><a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2023/08/22/expanding-testing-for-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/"><span>was a significant effort for Messenger</span></a><span>, as much of its functionality has historically relied on server-side processing, with certain features difficult or impossible to exactly match with message content being limited to the devices.</span></p>
<h3><span>5. Logging limitations</span></h3>
<p><span>Maintaining the confidentiality of message content extends to avoiding accidentally leaking it back to us in telemetry. In a product of Messenger’s scale, complexity, and iteration speed, this creates particular challenges&nbsp;as telemetry is vital in ensuring that the product is working well for people, and in debugging when things go wrong.</span></p>
<h3><span>6. Application security</span></h3>
<p><span>It’s a common saying that, “You can’t have privacy without security,” and this is absolutely true in the end-to-end encrypted domain. Security is important for any consumer product, but E2EE exacerbates the challenges in two important ways: it reduces the provider’s ability to protect the user from attacks, and, in fact, it expands the threat model to include the service provider itself. Our security team is keenly aware of these challenges and works closely with product teams to secure design and implementation of E2EE functionality. For example, we’ve been working to improve the memory safety of our apps; and our E2EE surfaces are covered by our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug bounty program</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>7. Being deliberate about what’s being protected</span></h3>
<p><span>E2EE protects message content. However, this is a complex term to define, and, while certain things are relatively clear – such as the strings contained in a text message, or a photograph sent from your camera roll – in a sufficiently complex messaging application, it turns out there’s a surprisingly large grey area.&nbsp; Our focus is on determining the appropriate boundaries, ensuring that we remain true to our commitments, setting the correct user expectations, and avoiding creating meaningful privacy risks, while still ensuring that the product retains its usefulness to our users.</span></p>
<h3><span>8. Third-party scrutiny</span></h3>
<p><span>E2EE implies confidentiality even if the provider wants to access the contents of a communication. We aim for this to be verifiable externally, and, to this end, have published two white papers to provide transparency into our operations. We describe the properties of some features in our Help Center, and we encourage submissions to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug bounty program</a>. Throughout the project, we have consulted with a diverse range of external parties to ensure that we’re making the right set of tradeoffs. To improve people’s ability to scrutinize us, we also support </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/10/security/code-verify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Code Verify browser extension</span></a><span> for our web-based end-to-end encrypted messaging, to give security researchers greater confidence that the code version that they are assessing is being used globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>High-level approach</span></h2>
<p><span>With all of this in mind, our high-level approach was to build off of Meta’s prior learnings in E2EE, from both <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp</a> and Messenger’s Secret Conversations, and then to iterate on our most challenging problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Working from the baseline of these two approaches, we then had to address a series of significant technical challenges, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Multi-device capability</strong>: Messenger’s model of multi-device reflects the Facebook network, which allows people to authenticate on new devices with a username and password, in order to send and receive messages. Since <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp’s multi-device capability</a> relies on a single primary device that must cryptographically authenticate companion devices, we adopted the Secret Conversations model of multi-device, while ensuring that it functions well for all of our users.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Feature support</strong>: Messenger has a number of messaging features that either don’t exist in WhatsApp, or function differently. Some of these just had to be rebuilt from scratch, while others required deploying new applied privacy technology. For example, we used </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ohai/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OHAI</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/30/security/de-identified-authentication-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Anonymous Credentials</span></a><span> to support searches of Facebook’s first-party sticker library, without revealing to us who is sending them.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Message history</strong>: Messenger has always allowed clients to operate off of a small stored local cache, relying on a server-side database for their message history. Neither WhatsApp nor Secret Conversations operated in this manner, and we didn’t want all users to have to rely on a device-side storage system. Instead, we designed an entirely new encrypted storage system called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TheLabyrinthEncryptedMessageStorageProtocol_12-6-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labyrinth</a>, with ciphertexts uploaded to our servers and loaded on-demand by clients, while operating in a multi-device manner and supporting key rotation when clients are removed.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Web support</strong>: We needed to support E2EE within our existing web surfaces, including the main Facebook site. The Web platform carries significantly different constraints from native apps, meaning that we needed to take custom approaches to many different aspects of the product. Further, Web users often add and remove devices in very different patterns from mobile-only users, increasing the complexity of our multi-device challenge.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Learn more about E2EE on Messenger</span></h2>
<p><span>Today, we are sharing two white papers:</span></p>
<ul>

<h2><span>Beyond E2EE for Messenger</span></h2>
<p><span>The journey to bring E2EE to Messenger has been a long one, but it’s not yet finished. While we are globally launching default E2EE for personal one-to-one messages on Messenger, we are still in the testing phase for group messaging and some other products, like Instagram Direct Messages. On Instagram, we are currently testing “disappearing messages” for one-to-one Instagram Direct conversations in select countries. Disappearing messages are ephemeral and, as with those in Messenger, expire 24 hours after being sent. They are built leveraging our E2EE infrastructure and provide an increased level of privacy. We plan to expand this work as well as conduct additional testing around E2EE on Instagram over the next year.</span></p>

(Image source: various - edited)</figcaption></figure><div><p>Recent testing revealed that Arch Linux, Pop!_OS, and even Nobara Linux, which is maintained by a single developer, all outstripped Windows for the performance crown on Windows-native games. The testing was run at the high-end of quality settings, and Valve's Proton was used to run Windows games on Linux. </p></div></div><div id="c10575186">
<p>Since Valve's Proton compatibility layer came about, there has been a lot of discussion about the performance implications of running games with a go-between. While Linux users have long espoused the performance benefits of Linux over Windows, Proton introduces some overhead, which could result in performance degradation in games. </p>
<p>As it turns out, according to testing by <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/2023-12/welche-linux-distribution-zum-spielen/2/" target="_blank">German outlet ComputerBase</a>, the opposite may be true, or it at least appears to be true that Windows has more going on in the background that does hinder performance. The outlet tested three different Linux distributions — Arch Linux, the base of SteamOS, Nobara Linux, a fork of Fedora, and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lemur-Pro-System76-refreshes-Linux-laptop-with-Intel-Raptor-Lake-U-series-processors.719285.0.html" target="_blank">Pop!_OS by System76</a> — across five Windows games and found that in most scenarios, Linux beats out Windows. </p>
<p>When it comes to FPS, the overall leader in testing was Nobara Linux, with Arch Linux and Pop!_OS trailing by 1–5%. <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Windows-11-steals-users-as-Steam-Deck-dominates-Linux-gaming-in-November-Steam-survey.777099.0.html" target="_self">Windows 11</a>, however, was only 6% behind Nobara Linux. So, there isn't a massive performance delta here, but it's an important milestone for Linux to be consistently ahead of Windows — especially in games designed to run on Windows. </p>
<p>In case you haven't heard of <a href="https://start.nobaraproject.org/" target="_blank">Nobara Linux</a>, it's a Fedora-based Linux distribution maintained by <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll</a> (Thomas Crider) — a Red Hat Software Engineer who is also responsible for ProtonGE, a modified version of Steam's Proton that often includes performance fixes and features not found in Valve's standard Proton. The point of Nobara is to deliver an easy-to-use Fedora that has been modified for gaming, so it makes sense that it scores well in gaming applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of the games tested — <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Forspoken</i>, <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</i>, <i>Starfield</i>, and <i>The Talos Principle II</i> — Windows lost by the biggest margin in The Talos Principle II, where it scored just 65.1 FPS, compared to the leader, Nobara Linux, and its 71.5 FPS.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The impressive FPS deltas aside, it should be mentioned that, with the exception of Arch Linux, average frame times (measured as 1% lows, in this case) on Linux were generally behind what Windows managed by up to 20%, although frame times were all over the place, so the average may need to be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i><i></i></i>Curiously, <i>The Talos Principle II</i> is where Windows excelled the most in terms of 1% lows, scoring a whole 14% better than the nearest competition, Pop!_OS. The only Linux distribution to consistently challenge Windows 11 when it comes to frame times is Arch Linux, which beat Microsoft's OS in <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Forspoken</i>, and <i>Starfield</i>. </p>
<p>Arch Linux's success in both FPS — where it scored within 3% of the fastest system in this round of testing — and frame times may give some insight into why Valve switched from Debian to Arch Linux for the base of its SteamOS for the Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=nbcnewsnet-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">curr.
