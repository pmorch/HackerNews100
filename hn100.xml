<p>A duo of Tesla shareholder-influencers tried to complete Elon Musk’s coast-to-coast self-driving ride that he claimed Tesla would be able to do in 2017 and they crashed before making it about 60 miles.</p>



<p>In 2016, Elon Musk infamously said that Tesla would complete a fully self-driving coast-to-coast drive between Los Angeles and New York by the end of 2017.</p>



<p>The idea was to livestream or film a full unedited drive coast-to-coast with the vehicle driving itself at all times.</p>



<p>We are in 2025 and Tesla never made that drive.</p>	
	



<p>Despite the many missed autonomous driving goals, many Tesla shareholders believe that the company is on the verge of delivering unsupervised self-driving following the rollout of its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in Austin, which requires supervision from Tesla employees inside the vehicles, and improvements to its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) systems inside consumer vehicles, which is still only a level 2 driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times as per Tesla.</p>



<p>Two of these Tesla shareholders and online influencers attempted to undertake a coast-to-coast drive between San Diego, CA, and Jacksonville, FL, in a Tesla Model Y equipped with the latest FSD software update.</p>



<p>They didn’t make it out of California without crashing into easily avoidable road debris that badly damaged the Tesla Model Y:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe id="post-youtube-video-1" title="Tesla Model Y - FSD Coast To Coast Attempt Part 2" width="500" height="281" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMppm1m6jio?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, you can see that the driver doesn’t have his hands on the steering wheel. The passenger spots the debris way ahead of time. There was plenty of time to react, but the driver didn’t get his hands on the steering wheel until the last second.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="450" width="1024" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Tesla-coast-to-coast-crash.gif?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>In a follow-up video, the two Tesla influencers confirmed that the Model Y had a broken sway bar bracket and damaged suspension components.&nbsp;The vehicle is also throwing out a lot of warnings.</p>



<p>They made it about 2.5% of the planned trip on Tesla FSD v13.9 before crashing the vehicle.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla shareholders used to discuss this somewhat rationally back in the day, but now that Tesla’s EV business is in decline and the stock price depends entirely on the self-driving and robot promises, they no longer do.</p>



<p>I recall when Musk himself used to say that when you reach 99% self-driving, it is when the “march of the 9s” begins, and you must achieve 99.999999999% autonomy to have a truly useful self-driving system. He admitted that this is the most challenging part as the real-world is unpredictable and hard to simulate – throwing a lot of challenging scenario at you, such as debris on the road.</p>



<p>That’s where Tesla is right now. The hard part has just started. And there’s no telling how long it will take to get there. If someone is telling you that they know, they are lying. I don’t know. My best estimate is approximately 2-3 years and a new hardware suite.</p>



<p>However, competition, mainly Waymo, began its own “march of the 9s” about five years ago.</p>



<p>Tesla is still years behind, and something like this drive by these two Tesla influencers proves it.</p>




	<p>I was actually in a similar accident in a Tesla Model 3 back in 2020. I rented a Model 3 on Turo for a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.</p>



<p>I ended up driving over a blown-out truck tire in the middle of the road like this. I was Autopilot, but I don’t know if the car saw it. I definitely saw it, but it was a bit late as I was following a truck that just drove over it. I had probably less than 2 seconds to react. I applied the brakes, but my choices were driving into a ditch on the right or into a car in the left lane.</p>



<p>I managed to reduce the force of the impact with the braking, but the vehicle jumped a bit like in this video. There wasn’t really any damage to the front, but the bottom cover was flapping down. I taped it together at the next gas station and I was able to continue the trip without much issue.</p>



<p>However, after returning it to the Turo owner and having the suspension damage evaluated by Tesla, the repair job was estimated to be roughly $10,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a similar situation with this accident.</p>

<article id="component_256568">
<p>Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind has found that Kmart Australia Limited (Kmart) breached Australians’ privacy by collecting their personal and sensitive information through a facial recognition technology (FRT) system designed to tackle refund fraud.</p><p>Between June 2020 and July 2022, Kmart deployed FRT to capture the faces of every person who entered 28 of its retail stores, and all individuals who presented at a returns counter, in an attempt to identify people committing refund fraud.</p><p>In a determination published today, the Privacy Commissioner found that Kmart did not notify shoppers or seek their consent to use FRT to collect their biometric information, which is sensitive personal information and enjoys higher protections under the Privacy Act.</p><p>The retailer argued that it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applies when organisations reasonably believe that they need to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct. The Privacy Commissioner’s determination focused on assessing whether Kmart met the conditions for relying on the exemption, and concluded:</p><ul><li>The sensitive biometric information of every individual who entered a store was indiscriminately collected by the FRT system.</li><li>There were other less privacy intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud.</li><li>Deploying the FRT system to prevent fraud was of limited utility.</li><li>Considering that the FRT system impacted on the privacy of many thousands of individuals not suspected of refund fraud, the collection of biometric information on Kmart customers was a disproportionate interference with privacy.</li></ul><p>“Understanding how FRT accords with the protections contained in Privacy Act requires me to balance the interests of individuals in having their privacy protected, on the one hand, and the interests of entities in carrying out their functions or activities, on the other. Relevant to a technology like facial recognition, is also the public interest in protecting privacy,” the Privacy Commissioner said.</p><p>Relevant factors considered by the Commissioner included the estimated value of fraudulent returns against the respondent’s total operations and profits, the limited effectiveness of the FRT system, and the extent of the privacy impacts in collecting the sensitive information of every individual who entered the relevant stores.</p><p>“I do not consider that the respondent (Kmart) could have reasonably believed that the benefits of the FRT system in addressing refund fraud proportionately outweighed the impact on individuals’ privacy,” the Commissioner stated.</p><p>The determination is the second issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) on the use of FRT in retail settings. In October 2024, the Privacy Commissioner found that Bunnings Group Limited had contravened Australians’ privacy through their use of FRT in 62 of its retail stores across Australia. That decision is currently under review by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p><p>“These two decisions do not impose a ban on the use of FRT. The human rights to safety and privacy are not mutually exclusive; rather, both must be preserved, upheld and promoted. Customer and staff safety, and fraud prevention and detection, are legitimate reasons businesses might have regard to when considering the deployment of new technologies. However, these reasons are not, in and of themselves, a free pass to avoid compliance with the Privacy Act,” she stated.</p><p>The Commissioner’s determination is instructive for entities that are considering new technologies such as FRT. Privacy considerations should be a key feature. The OAIC has also published guidance on its website: <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/organisations/facial-recognition-technology-a-guide-to-assessing-the-privacy-risks">Facial recognition technology: a guide to assessing the privacy risks</a></p><p>Kmart has been under investigation by the OAIC since July 2022, at which time it ceased operating the FRT system. It has cooperated with the OAIC throughout the investigation.</p><p>Although the Privacy Commissioner reached a similar conclusion in the Kmart and Bunnings decisions, the cases differ considerably and focus on different uses of FRT.</p><p>The Privacy Act is technology-neutral and does not proscribe the use of any particular technology. When considering the roll-out and use of new technologies such as FRT, the OAIC’s guidance encourages entities to consider factors such as proportionality, transparency, the risk of bias and discrimination, and governance for the collection, use and retention of sensitive personal information.</p><p>Commissioner Kind has <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/news/blog/is-there-a-place-for-facial-recognition-in-australian-society">published a blog post</a> with further takeaways for other retailers considering using FRT.</p><p><a href="https://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2025/155.html">View on AustLii</a>.</p>

<p>LinkedIn is preparing to switch on generative-AI training that draws from European members’ data, setting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a8059228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">November 3, 2025</a> as the go-live date. The company says it will rely on “legitimate interests” as its legal basis and will offer an opt-out so members can refuse use of their data for training—promising that private messages are excluded. The change applies across the EU/EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="790" height="237" src="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos.png" alt="linkedin AI update notice tos" srcset="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos.png 790w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-300x90.png 300w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-768x230.png 768w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-440x132.png 440w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-320x96.png 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></figure>



<p>This is a pivot from last year’s pause. In September 2024, after criticism and scrutiny, LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/updates-to-our-terms-of-service-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspended plans</a> to train models on data from EU &amp; U.K. users.</p>



<p>What exactly will be used? LinkedIn’s help center explains that profile details and public content (posts, articles, comments) can feed content-generating models. The company also points to saved résumés and job-application answers as potential inputs to features that help members get discovered by recruiters, and it says it screens out minors it believes are in secondary school. It stresses that <strong>private messages</strong> are not part of the training set. The togglable setting appears as “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and turning it off stops future use of your data for training, though it doesn’t unwind models already trained.</p>



<p>There’s a parallel—but separate—data-sharing change with Microsoft, LinkedIn’s parent. Beginning November 3, LinkedIn will expand, in some regions, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1397243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the types of LinkedIn data shared with Microsoft</a> so Microsoft can personalize ads. LinkedIn frames this as an “Affiliates” update; it says it will provide an additional opt-out where relevant. The two changes arrive together in the same terms refresh but follow different regional rules.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Outside EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK, LinkedIn shares your information with our affiliate, Microsoft, for advertising purposes and with select partners for purposes of marketing LinkedIn’s products and services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For European members, the legal hinge is GDPR’s “legitimate interests.” That route allows processing without consent if a company can show necessity, transparency, and an effective right to object. LinkedIn’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">European Regional Privacy Notice</a> update states that legitimate interests will be the basis for training content-generating models starting November 3, and that an objection (opt-out) will be honored via account settings.</p>



<p>Why now? LinkedIn has steadily added AI-assisted features—writing suggestions, profile summaries, recruiter tools—that benefit from domain-specific training. After the 2024 backlash (and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsofts-linkedin-sued-disclosing-customer-information-train-ai-models-2025-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short-lived lawsuit in the U.S.</a> that centered on fears about private messages—claims LinkedIn denied and that were later withdrawn), the company has come back with region-specific notices, a single, named training setting, and clearer language that private messages aren’t in scope.</p>



<p>Practically, here’s what changes on (or around) November 3 in Europe: if you do nothing, LinkedIn may use parts of your profile and public activity to refine the models behind its content-generation features. If you object in settings, that use should stop for future training. Your ability to <strong>use</strong> AI features doesn’t depend on opting in. In parallel, some—but not all—regions will see broader ad-personalization data sharing with Microsoft, governed by a separate control. Expect some differences in labels and availability by market; LinkedIn says not all features and settings roll out worldwide at once.</p>

<p>If you want out, the setting to look for is “Data for Generative AI Improvement” in <strong>Settings → Data privacy</strong>. The key is that the toggle affects <strong>future</strong> training, not models already built. Keep an eye out for any region-specific notices in your account banner over the next few weeks as the company aligns the U.K. with the EU schedule.</p>

   <p>10.09.2025 | Frederik Ramm </p>

   <div>
      <p>This month we’ve ramped up the infrastructure behind the download server, and downloads should now be available earlier<br>
and faster. There’s also a small technical change in that requests for a “…latest” file will now be answered with a<br>
HTTP redirect to the specific latest version (see previous blog post).</p>
<p>I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to users of the download server to “download responsibly”. We want<br>
to continue offering this service as powerful and as convenient as possible within our means. We want everyone<br>
to have easy access to the latest OSM data in a form that is useful to them.</p>
<p>Every now and then, people break things for others. There have been individual clients downloading the exact same<br>
20-GB file 100s of times per day, for several days in a row. (Just the other day, one user has managed to download almost 10,000 copies of the italy-latest.osm.pbf file in 24 hours!) Others download every single file we have on the<br>
server, every day. There’s a limit to the outgoing network bandwidth, and behaviour like this means that<br>
things are slowing down for everyone. Also, when we block an IP range for abuse, innocent third parties can be affected. </p>
<p>Here’s three concrete appeals to users of the download server:</p>
<p>1. If you want data for the whole planet, don’t download it piecemeal from us – simply get the planet file from planet.openstreetmap.org and you’re done!<br>
2. If you want a large region (like Europe or North America) updated daily, use the excellent pyosmium-up-to-date program which will automatically determine the age of your local file and update it by downloading the latest changes; this saves something like 98% of network traffic compared to a fresh download, and is faster.<br>
3. If you automate anything with regard to our download server, monitor what your script is doing or build in appropriate catches so that you don’t end up downloading the same file 1000 times just because your disk is full or something like that.</p>
<p>Happy downloading!</p>

Lee said he did not believe it was directed by Trump but was the result of overzealous law enforcement.</p><p>"I do not believe this was intentional, and the U.S. has apologized for this incident, and we have agreed to seek reasonable measures in this regard and we are working on them," he said.</p><p>Lee's office says there is no plan for him to meet Trump in New York and that the trade talks are not on the visit's agenda.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Stumbling block in trade talks</h2><p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said South Korea should follow Japan's deal with the United States.

Lee did not address how likely the U.S. was to agree or whether that would be enough for the deal to go forward.</p><p>He said South Korea is different from Japan, which struck a trade deal with the U.S. in July. Tokyo has more than double South Korea's $410 billion foreign exchange reserves, an international currency in the yen and a swap line with the United States, Lee said.</p><p>Seoul and Washington have said in writing that any investment projects must be commercially viable, but working out the details is proving difficult, he said.</p><p>"Reaching detailed agreements that guarantee commercial reasonableness is now the central task - yet it also remains the biggest obstacle," Lee said. Proposals during working-level talks provide no assurance of commercial viability, making it hard to bridge the gap, he said.</p><p>Trump says the investments will be "selected" by him and controlled by the U.S., meaning Washington would have discretion over where the money will be invested.</p><p>But Lee policy adviser Kim Yong-beom said in July that South Korea had added a safety mechanism to reduce financing risk, including supporting commercially feasible projects rather than providing unconditional financial support.</p><p>Lee said South Korea and the United States do not disagree on increasing Seoul's contributions toward its own defence, bolstered by 28,500 U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula, but that Washington wants to keep security and trade talks separate.</p><p>"We should end this unstable situation as soon as possible," he said, when asked whether talks could extend into next year.</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>Tensions with North Korea, China, Russia</h2><div><p>Lee has sought to reduce tensions with nuclear-armed North Korea. Pyongyang has rebuffed the South's overtures, and Lee said he was not optimistic about the prospect of inter-Korean talks for the time being.</p><p>During their meeting, Lee encouraged Trump to try to meet again with North Korean leader <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/kim-jong-un/">Kim Jong-Un</a> during Trump's trip next month for an Asia-Pacific summit Lee will host in the South.</p><p>Lee told Reuters his government does not have detailed information on the status of any talks between Washington and Pyongyang. "It is our judgment that they are not engaging in concrete conversations," he said.</p><p>He said he shares his predecessor Yoon's view that North Korea's military cooperation with Russia is a significant threat to South Korea's security. But he said it is not enough to respond in a simplistic way to the issue, which must be addressed through dialogue and coordination.</p><p>The North Korean leader and Russian President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> stood shoulder to shoulder this month in Beijing when Chinese President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/xi-jinping/">Xi Jinping</a> hosted them at a massive military parade and summit.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108194199" data-test="InlineImage"><p>In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, (L-R) Russia's President Vladimir Putin walks with China's President Xi Jinping and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un before a military parade marking the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan and the end of World War II, in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on September 3, 2025.</p><p>Sergey Bobylev | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Lee said there is increasing confrontation between a socialist camp of countries and a capitalist, democratic camp that includes Seoul, and South Korea's geography threatens to place it on the frontier of any conflict with the other camp.</p><p>He said there is an escalatory spiral of rivalry and tensions where South Korea, Japan and the United States deepen cooperation and China, Russia, and North Korea work more closely together.

(was available as a preprint at the time of writing this post, later </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">Clinical Psychological Science</a></em><span>) is a brilliantly designed and innovative study of the quantitative structure of psychopathology with important ramifications for our understanding of psychiatric classification. No one has conducted a study quite like this before, and the results are remarkable. It takes place in the context of the development of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Taxonomy_of_Psychopathology" rel="">Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)</a><span> which is a dimensional, hierarchical, and quantitative approach to the classification of mental disorders, and relies on identification of patterns of covariation among symptoms.</span></p><p><span>The study is based on a large online survey, with participants recruited from a variety of sources, resulting in a socio-demographically diverse sample size of 14.8K participants. Participants could opt to complete a mini, short, medium, or long version of the questionnaire. The survey consisted of items based on individual symptoms derived from DSM-5. Symptoms were written in first person and past tense, as close to the DSM phrasing as possible but devoid of information about symptom onset, duration, frequency, and severity. Importantly, survey items were presented to participants in a </span><em>random order</em><span>. This randomness is important because in prior studies questions about symptoms were not asked or presented in a random manner. They have been asked using symptom questionnaires that cluster symptoms together in ways influenced by the diagnostic manuals or using a structured clinical interview that adopts the DSM organization. Asking about symptoms in a random order ensures that their co-occurrence is not artificially influenced by the order in which questions are asked. The survey went through multiple rounds of pilot testing, and in the end, 680 items were included. Participants reported how true each symptom statement was for them in the past 12 months on a five-point scale from </span><em>Not at all true (Never)</em><span> to </span><em>Perfectly true (Always)</em><span>. Participants were told to think about their experiences across a wide variety of contexts.</span></p><p><span>The responses were subjected to two statistical clustering methods: </span><em>iclust</em><span> and Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Clusters were accepted for further analysis when both methods agreed. This was intended to ensure that there were no idiosyncrasies arising from reliance on one method. This resulted in 139 clusters (“syndromes”) and 81 solo symptoms. Higher-order constructs were identified using hierarchical principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering. The sample was divided into a primary sample (11.8K) and a hold-out sample (3K) to examine the robustness of results. The final classification was based on points of agreement between samples and methods.</span></p><p>The final high order structure included 8 spectra: Externalizing, Harmful Substance Use, Mania/Low Detachment, Thought Disorder, Somatoform, Eating Pathology, Internalizing, and Neurodevelopmental and Cognitive Difficulties. 27 subfactors were identified. As an example, within the internalizing spectrum, the 4 subfactors were: Distress, Social Withdrawal, Dysregulated Sleep and Trauma, and Fear. Similar to earlier literature, a single overarching dimension also emerged. This has been described before as the “p-factor” (general psychopathology factor), but Forbes et al. chose to call it the “Big Everything” to avoid reifying it.</p><p>So here it is, an empirically derived hierarchical clustering of individual symptoms across the range of psychopathology:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" width="1456" height="814" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:298979,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Forbes, et al. 2023.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The end result has a prominent convergence with the existing HiTOP model, with some points of divergence that would be important for future revisions of HiTOP.</p><p>Due to the symptom heterogeneity of DSM constructs, they are either broken down into smaller homogenous syndromes or they merge into higher-order clusters such as subfactors and spectra.

Eighteen symptoms and signs of depression were described, 10 of which are covered by the DSM criteria for major depression or melancholia. For two symptoms (mood and cognitive content), DSM criteria are considerably narrower than those described in the textbooks. Five symptoms and signs (changes in volition/motivation, slowing of speech, anxiety, other physical symptoms, and depersonalization/derealization) are not present in the DSM criteria. Compared with the DSM criteria, these authors gave greater emphasis to cognitive, physical, and psychomotor changes, and less to neurovegetative symptoms. These results suggest that important features of major depression are not captured by DSM criteria. This is unproblematic as long as DSM criteria are understood to&nbsp;</span><em>index</em><span>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;</span><em>constitute</em><span>&nbsp;psychiatric disorders. However, since DSM-III, our field has moved toward a reification of DSM that implicitly assumes that psychiatric disorders are actually just the DSM criteria. That is, we have taken an index of something for the thing itself.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>DSM criteria for MDD are an index, but what is the </span><em>thing itself</em><span>? If Forbes et al. are correct, the thing itself isn’t a fixed, stable entity but consists of variable and heterogenous subsets of internalizing and neurocognitive symptoms. And each time we use MDD as an index, we index something </span><em>different.</em><span> (Different from but </span><em>overlapping</em><span> with other instances.)</span></p><p><span>DSM criteria for MDD are an index, but what is the </span><em>thing itself</em><span>?

It relies only on self-reported symptoms, and features requiring clinician observation are missing; symptoms are decontextualized (e.g., insomnia due to substance withdrawal isn’t differentiated from insomnia due to anxiety); all symptoms were assessed using a 12-month time scale, even though different symptom patterns exist at different time scales. </p><p>Forbes et al. themselves note,</p><blockquote><p>“It will also be essential to understand which aspects of these results—particularly the fine-grained levels of the structure—are robust to other approaches to measurement (i.e., using alternative measures, time frames, multi-method or multi-informant approaches, as well as within-person assessment) and across intersectional conceptualizations of identity (e.g., in a variety of sociodemographic and culturally and linguistically diverse samples).”</p></blockquote><p>See also:</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/common-misconceptions-about-the-clinical" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1RXz!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5faac8bc-eff8-430a-bfd7-e4c8f16c805b_2999x1684.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1RXz!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5faac8bc-eff8-430a-bfd7-e4c8f16c805b_2999x1684.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Common Misconceptions About the Clinical Use of HiTOP" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/are-critiques-of-dsmicd-as-devastating" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grCP!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f5d1be-a3e1-4571-9ac3-93672932c080_600x600.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grCP!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f5d1be-a3e1-4571-9ac3-93672932c080_600x600.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Are Critiques of DSM/ICD as Devastating for Psychiatric Diagnosis as Some Critics Seem to Think?" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/traditional-dsm-disorders-dissolve?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/traditional-dsm-disorders-dissolve?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

  <div>
  <p>“Hello! I am a developer. Here is my relevant experience: I code in Hoobijag and sometimes jabbernocks and of course ABCDE++++ (but never ABCDE+/^+ are you kidding? ha!)&nbsp; and I like working with Shoobababoo and occasionally kleptomitrons. I’ve gotten to work for Company<sup id="fnref:1"><a data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> doing Shoobaboo-ing code things and that’s what led me to the Snarfus. So, let’s dive in!&nbsp;</p>
<p>↑ Excerpt ↑</p>
<p>About this tutorial</p>
<p>I first started doing Very Simple Thing<sup id="fnref:2"><a data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> with Snarfus, but the more I used it the more I saw the potential! Despite the jaggle of the chromus, it’s really multi-purpose. And that’s what led me to argyling the pintafore with the quagmire instead of the hoobastank! I know, crazy. But it was kind of working, and actually a lot of fun… Until I hit a big roadblock: the fisterfunk will NOT talk to the shamrock portal or even send beep-boops back to the Snarfus! Of course, you know what that means<sup id="fnref:3"><a data-id="ffe570ad-86df-49e0-8d9b-debc850a3651" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;— Now the entire hoob-tunnel is clogged with gramelions. Unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I almost gave up but then I realized: If I connect the backside Snarfus stagnator to the backside shamrock Klingon troglodyte emulater, it’s good! Everything beep-boops and ding-dongs and I get the Actual Topic of the Tutorial, which lets me do the Very Simple Thing the way I want after all! Pretty cool<sup id="fnref:4"><a data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here’s how to set it up:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the terminal, ajkl;gawgor;iqeg;iJLkqen.&nbsp; wl;R aw;oeiga 4648664 arjarwgj;llj;ja fadgfgajkljl; wlj;sdjk;lfas</p></li>
<li><p>Next go to folder/hidden/deep/in/the/file/system/surprise!.file and copy the contents of the file. If it’s not there, it might be in library/library/library/llibrary/liiiiiibrarrrary/llllliiiiibrary/hidden/hidden/hiding/you can’t find me/hidden/nope/never/hahahahereiam.file.</p></li>
<li><p>Now go back to the terminal and paste in the file contents, then type in 64A786AGR45JAR; rdja;jg [[]][[]][[]][[]]][[]()()()()()()()()(){{}{}{}|{}{|}{}{|}{ ////////////////!! !!!! !! //// !!! agjlkargji;lwej;OI [ASRGASG[]ASGDASG[]EAEadgasg[]EAGE[edaga][]ahgr-0-0=-0-=0-=0=0-0=-0-=0=-0-=0=-0=-0!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Boop!<sup id="fnref:5"><a data-id="1385bd5d-ec29-4fdf-bdcb-65fb027612bf" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>Open Snarfus and upload the file you just made.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Just for shits and giggles, you<em>&nbsp;</em>can de-sham the chronostatiomatrix by running —()()(]]asdg a=-do —cd go cd stay —sususudododo baby shark—][] but that’s optional.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>That’s it!&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know how it goes for you. I’d love to hear if anybody uses this approach with GewGawGamma or ometer2.7.”</p>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e"><p>I probably should recognize Company because it seems illustrious but I do not recognize Company or know what they do.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:1">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2" data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b"><p>It is not simple.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:2">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3" data-id="ffe570ad-86df-49e0-8d9b-debc850a3651"><p>I do<em> </em>not&nbsp;know what that means.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:3">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4" data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a"><p>It<em> is</em>&nbsp;cool. I don’t really understand how, but I believe it. I’m glad you know how to do it.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:4">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5" data-id="1385bd5d-ec29-4fdf-bdcb-65fb027612bf">
<p>The first 3 steps will take me approximately 7 hours and 193 internet searches to complete. When I finally get to Boop! it will be really satisfying.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is meant in good fun. I really appreciate the folks who take time to share their knowledge and write up tutorials and give tips and so on.&nbsp;</em></strong> <a href="#fnref:5">↵</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

        <p>Go has a feature called struct embedding that allows you to compose types. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Position</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>X</span> <span>int</span>
	<span>Y</span> <span>int</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Colour</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>R</span> <span>byte</span>
	<span>G</span> <span>byte</span>
	<span>B</span> <span>byte</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Rectangle</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>Position</span>
	<span>Colour</span>
	
	<span>Width</span>  <span>int</span>
	<span>Height</span> <span>int</span>
}

<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Rectangle</span>{<span>/* ... */</span>}

<span>// This works:</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"%d,%d\n"</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Position</span>.<span>X</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Position</span>.<span>Y</span>)

<span>// but so does this:</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"%d,%d\n"</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>X</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Y</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>But what do you think this code does?</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>FooService</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>URL</span> <span>string</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>BarConnectionOptions</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>URL</span> <span>string</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>BarService</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>BarConnectionOptions</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Options</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>FooService</span>
	<span>BarService</span>
}

<span>opts</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Options</span>{
	<span>FooService</span>: <span>FooService</span>{<span>URL</span>: <span>"abc.com"</span>},
	<span>BarService</span>: <span>BarService</span>{
		<span>BarConnectionOptions</span>: <span>BarConnectionOptions</span>{
			<span>URL</span>: <span>"xyz.com"</span>,
		},
	},
}

<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>opts</span>.<span>URL</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect this to fail to compile as <code>URL</code> is ambiguous. It actually prints <code>abc.com</code>, presumably as it is the least nested version of that field. This happened at the day job, although it was caught in a test. Be careful when embedding structs!</p>

    <p><span>V</span>enus is arguably the worst place in the solar system. A cloak of carbon dioxide suffocates the planet, subjecting its surface to skull-crushing pressure. Sulfuric acid rains down through the sickly yellow sky but never reaches the lava-licked ground. Venus is so hot — hot enough to melt lead — that the acid rain evaporates as it’s falling.</p>
<p>The planet’s extreme inhospitality is at the heart of one of the most beguiling mysteries in planetary science. Venus and Earth formed at the same time, from the same geologic building blocks, in pretty much the same part of the solar system. They’re even the same size. So why is Venus a hellscape, and Earth a garden?</p>
<p>A common refrain in the scientific community is that Venus is just several steps ahead — that it represents the end state of all large rocky planets, including Earth. The hypothesis is that these planets eventually lose the ability to sequester planet-warming greenhouse gases in their geologic underbelly. When those gases then accumulate in the atmosphere, the world enters a runaway greenhouse state — like the boiling hot Venusian climate. “Over the years, we’d always heard about Venus being a preview into Earth’s future,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/skane">Stephen Kane</a>, a planetary astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>

<p>But is that long-held assumption true? In hundreds of millions or billions of years, will Earth’s climate go the way of Venus’, transitioning from a temperate world into a catastrophic hothouse? Kane and his colleagues have been trying to find out. Venus and Earth are often referred to as twins, with Venus being the evil one of the pair. In their Reuniting Twins project, the scientists have developed a digital model of Earth that combines solar physics, volcanology, plate tectonics and climate science. They’ve been pushing their model Earth to its extremes, trying every plausible way to break it and make it into Venus.</p>
<p>As well as exploring what went so wrong on the second rock from the sun, this work speaks to a query closer to home, said <a href="https://eeps.wustl.edu/people/paul-byrne">Paul Byrne</a>, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not directly involved with the project: “How long is Earth habitable for?”</p>

    <h2><strong>A Planetary Whodunit</strong></h2>
<p>Forecasting Earth’s future requires an understanding of Venus’ past. Long ago, Venus might not have been too different from how Earth is now. Spacecraft surveys and telescope observations have revealed the existence of a rare, heavy form of water in the Venusian atmosphere — a telltale sign that regular water used to be abundant on the planet.</p>
<p>Researchers debate how that water resided there. One possibility is that the water on young Venus formed steam that wafted above the magma sea covering the newborn planet’s surface. That water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, would have pushed the world into a scorching-hot greenhouse state not long after its birth. Alternatively, Venus’ initial, planetwide magma sea might have cooled and hardened into a crust quickly enough for liquid water — maybe even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-just-broke-the-venus-curse-heres-what-it-took/">an ocean’s worth of water</a> — to flow across it. If that is true, then what happened to all that water?</p>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/michael.j.way">Michael Way</a>, a planetary scientist and climate modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, looked at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006276">two possibilities</a> for how a Venusian ocean could have boiled away.</p>
    
    
    
    
<p>The first hypothesis points to the sun, which, as it ages and burns through its hydrogen fuel, blasts out ever more sunlight, subjecting nearby planets — including Venus, which sits closer to the sun than we do — to an increasingly intense blaze. Planetary scientists estimate that by about a billion years after the solar system’s birth, the gradually brightening sun would have been able to efficiently vaporize any liquid water on Venus. Water vapor would then have flooded the Venusian atmosphere, potentially causing intensive global warming; this warming might have been exacerbated further by volcanoes off-gassing carbon dioxide. The combination might have pushed Venus into a runaway greenhouse state.</p>
<p>It’s a nice story. But according to Way’s models, the theory that the sun broke Venus by evaporating its oceans has problems. Venus spins very slowly on its axis, and one day there is equivalent to 116 Earth days, or nearly four months. If the planet’s dayside initially held liquid oceans, that water’s evaporation would have formed thick clouds. Those prodigious, persistent dayside clouds would have reflected sunlight, keeping Venus cooler than it otherwise might have been and actually preventing a runaway <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-pinpoint-the-quantum-origin-of-the-greenhouse-effect-20240807/">greenhouse effect</a> and unrestrained global warming.</p>
<p>Way thinks that a more plausible suspect in Venus’ demise is a form of ruinous volcanism. In its own storied past, Earth experienced prolonged eruptions of lava in single regions, known as large igneous provinces (LIPs), that lasted for hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of years. Each of these events injected copious carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and made the world, for a time, extremely hot. One LIP 252 million years ago <a href="https://doi.org/10.1130/G47365.1">triggered</a> the <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/great-dying-what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction/">worst recorded mass extinction in Earth’s history</a>, almost sterilizing the planet.</p>

    <p>Fortunately for life, after each of these LIP events, Earth gradually drew that excess carbon dioxide deep into its rocky bowels, and the planet cooled back down. It accomplished this through a process called subduction: When tectonic plates collide, one plate can descend below the other, drawing seawater rich in dissolved carbon dioxide into the abyssal depths. That carbon remains sequestered in the lower mantle for epochal lengths of time; some of it eventually erupts back into the atmosphere via volcanism. That, in a nutshell, is how <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-biography-of-earth-across-the-age-of-animals-20250915/">Earth’s global thermostat</a> is regulated.</p>

<p>It’s possible that back when there was water on Venus, it also had Earth-like plate tectonics with major subduction zones. But the system wasn’t widespread or large-scale enough to save it from a planetary immolation — especially if several LIP events occurred at roughly the same time. Way’s models show that several concurrent LIPs could have thrown vast quantities of carbon dioxide into Venus’ atmosphere, warming the world so severely that much of its liquid water boiled away into the sky, accelerating the warming further. With no oceans to speak of, all that carbon dioxide could not be reabsorbed. Moreover, water is an enabler of subduction: It lowers the melting point of rocks, allowing tectonic plates to more easily bend and break. And so, with no water left at the surface, major subduction zones would grind to a halt, preventing the entombment of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Other scientists tend to agree with Way’s assessment: The sun alone cannot be responsible for making Venus the awful place it is today. “I really do think you need multiple extreme volcanic episodes … to get there,” said <a href="https://annagulcher.com/">Anna Gülcher</a>, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Break the World</strong></h2>
<p>While studying Venus and its runaway greenhouse wasteland, Kane became morbidly curious: Could the same fate befall Earth? “What if we shut down the carbon cycle on Earth?” he said. “Could you produce a Venus?”</p>
<p>To find out, he and his team built a virtual world-destroying machine. “Everybody loves a post-apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, provided it’s 5 billion years in our future,” he said.</p>

    <p>The first step was to fast-forward their model of Earth about 3.5 billion years, to when the sun and planets will be 8 billion years old. At that point, the sun will shine brighter than it does today, and Earth’s atmosphere will receive the same level of roasting-hot starlight that Venus did when it was just 1 billion years old. Back then, it’s thought, Venus would have been at a tipping point: either temperate and waterlogged, or burnt to a crisp. The 8 billion-year-old sun will push Earth to a similar, climatic knife-edge.</p>
<p>The team’s model suggests that in 3.5 billion years, Earth’s oceans could begin evaporating and become heat-trapping water vapor in the atmosphere. That could be sufficient to kill off Earth’s major subduction zones, since without water, there might be no subduction (plus, there would be less water for carbon dioxide to dissolve into in the first place). “We’re losing the ability to draw back that CO<sub>2</sub> into the Earth’s mantle. So it just builds up,” said <a href="https://www.michellehillphd.com/">Michelle Hill</a> of Stanford University, a member of the Reuniting Twins project.</p>
<p>The shutdown of major subduction zones would mean that the Earth’s tectonic plates stop clashing and jostling about. Instead, they would form a near-united rocky shell around the hot mantle. For a time, the mantle would get hotter, since the shell around it would trap heat generated by radioactively decaying compounds inside it. As heat accumulates in the interior, the Earth in Kane’s simulations would experience an uptick in volcanism lasting for about 15 million years.</p>
<p>This period, known as a “stagnant lid regime,” adds even more carbon dioxide to the sky. But the eruptive spike is short-lived. The mantle cools down and the crust thickens until it becomes nearly impermeable to any major carbon-erupting volcanism.</p>
<p>So 15 million years after its stagnant lid forms, Earth will have reached a new equilibrium. Occasional spurts of volcanism would still happen. (Likewise, scientists have found <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/venus-is-volcanically-alive?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1716366279998">compelling</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/science/venus-volcanoes-lava.html">evidence</a> that Venus is volcanically active today.) But Kane explained that these sporadic eruptions aren’t expected to add much carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>At that point, the team’s simulations stop. How Venus-like is their model of the future Earth?</p>

<p>If or when Earth’s large-scale subduction shuts off in about 3.5 billion years, kneecapping the planet’s ability to bury carbon, Kane and his team’s simulations indicate that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere will rise anywhere from 0.1 bars to 0.8 bars. (For reference, the total atmospheric pressure at sea level today is 1 bar, and roughly 0.04% of that, or 0.042 bars, comes from carbon dioxide.) Even in their best-case scenario of a 0.1-bar rise in carbon dioxide, Earth’s surface temperature surpasses 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The same happens at 0.8 bars, but far more quickly.</p>
<p>Either way, the surface of the world becomes literally boiling hot. Earth will “turn into a post-runaway greenhouse state,” Kane said. “The surface temperature will be too hot for any water. It’ll all boil away.” Nothing sitting on the world’s skin would survive.</p>
<p>Still, Earth won’t get close to the state that Venus is in today. “It’d be Venus lite,” Kane said.</p>
<p>Venus has a 93-bar atmosphere consisting of 96.5% carbon dioxide. Kane and his colleagues’ doomsday machine, no matter how hard they push it, cannot take Earth to those levels. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Because the mantle is sealed off by a stagnant lid, volcanism drops, protecting Earth from a Venus-style roasting better than he thought.</p>
<p>Independent scientists have praised the Reuniting Twins project for challenging prior assumptions and adding significantly to the discussion about the terminal state of rocky planets.</p>
        
        
<p>“I like their idea,” Way said, adding that the team’s version of a future Earth “doesn’t sound unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“You end up with a world that’s stinkingly hot,” said Byrne, the Washington University planetary scientist. But, he said, the possibility that it may not be Venusian levels of hot is intriguing.</p>
<p>Kane’s team acknowledged that their model hasn’t considered LIP-style mega-eruptions, and that these events could feasibly add a bounty of trapped carbon to the atmosphere at any point in the future. Maybe Earth gets unlucky and experiences multiple, simultaneous LIP events (though this grows less likely over time, Kane said, as the mantle cools and its churning slows). If so, that scenario could push Earth to be more like Venus than the team’s model suggests.</p>
<p>Uncertainties abound. But if Kane’s team is even broadly correct, it suggests that Venus has a uniquely grim history. Something — perhaps an inundation of lava — burned that planet to the bone. Earth, meanwhile, has so far been unable to bring about its own destruction. Let’s hope that remains the case long into the future.</p>

          <h2 dir="auto">Release Notes</h2>
<p dir="auto">The new linker can be used with <code>-fnew-linker</code> in the CLI, or by setting <code>exe.use_new_linker = true</code> in a build script.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is already the default when passing <code>-fincremental</code> and targeting ELF.</p>
<p dir="auto">The performance is fast enough that there's no longer much of a benefit to exposing a <code>-Dno-bin</code> build step. You might as well keep codegen and linking always enabled because the compilation speed difference is negligible, and then you get an executable at the end.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Performance Data Points</h3>

<p dir="auto">In summary:</p>

															<h2>How can I influence others without manipulating them?</h2>										<div>
				<p>We influence others every day, whether we intend to or not. Sometimes it is through the way we argue, sometimes through the way we listen, and sometimes simply through the story we tell about what matters. Influence is not the property of the few who hold authority. It is the currency of all relationships.</p>
<p>The word persuasion often carries with it the scent of manipulation, as though one person is moving another toward something they do not really want. But there is another way to hold it. Influence can be understood as an invitation. It is the art of meeting people where they are, of entering their world with respect, and of opening a door that they might choose to walk through with us.</p>
<p>This article invites you to consider five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging. Each opens a different path into relationship and commitment. Each has its gifts. Each, when overused, can become a wall instead of a door.</p>
<p>The practice is not to master all five overnight, but to grow our awareness and our range. Persuasion is not a personality trait. It is a skill. It asks us to listen, to notice, and to choose consciously how we invite others.</p>
<h2>Our own doorway: The blind spot of preference</h2>
<p>Most of us have a default style of persuasion. Perhaps you lean on facts. Perhaps you rely on conviction. Perhaps you search for compromise, tell stories, or call on the voices of others. None of these is wrong. Each is a doorway.</p>
<p>Yet our default does more than shape how we speak. It shapes how we see. If I lean on data, I may hear someone’s story as weak rather than inspiring. If I favour conviction, I may interpret hesitation as lack of commitment, when it might be an opening for negotiation. If I thrive on inspiration, I may dismiss detail-oriented questions as nit-picking rather than as a real need for clarity. If I am most comfortable with bridging, I may feel uneasy with those who are direct and independent.</p>
<p>Our own doorway becomes a filter. It colours what we pay attention to, what we dismiss, and how we react. The danger is that we mistake difference for resistance. We think they are being difficult, when in fact they are simply standing at another door.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of our preference allows us to pause. Instead of defending our own style, we can ask: What is the invitation they are offering me through their language and behaviour? Which door are they holding open that I have overlooked because I was guarding my own?</p>
<p>Influence begins with this act of humility. The willingness to see that the door we most trust may not be the one others are waiting at.</p>
<p>Once we recognise our blind spot, we are ready to notice the variety of doors available to us. Influence is not one way, it is five ways. Each has its own language, its own gifts, and its own risks. Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging are not personality types but choices. At any moment, we can choose to knock on a different door, depending on where others are standing and what the moment requires.</p>
<p>What follows is a closer look at each door. how to recognise it, how to walk through it well, and how to avoid turning it into a wall.</p>
<h2>Rationalising: The door of logic</h2>
<p>Rationalising is the style that seeks to persuade through facts, evidence, and analysis. It appeals to those who are comforted by structure and clarity. When someone asks for data, compares benchmarks, or worries about risk and performance, they are standing at the rational door.</p>
<p>This style has its strengths. It reassures the finance director who needs a business case. It appeals to the engineer who wants proof that the system will not fail. It builds trust with the analyst who measures quality by what can be verified.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we come prepared. We gather our facts. We organise our thinking into a clear flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation. We know the return on investment, the efficiency gains, the quality improvements. We anticipate objections and hold evidence ready to meet them. We present data not as a weapon but as a gift of clarity.</p>
<p>Yet logic alone is not enough. Overused, it can become cold and detached. The person across from us may long for empathy, but we bury them in numbers. They may seek relationship, but we offer them a chart. Rationalising can easily turn into proving a point rather than creating understanding.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which metrics or outcomes matter most to this person, and have I framed my case in those terms, for example ROI, risk, quality or efficiency?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my one-page flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which objections are most likely, and what independent sources will I cite to address them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will a chart or comparison clarify, and where could visuals overwhelm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What level of evidence would be enough for this decision, and how will I check for overload signals in the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where might I be using facts to prove a point rather than to build shared understanding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If they are not data-driven, which second door will I pivot to after I test for fit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What jargon should I remove to keep the message precise and clear?</p>
<h2>Asserting: The door of conviction</h2>
<p>Asserting persuades through confidence, authority, and clarity. It is the voice that speaks directly and without hesitation. It is the person who values decisiveness, who prefers a straight line over a winding explanation, who respects those who stand their ground.</p>
<p>You recognise this style when someone expresses strong opinions with little hesitation, when they challenge ideas and expect you to do the same, when they respond best to conviction rather than ambiguity. For them, clarity is a form of respect.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we speak with confidence. We choose firm language, declarative statements, uncluttered by qualifiers. We are direct and concise. We know our boundaries, and we state them. We are ready with anchor points: two or three firm reasons why our proposal matters.</p>
<p>The temptation, though, is to confuse assertiveness with aggression. Overused, asserting becomes domineering. It silences others. It leaves no room for dialogue. It builds resistance where it meant to build respect.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What exactly am I asking for in one clear sentence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is non-negotiable, and what is flexible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What two or three anchor reasons will I use to support my position?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I signal credibility without drifting into name-dropping or status plays?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What does matching their energy look like while staying respectful and calm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I deliberately pause to listen so I do not over-talk the room?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What early signals tell me I am tipping into pressure, and how will I de-escalate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If directness stalls the dialogue, what is my next door to try?</p>
<h2>Negotiating: The door of balance</h2>
<p>Negotiating persuades by finding common ground. It seeks the middle path, the workable solution, the compromise that honours both sides. It is rooted in the belief that influence is not about victory but about mutual benefit.</p>
<p>You notice this style in those who raise concerns gently, who suggest meeting halfway, who speak in terms of “what if” and “could we.” They are pragmatic. They value win–win outcomes. They prefer flexibility over confrontation.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we listen closely to uncover the real concern beneath the stated one. We protect what matters most to us while staying open to trade-offs. We come with options. We ask open-ended questions. We remain collaborative, treating the conversation as joint problem-solving.</p>
<p>But compromise has its dangers. Overused, negotiation turns into unnecessary concession. We may be seen as weak or uncertain. Others may begin every conversation expecting us to bend. We may give away value before fully exploring our own position.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the real concern beneath what is being said, and how will I surface it with open questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which larger goals or principles am I protecting, and what are my red lines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What tradables or creative options can I offer that create value without giving away too much?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What do I expect in return for each concession?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I hold a respectful, collaborative tone so we stay in joint problem solving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	At what point would compromise become drift, and how will I name that threshold?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If others expect automatic concessions from me, how will I reset expectations early?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What alternative door will I use if bargaining signals are not present?</p>
<h2>Inspiring: The door of vision</h2>
<p>Inspiring persuades through story, metaphor, and imagination. It calls people to something larger than themselves. It shifts the focus from what is practical to what is possible.</p>
<p>You know you are with an inspiring type when they disengage from technical talk but light up at mention of purpose or possibility. They ask about impact and legacy. They respond to stories and metaphors. They look for meaning, not just measurement.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we tell relevant stories. We use vivid language and imagery. We connect ideas to values and aspirations. We speak with authenticity and passion. We invite others to imagine: What if you could? What would it feel like if…?</p>
<p>Yet inspiration without grounding can lose its way. Overused, it becomes idealistic, disconnected from reality, heavy with promise and light on delivery. Listeners may nod politely but ask for numbers that never come. Trust fades when vision is not matched by action.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What specific story from their world will make this possibility feel real and credible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What image or analogy will help them visualise success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which values or purpose of theirs does this idea serve, for example impact, legacy, innovation or customer experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the smallest concrete next step that grounds the vision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I invite imagination with a genuine what if question, then check for practical concerns?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What numbers or proof points should I have ready if they ask for them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep my tone authentic so enthusiasm does not outpace deliverables?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If inspiration lands politely but without commitment, which door will I move to next?</p>
<h2>Bridging: The door of relationship</h2>
<p>Bridging persuades through connection and social proof. It is the style that builds trust by involving others, by leaning on shared experience, by showing that someone else has walked this path before.</p>
<p>You recognise it when someone asks, “Who else is doing this?” or seems hesitant until they hear a peer’s endorsement. They value rapport and trust more than unknown data. They commit when they see others they respect committing.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we bring in mutual contacts. We offer testimonials and case studies. We emphasise shared goals. We give before we ask, offering help, making introductions, extending reciprocity. We are warm and attentive, because this style rests on human connection.</p>
<p>But here too lies a danger. Overused, bridging makes us dependent on others. We may delay decisions, waiting for third-party validation. We may undermine our own authority, deferring to outside voices instead of speaking for ourselves.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Who do they already trust that I can appropriately involve, and how will I make that connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which case study or testimonial best mirrors their context?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I frame our shared goals so alignment is explicit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What value can I offer first, for example a helpful introduction or insight, before asking for commitment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep momentum without waiting for every third party to weigh in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where do I need to speak in my own voice so I do not over-rely on others’ validation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my plan to sustain the relationship beyond this single decision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If bridging slows progress, which door should I try to regain decisiveness?</p>
<h2>Living the paradox of influence</h2>
<p>Each of these five doors, Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, offers a path into relationship. Each works best when it honours the person we hope to influence rather than serving only our own habits.</p>
<p>The paradox is that any of them, when overused, becomes a wall. Logic turns cold. Conviction turns harsh. Compromise turns weak. Vision turns empty. Relationship turns dependent. What begins as invitation can end as imposition.</p>
<p>The practice is not to abandon our natural style but to notice when it no longer serves. To ask: Which doorway is this person already standing at? What language are they using? What energises them? What shuts them down?</p>
<p>Influence then becomes less about pressing harder on the door we know, and more about walking around to the door they are holding open.</p>
<p>Persuasion is not about clever tactics or manipulation. It is about presence. It is about listening for what matters to others and choosing consciously how we invite them.</p>
<p>The question that remains for each of us is simple: Which door will you choose to knock on in your next conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any tips or advice? What has worked for you? Do you have any recommended resources to explore? Thanks for reading!</strong></p>

<h2>Influenced by</h2>
<p>The five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, are my synthesis, but several bodies of work have shaped them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Gary Yukl’s research on leadership influence tactics, which identified patterns such as rational persuasion, pressure, exchange, inspirational appeals, and coalition tactics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Robert Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, especially authority, social proof, reciprocity, and consistency, which continue to show how people respond to influence in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Negotiation practice and theory, from both organisational behaviour research and classic works on principled negotiation, which highlight the importance of mutual benefit and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Leadership and change literature, including Peter Block’s writings on community and invitation, which shape the idea of influence as a relational act rather than a manipulative one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	My own work with leadership teams, where repeated practice has confirmed that leaders tend to default to one or two styles, often without realising the limits this creates in how they see and respond to others.</p>
<p>These streams converge in the five doors. They are not meant as a new theory, but as a practical frame that leaders can hold in the moment, to choose how they wish to invite others.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We formulate the task of detecting lines and paragraphs in a document into a unified two-level clustering problem. Given a set of text detection boxes that roughly correspond to words, a text line is a cluster of boxes and a paragraph is a cluster of lines. These clusters form a two-level tree that represents a major part of the layout of a document. We use a graph convolutional network to predict the relations between text detection boxes and then build both levels of clusters from these predictions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the unified approach can be highly efficient while still achieving state-of-the-art quality for detecting paragraphs in public benchmarks and real-world images.

            <div itemprop="text">
              <p>The latest nightly releases of Mojo (and our next stable release) include initial support for a new accelerator architecture: Apple Silicon GPUs!</p>
<p>We know that one of the biggest barriers to programming GPUs is access to hardware. It’s our hope that by making it possible to use Mojo to develop for a GPU present in every modern Mac, we can further democratize developing GPU-accelerated algorithms and AI models. This should also enable new paths of local-to-cloud development for AI models and more.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to have an Apple Silicon Mac (we support all M1 - M4 series chips) running macOS 15 or newer, with Xcode 16 or newer installed. The version of the Metal Shading Language we use (3.2, AIR bitcode version 2.7.0) needs the macOS 15 SDK, and you’ll get an error about incompatible bitcode versions if you run on an older macOS or use an older version of Xcode that doesn’t have the macOS 15 SDK.</p>
<p>You can clone our <a href="https://github.com/modular/modular"><code>modular</code></a> repository and try out one of our GPU function examples in the <code>examples/mojo/gpu-functions</code> directory. All but the <code>reduction.mojo</code> example should work on Apple Silicon GPUs today in the latest nightlies. Additionally, puzzles 1-15 of the <a href="https://puzzles.modular.com/introduction.html">Mojo GPU puzzles</a> should now work on Apple Silicon GPUs with the latest nightly. We haven’t yet updated the Pixi environment for the GPU puzzles to add Apple Silicon support, so for now you may need to run the Mojo code manually from another environment.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-current-capabilities-1" href="#p-5775-current-capabilities-1"></a>Current capabilities</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning of our support for Apple Silicon GPUs, and many pieces of functionality still need to be built out. Known features that don’t work today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intrinsics for many hardware capabilities
<ul>
<li>Not all Mojo GPU examples work, such as <code>reduction.mojo</code> and the more complex matrix multiplication examples</li>
<li>GPU puzzles 16 and above need more advanced hardware features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic MAX graphs</li>
<li>MAX custom ops</li>
<li>PyTorch interoperability</li>
<li>Running AI models</li>
<li>Serving AI models</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll emphasize that even simple MAX graphs, and by extension AI models, don’t yet run on Apple Silicon GPUs. In our Python APIs, <code>accelerator_count()</code> will still return 0 until we have basic MAX graph support enabled. Hopefully, that won’t be long.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-next-steps-2" href="#p-5775-next-steps-2"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>We’ve identified many of the technical blockers to progressively enable the above. The current list of what we plan to work on includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle <code>MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK_METADATA</code> and similar aliases</li>
<li>Support <code>GridDim</code>, <code>lane_id</code></li>
<li>Enable <code>async_copy_*</code></li>
<li>Convert arguments of an array type to a pointer type</li>
<li>Support <code>bfloat16</code> on ARM devices</li>
<li>Support <code>SubBuffer</code></li>
<li>Enable atomic operations</li>
<li>Complete implementation of <code>MetalDeviceContext::synchronize</code></li>
<li>Enable captured arguments</li>
<li>Support <code>print</code> and <code>debug_assert</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I apologize for some of the cryptic error messages you may get when hitting a piece of missing functionality, or encountering a system configuration we aren’t yet compatible with. We hope to improve the messaging over time, and to provide better guides for debugging failures.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-how-this-works-3" href="#p-5775-how-this-works-3"></a>How this works</h2>
<p>To learn more about how Mojo code is compiled to target Apple Silicon GPUs, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/t2hAfgDYHoc?si=5X7E70xAi_eMjCMN&amp;t=1557">Amir Nassereldine’s detailed technical presentation from our recent Modular Community Meeting</a>. He did amazing work in establishing the fundamentals during his summer internship, and we are now building on that to advance Mojo on this new architecture.</p>
<p>In brief, a multi-step process is used to compile and run Mojo code on an Apple Silicon GPU. First, we compile Mojo GPU functions to Apple Intermediate Representation (AIR) bitcode. This is done through lowering to LLVM IR, and then specifically converting to Metal-compatible AIR.</p>
<p>Mojo handles interactions with an accelerator through the <code>DeviceContext</code> type. In the case of Apple Silicon GPUs, we’ve specialized this into a<code>MetalDeviceContext</code> that handles the next stages in compilation and execution.</p>
<p>The <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> uses the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/">Metal-cpp API</a> to compile the AIR representation into a <code>.metallib</code> for execution on device. Once the <code>.metallib</code> is ready, the <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> manages a Metal <code>CommandQueue</code>, and buffers operations for moving data, running a GPU function, and more. All of this happens behind-the-scenes and a Mojo developer doesn’t need to worry about any of it.</p>
<p>Code that you’ve written to run on an NVIDIA or AMD GPUs should mostly just work on an Apple Silicon GPU, assuming no device-specific features were being used. Obviously, different patterns will be required to get the most performance out of each GPU, and we’re excited to explore this new optimization space on Apple Silicon GPUs with you.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-just-the-beginning-4" href="#p-5775-just-the-beginning-4"></a>Just the beginning</h2>
<p>While we’d love help in bringing up Apple Silicon GPU support, some of the infrastructure for introducing support for new AIR intrinsics and compiling them to a <code>.metallib</code> currently requires Modular developers for implementation. We’ll get more of the basics in place before work moves primarily to the open-source standard library and kernels, at which point community members will be able to do a lot more to advance compatibility. Contributions are always welcome, but we don’t want you to hit missing non-public components and get frustrated by being unable to move forward.</p>
<p>We’ll share much more documentation and content on how to work with and optimize for this new hardware family, but we’re extremely excited about even these first few steps onto Apple Silicon GPUs. I’ll to try to keep this post up to date as we expand functionality.</p>

            <p>Our Docker containers largely use Linux within them. Due to the requirement for Xcode tooling to build the <code>.metallib</code> from Mojo code, you’d need to have a virtualized macOS environment in the container. We haven’t yet built a container like that.</p>

            <p>Googling / AI Overlording around it looks like you can’t even mount the gpu from mac into a container anyways. Unless someone knows something I don’t, I’m guessing the guidance on mojo + metal is via host.</p>

   <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif — California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning law enforcement from wearing masks on duty except for things like riot gear, medical masks and undercover work.</p>   <p>Saying it's the first bill of its type in the country, Newsom — a Democrat and frequent critic of President Trump — said it was a sign of growing authoritarianism to have detentions in by masked men "hidden from accountability, any transparency, any oversight. That's Trump's America."</p>   <p>He said federal agents had operated for years in the state unmasked and called masking "a new construct conceived to terrorize our diverse communities." </p>   
   <p>The law, called by sponsors the "<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB627" target="_blank"><u>No Secret Police Act</u></a>," comes in response to increased immigration enforcement in California, particularly in Los Angeles. Newsom went to L.A. for the bill signing.</p>   <p>President Trump's mass deportation program has led to scenes of masked federal agents detaining people off the streets, often without badges or indicating what agency they're from. The city has been the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427176/the-latest-on-the-la-protests-sparked-by-immigration-sweeps" target="_blank">scene of protests</a> against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids.</p>   <h3 id="The">The impact of the law could be decided in court</h3>   <p>The law takes effect next year. It's unclear exactly what powers state lawmakers have to regulate the conduct of federal law enforcement. University of California, Davis law professor Raquel Aldana says California is trying to use this law to identify what federal agents can and cannot do within a state.</p>   <p>She said there has to be a line somewhere for states outlawing — as hypothetical extremes — things like murder or torture by federal agents. "At some point, the answer has to be 'no' and I think this is what the state of California is trying to do. Establish limits as to how much the federal government can do within the jurisdiction of the state. It's an issue of state sovereignty."</p>   
   <p>Lawmakers in a few other states, including New York and Massachusetts, are considering similar moves.</p>   <p>ICE declined to comment when contacted by NPR. In general, ICE officials have said their agents wear masks to prevent from being identified in videos or photos posted online, sometimes resulting in threats to them or their families.</p>   <p>Newsom also signed several other bills including one that would require law enforcement to clearly display their name or badge number while on duty; another requiring schools to notify parents and staff when immigration enforcement is on site; and two others prohibiting schools and health care facilities from allowing ICE agents on their grounds without valid warrants.</p>   <p>Aldana noted that the legal impact of the mask law on federal law enforcement could be weakened because it does not apply to California state-level law enforcement.</p>   <p>But it does apply to police and sheriffs offices and other local agencies, who routinely operate unmasked. By July 2026, their agencies have to issue mask policies following the law.</p>   <h3 id="California">California law enforcement groups have opposed it</h3>   <p>Several California organizations representing local law enforcement agencies, including the California State Sheriff's Association, opposed the bill, calling it reckless and dangerous to officers and their families.</p>   <p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican running in the 2026 race for governor, said the ban showed Newsom and Democratic lawmakers care more about the safety of criminals than officers.</p>   <p>"They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks, they didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves," Bianco said while campaigning in Northern California on Friday. "Every single person that voted for that needs to be eliminated in the next election. Anyone that votes for those people are absolute idiots."</p>   <p>The Peace Officers Research Association of California — representing over 80,000 public safety members — and the California Police Chiefs Association were also against the bill.</p>   
   <p>Giselle Garcia with NorCal Resist, a Sacramento-based mutual aid organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants at risk of deportation, said the ban would be helpful even if it's not enforceable.</p>   <p>"There's always a tension between state rights versus the federal government's rights and scope of power," Garcia said. "However, what we do know is that when things are codified under law, there is more of an opportunity to not just cite to law, but hopefully there's some kind of basis for litigation to really challenge when there's a federal government abuse happening."</p>   <p>Garcia said the organization's court observers have been verbally harassed and physically assaulted by ICE agents wearing masks who refuse to identify themselves when asked.</p>      <p><a href="https://www.capradio.org/about/bios/gerardo-zavala/" target="_blank"><em>Gerardo Zavala</em></a><em> covers state government and politics for Capradio.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>LaLiga, Spain’s top football league, is facing a firestorm of criticism after boasting about a staggering 142% increase in anti-piracy takedown notices in early 2025 while simultaneously causing <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-seeks-charges-against-google-and-apple-execs-for-not-remotely-removing-apps-from-peoples-phones">extensive collateral damage across the internet</a>.</p>
<p>As the 2025/2026 season began on August 15, LaLiga ramped up its enforcement strategy, triggering widespread outages for entirely lawful websites, services, and platforms.</p>
<p>These disruptions are tied to a controversial anti-piracy scheme operated in partnership with telecom giant Telefónica.</p>
<p>The initiative, which enjoys judicial backing in Spain, allows LaLiga to instruct major internet service providers, including Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, and DIGI, to block IP addresses suspected of hosting unauthorized streams.</p>
<p>The fallout is that entire chunks of the internet go dark for Spanish users, often during match broadcasts.</p>
<p>LaLiga doesn’t target specific infringing content. Instead, it flags entire IP ranges, many of which are shared by thousands of unrelated domains.</p>
<p>When one site is accused of hosting pirated material, everyone else sharing that IP address gets swept up in the block.</p>
<p>The result is a digital dragnet that has ensnared companies as diverse as Amazon, Cloudflare, GitHub, Twitch, and even Google Fonts.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/end-game-twitch-servers-among-hundreds-blocked-for-piracy-by-spanish-isps-250504/">TorrentFreak</a> has documented repeated weekly blocks of platforms <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-spain-internet-censorship-vercel-blocking-piracy-shield">like Vercel since early 2025</a>, while Catalonia’s own .cat domain registry has also reported service disruptions.</p>
<p>The issue became so disruptive that iXsystems, the team behind TrueNAS, a widely used open-source NAS operating system, was forced to shift its distribution model entirely. After its CDN IPs were repeatedly blocked in Spain, making critical security updates inaccessible to users, the developers resorted to distributing their software via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>“These locks have a significant collateral damage about legitimate services, which have nothing to do with football piracy,” TrueNAS noted. Their solution not only bypasses censorship but hands the bandwidth burden back to the same ISPs complicit in the blocking.</p>
<p>In TrueNAS’s official community forums, users from Spain, Italy, and France reported ongoing issues with downloads and connectivity.</p>
<p>Some turned to VPNs to circumvent the blocks, though even popular providers like Cloudflare’s free WARP service were reportedly blocked during peak match times.</p>
<p>LaLiga, meanwhile, continues to tout its enforcement record. A self-published report revealed that over 26 million takedown notices were sent in the first half of 2025 alone, more than doubling the total from all of 2024.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a translated tweet from LaLiga reporting anti‑piracy results: it says detection of piracy in live sports reached historic numbers, a 142% increase in notifications to digital intermediaries in the first half of 2025 versus all of 2024, and a 60% reduction in piracy in the 24/25 season, above a coral‑bordered white graphic that reads NOTA INFORMATIVA and LALIGA." width="884" height="952" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg 884w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-279x300.jpg 279w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-768x827.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></p>
<p>Yet despite this surge, only 11% of flagged streams were actually taken offline. LaLiga’s primary targets include hosting services and infrastructure providers, where enforcement remains minimal.</p>
<p>Legal challenges to the league’s blocking strategy are piling up. Cloudflare and RootedCON have taken their grievances to Spain’s Constitutional Court after lower courts refused to curb the overreach.</p>
<p>Despite mounting pressure, there is no indication that the blanket blocking will stop. On the contrary, as the new season unfolds, users are bracing for more censorship.</p>
<p>Calls for reform are growing louder. Opponents of the regime argue that the current system punishes lawful users while failing to meaningfully curb piracy.</p>
<p>As long as courts uphold LaLiga’s authority to dictate who gets to be online during football games, entire swaths of the internet will remain at risk, collateral in a campaign that blurs the line between protection and overreach.</p>
<p>The reality is clear. LaLiga’s war on piracy has become a war on the open web.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The University of Oxford has fallen out of the top three universities in the UK for the first time, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk-university-rankings/feature-guide/article/best-good-university-guide-2026-nlg69hm5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Both Oxford and Cambridge universities have been supplanted by Durham University, which now holds the third-place spot among the top universities in the UK.</p>



<p>Oxford and Cambridge are tied for fourth in the 2026 rankings, after falling due to their relatively poor performance in the latest National Student Survey.</p>



<p>Durham University was named The Times’s University of the Year, although the number-one ranked university in the UK remained the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) for the second year in a row.</p>



<p>Second place was held by the University of St Andrews, again for the second consecutive year.</p>



<p>While the University of St Andrews ranked very highly in student experience and teaching quality, it lost out to the LSE in graduate prospects and research quality.</p>



<p>Durham University improved by 30 places year-on-year in its students’ evaluation of teaching quality, which was the main driver in securing its third place in the overall university league table.</p>



<p>“Durham is an outstanding place to study. We ensure that every student can grow and thrive here,” said Durham University Vice-Chancellor Professor Karen O’Brien.</p>



<p>“Our loyal, engaged alumni are testament to the impressive career prospects that await our graduates.”</p>



<p>The table below shows the top 20 universities in the United Kingdom, according to The Times University Rankings 2026.</p>

    <p>The following has never happened to me but I often hear stories.</p>
<p>You go into work and discover that a coworker isn't happy with some
code you wrote because they don't understand it. They go to your
manager and tell them that you're being a problem by writing code they
don't understand. Your manager, being very skilled in conflict
resolution, makes a technical decision to avoid whatever tool you used
which caused the problem. In your case it was functional programming.</p>
<p>That's it. You've been told. No more functional programming.</p>
<p>The manager has figured out what's good for the business and you figure
that listening is what's good for your job.</p>
<p>You get back to your desk and take a ticket from JIRA. You've got to
add a page listing a person's coworkers to your internal employee
directory. First you write a function you need.</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] =
  u.departments.flatMap(_.employees)</code></pre>
<p>But it's pure. You're doing functional programming! Stop</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] = {
  val coworkers = ListBuffer[Employee]()
  for { d &lt;- departments }
    coworkers ++ d.employees
  coworkers.toList
}</code></pre>
<p>Well, there's a side-effect involved, but the whole method is pure.
You're still doing functional programming!</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] = {
  logger.info("Collecting coworkers")
  val coworkers = ListBuffer[Employee]()
  for { d &lt;- departments }
    coworkers ++ d.employees
  coworkers.toList
}</code></pre>
<p>Now the method has 1 external side-effect. Is that enough? With "no
functional programming" you've been given a lower-bound of 1
side-effect per method but we don't really know what the ideal number
is. Hopefully you can slip it through code review.</p>
<p>After this exercise you've learned how easy it is to not do functional
programming.</p>
<p>You show it to your product manager. They didn't realise how many
coworkers the average person had. The page is huge. They ask you to just
change it to a number.</p>
<p>You're going to have to add numbers together. Without being pure.
You're going to have to think about this one.</p>
<p>Maybe you should ask your manager how to do it. Good luck.</p>

		<p>Why does Space Station 14 crash with ANGLE on ARM64? 6 hours later…</p>
<p>So. I’ve been continuing work on getting ARM64 builds out for Space Station 14. The thing I was working on yesterday were launcher builds, specifically a <em>single</em> download that supports both ARM64 and x64. I’d already gotten the game client itself running natively on ARM64, and it worked perfectly fine in my dev environment. I wrote all the new launcher code, am pretty sure I got it right. Zip it up, test it on ARM64, aaand…</p>
<p>The game client crashes on Windows ARM64. Both in my VM and on Julian’s real Snapdragon X laptop.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-logs">
	<a href="#debugging-logs">
		Debugging: logs
	</a>
</h2><p>The client logs are empty. They suspiciously cut out right after SDL is initialized.</p>
<p>Of course it isn’t that easy.</p>

</p>
<p>So at first I decided to start <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly through WinDbg. This is annoying because I have to go into child processes (with <code>.childdbg 1</code>) twice, and for some reason there’s a lot of waiting, but it does work…</p>
<p>The game crashes in <code>USER32!GetDC</code> on an <em>illegal instruction</em>, somewhere after SDL does <em>something</em>. I barely glanced at the disassembly but it made no sense to me, so I just assumed there’s some UB happening and didn’t think much of it. After all, <em>why would the implementation of <code>GetDC()</code> have broken assembly?</em></p>

</p>
<p>WinDbg was also unable to pull stack frames from C# code. It did, thankfully, clearly communicate <em>why</em> this was. Yep, it’s our friend&nbsp;<a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/24-11-20-why-should-you-download-more-ram/"><code>mscordaccore</code></a> again!</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>CLRDLL: Consider using ".cordll -lp &lt;path&gt;" command to specify .NET runtime directory.
</span></span><span><span>CLRDLL: Consider using ".cordll -lp &lt;path&gt;" command to specify .NET runtime directory.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, my attempts to actually follow said instructions were completely fruitless, giving this error:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>0:027:ARM64EC&gt; .cordll -lp C:\Users\Luna\Downloads\SS14.Launcher_Windows\dotnet_arm64\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\9.0.9

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why is it trying to run an <code>AMD64</code> binary? Wait is WinDbg not natively compiled for ARM64? <em>Sigh</em>. Let’s just do it without C# debugging, I can probably manage based off the SDL stack trace. So I pull <a href="https://moon.spacestation14.com/natives/SDL3/3.2.20/win-arm64/"><code>SDL3.pdb</code> from our server</a>, drop it next to <code>SDL3.dll</code>, and then use the UI to reload the symbols. And that gets us a bit further, we now have proper function names for SDL3!</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>So I double click one of the entries in the UI’s stack trace view. And the entire debugger breaks. Stack trace view goes empty. Every action I try to make causes more of these errors to be printed:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span><span><span>Unable to get current machine context, HRESULT 0x8000FFFF

</span></span><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now even WinDbg is broken??</p>
<p>Googling these errors gave nothing useful. One of them gave <em>not a single result</em>. After just pondering the error for a moment, I thought “wait, why is the command prompt still saying <code>ARM64EC&gt;</code>? ARM64EC is for emulation, but the active debugger processes (<code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> and <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>) are both native ARM64.</p>
<p>Turns out that it’s because I started <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly. You see, that executable is x64 native, and its only job is to set up the .NET environment and launch the <em>actual</em> ARM64 executable. Something about <em>starting</em> the debugging session with that program causes WinDbg to get extremely confused when later looking at the child processes it spawns.</p>
<p>From this point on I just started launching <code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> directly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This means I wasn’t setting up the same <code>DOTNET_ROOT</code> (because WinDbg can’t set environment variables when launching things… yes really), but this didn’t really matter. This fixed both the “Machine is not a possible execution machine” errors <em>and</em> the issues with showing C# stack traces. I guess WinDbg is compiled for ARM64 after all, and it just decided to run an x64 debug host when you start debugging an x64 application. Fair enough I guess?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
	<a href="#debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
		Debugging: what’s SDL doing?
	</a>
</h2><p>After figuring out all of the above, we could <em>really</em> get started. I also opted to swap out <code>SDL3.dll</code> with a locally-built copy, so that the debugger could locate source files<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. What SDL is doing is pretty straight forward: the first time the window is shown, it clears the background with GDI commands:</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>I mean… this is like, fine, right? I mean I don’t know much about this code, but why would this crash on ARM but not x64??? The window is valid. <code>GetDC()</code> is an extremely fundamental Win32 function call. If there was something broken with it, my OS would not be usable. What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>The <code>if (ShouldClearWindowOnEraseBackground(data))</code> allows it to be disabled via a hint, which can be specified by environment variable. This fixes the crash… until you open a second OS window, then SDL3 calls <code>GetDC()</code> once again and <em>that</em> crashes. Not a solution.</p>
<p>So I checked the actual <code>USER32!GetDC</code> again, and this time I actually paid attention to the disassembly code instead of glossing over it. What the fuck? <code>pacibsp</code> is missing at the start. It’s loading an address for a jump that only jumps to <em>the next instruction</em>, which is <em>invalid</em>. In some runs, said instruction was instead a broken <code>x26</code>-relative <code>str</code> instruction that AV’d because the register was all zeroes.</p>
<p>At this point let’s introduce the villain. You might have noticed it in the call stack: <code>DXGI!My_GetDC</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-09-21-dxgi-debugging-microsoft-put-me-on-a-list/windbg_disasm_2.webp" alt="WinDbg disassembly for DXGI!MyDC. The word &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot; is clearly visible"><figcaption>
      <p>Microsoft is detouring their <em>own code???</em></p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For those who aren’t well-versed in DirectX stuff: <em>DXGI</em> is a fundamental part of DirectX ever since DirectX 10 (Vista). For those who have never modded a game before: a <em>detour</em> is a hack that injects instructions into other functions at runtime, to do evil shit. Why the <em>hell</em> is Microsoft using this in DXGI?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-dxgi-despair">
	<a href="#debugging-dxgi-despair">
		Debugging: DXGI despair
	</a>
</h2><p>Through the debugging adventure, I ended up putting a breakpoint on every call to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. The first few calls are fine, but then the <em>last</em> one, the one that crashes, is not.</p>
<p>At this point I got really desperate. “Asking in low-level programming Discords”-level desperate. I ended up asking for help in the <a href="https://discord.gg/directx">DirectX Discord</a> (yes, there’s an official DirectX Discord, and there’s many MS employees in there).</p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>I would like to thank Jesse Natalia from the DirectX Discord for responding swiftly to my messages in there.</p>
</section>
<p>After some back and forth there, I wanted to catch DXGI in the act. Maybe that would tell me something, I don’t know. So with a simple <code>ba w4 USER32!GetDC</code>, I put a hardware breakpoint for whenever something would <em>write</em> to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. I did have to awkwardly “run the program for just a little bit” because <code>USER32.dll</code> isn’t loaded immediately at program startup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>While writing this blog post I realized there <em>is</em> an intelligent way to do this. It’s called <code>sxe ld USER32.dll</code>. I’ve literally written about it <a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-03-18-virtual-reality-projection-shenanigans/"><em>in this blog before</em></a>. Oops.</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>Now this is very interesting. The bottom of the stack trace is quite expected: SDL creates a window, uses ANGLE’s EGL implementation for this, that does a bunch of stuff, and eventually creates a DXGI swapchain. But then what is <code>UpgradeSwapEffect</code>? And why is it installing a detour?</p>
<p>Ah, I already know what this is.</p>

Been out of the DXGI code for too long” “is this related to whatever the thing in windows 11 is that forces flip model on software (ANGLE […] create flip model swap chains when using its own swap chain management)” “Yes”">

</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
	<a href="#optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
		Optimizing windowed games: flip model
	</a>
</h2><p>Right. So. DirectX.</p>
<p>When you create a DirectX swapchain, you specify an “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_effect">effect</a>”, which falls into two categories: “bitblt” and “flip”. To make a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/for-best-performance--use-dxgi-flip-model#a-brief-history">long story short</a>: bitblt is the “original” one, while flip is the much more modern one added in Windows 8<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It’s more efficient and performant, and all software should be using it. Furthermore, on modern versions of Windows and with a GPU supporting “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/multiplane-overlay-support">Multiplane Overlays</a>”, flip model actually enables windowed games to be displayed with <em>zero additional latency</em> over “exclusive” fullscreen mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many games never get updated, or they’re stuck on an ancient version. And many of these games don’t care. So in Windows 11, Microsoft added “<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952">Optimizations for windowed games</a>”, which forcibly enables flip model on games that are still using bitblt. Why does DXGI need to install detours for this? Probably some compatibility shit with the bitblt model. I don’t have any deep knowledge of how Win32 GDI stuff works, but it’s not hard for me to imagine there’s some interplay here they need to take care of. I can also confirm that <em>disabling</em> the feature in Windows’ settings menu fixes the crash!</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why SS14 isn’t using flip model: it’s because we can’t. We’re not creating the swapchain directly, <em>ANGLE</em> is. And ANGLE is continuing to use <code>SWAP_EFFECT_SEQUENTIAL</code>. I actually once <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox/blob/ac3cb4dc2abe970e611b944b252504e602303dfe/Robust.Client/Graphics/Clyde/GLContext/GLContextAngle.cs">experimented with SS14 managing the swapchain</a>, but this ran into some ANGLE limitations and I never got around to ironing out all the edge cases and crashes. I’d rather just spend the brain power on ditching OpenGL, rather than trying to continue working with this broken API.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here we are. The entire debugging story so far, you’re like, “surely Microsoft didn’t break DXGI on ARM64, huh???” But now it’s becoming plausible. There’s barely any native ARM64 Windows games, and surely none that are using bitblt swapchains. And guess what, you don’t even <em>need</em> <code>GetDC()</code> for modern DirectX games. SDL does it because it’s heavily designed for OpenGL. Most games run in x64 emulation, and that presumably works fine. Everything adds up to it being possible this just genuinely fell under the radar at Microsoft.</p>
<p>This should be pretty easy to verify in a minimal example. I cloned an <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-SDK-Samples/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Direct3D11/Tutorials/Tutorial01/Tutorial01.cpp">old DirectX SDK sample</a>, updated it to be compiled for ARM64, added some <code>GetDC()</code> calls, aaand… nope, no crash. Then I spent quite a while <em>trying various stuff</em>: comparing the swapchain creation code with that of ANGLE, changing various parameters, verifying whether the detour was being installed (it wasn’t). But eventually, I did find it.</p>
<p>It’s the filename.</p>
<p>Of course it’s the goddamn filename.</p>
<h2 id="im-on-a-list">
	<a href="#im-on-a-list">
		I’m on a list
	</a>
</h2><p><strong>It only happens when the program is called <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle. It didn’t happen in a dev environment because then the exe isn’t named <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>. Microsoft only enables “Optimizations for windowed games” on a specific list of games. And guess what, <em>none</em> of those select games are on ARM64, at least until I was unfortunate enough to port mine. How did we get on the list? Who knows.</p>
<p>Microsoft put me on a list, that ships with every Windows install. And this list actually broke my game. Achievement unlocked!</p>

	<a href="#addendum-why-angle-and-about-opengl-on-windows-arm64">
		Addendum: why ANGLE, and about OpenGL on Windows ARM64
	</a>
</h2><p>Traditionally, OpenGL on Windows has been implemented by the 3 IHVs (Nvidia, AMD, Intel). If they didn’t explicitly go out of their way to add it to their drivers, you’d have no OpenGL beyond 1.0. Those new Snapdragon X devices, however, use Microsoft’s new-ish “OpenGL on D3D12” driver. It’s actually part of Mesa!</p>
<p>The problem with Space Station 14 is that said driver is broken for us, causing severe graphical artifacts and flickering. I had been aware of this for years, because the same driver is used for the GPU acceleration of WSL2, but I never bothered to report it 😬. So for the purpose of porting SS14 to ARM64 Windows, I decided to just immediately force on ANGLE on Qualcomm devices, and call it a day.</p>
<p>What I didn’t know until yesterday is that the OpenGL on D3D12 driver does not ship with Qualcomm’s drivers! <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">It’s on the Microsoft store!</a> I can even install it in my VM and get it to emulate OpenGL on top of DirectX’s software renderer (WARP), just like I had been doing with ANGLE. I’ve finally bothered to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13936">report the graphical issues</a>, so hopefully it gets fixed eventually. If it does get fixed, Microsoft Store distribution means it shouldn’t take too long to trickle down to users, and then we can stop enforcing ANGLE on Qualcomm devices.</p>
<p>For Space Station 14, I will say that this means I’ll be postponing official Windows ARM64 support <em>for now</em>. At least until either bug (OpenGL on D3D12 <em>or</em> ARM64 DXGI detours) are fixed. Or when I finally rewrite the renderer to drop OpenGL, that’s also an option.</p>

<ul>
<li>“Why not just rename the <code>.exe</code> on ARM”: what I didn’t mention is that Steamworks does not support ARM64 Linux or Windows, at the moment. That means ARM64 builds will not be on Steam regardless, and I didn’t feel like going through even more the effort to add <em>a</em> workaround, just to improve performance for that 0.001% of people playing the game on a Snapdragon X device <em>while also downloading from our website</em>. And God forbid Microsoft updates the list later based on a bulk import of some random filenames and catches the new name too. The game already works when emulated, so I’m leaving it there until Windows is fixed.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have developed a new, easily manufacturable solid-state thermoelectric refrigeration technology with nano-engineered materials that is twice as efficient as devices made with commercially available bulk thermoelectric materials. As global demand grows for more energy-efficient, reliable and compact cooling solutions, this advancement offers a scalable alternative to traditional compressor-based refrigeration.</p><div id="text">
<p>In a paper published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, a team of researchers from APL and refrigeration engineers from Samsung Research demonstrated improved heat-pumping efficiency and capacity in refrigeration systems attributable to high-performance nano-engineered thermoelectric materials invented at APL known as controlled hierarchically engineered superlattice structures (CHESS).</p>
<p>The CHESS technology is the result of 10 years of APL research in advanced nano-engineered thermoelectric materials and applications development. Initially developed for national security applications, the material has also been used for noninvasive cooling therapies for prosthetics and won an R&amp;D 100 award in 2023.</p>
<p>"This real-world demonstration of refrigeration using new thermoelectric materials showcases the capabilities of nano-engineered CHESS thin films," said Rama Venkatasubramanian, principal investigator of the joint project and chief technologist for thermoelectrics at APL. "It marks a significant leap in cooling technology and sets the stage for translating advances in thermoelectric materials into practical, large-scale, energy-efficient refrigeration applications."</p>
<p><strong>A New Benchmark for Solid-State Cooling</strong></p>
<p>The push for more efficient and compact cooling technologies is fueled by a variety of factors, including population growth, urbanization and an increasing reliance on advanced electronics and data infrastructure. Conventional cooling systems, while effective, are often bulky, energy intensive and reliant on chemical refrigerants that can be harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric refrigeration is widely regarded as a potential solution. This method cools by using electrons to move heat through specialized semiconductor materials, eliminating the need for moving parts or harmful chemicals, making these next-generation refrigerators quiet, compact, reliable and sustainable. Bulk thermoelectric materials are used in small devices like mini-fridges, but their limited efficiency, low heat-pumping capacity and incompatibility with scalable semiconductor chip fabrication have historically prevented their wider use in high-performance systems.</p>


<p>In the study, researchers compared refrigeration modules using traditional bulk thermoelectric materials with those using CHESS thin-film materials in standardized refrigeration tests, measuring and comparing the electrical power needed to achieve various cooling levels in the same commercial refrigerator test systems. Samsung Research's Life Solution Team, led by executive vice president Joonhyun Lee, collaborated with APL to validate the results through detailed thermal modeling, quantifying heat loads and thermal resistance parameters to ensure accurate performance evaluation under real-world conditions.</p>
<p>The results were striking: Using CHESS materials, the APL team achieved nearly 100% improvement in efficiency over traditional thermoelectric materials at room temperature (around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 C). They then translated these material-level gains into a near 75% improvement in efficiency at the device level in thermoelectric modules built with CHESS materials and a 70% improvement in efficiency in a fully integrated refrigeration system, each representing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art bulk thermoelectric devices. These tests were completed under conditions that involved significant amounts of heat pumping to replicate practical operation.</p>
<p><strong>Built to Scale</strong></p>
<p>Beyond improving efficiency, the CHESS thin-film technology uses remarkably less material -- just 0.003 cubic centimeters, or about the size of a grain of sand, per refrigeration unit. This reduction in material means APL's thermoelectric materials could be mass-produced using semiconductor chip production tools, driving cost efficiency and enabling widespread market adoption.</p>
<p>"This thin-film technology has the potential to grow from powering small-scale refrigeration systems to supporting large building HVAC applications, similar to the way that lithium-ion batteries have been scaled to power devices as small as mobile phones and as large as electric vehicles," Venkatasubramanian said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CHESS materials were created using a well-established process commonly used to manufacture high-efficiency solar cells that power satellites and commercial LED lights.</p>


<p>"We used metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) to produce the CHESS materials, a method well known for its scalability, cost-effectiveness and ability to support large-volume manufacturing," said Jon Pierce, a senior research engineer who leads the MOCVD growth capability at APL. "MOCVD is already widely used commercially, making it ideal for scaling up CHESS thin-film thermoelectric materials production."</p>
<p>These materials and devices continue to show promise for a broad range of energy harvesting and electronics applications in addition to the recent advances in refrigeration. APL plans to continue to partner with organizations to refine the CHESS thermoelectric materials with a focus on boosting efficiency to approach that of conventional mechanical systems. Future efforts include demonstrating larger-scale refrigeration systems, including freezers, and integrating artificial intelligence-driven methods to optimize energy efficiency in compartmentalized or distributed cooling in refrigeration and HVAC equipment.</p>
<p>"Beyond refrigeration, CHESS materials are also able to convert temperature differences, like body heat, into usable power," said Jeff Maranchi, Exploration Program Area manager in APL's Research and Exploratory Development Mission Area. "In addition to advancing next-generation tactile systems, prosthetics and human-machine interfaces, this opens the door to scalable energy-harvesting technologies for applications ranging from computers to spacecraft -- capabilities that weren't feasible with older bulkier thermoelectric devices."</p>
<p>"The success of this collaborative effort demonstrates that high-efficiency solid-state refrigeration is not only scientifically viable but manufacturable at scale," said Susan Ehrlich, an APL technology commercialization manager. "We're looking forward to continued research and technology transfer opportunities with companies as we work toward translating these innovations into practical, real-world applications."</p>
