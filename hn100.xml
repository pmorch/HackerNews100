<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Since the dawn of human history, certain archetypal stories have recurred, appearing again and again in myth and legend across cultures, continents, and centuries. The Deluge. The Resurrection. The Hero’s Journey. On the internet, among the most important archetypes is “The Overconfident Optimist and His Ill-Advised DIY Project.” We see it in </span><a href="https://twitter.com/boldlybuilding2/status/1197999531671130112" rel="">Groverhaus</a><span>, in </span><a href="https://www.gawker.com/5932987/reddit-island-could-an-enthusiastic-online-community-create-a-nerd-oasis-in-real-life" rel="">Reddit Island</a><span>, in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/foldablehuman/status/1018966179493265408?lang=en" rel="">Child-Annihilating Zipline</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>On Monday the user @i_zzzzzz -- a person to whom I feel personally indebted for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i_zzzzzz/status/948803884738404352" rel="">their coinage of the extremely useful term “chaos meal”</a><span> -- revealed what seemed like a new instance of this time-honored archetype. “</span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465698" rel="">This guy on Hacker News</a><span> is buying up the entire town of Pine Bluff, Arkansas for reasons that seem unclear even to him. Someone please help him go home to his children,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i_zzzzzz/status/1559027106176286721" rel="">@i_zzzzzz wrote</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The comment appears, it seems worth noting, underneath </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465372" rel="">a Hackernews post from a tech worker looking to relocate for remote work, asking for advice on finding a small town</a><span> with a walkable downtown, good schools, a nearby airport, and houses that cost less than $1 million. “Pick some states, and go visit towns with colleges in them,” one commenter suggests. “The internet means there are no undiscovered places, and the economics can undermine what makes a place special in the first place,” another commenter warns. But one commenter -- writing under the name pontifier -- has very different way of thinking about the problem: why not find the biggest, cheapest warehouse building in the U.S., and buy it?</span></p><blockquote><p>My method sure hasn't worked very well... or has it? I was looking for cheap warehouse space to start a business in, and did a nation-wide search for the largest, cheapest building in the entire continental US.</p><p>I found one that seemed too good to be true. a 220,000 sqft metal warehouse and office complex on 17 acres. I thought the price was a typo at $375k.The agent assured me that the price was correct, and I flew out to see the place.</p><p>It was in a little town called Pine Bluff, Arkansas.</p><p>I offered about 3/4 what they were asking, and they accepted the offer.</p><p>Fast forward 2 1/2 years, and I've had nothing but problems. Break in after break in. Can't work through the red tape with the city so my warehouse sits empty. It feels like they are actively working against myself and other entrepreneurs I talk to. At least 2 others who bought buildings and tried to open businesses left after getting nowhere.</p><p>Maybe I'm daft, but I ended up buying about 75 more properties here... all surprisingly cheap.</p><p>The town is killing me though. I haven't seen my kids very much lately - I don't think it's safe enough for them. I'm probably going to be moving back to Utah in the next couple of months because it's just too much out here.</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to express the number of questions that a comment like this raises. Questions like: What? What on earth, bro? Was this (as some commenters imagined) a libertarian tech bro trying to take over a depressed town? A comedian doing a weird bit? A man with some kind of mental illness?</p><p><span>Whatever it was, it wasn’t fake: “Pontifier” is the handle used across a number of platforms by a Utahn named John Fenley, a compulsive entrepreneur, amateur nuclear engineer, and, now -- public records show</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-1-68844027" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> -- among the largest property owners in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Fenley has an extensive internet-content trail -- including, besides </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pontifier" rel="">hundreds of HackerNews comments</a><span>, </span><a href="http://twitter.com/pontifier" rel="">a Twitter account</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pontifier/videos" rel="">a YouTube channel</a><span>, </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-fenley" rel="">a Soundcloud page</a><span>, and many different registered URLs</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-2-68844027" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> -- some portion of which is dedicated to documenting his Pine Bluff odyssey. But none of it really clarifies what Fenley’s deal is. </span></p><p>So I called Fenley on Tuesday morning, and reached him at his home in Pine Bluff. He was an engaging, talkative interview, and I appreciated his candor and admired his ambition and his positive attitude. He was more than happy to discuss his dreams, troubles, and real-estate activity in Pine Bluff. </p><p>If I’m being honest, I can’t really promise it will clarify anything. </p><p>“Only time will tell if this was a good idea,” he told me. “I mean, yeah, I've experienced, you know, thousands, and thousands, and thousands of dollars of loss. But the upside still could be millions and millions of dollars. Because I still own a warehouse.”</p><p><span>Fenley’s story --&nbsp;this chapter, at any rate -- begins in 2019. After separating from his wife, with whom he has three kids, Fenley had moved in with his father, a sculptor, and uncle in Los Angeles, working on </span><a href="http://www.crossies.com/murfie/crossies_history.html" rel="">a start-up he’d founded called Crossies</a><span>, which stores and digitizes physical media collections and offers them for streaming on the cloud. Two weeks after his arrival, his uncle received an eviction notice, and Fenley and his father began to look for somewhere new. </span></p><p><span>Fenley had run a </span><a href="http://www.provolt.org/" rel="">a makerspace workshop called “Provolt”</a><span> in Utah until the landlord had raised the rent. “There was a 65,000 square foot jail that I'd wanted wanted to move the makerspace into in Provo, and that that whole thing hadn't worked out,” he told me on the phone. (The city only wanted to sell the asbestos-riddled jail, </span><a href="http://heraldextra.com/news/2015/jun/18/provo-city-puts-old-county-jail-on-surplus-list-gets-sued" rel="">which it described as “grim,”</a><span> to owners who would demolish it; Fenley had wanted to rehabilitate the building.) The jail’s size became his minimum lower bound. </span></p><p><span>“I didn't care where it was in the country. And I wanted to find the cheapest possible price,” he said.” So Fenley hopped on the commercial real-estate listing site Loopnet and searched, </span><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">as he later described to </a><em><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">The Capital Times</a></em><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel=""> of Madison, Wis.</a><span>, “for properties over 65,000 square feet and sorted by price.” At the top of the list was the former home of the steel company Varco Pruden --&nbsp;a 17-acre property with a warehouse and office complex in Pine Bluff that had been vacant and decaying for 15 years. The property was listed at $375,000; Fenley initially assumed the price was a typo. In the summer of 2019, Fenley flew out to tour it, making a YouTube video of his first visit:</span></p><div id="youtube2-qdkLzioUiAE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;qdkLzioUiAE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qdkLzioUiAE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>“It was awesome,” Fenley recalled. “It didn't seem like in that bad condition. I mean, for $375,000, how picky can you be about the condition of a place? It had a roof. It had concrete slabs. It had walls, you know</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-3-68844027" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>?” That fall, Fenley made an offer of $300,000, and the owners accepted. He started packing up his things in L.A. and Utah, preparing to relocate.</span></p><p><span>Not many people move </span><em>to </em><span>Pine Bluff. Once a prosperous manufacturing and agricultural city located about 50 miles south of Little Rock, Pine Bluff most recently made national headlines for being </span><a href="http://nytimes.com/2021/08/12/us/pine-bluff-fastest-shrinking-metro-area.html" rel="">the fastest-shrinking city in the country</a><span>. As in many other industrial and agricultural cities in the U.S., white flight, capital flight, deindustrialization, and a multi-decade conservative assault on social spending have decimated Pine Bluff’s economy, leaving it caught in a negative feedback loop between a dwindling tax base and diminished municipal resources. Varco Pruden, the steel company that once owned the 19-acre property Fenley bought for $300,000 and is now itself owned by an Australian conglomerate, </span><a href="http://arkansasonline.com/news/2022/jan/25/varco-pruden-moving-from-pb-to-white-hall" rel="">announced this year it would move its remaining 32 employees to the neighboring city of White Hall</a><span>, which is 70 percent white (Pine Bluff is 75 percent black) and has among the highest median incomes in Arkansas. Pine Bluff, where median income is about 60 percent lower, suffers under one of the worst murder rates in the country.</span></p><p><span>Fenley would not make it to Pine Bluff for a few months yet. In December of 2019, while closing the deal for the Varco Pruden property, Fenley </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21019565/murfie-madison-wisconsin-store-stream-cd-vinyl-collection-closed" rel="">read on the Verge about the demise of a company called Murfie</a><span> -- a music storage-digitizing-streaming company very similar to Crossies, which Fenley was still trying to get off the ground. Murfie, which was based out of Madison, had gone mysteriously bankrupt and the collections of CDs it was storing for customers were about to be abandoned. To Fenley, it was “a perfect storm of opportunity”: Murfie was “basically” Crossies, and he was in the process of purchasing a perfect storage facility for all those CDs. Fenley </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21121594/crossies-murfie-madison-wisconsin-arkansas-1-million-abandoned-cds" rel="">flew to Wisconsin and negotiated to purchase Murfie and its assets for $6,000, plus $2,000 in lawyers’ fees</a><span>. He packed two shipping containers with Murfie customers’ CD collections and sent them down to Pine Bluff.</span></p><div id="youtube2-B5KleqoyB0s" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;B5KleqoyB0s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B5KleqoyB0s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>By the time the shipping containers, delayed by COVID-19, arrived in July, Fenley’s dreams had gotten more complicated. At this point his plans for the warehouse and surrounding property included not just a makerspace but a live/work business incubator, art studio, and science museum. It would be called “</span><a href="http://www.serendipic.com/#contact" rel="">Serendipic</a><span>.” “I was working with Pine Bluff City at the time,” Fenley said. “I made up my little proposal for the planning commission, submitted it, and they approved most of the stuff I wanted to do, with a notable exception exception of a go-kart track.” </span></p><p><span>But Fenley’s relationship with the city of Pine Bluff was deteriorating. </span><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">Pine Bluff city government wanted Fenley to submit architectural and engineering drawings so it could determine the applicable building codes</a><span>, but he had not done so and the city wouldn’t approve his permits. Fenley believes something else was at stake: “They denied my go-kart track that I proposed, and now they’re spending $2.6 million to </span><a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/entertainment/go-kart-facility-pine-bluff/91-b3415ccd-8350-4ed7-be53-1080fef6ca0d" rel="">build their own go-kart track</a><span>. Yeah, surprising. I proposed residences for artists and entrepreneurs. Oh, suddenly, their little art space that they’re building is going to have residences for artists. Oh, what a surprise.” he said. “The city doesn't want any competition with anything they're trying to do. They have their own business incubator; they have their own science museum, which honestly sucks. Both of them. Their little makerspace, business incubator thing? It sucks. It's the worst one I've ever been to in my life.”</span></p><p><span>Fenley </span><a href="https://murfie.com/dist/list.html" rel="">began recording his meetings with town officials and posting them to the Murfie site</a><span>; they frequently end with Fenley being asked to calm down or leave. At one point, he told me, a zoning official “came across the room, ripped the clipboard out of my hand, and yelled at me to get out.” (He says he filed a police report over the incident.) Listening to Fenley’s recordings, the fairest thing you might say is that it seems like there is a mismatch between the scale and mutability of Fenley’s science museum–makerspace–go-kart track dreams and the capacity of Pine Bluff’s bureaucracy, not to mention between his eagerness to occupy the old warehouse and the city government’s caution over a long-abandoned space. </span></p><p><span>Permitting difficulty was not the only trouble Fenley was facing, anyway. In the early months of the process, Fenley had been staying in a tent and RV on the Varco Pruden site, sometimes with his father. (Fenley now lives in a house nearby.) “This whole time, there's this constant background of crime in this town,” he said. “People have come to the tent and put a gun in my face at one point, back in 2020 -- while I was waiting for this stuff to happen -- and my dad shot at them, and they ran away. I've got an audio recording of that.” (He does; it’s available on his Soundcloud; I can’t say I recommend listening to it.) At one point, trying to catch two thieves who’d stolen a catalytic converter from his car, </span><a href="http://bensforbars.com/" rel="">he set up a website called “Bens for Bars”</a><span> offering cash for tips leading to the thieves.</span></p><p>Fenley wasn’t exactly unaware of Pine Bluff’s reputation. “I saw some statistics,” he said on the phone. “And I was like, ‘Oh, well, I have one in X number of chance of being robbed each year or something.’ Right? Yeah. But that's on average, and well, I'm a huge target. I didn't really take that into account, I guess.” He’s mostly dealing with “career criminals,” he said, who arrive “with heavy machinery, cutting torches,” looking for metal and other materials to lift and sell for scrap.</p><p>Whatever you think of Google Forms-based private snitch sites, and whatever might expect from the circumstances, Fenley is a fraction as bloodthirsty as tough-on-crime local columnists in much less dangerous metropolises. “It’s a nice town,” he told me about Pine Bluff. “It feels like they’re trying to fix things. New York was terrible, in the ‘80s. Everything they’re saying about Pine Bluff now they were saying about New York in the ‘80s! And I sure wish I could have bought some real estate in New York in the 80s!”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>For most of the next year, Fenley, living on the property and subsisting on ramen, was engaged in battle on multiple fronts: Against the city of Pine Bluff, against the scrappers stealing from his property, and against angry Murfie customers who wanted to know where their CDs were. (Still packed into the shipping containers sitting outside the Varco Pruden warehouse, as it happened.) But in the summer of 2021, he came into a windfall: He was able to sell nearly $900,000 worth of stock in a company to whom he’d sold a patent</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-4-68844027" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. A certain kind of person might use that money to extricate themselves from what had become a clearly stressful and likely unsustainable real-estate situation in Pine Bluff. Fenley, instead, used it to buy more property.</span></p><p>“All of a sudden I went from scraping by to having $890,000 in my bank account. And then a tax auction, like three weeks later? Of course I'm gonna buy some property.” He spent $138,000 and ended up with 74 parcels of land in Pine Bluff, to go along with his 19-acre industrial park. “I didn’t really have a plan,” he said. Fenley’s mom was a real estate agent, and he told me it was “drilled into me from a young child: You buy property when you can.” He still sounds awed by how much land he bought, and how cheaply. “There were a few hundred other people in that room. And anybody else that had the money could have done it,” he said. “But I'm the one that actually did it. That's what a lot of this boils down to, in a way. A lot of the things that I'm doing, anybody could do them. But I'm the one that's actually doing them.”</p><p><span>And yet becoming one of the top landowners (by parcel) in Jefferson County didn’t change much for Fenley’s overall situation. He moved into a house, but he still hasn’t broken ground on his dream makerspace; his YouTube feed is still taken up by increasingly apologetic messages to Murfie customers interspersed with security footage of alleged thieves. This summer, he and his 12-year-old son drove from Provo to Pine Bluff in a Volkswagen bus loaded up with electronics and supplies. “Saturday, we came to the house and played video games. And Sunday, went back over the warehouse, and the containers were robbed. Everything,” he said.” “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHclCHqC2rE" rel="">Everything I brought from Utah was stolen</a><span>. They stole my turbomolecular vacuum pumps for my fusion reactor</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-5-68844027" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>!”</span></p><p>This seems to have been something of a final straw for even the eternally optimistic Fenley. A year after buying a chunk of Pine Bluff at auction, he’s finally decided to leave: “My finances are fine,” he told me. “I'm in no danger of losing the warehouse or any of the property that I bought. But right now, my mother and girlfriend are working on building a warehouse in Utah, and moving everything back to Utah. That's the plan at this point as of today.”</p><p>But what about the makerspace? What about the warehouse? What about his Pine Bluff holdings? I asked Fenley what his long-term plans were. He hesitated. “There's a hotel available at auction right now that I bid on three weeks ago. There's like a week left in the auction. If nobody bids on this hotel against me, I'm gonna buy a hotel for $31,400,” he said. The hotel is in Pine Bluff, with good highway access. It’s been unoccupied since 2019. “It'd be freaking fantastic to own a hotel, and like, have rooftop parties and turn the whole top floor into a penthouse for me. You know? Like, that's, like, how would I not want to do that?”</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>Physical media may be on life-support, but rumors of its demise are overstated. Its heyday as a significant slice of film industry revenue may be over, but there’s good reason to believe the movie-disc will live on as a healthy niche that struggling film industry can’t afford to ignore into the foreseeable future. There may even be some optimism that physical media has already seen its rock-bottom and can only go one direction from here.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Those of us who stopped paying cable bills anytime through the 2000s lived through it. We cheered-on streaming video or the “Subscription Video on Demand” (SVoD) market as it threw a hand grenade into the cable TV industrial complex. But we may not have expected physical media would be collateral damage. A 2023 report from the Digital Entertainment Group says, after over a decade of declines, movie-disc media (DVD/BD/UHD) <a href="https://www.degonline.org/portfolio_page/deg-q2-2023-digital-media-entertainment-report/">revenue dropped an additional 28% through 2023</a>. I wish I had more firm good news for movie-disc media, but I’m remaining optimistic that as the SVoD market matures and passes from its experimental disruptive technology phase, more of us will return to the value in owning the disc again.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Peak Streaming TV</span></h2>
<p><span>When streaming came along, video on Demand (VoD) was not a new concept. Cable and satellite services experimented with VoD services as far back as the 90s. But the real innovation with on-demand TV and movies would arrive in the high-speed Internet-era, and it was called Netflix. Honestly, what’s not to love about an ad-free, all-you-can-watch video buffet that can be consumed on any connected screen?&nbsp;</span><span> <br></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/netflix.jpg/image" title="Netflix N"><img alt="Netflix N" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/netflix.jpg/image_mini" width="195"></a>Brief Rise of Streaming Timeline:</span><span><br></span></strong></p>

</li><li>
<p><span>2023 Physical movie-disc media sees its sixteenth straight year of sales decline</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>By the 2010s households across <a href="https://research.mountain.com/trends/streaming-tv-viewing-time-continues-its-rise-over-cable/">America were replacing monthly cable bills</a> that averaged between $80-$200 with a broadband Internet connection and an inexpensive ad-free, unlimited streaming video service called Netflix. When the first major SVoD service was the only game in town it built an audience on licensed TV programming and movies from nearly any network or film studio. Early adopters may remember when a Netflix subscription was only $8/mo and paired with a free, ad-supported Hulu subscription you had a popular one-two punch for movies, legacy and current TV with no cable bill.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Unsustainable Streaming Flood <br></strong></h2>
<p>Did anyone really think the economics of an $8/mo centralized streaming service could last? The cord cutting trend took a <strong>lot</strong> of potential revenue out of the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, movie theater attendance had been in steep decline since long before the virus struck in 2020. Cable TV may have simultaneously been among America’s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/comcast-is-americas-most-hated-company">most profitable and hated businesses</a>, but it had it all! From outrageous bills to network advertising, cable providers and the networks it carried had such large, often captive markets that it could afford to fund what we call the “golden age of TV” in the late 90s &amp; 2000s.</p>
<p>This may be an unpopular opinion, but early streaming adopters were taking part in an experiment with the Netflix library in its $8/mo-era. We got away with it while we could, but what we were viewing was provided at losses, covered mostly by borrowing and investors to provide us with a preview of a home entertainment future. It was the proverbial free sample of crack to get us hooked. One way or another, the real cost was coming to our homes to roost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, big-tech unlocked the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/streaming-viewership-overtakes-cable-tv-first-time-rcna43704">“Disrupt Home Entertainment” achievement trophy</a> when cord cutters outnumbered cable subscribers. The big media companies were already working on getting that revenue back when they began to imitate Netflix. The media conglomerates started tech-companies to launch their own streaming services while Netflix built its own legitimate media production company<span><span>—</span></span>what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p><em><span>“Everything became big tech — the Amazon model of ‘We don’t actually have to make money; we just have to show shareholder growth.’ Everyone said, ‘Great. That seems like the thing to do.’ Which essentially was like, ‘Let’s all commit ritual suicide. Let’s take one of the truly successful money-printing inventions in the history of the modern world — which was the carriage system with cable television — and let’s just end it and reinvent ourselves as tech companies, where we pour billions down the drain in pursuit of a return that is completely speculative, still, this many years into it.’”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>“I think we may be in the world’s biggest Ponzi scheme.” <br></span></em></p>

<h2><span>Peak Streaming <br></span></h2>
<p><span>Now that we’re years into competitive streaming we’ve started to see the cracks. According to one media analyst, as the seemingly unlimited growth of the SVoD market has begun to taper off, <a href="https://businessmodelanalyst.com/is-netflix-profitable/">only Netflix has proved profitable</a> as a standalone streaming business. For some companies, losing money in streaming may be seen as an investment in a retention or marketing strategy for other profitable services. Amazon and Apple may use streaming to promote their services or ecosystem. Disney may have even pitched streaming to its board as marketing for its theme parks and theatrical releases, but that doesn't seem to be working. For film studios sinking in losses at the movies, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/disney-plus-number-of-subscribers-us/">starting a streaming service</a> has been like throwing it an anchor.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/RobLongUnspeakable.jpg/image" title="Rob Long Hollywood Exec"><img alt="Rob Long Hollywood Exec" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/RobLongUnspeakable.jpg/image_mini" width="200"></a>Behind-the-Scenes Hollywood Legend Talks Streaming</span><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Rob Long is a Hollywood writer/executive and podcaster that shares his often humorous takes on the entertainment industry as co-host of the <a href="https://ricochet.com/series/goldberg-long-podhoretz/">Glop Culture podcast</a>. The natural humor he brings to his writing and podcasting is a gift he’s employed since he started in the business writing for the comedy TV show Cheers. Long has had a lot to say about the sorry state of entertainment production in the age of streaming. He seems to imply that production companies building streaming services and tech companies (Netflix, Apple &amp; Amazon) creating studio productions is just bad business. But he says they’ve been able to get away with reckless spending due to a period of low-interest rates and relatively free-flowing investment capital. On the <a href="https://player.fm/series/the-unspeakable-podcast/rob-long-on-how-hollywood-lost-the-plot">Unspeakable podcast with Meghan Daum</a> Rob Long said:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>”Netflix grew on borrowed money… [while production studios] spent on building these stupid companies [streaming services]. There is no reason on Earth why the world needs, or where the economically rational choice would be to build “Paramount Plus”. It’s so lazy, they spent so much money and didn’t even think… they just named everything “Plus”! There’s even an MGM Plus!… When money was essentially free, they made poor decisions… ”</em></span></p>
<p><span>Long has told stories about one important job of a movie producer, working the phone to acquire investment into movies. The business has always worked this way and Long says that throughout film history, the most successful business-sectors in any given era will reliably invest in Hollywood despite its risks. Fortunately for these producers, big companies and the powerful people behind them are charmed by the glamor and prestige of being part of Hollywood while wanting their brands associated with it.</span></p>
<p><span>In earlier eras of entertainment this may have resulted in Mutual of Omaha putting its name on a wildlife documentary series. But the consumer electronics industry took its relationships with Hollywood to the next level in the 1980s by acquiring them, and giving us preview of what was to come. GE acquired RCA which included NBC. Sony bought Columbia pictures to create Sony Pictures. Comcast bought NBC-Universal from GE in 2011. But these days, the most successful business sector is big-tech, which is simultaneously investing in the industry, while gravely disrupting it. The two business-worlds seem to be merging after a catastrophic collision with Netflix that turned the tech-startup culture of investment spending over to Hollywood.<br></span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Drunk with Growth Potential</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The COVID restrictions of 2020-2021 arrived just as Disney+ and a revamped unified HBO Max (HBO/Warner/Discovery) began. The SVoD market was already ripe for growth, but the COVID-era may have seduced streamers into exaggerated impressions of demand. According to a Deloitte Digital Media Trends study soon after the start of widespread COVID restrictions, the percentage of Americans that <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/streaming-video-subscriptions-churn-covid-19-deloitte-1234642672/">subscribed to one or more streaming services jumped by about 11%</a>, while the average American household increased the number of streaming services from 3 to 4 while subscriber churn only declined slightly. That’s a little smaller growth than I would have guessed but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/nielsen-finds-connected-tv-viewing-remains-higher-than-pre-covid-19-levels-despite-lockdowns-lifting/">according to Neilson, the real growth</a> during the high-pandemic months was in viewing time.</span><span> From <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2020/connected-tv-usage-remains-above-pre-covid-19-levels-as-traditional-tv-viewing-normalizes/">Neilson Insights</a>: <br></span></p>
<p><span><em>“During the height of countrywide shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly time spent watching connected TVs grew along with overall media use, rising by more than 1 billion hours as the weeks passed.” <br></em></span></p>

<h2><span>2023-2024 - Streaming’s Real Cost Passed to Consumers</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>By now we’ve all seen a parade of streaming service price hikes accompanied by lost revenue. Worst of all, we’ve seen movies and shows pulled from the services that produced them. Much of streaming’s new lost media were only produced over the last few years and are now locked away by its intellectual property owner, potentially never to be seen again. That the cost of streaming specific titles is higher than the rewards of its presence on the service speaks to an industry that drank a bit too much of its own Kool-Aid. The money being saved could be hosting cost, per-stream residuals and maybe the service gets a tax write-off. But for some of the freshly pulled Disney+ plus content, it could be a form of reputation management or damage control to keep subscribers from accidentally watching that Willow remake.&nbsp; </span><span><br></span></p>

<h2><span>Streaming Will Only Get Worse</span><strong><span></span></strong><br><strong><span></span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Where will streaming video will go next? My guess is that media conglomerates with ties to communications companies will form a team-up. Comcast (NBCUniversal) and AT&amp;T (Warner) may partner with Disney to take the lead on at least one unified streaming service in a sort-of Hulu 2.0 enterprise that will compete with or absorb Netflix. They’ll find clever ways to sneak more advertising throughout user-interfaces and content, even on more expensive premium “ad-free” subscriptions. Soon, we’ll forget about “cord cutting” and a not-so-new term will re-enter the American entertainment lexicon: “Bundles”. Perhaps a new generation of bundles will be tied to your ISP or wireless network fees and they may even involve contracts to lock you in. It will be just like cable TV, but in the cloud. Streaming can't continue operating at losses for much longer, eventually its true cost will be passed on to consumers. I'm hopeful this may present opportunity for physical media.<br></span></p>

<h2><span>Back to Physical Media</span></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/JamesMadison.jpg/image" title="James Madison"><img alt="James Madison" height="142" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/JamesMadison.jpg/image_mini" width="200"></a>I’m not here to tell you that you can <em>stick it to the man</em> through consumption. But by collecting movies on optical-disc in any form, you will at least support a more reliable and egalitarian method of media consumption. You’ll achieve the only real <em>ownership</em> of your movies </span><span>in the true </span><span>constitutional </span><span>sense that exercises your right to private property.</span><span> If James Madison permitted himself such frivolities, he would almost certainly keep a collection of his favorite movies on disc. If you care about sound and video quality, the new generations of optical disc is your best bet this side of <a href="https://dreamediaav.com/collections/kaleidescape?ref=3">Kaliedescape</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>After over a decade of decline, there’s still a robust, if niche market for physical movie-disc media</span><span><span>—</span></span><span>but it needs your support! It may be too soon to provide any solid sales data to support it, but I believe the market for DVD, Blu-ray &amp; 4K Ultra discs may be on the rise. There were plenty of anecdotes from the collector market of individuals <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/oppenheimer-4k-disc-sells-out-all-over/">unable to obtain Oppenheimer on 4K Ultra HD</a> the week after release due to demand and that’s a good sign. If physical media can achieve broader market acceptance again, it will have a much better chance of surviving streaming. Streaming affords the studios absolute control of its intellectual property's distribution. But a formidable revenue stream is a fair incentive to include a physical media release into a new movie's life-cycle. But I can only wonder if a niche collector's market will be enough to entice physical media releases far into the future.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Conan the Barbarian (1982)</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The movie that got me back into physical media recently was Conan the Barbarian (1982). It has long been one of my favorites. I grew-up reading the old DeCamp edits of the books by Robert E. Howard and the comic adaptations by Roy Thomas. While the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie can be criticized by Howard purists for not giving the character the same backstory as the books, the screen-writing duo of Oliver Stone and John Milius succeeded in capturing the true spirit of the character. </span><span>I will be grateful if the character never receives a new film adaptation that updates </span><span>Conan’s Hyborian Age </span><span>for <em>modern audiences</em>. But I have finally been treated to the definitive Blu-ray version of the classic I've been waiting for.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/ConanArrow1.jpg/image_large/image" title="Conan the Barbarian (1982)"><img alt="Conan the Barbarian (1982)" height="720" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/ConanArrow1.jpg/image_large" width="768"></a><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arrow's 2024 Release of </span><span>Conan the Barbarian (1982) Unboxed!<br></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.arrowvideo.com/">Arrow Video</a> is a boutique video-disc company that curates classic movies and performs high-quality audio/video transfers for DVD, Blu-ray and 4K UHD. I heard the company had released a limited, definitive remaster of Conan the Barbarian (1982) in UHD with a new Dolby Atmos soundtrack and video lovingly transferred from the original film's negatives. I was hooked because it also includes the classic Milius/Schwarzenegger commentary that I've only heard on an old DVD release, no subsequent Blu-ray until now included it or the ambitious restoration that Arrow performed. The commentary is a <em>must hear</em> for any fan of Milius,&nbsp;</span><span>Schwarzenegger or the 1982 movie, it's comedy gold hearing Milius philosophize over each scene through his distinct "survival of the fittest" outlook while </span><span>Schwarzenegger only really speaks up about his injuries while filming or about his female co-stars.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t find the disc anywhere in stock soon after its Jan 30th 2024 release date. It must have been in high demand if the <strong>Sold Out</strong> label on every retail web-page was any indication. Stock of the disc eventually returned to one online supplier the next month and I finally got it into my hands.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I finally got it home, opening the small box that includes a booklet, silly two-sided poster and hard cardboard slip-cover accompanied by that distinct smell of new media brought back a flood of fond memories of collecting great movies. At no time did I make a conscious decision to abandon physical movie-media, it just sort-of faded out. The fade can be dated across my modest collection at around 2015 when it ground to a halt. But for movie viewing at home, I for one will be subscribing less and the halt on my physical media collecting ends now!<br></span></p>

<p>Zhang Chunyuan had all the makings of a loyal communist. A native of rural Henan, Zhang and his family had only known hard times. The area was always on the verge of famine, and that made many people interested in the Chinese Communist Party’s appeal to social justice and economic development. In Zhang’s case, the Party was also an ersatz family. His mother had died when he was seven and, in his telling, his stepmother had treated him cruelly.</p>



<p>At 13, he ran away from home, never to return. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic and then joined the People’s Liberation Army in 1948 as a 16-year-old. When China entered the Korean War in 1950, he volunteered and was wounded when his convoy was strafed by US fighter planes. His neck was permanently damaged and in 1954 he was discharged. He took advantage of policies favoring veterans and entered Lanzhou University’s history department.</p>



<p>That began his disillusionment with how the Communists were running China. He thought a university would have a magnificent library but found that most books were under lock and key. Lanzhou University didn’t even possess a complete set of the Confucian classics — the basic texts used over the centuries by all literate people — let alone cutting-edge journals. Teaching was worse, with one lecturer for 100 students.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="300" height="434" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image6-1.png" alt="Zhang Chunyuan in 1956"><figcaption>Zhang Chunyuan in 1956</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the Hundred Flowers Campaign began in 1956, in which the Party encouraged citizens to voice their opinions, Zhang criticized the lack of books and poor teaching. For that, he was accused of trying to overthrow the university and in May 1958, as part of the Anti-Rightist Campaign, he was exiled with a group of forty other students and faculty to Tianshui, a city in the southeast of Gansu province at the boundary of the Loess Plateau and the Qinling Mountains.</p>



<p>In Tianshui, traditional society was being torn apart. Mao’s violent revolution had left temples dedicated to folk deities empty and desecrated. Farms were&nbsp; still divided into small plots for farmers to grow their traditional crop of wheat and sorghum, but every square inch of land in the People’s Republic actually belonged to the state. And for the sharp-eyed, new buildings hinted at the state’s unbridled power. One housed the local Communist Party offices, where Beijing’s orders were disseminated to villagers. Another was a new garage, which held a tractor — the first promise of the Party’s pledge to modernize rural life. The village had just one of the machines, and the farmers shared it. In the past, life centered around communal religious life; now it was to revolve around a new god, science, and its guardian: the Communist Party.</p>







<p>Zhang took up his job at the tractor station with gusto, fixing and driving the valuable piece of equipment. At night he even wrote a film script, “Children of China and North Korea,” which talked about the ties binding the two socialist countries. He used a pseudonym to send it to a movie studio that was sponsoring a competition, and won a prize worth 700 yuan, a small fortune back in the 1950s. The script was set to be produced until the studio delved deeper into the mysterious author and realized that it had been written by a convicted Rightist.</p>



<p>Zhang, though, was irrepressible. As a boy he was given the nickname “Screw” for being unbreakable when his mind was set on something. That made him cut out to lead the other students, because he had the toughness to do more than just talk — he could get things done. But his uncompromising attitude also led him to take huge risks.</p>



<p>In Tianshui, he once heard that a classmate was being detained by railway police several hundred miles south for having illegally ridden the rails to escape the Great Famine of 1959. Zhang forged an identity card as a Public Security officer and traveled down to straighten out the situation. He bluffed his way past railway guards and local police to get the young man released, returning in triumph, convinced that he could achieve anything.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1004" height="681" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan.jpg 1004w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-600x407.jpg 600w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-768x521.jpg 768w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-1000x678.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px"><figcaption>Pictures of Tan Chanxue (together with other members of <em>Spark</em> magazine on the right, in 1959)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The group of exiled students often met at Zhang’s tractor station. It was conveniently located on the main road, and Zhang was an amiable and thoughtful host. Broad and strong, with thick eyebrows and a square face, he had sensitive eyes and loved to read. His knowledge complemented his war experiences, which made him more mature than the bookish students. But he didn’t lecture or talk down to them, instead engaging them in long conversations about their country’s future. One point he returned to time and again was how they, even though just exiled students, were duty-bound to help their country.</p>



<p>“He really opposed those who only thought of themselves,” Tan Chanxue, one of the students, recalled in her memoirs. “He never thought that his own liberty counted for much.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Famine was taking hold, and the students saw the gruesome effects firsthand. They were able to withstand the lack of food, but they saw the elderly, the weak, and the very young slowly die</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In more densely populated areas farther east, the students probably would never have been able to meet at a place like Zhang’s tractor shed. Tianshui, however, was remote and poor, and local officials were eager to promote literacy. So they set up an open university, appointing the students as faculty. That gave the young people an excuse to meet and travel around the region. These face-to-face meetings, they realized, were crucial. Working alone resulted in nothing. A pebble can’t break a rock, Tan said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it.</p>



<p>Everyone in the group became good friends, but Tan and Zhang were particularly close, later declaring themselves to be husband and wife. A slender 24-year-old with thin, arching eyebrows, Tan came from southern China’s Guangdong province near the Hong Kong border. While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, she was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. There were many obstacles to a love in a famine-ridden land run by a totalitarian dictatorship, but their feelings blossomed. Soon, they would risk their lives to prove their love.</p>



<p>By May 1959, the group was debating issues such as how to rid China of the Communist Party, or at least the current leadership that had caused the famine. Zhang said there were two options: a top-down coup or a bottom-up revolution. The latter seemed impossible and so they hoped that Mao’s peers would act. And in fact, something along these lines is what some people in Beijing were planning. Over the summer, one of China’s most-decorated military leaders, Peng Dehuai, challenged Mao for causing the famine, but Mao held a pivotal meeting in the mountain-top retreat of Lushan. Peng was crushed and Mao redoubled his economic policies, causing the famine to deepen, eventually taking up to 45 million lives.</p>



<p>When Peng’s downfall was made public, the students felt certain that they had to act: if even a general at the top could be persecuted for expressing loyal dissent, then the only hope was to foment something at the grass roots. They thought that their best bet was to publish material on the famine in hopes of sharing ideas and opening up officials’ eyes to what was going on in the countryside. They began to think of publishing a journal.</p>







<p>The idea remained vague until they came across a remarkable poem. It was written by a student at Peking University, Lin Zhao, who had been studying in Beijing until she was labeled a Rightist for defending friends who were being persecuted. Lin’s poems galvanized the students, showing them the power of the written word.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="445" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg" alt="Lin Zhao (undated)"><figcaption>Lin Zhao (undated)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Zhang, Lin was more experienced than many of the younger students. Born in 1932, she had worked as a propagandist for the Communists shortly after their takeover in 1949. At the time, she went along with their violent policies and participated in the land reform campaigns that saw hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of property owners murdered — a genocide aimed at eliminating the elite that had run China before the revolution. But with time she began to see that the Communists were not building a utopia but a tightly controlled authoritarian state. As a young girl in pre-Communist China, she had attended a Methodist girl’s school. Now she returned to her faith and experimented with art to express her independence from the party. When her friends were arrested, she wrote a poem declaring:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The power of truth<br>never lies in<br>the arrogant air<br>of the guardians of truth.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lin later wrote a 240-line poem called “Seagull” and circulated it among friends. One friend was the sister of a member of the group of Tianshui students. The woman mailed a handwritten copy of the poem to the exiled students, who were thrilled by Lin’s bold imagery and overtly political message. The poem tells the story of a ship carrying chained prisoners. Their crime: they seek freedom.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Freedom, I cry out inside me, freedom!<br>The thought of you has filled my heart with yearning,<br>like a choking man gasping for air,<br>like one dying of thirst lurching toward a spring.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhang decided that he had to meet the author. After being arrested in Beijing, Lin was released after her chronic tuberculosis worsened, and she began spitting up blood. She moved back to her hometown of Suzhou on China’s east coast. She was immediately put under close surveillance. But Zhang once again took another huge risk, using his forged identity papers to travel days by train and then arranging to meet her. Lin urged Zhang not to print her poem, seeing it a risk to the group and to anyone who read it.</p>



<p>But then Zhang read Lin’s second poem, a 368-line work called “A Day in Prometheus’s Passion.” It used Christ-like motifs that reflected Lin’s renewed Christian faith. The poem tells of an encounter between Zeus and Prometheus, who is chained to a rock for giving humans fire. Zeus explains that his punishment is necessary because humans must never have such an important tool:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>But you ought to know, Prometheus,<br>for the mortals, we do not want to leave even a spark.<br>Fire is for the gods, for incense and sacrifice,<br>how can the plebeians have it for heating or lighting in the dark?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhang convinced Lin to let them publish the poem and decided to put it in the first issue of their new journal. Students from Beijing also passed him materials about how Yugoslavian Communists were trying a hybrid form of socialism that allowed for capitalist-style incentives (something the Communist Party would embrace twenty years later). Zhang decided to add that material, too, to the inaugural issue, as well as essays by himself and others in the group. The journal needed a name. They quickly settled on <em>Spark</em> (星火), based on the idiomatic expression <em>xinghuo liaoyuan, </em>or “a single spark can start a prairie fire.” Mao had also used it in one of his essays, making it widely known.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A pebble can’t break a rock, Zhang’s partner Tan Chanxue said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Two members of the group, physics student Miao Qingjiu and chemistry student Xiang Chengjian, were entrusted with printing the first issue. They had been assigned to work at a sulfuric acid plant in the nearby town of Wushan. The plant had an old mimeograph machine, which they could occasionally access. Their jobs also required them to cultivate bacteria used to make fertilizer, a process that required a sealed-off space. This allowed them to bar themselves in the room with the mimeograph machine, claiming that they were making the bacteria.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1627" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1200x1627.jpg" alt="The cover page of Spark’s first issue" srcset="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1200x1627.jpg 1200w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-600x814.jpg 600w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-768x1042.jpg 768w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-737x1000.jpg 737w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1133x1536.jpg 1133w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1.jpg 1474w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>The cover page of <em>Spark</em>’s first issue</figcaption></figure>



<p>The two spent eight nights in January 1960 carving the plates by hand — there was no typesetting or other equipment available. The process, though, was too slow. Miao and Xiang would eventually have to open their office, which would endanger the enterprise. As always, Zhang came up with the solution. Inside his tractor shed was an old motor. He gave it to Miao and Xiang, who sold it to their factory cheaply. They used the proceeds to buy a used mimeograph machine. The group kept that at the home of Gu Yan, a graduate student in physics, who lived near Zhang. He also carved essays on that machine’s drums, and drew the magazine’s logo, a torch with a flame leaping upward. They ran off thirty copies. <em>Spark </em>was born.</p>



<p>At just eight pages, handwritten, and with no photos or graphics, Spark was primitive. But it was filled with articles that got to the heart of China’s conundrum — then and now. The lead article on the first page by Gu Yan set the tone. Called “Give Up Your Fantasies and Prepare to Fight!” it asked questions that Chinese people have posed time and again over the decades:</p>



<p>Why did the once progressive Communist Party become so corrupt and reactionary less than ten years after coming to power, with complaints and rebellions at home, and falling into an embarrassing situation abroad? This is because the people’s world is regarded as its private property, and all matters are managed by party members.</p>



<p>One key problem was due to “idol worship” — alluding to the personality cult surrounding Mao Zedong. But it also pointed to broader problems, such as the state’s unlimited powers: “political oligarchs being arrogant, and perverted. If such a dictatorship insists on calling it socialism, it should be a kind of National Socialism monopolized by a political oligopoly. It is of the same type as Nazi National Socialism and has nothing in common with real socialism.”</p>



<p>Writing about the famine, Zhang Chunyuan penned an essay simply titled “Food Matters.” He blamed the Chinese Communist Party for exploiting the farmers: “Today’s ruler, like any ruler in history, used the peasant revolution to climb Tiananmen Square and ascended to the throne.” After that, China’s new rulers trampled on the farmers, leaving them no better than serfs. In another essay, he pointed to the lack of land ownership as a key problem facing farmers.</p>







<p>A few months later, the students met again and decided to make <em>Spark </em>a regular publication. The goal was to mail it to high-level officials in five major cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi’an — where the students had contacts. They began writing more essays, including Zhang Chunyuan’s “On People’s Communes,” which dissected how farmers lost their property, and Xiang Chengjian’s “Letter to the People,” a takedown of top leaders:</p>



<p>When millions, tens of millions of farmers starve to death on their beds, on trains, by railroads, at the bottom of a ditch, when hundreds of millions (400 million) people are dying of starvation, when the other 200 million are half-starved. When they are full, those animals who “wholeheartedly” serve the people and are “people’s servants” can buy any snacks, biscuits, candies. … They feasted and walked away (who would dare to ask them for food stamps), and as soon as they arrived, the meal was served.</p>



<p>Xiang continued in this vein by pointing out the moral relativism of China’s top leaders. Decades before Mao’s private doctor shocked the world with his tales of Mao’s sex with young women, Xiang pointed out the hypocrisy of the older men who led China. While appealing to steadfastness and loyalty, they had taken up with younger women, casting aside their wives who had suffered with them while they were fighting for the revolution. Even worse, information had come to light during the Anti-Rightist Campaign showing that many officials freely took the daughters and wives of persecuted families.</p>



<p>Lin Zhao’s poem “Seagull” was also slotted into this issue. It was engraved onto cylinders in addition to Zhang’s “On People’s Communes.” While they were figuring out the logistics of engraving and then distributing their new issue, they ran off 300 copies of Zhang’s article because of its importance in analyzing the root causes of the famine. The idea was to mail out that article first and follow it up with the full issue.</p>



<p>As the second issue neared publication, the group began to debate what to do next. They decided they needed some sort of organization and ways to spread their appeal beyond the narrow group of exiled students. They also felt that someone had to escape from China and find help, or at least get more information about the situation in other socialist countries, such as Yugoslavia. Maybe this would help their country find a way forward.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The journal’s name was based on the idiomatic expression “a single spark can start a prairie fire,” used by Mao in one of his essays</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Tan Chanxue decided to try to seek help in Hong Kong. She was from Guangzhou, the metropolis not far from the British colony, and she figured she could make her way across the border. The students were some twelve hundred miles away, but China was in such chaos that it wouldn’t appear odd if a university student traveled back to her hometown to find food. So she made her way south by train and stayed with an aunt.</p>



<p>The two women decided to flee together to Hong Kong and hired a human smuggler to spirit them across the border. They dressed as peasant women and walked to a village near the border. The smuggler, however, was inexperienced and led the women straight into the hands of the local militia, who detained them in Shenzhen — back then still a village, and not today’s city of nearly 20 million.</p>



<p>They tried to play the role of peasants, hoping to be let off with a warning for having strayed too close to the border. So when they were allowed out to do manual labor by collecting firewood, the two did so barefoot, although their soft feet were quickly cut by the rough terrain.</p>



<p>Still, no one seemed aware of her true identity until Tan made a fatal mistake. One day, a guard told Tan that if she wanted to post a letter, he would carry it out and post it. She was supposed to be illiterate but decided to use the chance to warn the group around <em>Spark </em>that she had been detained. A few weeks later, she realized her error. She was taken in for interrogation and asked if she knew a man named Gao Chengqing. This was Zhang Chunyuan’s pen name. How did they know about him?</p>



<p>The letter itself wasn’t a trap. It had been delivered, and Zhang had quickly heard that his sweetheart had been detained. He decided to rescue her, just as he had helped out his friend a year earlier. He used the same forged identity card, which gave his identity as his pen name, Gao Chengqing, and traveled south. But the women were being held in a reform-through-labor facility, which was much stricter than the railway police he had fooled before. The prison’s officials immediately saw through his ruse and put him under arrest. Because they didn’t know his real identity, they booked him by his pen name.</p>



<p>Feigning illness, Zhang met a female doctor who was also a prisoner. Feeling he could trust her, he told her that he and Tan were husband and wife and asked her to pass Tan notes. He wrote several, many of them professing his love and hope for a life after imprisonment. He used an intimate form of address, using only the last character of her given name, <em>xue</em>, which means “snow.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Snow! It must be a match made in heaven that we can go to jail together. Our feelings will transcend all time and space. May we go out and in, life and death together! The days to come will be long. Take care!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the doctor wasn’t willing to risk her future for a man she didn’t know. She could gain by informing on him and, anyway, he himself might be a trick to test her. All of Zhang’s love letters ended up in the authorities’ hands.</p>



<p>The authorities sent a political prisoner to live with Zhang in his cell as a spy. The man befriended Zhang, who again fell for the ploy. Zhang confessed everything, not only their hopes to escape but the existence of <em>Spark</em>. Soon, Zhang and Tan were on a train back to Lanzhou for trial.</p>







<p>By September 1960, the magazine was shut down and the case was cracked. In what became the fourth largest “counter-revolutionary” incident in the country, 43 people were arrested in connection with <em>Spark</em>, including 12 university students, two professors, two graduate students, and 25 farmers.</p>



<p>Revenge was swift. The Party convened a “Ten-Thousand-Person Sentencing Conference” in Lanzhou to hand down the sentences to those who were still in Tianshui. Zhang Chunyuan got life in prison. The students who carved the drums, Miao Qingjiu and Xiang Chengjian, got 20 and 18 years. Others got between 15 and five years.</p>



<p>Tan Chanxue spent 14 years in prison for membership in a “Rightist counterrevolutionary clique.” After that, she was forced to take a factory job in Jiuquan, the city near the Jiabiangou labor camp and the satellite launch facility. It was only after her rehabilitation in 1980 that she could leave the factory. She later joined the Dunhuang Research Academy before retiring to Shanghai in 1998. During a trip back to Tianshui in the 1990s, she met people who still knew her case. Once, a woman grasped her hands and said, “You have suffered so!” Tan could only burst into tears.</p>



<p>She was lucky compared to many of the others. The security apparatus quickly picked up those who had fled Gansu. In Shanghai, the physics student Gu Yan, who had come up with the magazine’s name and logo, received a 17-year sentence. The prison term for Lin Zhao, the poet whose work inspired Zhang to launch the journal, was 20.</p>



<p>Many fought their fate, especially Zhang. In July 1961, he feigned illness and was admitted to hospital. During the midday siesta, while everyone was overcome by the summer heat, he changed into street clothes and walked out of the hospital. He hitched a ride to a nearby town, then walked 19 kilometers to a logging camp where a friend worked.</p>



<p>He lived in his friend’s logging hut, regained his strength, and then set off to Shanghai to see what had become of his friends. He found that Gu Yan had already been arrested. Then he went to the neighboring city of Suzhou to learn that Lin Zhao had also been arrested. He wrote her a postcard, signing it with her mother’s name but figuring that she would recognize his handwriting: “Our life is so rich in materials that we could write a novel that hasn’t been seen in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. I hope you can read this book, this book that cost us so dearly.”</p>



<p>Zhang then moved on to the nearby city of Hangzhou, feeling guilty that he was free while his friends were in prison. It’s a measure of the turmoil in China brought on by the famine and political instability that he stayed free for so long. But then the inevitable happened. As the famine was brought under control, the government reasserted itself. Zhang was picked up in a street sweep of homeless people. He was identified and sent back to prison in Lanzhou.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, Tan was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. They risked their lives to prove their feelings</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A few years later, the Communist Party’s next convulsion, the Cultural Revolution, proved deadly for some of those in jail. After a brief period of chaos at the start of the Cultural Revolution, the Party promulgated new rules to “strengthen public security work.” That resulted in harsh crackdowns across the country. Young people were once again sent to remote areas to work. Prisons carried out mass executions of convicts.</p>

<p>In 1970, local authorities in Tianshui decided that the new rules meant that Zhang should be executed on the grounds of being in an “active” counterrevolutionary cell — a capital offense. For a few months before his execution, Zhang and Tan were housed in the same prison. Tan wanted Zhang to know, before his death, that she still loved him. She asked someone who delivered him his meals to tell him that “he will always live in my heart.”</p>



<p>Zhang was sent to the Lanzhou Detention Center to be executed. The prison was nicknamed the “kiln,” a castle-like complex with walls 10 meters high and topped with barbed wire. When he entered his final cell, number 12, he was wearing a black cotton prison shirt and trousers, a black cotton cap, and black cotton shoes without laces. Heavy shackles weighing about fifteen kilograms were attached to his ankles, which were wrapped in cotton to prevent bleeding. His hands were cuffed tight behind his back. He could only clutch his sole belongings, a chipped enamel bowl and cup stuffed with a rolled-up white cotton towel. He could drop his trousers to urinate or defecate but inmates had to help him pull them back up.</p>



<p>The dozen or so prisoners in the room roused themselves to look at the condemned man. He apologized for bothering them and waited politely for someone to make space for him to sit down. The men were dumbfounded and soon made space.</p>



<p>The prisoner in charge of the room was a man named Wang Zhongyi. He had been rounded up in a sweep of young people and charged with hooliganism. Now he was under orders to make sure that Zhang didn’t commit suicide. Over the next three days the men became close and Zhang entrusted Wang with telling Tan how much he loved her.</p>



<p>One of the young men asked Zhang if he was scared. His case was serious, wasn’t it? Zhang replied: “Yes, it’s serious: active counterrevolutionary activity.”</p>



<p>Zhang told the men his life story. Then, on March 22 he was led out to the Qilihe Stadium for a mass sentencing. Before he left, he made Wang promise that somehow, someday, he would find Tan and tell her two sentences: “First, I have a clear conscience toward the Party, the country, and the people, and I’m sorry because I can’t accompany her to finish the road of life. Second, she must live well; the future is bright and boundless!”</p>



<p>Zhang was condemned to death and then taken to Willow Gulley in Donggang Township, where he was shot. After his death, a notice was put up in various prisons around the district. One was Tan’s women’s prison. Tan saw it. Within a month her hair had gone white. ∎</p>







<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>







<p><em>The magazine </em>Spark<em> lasted only a year before it was extinguished. It never circulated nationally. It resulted in no protests or any sort of threat to the government. Over the Chinese Communist Party’s three-quarters of a century in power it is one of countless small acts of outrage against its unchecked powers. And yet, due to case files released in the late 1970s and 1980s, including the love letters between Tan Chanxue and Zhang Chunyuan, the story was preserved. <em>In the 2000s, the underground filmmaker Hu Jie interviewed most of the survivors and in 2013 released online one of his best-known films, </em></em>Spark<em>. Over the past two decades, this story has become a touchstone in Chinese people’s efforts to counter the Party’s efforts to whitewash the past.</em> <em>Read more about it and similar stories in <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sparks-9780197575505?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#">Sparks: China’s Underground Historians and their Battle for the Past</a>.</em></p>

      <p>Thanks to the 2024 Barkley Marathons, “coming down to the last minute” will never sound the same again.</p>
<p>Runners have 60 hours to complete arguably the world’s hardest footrace in Tennessee’s Frozen Head State Park. With less than two minutes to go on Friday afternoon, Jasmin Paris, legs oozing with scrapes and ponytail awry, charged to the fabled yellow gate marking the Barkley Marathons finish and promptly collapsed over it and onto the ground.</p>
<p>She stopped the clock in 59:58:21. And she became first woman to ever finish the infamously grueling race in its 38-year history.</p>

<p>It was a year of historic firsts at the Barkley Marathons. No race is more notoriously impossible to finish. Over the first 37 years, only 17 people had done so. That all changed on March 22, 2024, when an unprecedented five runners completed the race, smashing the record of three set <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/racing/races/2023-barkley-marathons/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>In case that’s not enough, Jared Campbell, who finished in 59:30:32, became the first individual to finish the race four times.</p>
<p>Joining the Class of 2024 Barkley Marathons finishers is Barkley “virgin” Ihor Verys of Ukraine/Canada, who completed the race first in 58:44:59. He was followed by Tennessee’s John Kelly in 59:15:39, who became just the second person after Campbell to earn a third finish. And on his third attempt, Greig Hamilton of New Zealand finished in 59:38:42.</p>
<p>Here’s how these runners survived “the race that eats its young” during 6o of the most iconic hours of ultrarunning history.</p>

<p>Paris, 40, may have found running later in life than some, but she’s made up for lost time—and redefined what’s possible. At her debut at the Barkley Marathons in 2022, <a href="https://run.outsideonline.com/people/jasmin-paris-barkley-marathons/">she completed a “Fun Run”</a> on a year there were no finishers.</p>
<p>She returned to Frozen Head last year and blew ultrarunning fans away by becoming just the second woman ever behind Sue Johnston to start a fourth loop. While she completed the lap, she did so outside of the 48-hour cutoff, ending her Barkley quest.</p>
<p>But Paris entered the 2023 event coming off of a knee injury, which both impeded her training build-up and her ability to run to her potential up and down the insanely steep grades, which go up to a dizzying 40 percent. While that slowed her down, it also stopped her from hanging with fellow participants, including her coach Damian Hall and Kelly, on the descents. All three have cited the critical role that teamwork plays over the first four loops, when runners can help each other navigate to the hidden books that serve as checkpoints, push each other through their lows, and collectively problem-solve on the fly. (It’s every runner for themselves on the fifth loop, which runners start in rotating directions.)</p>
<p>Paris, who juggles being an elite runner with being a mother of two and an animal veterinarian, was not to be stopped this year. She returned to Frozen Head armed with the experience of two “Fun Runs,” as well as a healthy body and an interminable resolve.</p>
<p>When Laz lit the cigarette marking the start at 5:17 A.M. Eastern on Wednesday morning, Paris ran at the front of the pack with the likes of Kelly, Hall, and Verys over the course of the first lap—all three finished within a minute of 8:31 elapsed. Those four continued to work together over the second loop, which took the runners the opposite direction (counterclockwise) through the night before returning to the yellow gate 19:27 into the race.</p>

<p>The pack splintered over the third loop, once again clockwise and into the dawn of the second day. For the second year in a row the infamously fickle weather held off—a boon navigating through the dense underbrush and thick tree cover but also a bane for Paris, who lives in Scotland and is accustomed to inclement weather. The unrelenting sun pushed temperatures up into the 80s on Wednesday and Thursday as Paris and the rest of the remaining runners also started grappling with sleep deprivation and navigating to the hidden books that serve as checkpoints along each loop.</p>
<p>Paris completed her third “Fun Run” (third loop) in 32:15:53, “smiling and looking good,” according to Dunn.</p>
<p>At 3:10 P.M. eastern on Thursday, Dunn <a href="https://twitter.com/keithdunn/status/1770890658175127847">tweeted</a> that eight runners had moved onto loop four—a race record. That bunch included Paris and Campbell, whose quest to break his own Barkley finisher record lived on. While Paris completed loop four 10 minutes back from Campbell, Campbell waited for Paris to start lap five so she could choose her direction.</p>
<p>As the hours ticked off on Friday afternoon, fans frantically refreshing X (formerly Twitter) worried that Paris might run out of time. She was spotted on Rat Jaw with just under three hours left on the clock. Based on Verys’s splits she wouldn’t make it. But Paris found a higher inner resolve and blasted the last third of the course to finish her final lap with a 13:17 split, just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>It’s a poetic ending for the 38 years we’ve all been waiting for a woman to finish this race. Chapeaux, Jasmin.</p>
<h2><b>Jared Campbell Rewrites History, Again</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_2661075"><img data-lazy-load="" decoding="async" data-src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=730" alt="Barkley Marathons" width="2100" height="1400" data-srcset="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=300 300w, https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=768 768w" src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=730"><figcaption><span>Jared Campbell (left) and John Kelly (right) rewrote the books with an unprecedented four and three Barkley Marathons finishes, respectively. </span> (Photo: Howie Stern)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With three finishes under his belt, it may seem like a fourth one was clandestine for Campbell, 44. But his last finish was in 2016, several lifetimes ago in ultrarunning time. But Campbell seems to have raced with the patience of a consummate veteran, biding his time behind the lead pack over the first three loops before surpassing Paris on the fourth.</p>
<p>Some years the race ends at the 48 hour mark with no runners completing a fourth loop. Not this year. At 5:14 A.M. eastern on Friday, Dunn announced that, after Sebastian Raichon began loop five with three minutes to spare, an unprecedented seven runners were on loop five. That included Verys, who set out first in 46:06:32 after 20 minutes in camp (he chose to go clockwise); Kelly (who waited for Verys to start so Verys could choose the direction of his last lap), Hall, Hamilton, Paris, Campbell, and Raichon.</p>
<p>The seven runners who moved onto lap five all completed their fourth loop in under 15 hours, from Kelly’s leading split of 14:10 to Raichon’s 14:49. Five would succeed. Raichon and Hall would eventually turn back and face Taps, played&nbsp;on a bugle trumpet like at a military funeral.</p>
<p>Campbell, meanwhile, continued his upward momentum to finish the race with just under 30 minutes to spare, cementing his spot as the runner with the most finishes ever.</p>
<p>“That new section is brutal. You’re a bad man,” Campbell said to Laz at the finish, <a href="https://x.com/keithdunn/status/1771277977260556593?s=20">according to Dunn</a>.</p>
<p>Kelly, meanwhile, is hot on his heels with his second consecutive finish and third overall in seven tries.</p>

<h2><b>Ihor Verys Channels Ukrainian Strength</b></h2>
<p>A Ukrainian now living in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Verys showed remarkable resolve for a Barkley “virgin” at this masochistic event that leaves runners covered in scrapes from bushwhacking through dense and prickly underbrush, sleep deprived from staying up for nearly 60 hours straight, and physically, mentally, and spiritually depleted from covering about 130 miles and more than 60,000 feet of climbing with no course markings and no GPS devices.</p>
<p>He’s the 18th unique Barkley finisher. Hamilton and Paris make numbers 19 and 20.</p>
<p>Even before Dunn <a href="https://x.com/keithdunn/status/1771285735833817456?s=20">tweeted</a> the race’s closing words, “The 2024 Barkley Marathons has ended. There are five finishers,” the Internet started speculating about what next year would have in store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/racing/races/2023-barkley-marathons/">Last year</a>, Laz told <a href="https://www.trailrunnermag.com/people/news/barkley-marathons-is-underway/">Trail Runner</a> that he “made it easier to assure a finisher.” People on the ground at Frozen Head say that the course changed minimally this year simply because Laz was recovering from heart surgery.</p>
<p>He has an entirely new route planned for 2025. The entrants, meanwhile, have an entirely new understanding of what’s possible.</p>

</div><div>
<p>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</p><p>

Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer, who was by far the most important Lisa implementer, thought that lines of code was a silly measure of software productivity.  He thought his goal was to write as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.</p><p>

He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw's region calculation machinery, and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster.  As a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.</p><p>

He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time to fill out the management form for the first time.  When he got to the lines of code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.</p><p>

I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Takeaways</p><div><br><ul><li>Today, we’re introducing <a href="https://www.projectaria.com/scenescript" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>SceneScript</u></a>, a novel method for reconstructing environments and representing the layout of physical spaces.</li><li>SceneScript was trained in simulation using the Aria Synthetic Environments dataset, which is available for academic use.</li></ul></div><div><p>Imagine a pair of stylish, lightweight glasses that combined contextualized AI with a display that could seamlessly give you access to real-time information when you need it and proactively help you as you go about your day. In order for such a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses to become reality, the system must be able to understand the layout of your physical environment and how the world is shaped in 3D. That understanding would let AR glasses tailor content to you and your individual context, like seamlessly blending a digital overlay with your physical space or giving you turn-by-turn directions to help you navigate unfamiliar locations.</p><p>However, building these 3D scene representations is a complex task. Current MR headsets like Meta Quest 3 create a virtual representation of physical spaces based on raw visual data from cameras or 3D sensors. This raw data is converted into a series of shapes that describe distinct features of the environment, like walls, ceilings, and doors. Typically, these systems rely on pre-defined rules to convert the raw data into shapes. Yet that heuristic approach can often lead to errors, especially in spaces with unique or irregular geometries.</p></div><p>Introducing SceneScript</p><div><p>Today, Reality Labs Research is announcing <a href="https://www.projectaria.com/scenescript" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>SceneScript</u></a>, a novel method of generating scene layouts and representing scenes using language.</p><br></div></div><div><div><p>Rather than using hard-coded rules to convert raw visual data into an approximation of a room’s architectural elements, SceneScript is trained to directly infer a room’s geometry using end-to-end machine learning.</p><p>This results in a representation of physical scenes which is <b><i>compact</i></b>, reducing memory requirements to only a few bytes; <b><i>complete</i></b>, resulting in crisp geometry, similar to scalable vector graphics; and importantly, <b><i>interpretable</i></b>, meaning that we can easily read and edit those representations.</p></div><p>How is SceneScript trained?</p><div><p>Large language models (LLMs) like <a href="https://llama.meta.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama</u></a> operate using a technique called next token prediction, in which the AI model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the words that came before it. For example, if you typed the words, “The cat sat on the...,” the model would predict that the next word is likely to be “mat” or “floor.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>SceneScript leverages the same concept of next token prediction used by LLMs. However, instead of predicting a general language token, the SceneScript model predicts the next architectural token, such as ‘wall’ or ‘door.’</p><p>By giving the network a large amount of training data, the SceneScript model learns how to encode visual data into a fundamental representation of the scene, which it can then decode into language that describes the room layout. This allows SceneScript to interpret and reconstruct complex environments from visual data and create text descriptions that effectively describe the structure of the scenes that it analyzes.</p><p>However, the team required a substantial amount of data to train the network and teach it how physical spaces are typically laid out—and they needed to ensure they were preserving privacy.</p><p>This presented a unique challenge.</p><br></div><p>Training SceneScript in simulation</p><div><p>While LLMs rely on vast amounts of training data that typically comes from a range of publicly available text sources on the web, no such repository of information yet exists for physical spaces at the scale needed for training an end-to-end model. So the Reality Labs Research team had to find another solution.</p><p>Instead of relying on data from physical environments, the SceneScript team created a synthetic dataset of indoor environments, called <a href="https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Aria Synthetic Environments</u></a>. This dataset comprises 100,000 completely unique interior environments, each described using the SceneScript language and paired with a simulated video walking through each scene.</p><p>The video rendered through each scene is simulated using the same sensor characteristics as <a href="https://www.projectaria.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Project Aria</u></a>, Reality Labs Research’s glasses for accelerating AI and ML research. This approach allows the SceneScript model to be completely trained in simulation, under privacy-preserving conditions. The model can then be validated using physical-world footage from Project Aria glasses, confirming the model’s ability to generalize to actual environments.</p></div><div><p>Last year, we made the <a href="https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Aria Synthetic Environments</u></a> dataset available to academic researchers, which we hope will help accelerate public research within this exciting area of study.</p><br></div><p>Extending SceneScript to describe objects, states, and complex geometry</p><div><p>Another of SceneScript’s strengths is its <b><i>extensibility</i></b>.</p><p>Simply by adding a few additional parameters to scene language that describes doors in the Aria Synthetic Environments dataset, the network can be trained to accurately predict the degree to which doors are open or closed in physical environments.</p><p>Additionally, by adding new features to the architectural language, it’s possible to accurately predict the location of objects and—further still—decompose those objects into their constituent parts.</p><p>For example, a sofa could be represented within the SceneScript language as a set of geometric shapes including the cushions, legs, and arms.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://soupault.app/">https://soupault.app/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39796893">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>
     Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a static website generator/framework that works with HTML element trees and can automatically manipulate them. It can be described as a robotic webmaster that can edit HTML pages according to your rules, but doesn’t get tired of editing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can use soupault for making blogs and other types of websites, pretty much like any other SSGs (Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, etc.). However, you can also use it as a post-processor for existing websites — a use case other tools don’t support.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soupault is highly-configurable, extensible, and designed to give you complete control over your website generation process.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are already familiar with other static site generators, check out the <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/comparison/">comparison with Hugo, Zola, and Jekyll</a>. You may also want to read the <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/faq">FAQ</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="quick-start">
     Quick start
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is very simple to <a href="https://soupault.app/install/">install</a>: if you are on Linux (x86-64), macOS, or Microsoft Windows, you can just download an executable.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are starting a blog or an online book, you can grab a ready-to-use <a href="https://soupault.app/blueprints">blueprint</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want to make a custom setup, read a guide to get a feel of soupault’s workflow:

    </ul>
    <h2 id="why-soupault">
     Why soupault?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is not like other static site generators — it works on the HTML element tree level. Most SSGs treat HTML as an opaque format that can be generated with templates but cannot be read or manipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soupault treats HTML as a first-class format and that enables many use cases and features that are impossible for other SSGs.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Store pages in any format
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault works with HTML element trees, so you can store your pages in any format that can be converted to HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can configure HTML conversion commands for different file extensions and soupault will call them automatically when it loads your pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever formats and tools you want to use, you can easily do it. Want to use <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a> for Markdown, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> for reStructuredText, and <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> for AsciiDoc? That’s simple:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[preprocessors]</span>
  <span>md </span><span>=</span> `cmark <span>--</span>unsafe <span>--</span>smart`
  <span>rst </span><span>=</span> `pandoc <span>-</span>f rst <span>-</span>t html`
  <span>adoc </span><span>=</span> `asciidoctor <span>--</span>embedded <span>-</span>o <span>-</span>`
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Or you can write HTML pages by hand if you prefer.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Bring any external tools to your workflow and remove unnecessary client-side JavaScript
    </h3>
    <p>
     A lot of time people add non-interactive client-side JavaScript to compensate for missing features in their SSGs. Soupault helps you keep your pages lighter by pre-rendering HTML with external tools at build time instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the simplest case, you can include the output of an external program in your page, in any location identifiable with a CSS selector.
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[widgets.page-generation-date]</span>
  <span>widget </span><span>=</span> <span>"exec"</span>
  <span>command </span><span>=</span> <span>"date -R"</span>
  <span>selector </span><span>=</span> <span>"datetime#generated-on"</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>
     But you can also <em>pipe</em> element content through an external program and insert the output back. Run code examples through your favorite syntax highlighter, automatically check if they compile — there are many possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is how this website highlights source code in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags with Andre Simon’s <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php">highlight</a>:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span># Runs the content of &lt;* class="language-*"&gt; elements through a syntax highlighter</span>
<span>[widgets.highlight]</span>
  <span>widget </span><span>=</span> <span>"preprocess_element"</span>
  <span>selector </span><span>=</span> '<span>*[</span>class^<span>=</span><span>"language-"</span><span>]</span>'
  <span>command </span><span>=</span> 'highlight <span>-</span>O html <span>-</span>f <span>--</span>syntax<span>=</span>$<span>(</span>echo $ATTR_CLASS | sed <span>-</span>e <span>"s/language-//"</span><span>)</span>'
</code></pre>
    <p>
     With additional scripts you can do much more, for example, <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/static-rendering/#mathematics">render math with KaTeX at build time</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Extract page metadata from HTML, no front matter needed
    </h3>
    <p>
     Most static site generators make you write metadata in the “front matter”, but soupault allows you to extract it right from HTML instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can define a mapping of CSS selectors to metadata fields. This is how you can add a list of all pages to your main page, using the first heading tag (either <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, whichever is present) of the page as its title:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[index]</span>
  <span>index </span><span>=</span> true

<span>[index.fields]</span>
  <span>title </span><span>= {</span> selector <span>= [</span><span>"h1"</span><span>,</span> <span>"h2"</span><span>,</span> <span>"h3"</span><span>] }</span>

<span>[index.views.page-list]</span>
  <span>page </span><span>=</span> <span>"index.html"</span>
  <span>index_selector </span><span>=</span> <span>"main"</span>

  <span>index_template </span><span>=</span> '''
    <span>&lt;</span>h2<span>&gt;</span>All pages<span>&lt;/</span>h2<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul class</span><span>=</span><span>"page-list"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{%</span> for e in entries <span>%}</span>
      <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{e.url}}"</span><span>&gt;{{</span>e.title<span>}}&lt;/</span>a<span>&gt;&lt;/</span>li<span>&gt;</span> 
    <span>{%</span> endfor <span>%}</span>
  '''
</code></pre>
    <h3>
     Take advantage of HTML as a first-class format
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault’s DOM manipulation is as powerful as client-side JavaScript (without interactivity, of course), but the result is a static page.
    </p>
    <p>
     With built-in features, you can automatically create <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#footnotes-widget">two-way footnotes</a>, use a <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#toc-widget">highly-configurable ToC</a>, or <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#absolute-links">add a URL prefix to every link</a>. Most importantly, those features are available regardless of the original page format: whether the HTML was hand-written or produced by a converter, they will work the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     With <a href="https://soupault.app/plugins/">Lua plugins</a> you can do much more than that. You can transform existing HTML, or create a <abbr title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</abbr> from “fake” elements and convert them to real HTML, e.g. create a <a href="https://soupault.app/plugins/#hyperlinked-glossary">hyperlinked glossary</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     The <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#plugin-api">plugin API</a> offers many possibilities, from adding and deleting HTML elements to executing external programs, loading data from JSON/YAML/TOML, and more.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Built to last
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault is available as a statically-linked executable with no dependencies. You can stick with the same version for years if it works for you. Or you can download every new version, try it out, and easily revert back if you run into any issues.
    </p>
    <h2 id="name">
     Why it's named soupault?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Soupault">Philippe Soupault</a>, a French dadaist and surrealist writer, because it’s based on the <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of ’Pataphysics</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_horsing">International Hobby Horsing Association</a>.<a href="#footnote-sponsors"></a>
    </p>
    <h2 id="graphics">

    <p>
     Soupault logo is a stick horse. It’s a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary at a random word and landed on <q>dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse</q>, which is why they named it “dadaism”.

     So far just me, <a href="https://baturin.org/">Daniil Baturin</a>, but everyone is welcome to send a patch/pull request or a suggestion. It has grown out of the bunch of ad hoc scripts that used to power my own website, and then I thought I can as well make it usable for everyone who finds other generators too annoying or too limiting.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><p>The government orders show an "unconstitutional" overreach by the government, multiple privacy experts said.</p><small>AFP via Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure>
<p><abbr>F</abbr>ederal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told <em>Forbes</em> they think the orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects.</p>


<p>In a just-unsealed case from Kentucky reviewed by <em>Forbes</em>, undercover cops sought to identify the individual behind the online moniker “elonmuskwhm,” who they suspect of selling bitcoin for cash, potentially running afoul of money laundering laws and rules around unlicensed money transmitting.</p>

<p>In conversations with the user in early January, undercover agents sent links of YouTube tutorials for mapping via drones and augmented reality software, then asked Google for information on who had viewed the videos, which collectively have been watched over 30,000 times.</p>

<p>The court orders show the government telling Google to provide the names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity for all Google account users who accessed the YouTube videos between January 1 and January 8, 2023. The government also wanted the IP addresses of non-Google account owners who viewed the videos. The cops argued, “There is reason to believe that these records would be relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing identification information about the perpetrators.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The court granted the order and Google was told to keep the request secret until it was unsealed earlier this week, when it was obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. The court records do not show whether or not Google provided data in the case.</p>

<p>In another example, involving an investigation in New Hampshire, the Portsmouth Police received a threat from an unknown male that an explosive had been placed in a trashcan in a public area. The order says that after the police searched the area, they learned they were being watched over a YouTube live stream camera associated with a local business. Federal investigators believe similar events have happened across the U.S., where bomb threats were made and cops watched via YouTube.</p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>They asked Google to provide a list of accounts that “viewed and/or interacted with” eight YouTube live streams and the associated identifying information during specific timeframes. That included a video posted by Boston and Maine Live, which has 130,000 subscribers. Mike McCormack, who set up the company behind the account, IP Time Lapse, said he knew about the order, adding that they related "to swatting incidents directed at the camera views at that time."</p>
<p>Again, it’s unclear whether Google provided the data.</p>
<p>"With all law enforcement demands, we have a rigorous process designed to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement,” said Google spokesperson Matt Bryant. “We examine each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data, including objecting to some demands entirely."</p>
<p>The Justice Department had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Privacy experts said the orders were unconstitutional because they threatened to undo protections in the 1st and 4th Amendments covering free speech and freedom from unreasonable searches. “This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend where we see government agencies increasingly transforming search warrants into digital dragnets. It’s unconstitutional, it’s terrifying and it’s happening every day,” said Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up. I’m horrified that the courts are allowing this.”</p>
<p>He said the orders were “just as chilling” as geofence warrants, where Google has been ordered to provide data on all users in the vicinity of a crime. Google announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" aria-label="an update in December">an update in December</a> that will make it technically impossible for the tech giant to provide information in response to geofence orders. Prior to that, a California court had <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" aria-label="ruled">ruled</a> that a geofence warrant covering several densely-populated areas in Los Angeles was unconstitutional, leading to hopes the courts would stop police seeking the data.</p>
<p>“What we watch online can reveal deeply sensitive information about us—our politics, our passions, our religious beliefs, and much more,” said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It's fair to expect that law enforcement won't have access to that information without probable cause. This order turns that assumption on its head.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>

        <p>Large-scale quantum computers are capable of breaking all of the common forms of
asymmetric cryptography used on the Internet today. Luckily, they don’t exist
yet. The Internet-wide transition to post-quantum cryptography began in 2022
when NIST announced their final candidates for key exchange and signatures in
the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">NIST PQC competition</a>. There is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/">plenty</a>
<a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">written</a> about the <a href="https://durumcrustulum.com/2024/02/24/how-to-hold-kems/">various algorithms</a> and
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig">standardization</a> <a href="https://wiki.ietf.org/group/sec/PQCAgility">processes</a> that are underway.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that it will take a long time to transition to
post-quantum cryptography, so we need to start standardizing and deploying
things <em>now</em>, even though quantum computers are not actually visible on the
horizon. We’ll take the best of what comes out the NIST competitions, and deploy
it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has not been enough discussion about how what NIST has
standardized is simply not good enough to deploy on the public web in most
cases. We need better algorithms. Specifically, we need algorithms that use less
bytes on the wire—a KEM that when embedded in a TLS ClientHello is still under
one MTU, a signature that performs on par with ECDSA that is no larger than
RSA-2048, and a sub-100 byte signature where we can optionally handle a larger
public key.</p>
<p>To understand why, we’ll look at the current state of HTTPS. Cryptography is
primarily used in five ways for HTTPS on the public web:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption/Decryption</strong>: The actual data for HTTP(2) is
transmitted as data inside a TLS connection using some authenticated cipher
(AEAD) such as AES-GCM. This is largely <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/">already secure</a>
against quantum computers.</li>
<li><strong>Key Agreement</strong>: Symmetric cryptography requires a secret key. Key agreement
is the process in which two parties mutually generate a secret key. TLS 1.3
traditionally used Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement. All
non-post-quantum key exchange mechanisms, including Diffie-Hellman, are broken
by quantum computers.</li>
<li><strong>Server Identity</strong>: Servers are authenticated via X.509 certificates. At
minimum, a server certificate (leaf certificate) contains a public key, and a
signature from an intermediate certificate. The intermediate certificate
contains another public key, and a signature from an trusted root certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Issuance Transparency</strong>: The <a href="https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/certificates-explained">public Web PKI</a>
relies on trusted third-parties known as <em>Certification Authorities</em> to validate
domain ownership. Certificates are publicly logged, and servers attest that
their certificates are included in the logs. This provides a deterrent for
malicious certificate issuance, since any certificate that is maliciously issued
to an attacker for some site will be publicly visible, and has the potential to
be detected.  Servers achieve issuance transparency by providing at least two
<em>Signed Certificate Timestamps</em>, usually embedded in the certificate itself.</li>
<li><strong>Handshake Authentication</strong>: The identity of the server needs to be bound to
the connection itself during the TLS handshake. In TLS 1.3, this is provided
by a signature over the server key share message from the key in the server
certificate in the CertificateVerify message.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a threat from <em>future</em> quantum computers to encrypted network
connections <em>today</em> in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">“harvest now, decrypt later”</a> attacks.
To defend against this, we only need to ensure that key agreement and symmetric
encryption are “quantum resistant” (secure in the presence of quantum
computers). Luckily, symmetric encryption is already quantum resistant, and so
defending against harvest-now-decrypt-later only requires updating the key
exchange algorithm to a post-quantum variant.</p>
<p>The remaining uses of cryptography in HTTPS—server identity, issuance
transparency, and handshake authentication—will eventually need to transition
to post-quantum variants. In the current structure of TLS, this means replacing
all signatures with post-quantum variants.  However, the need to do so, while no
less <em>important</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> than transitioning key exchange, is less <em>urgent</em>. This
matches the actions of browsers, who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1827g86/tls_13_hybridized_kyber_support_for_firefox/">actively</a>
<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html">deploying</a> post-quantum key exchange algorithms. An X25519 key
exchange involves the client and server transmitted 32 bytes each. The NIST
winner for key agreement, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd">ML-KEM (Kyber)</a>, involves the client sending
1,184 bytes and the server sending 1,088 bytes.</p>
<p>However, no widely-used browser has started
deploying post-quantum signatures.</p>
<p>This is because post-quantum signatures and their corresponding public keys are
too damn big. There are 5 signatures and 2 public keys transmitted during an
average TLS handshake for HTTPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The leaf certificate has 1 signing public key of the site, and 1 signature
from the intermediate certificate.</li>
<li>The intermediate certificate has 1 signing public key, used to the validate
the signature on the leaf, and 1 signature from the key on the root
certificate, which is used to validate the authenticity of the intermediate
certificate. The root certificate and its embedded public key are
predistributed to clients.</li>
<li>The handshake itself is has 1 signature from the private key corresponding to
the public key in the leaf certificate.</li>
<li>Each Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) contains one signature. The public key used
to the validate the signature is predistributed to clients. Most certificates
have 2 SCTs and therefore 2 additional signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current breakdown of key and signature sizes in TLS is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root certificates often contain RSA keys, as do intermediate certificates.
Root certificates are predistributed, and intermediates are provided by the
server, alongside the leaft certificate. An RSA intermediate certificate has a
4096-bit (512 byte) signature, and a 2048-bit (256 byte) public key.</li>
<li>An ECDSA leaf certificate has a 32-byte key and a 256-byte RSA signature from
the intermediate.</li>
<li>The handshake contains a 64-byte ECDSA signature.</li>
<li>Each SCT contains a 64-byte ECDSA signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, this is 512 + 256 + 256 + 32 + 64 + 2*64 = 1,248 bytes of signatures
and public keys in a normal TLS handshake for HTTPS. Of the winning signature
algorithms from the first NIST PQC competition, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd">ML-DSA (Dilithium)</a> is
the only signature algorithm that could be used in the context of TLS and it has
1,312-byte public keys and 2,420-byte signatures. This means <em>a single ML-DSA
public key is bigger than all of the 5 signatures and 2 public keys currently
transmitted during an HTTPS connection</em>. In a direct “copy-and-replace” of
current signature algorithms with ML-DSA, a TLS handshake would contain 5*2420
+ 2*1312 = 14,724 bytes of signatures and public keys, an over 10x increase.</p>
<p>Barring a large-scale quantum computer staring us in the face, this is not a
tenable amount of data to send simply to <em>open</em> a connection. As a baseline
reality check, we should not be sending over 1% of a 3.5" floppy disk purely in
signatures and public keys.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, for the server-sent messages, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/">Cloudflare
found</a> that every 1K of additional data added to the server response
caused median HTTPS handshake latency increase by around 1.5%. For the
ClientHello, Chrome saw a 4% increase in TLS handshake latency when they
deployed ML-KEM, which takes up approximate 1K of additional space in the
ClientHello. This pushed the size of the ClientHello greater than the standard
maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets on the Internet, ~1400 bytes, causing
the ClientHello to be fragmented over two underlying transport layer (TCP or
UDP) packets<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Assuming ML-KEM is here to stay, this means if we want to keep the total
latency impact of post-quantum cryptography under 10%<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, we need to make all
of the authentication happen in under ~4K of additional bytes in the server
reponse messages. Unfortunately, a <em>single</em> ML-DSA signature/public key pair is
~4K bytes. ML-DSA is too big to deploy to mitigate a threat that does not yet
have a timeline to exist.</p>
<p>There is some good news on the horizon. NIST recognized that the signatures were
quite large, and is running a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig">follow-on competition</a> for
smaller, faster signatures. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/">leaders</a> in that
competition are not quite there yet, but some do have potential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV)</strong>: UOV has big public keys (66K!), but
signatures are 94 bytes, which is on par with the current 64 bytes from an
ECDSA signature in an SCT. The 66K public key size is acceptable because the
public keys for Certificate Transparency logs are predistributed, and there’s
only a small number of logs (~10). UOV is not a solution for root
certificates—there’s too many root certificates and root stores would be too
big to embed in a binary.</li>
<li><strong>SQISign</strong>: SQISign has 64-byte keys and 177-byte signatures. If used for
certificates and the handshake signature, it would be 2*64 + 3*177 = 659
bytes. This is compared to the current RSA+ECDSA approach, which is 4096/8 +
2048/8 + 2048/8 + 32 + 64 = 1,120 bytes. SQISign is a net win (and comparable
to an ECDSA-only chain)! Unforunately, SQISign is incredibly slow. For SQISign
to be feasible, it needs around a 10,000x performance improvement in signing
speed, and a 100x performance improvement in verification.</li>
<li><strong>Mayo</strong>: Mayo is possibly feasible. Mayo1 has 1,168-byte public keys and
321-byte signatures, which makes it a candidate for use in certificates and
for handshake authentication (1168*2 + 321*3 = 3,299 bytes). Mayo2 has 5,488-byte keys, but only 180-byte signatures, which makes it a candidate for SCTs if UOV doesn’t pan out.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a couple other performance knobs we can attempt to tweak, but they all
require larger changes to how HTTPS, TLS, and the Web PKI interact than doing a
straight “copy-and-replace” with PQC algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intermediate elision</strong>: Predistributing known intermediate certificates to
browsers would save ~1.5K bytes for the median intermediate certificate. This
doesn’t fundamentally change any of the feasibility of the NIST candidates, but
it likely helps Mayo stay within bounds of what’s currently feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Merging SCTs and Certificates</strong>: Experimental proposals such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/">Merkle-Tree
Certificates</a> merge the certificate and SCTs into a single object
with a single hash-based proof of authenticity. This would reduce the
handshake to only require a single handshake signature and a single public key
in the merkle-tree certificate, alongside a hash-based inclusion proof.
Unfortunately, it makes some tradeoffs that are likely not feasible for
non-browser applications, such as requiring delayed (hourly) batch issuance,
and requiring clients to be up to date relative to a transparency server.
Solutions in this form may be a performance optimization for browser clients,
but are likely not feasible for non-browser clients. That being said,
handshake latency matters considerably less for non-browser clients.</li>
<li><strong>Shrink the size of the root store</strong>: A post-quantum root store with less
than 10 certificates containing UOV public keys would be within an order of
magnitude of the size of current root stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>All together, this means that combining Mayo and UOV with other changes to the
PKI <em>may</em> be enough to transition to quantum-resistant authentication in the
WebPKI. Unfortunately, all of this armchair design remains subject to several risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance impact might actually be larger than what Cloudflare measured.
Cloudflare’s experiment likely was primarily ideal clients (enterprise users
on desktop) accessing a login page (served by a low-RTT edge server).</li>
<li>The security of Mayo and UOV might not hold. This would not be the first time
a promising post-quantum algorithm <a href="https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/2022/08/11/hot-cryptanalytic-summer-with-steven-galbraith/">turns out to be broken</a>.</li>
<li>10% might be too much of a performance hit unless quantum computers are
immenient.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what can we do to derisk all this? Well, for any solution, we need to get
better a trust anchor agility, intermediate suppresion, and PKI migrations. This
is <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr/">happening already</a>.</p>
<p>The best thing we could do to make the post-quantum transition more feasible is
to come up with better algorithms that have performance characteristics no worse
than RSA-2048. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>A post-quantum KEM that fits in a single MTU when combined with the rest of
the TLS ClientHello</li>
<li>A 10,000x signing speed improvement and 100x verification speed improvement
in SQISign (or a new, equivalent algorithm with these characteristics)</li>
</ol>
<p>To some extent, this may be yelling for the impossible. Unfortunately, using
ML-DSA for the Web PKI in its current form is also impossible.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>A case could be made that the entire quantum threat is not important, but
I’m not here to argue that today. However important the quantum threat is, key
exchange and authentication are just as important—both get broken by the
same large-scale quantum computer. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The same concern applies to the server messages, but since certificates
are already 1.5-2K, we already have a multi-packet reponse size that varies
server to server, so the impact of additional bytes is not directly aligned
with a drastic relative increase in fragmentation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The 10% threshold is somewhat arbitrary and we have some wiggle room. In
reality, it’s very hard to justify nearly any performance hit that is big
enough to impact actual page load metrics or “Core Web Vitals”, such as First
Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint until the threat has much more
clear and present danger. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Though&nbsp;adults tend to look back on youth as a time of innocence, childhood is actually terrifying. Kids are always privy to more of the world’s horrors than we realize, and those glimpses of war on the evening news or the mutilation on display in anti-drunk-driving&nbsp;films leave permanent scars on their&nbsp;permeable little minds.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard Littler had a frightening&nbsp;childhood, too, but as a designer and screenwriter, he turned his memories of life in suburban Britain during the 1970s into a haunting and hilarious&nbsp;<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0091958482/?tag=colleweekl-20" target="_blank">book</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;the fictional dystopian town of Scarfolk. Littler mined the dark side of his childhood to create pamphlets, posters, book covers, album art, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scarfolk-council" target="_blank">audio clips</a>, and television shorts—remnants of life in a paranoid, totalitarian 1970s community, where even babies are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>What started as a handful of faux-vintage images for friends’ birthday cards grew into this&nbsp;universe of fake memorabilia, so complete&nbsp;that the Scarfolk concept&nbsp;was recently optioned for a British TV series.&nbsp;Littler borrows liberally from authentic designs of the era to craft his artfully decaying images, which are so familiar at first glance that many have been mistaken for authentic found objects rather than re-creations.</p>
<p>We recently spoke&nbsp;with&nbsp;Littler about the real-world inspiration for Scarfolk and what we&nbsp;can learn from its language of fear.</p>
<div id="attachment_67384"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1-1024x687.jpg" alt="Top, the cover of a mock-Penguin book on children and hallucinogens.

Above: A page from an outdated Scarfolk tourism brochure.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Where did the concept of Scarfolk come from?</h4>
<p><em>Richard Littler</em>: I initially started Scarfolk because I wanted to capture, or rather investigate, the fading memories of my 1970s and early ’80s British childhood. I suffered from night terrors as a kid, and looking back, I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.</p>
<p>One such memory was of children playing school sports on a railway line: As the children entered a dark tunnel, they’re injured or killed by speeding trains while a brass band played on the embankment. It almost sounds like the plot of a Bunuel film, and for many years I was convinced I had imagined it, especially because everyone I mentioned it to looked at me as if I were insane.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I finally discovered that I hadn’t imagined it—it’s a 1977 public information film called “The Finishing Line,” which was made to deter children from playing near railway lines. The film was screened&nbsp;at my junior school, or around second or third grade in the U.S., where pupils were also shown slide presentations of burn victims to discourage playing with fireworks. “The Finishing Line” caused controversy at the time and was eventually withdrawn. However, its replacement was another violent public information film about a boy called Robbie who loses both legs in a railway accident.</p>
<div id="attachment_67421"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg" alt="Two Scarfolk books aimed at children." width="650" height="469"></a></p><p>Two Scarfolk books aimed at children.</p></div>
<p>In terms of external inspirations, Scarfolk has all sorts of influences, including Monty Python and Terry Gilliam in particular, George Orwell’s and Yevgeny Zamyatin’s dystopias, the political cartoonists Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, music by Boards of Canada and&nbsp;The Beatles (whose work from 1967 on I consider “proto-hauntology”), and even the surreal song introductions during live Peter-Gabriel-era Genesis shows.</p>
<p>The conceit is that Scarfolk can never leave the 1970s, even though the rest of the world passes by normally. Perhaps this happens in a neighboring parallel universe, who knows. In practical terms, it&nbsp;means the present day can occasionally leak into the 1970s and vice versa, which is a way to contrast changes in social attitudes and ideas of the past 40 or 50 years.</p>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Do you think of&nbsp;Scarfolk as an alternate version of your childhood?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is more like a&nbsp;half memory. This means popular or stereotypical imagery from the period is ignored—there are no lava lamps, discos, or garish fashion and interior design. Scarfolk often invokes involuntary memories of long-since forgotten things, which didn’t have a life outside of the period or were taken for granted, like municipal designs, household products, TV station idents, and library music.</p>
<p>The vaguer the memory the better, because it produces this dim&nbsp;sense of recognition, and as you&nbsp;try to piece together the fragments, Scarfolk offers a substitute history. These substitutions are fictional, of course, and sometimes absurdly dark and dystopian.</p>

<p><em>Littler</em>: I don’t know how much of my memories are colored by hindsight, but it certainly seems dark in retrospect. Sometimes it was quite literally dark, as well: I grew up during a time of industrial unrest when the country was subject to power cuts and rationing. There were frequent reports of riots and IRA terrorism in the U.K., some of them relatively close to home. I think that such random events undermine one’s sense of security.</p>
<p>This lack of control also affected another area of culture, the preoccupation with the supernatural and occult. Books about UFOs, ghosts, telekinesis, and witchcraft filled the shelves. There wasn’t any skepticism as far I could tell. It was all delivered as fact; perhaps it was a more gullible time. It was as if the fabric of reality was unstable and a poltergeist or UFO could appear at any time.</p>
<p>The term most often applied to Scarfolk is hauntology, which I hadn’t heard of before I started Scarfolk. Hauntology plays in part with the idea developed by Jacques Derrida (via Karl Marx) of the specter of communism haunting Europe after its demise, but it has become something a bit different in popular culture. It recycles aesthetic forms and reflects the clash between the dreams we had of the future in the 1960s through the 1980s versus where we actually are now. But it also looks back, as did 1970s culture, to earlier periods, like pre-Christian paganism and <a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/victorian-era/overview">Victoriana</a>, for example.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: As a designer, what do you like most about the period’s&nbsp;aesthetic?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I like the clean lines and simple typefaces of modernism, and I’ve come to appreciate the aesthetic of Brutalist architecture. But it’s not just the period design I’m drawn to—I’m also interested in the pre-digital age and the idea that everything from that period is physically decaying.</p>
<p>Digital images don’t fade after being left on a window sill for a few years; they don’t crack or crumble. An image that goes viral on the Internet, for example, is identical no matter how many copies there are of it. In the pre-digital age, two people may have owned the same book or LP, but there would be idiosyncratic differences between the two physical objects.&nbsp;I have a personal response to most of the artifacts I imitate, and I’m lucky that others have had similar responses.</p>
<div id="attachment_67419"><p><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113221/album-covers.jpg" alt="Two of the album covers Littler produced for Scarfolk." width="650" height="319"></p><p>Two of the album covers Littler produced for Scarfolk.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: What’s your typical method for creating Scarfolk graphics?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I have a couple approaches. The first is to scour the Internet or my own books for an image that appeals to me and then improvise an idea around it. I collect digital imagery of the period for reference—my folder of 1970s images has about 20,000 items in it. In terms of physical objects, I don’t actively collect anything, though&nbsp;I own many publications from the period, particularly comics and books.</p>
<p>The second method is to start with an idea, and then go hunting for the appropriate imagery. This is a much harder process, but it’s necessary for posts that are direct comments on contemporary events and recent news.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: Have people mistaken your designs for real artifacts?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I’ve had mails from people telling me they contacted Penguin, the publisher, to ask where they might buy copies of some of the fake Scarfolk books, like “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/02/children-hallucinogens.html" target="_blank">Children and Hallucinogens</a>.” And there are often cases when people believe a Scarfolk post to be genuine, particularly those posts which elicit knee-jerk emotional reactions. Usually these deal with social issues like race, gender, or the treatment of children, and they haven’t taken in enough of the image to realize that it’s parody or satire. Most Scarfolk readers are very playful and like to string people along for as long as they can get away with it.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for “Children &amp; Hallucinogens” and “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/05/the-dont-campaign-and-kak-1973.html" target="_blank">Don’t</a>”&nbsp;because they propelled Scarfolk when I first started the blog, and to date they’re two of the most frequently viewed images. In general, I prefer designs that&nbsp;imitate recognizable period branding, like the Ladybird or Penguin book covers.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: How does Scarfolk reflect contemporary culture?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is paranoid and cynical, and often touches on themes such as surveillance and the diminishment of civil rights. To a certain extent, Scarfolk is speculative because it plays with the recent&nbsp;political developments and either subverts them or exaggerates them to the point of absurdity, though that’s becoming difficult with people like Donald Trump and the incumbent British government. Increasingly, there are official actions and statements that come across like they’ve already been created by satirists. It’s becoming hard for us to outdo our sources!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nfraprado.net/post/vcard-rss-as-an-alternative-to-social-media.html">https://nfraprado.net/post/vcard-rss-as-an-alternative-to-social-media.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39795830">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Last year after talking for a while with someone during a conference they asked
me for my LinkedIn to be able to connect with me, to which I answered I didn't
have one.</p>
<p>It was many years ago when I decided to leave social media. I don't miss it.
Instant messaging allows me to keep in touch with the people that really matter
to me in a much more personal way.</p>
<p>Still, this interaction stayed in the back of my mind. It would indeed be nice
to keep track of these connections too. The people you had an interesting
conversation with for just a few minutes. To be able to check how they're doing
every now and then, who they're working for and what they're hacking on.</p>
<p>Essentially I would like for everyone to have an online profile and feed, which
I could easily check and subscribe to, and that this subscription data could be
stored locally. Why should that be exclusive to social media?</p>
<p>It's not. In fact, the feed part has already been solved for quite a long time
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)">Atom</a>. So by just having the URL for someone's RSS/Atom feed, you can
add it to your feed reader and easily follow the person's updates wherever
they're published to.</p>
<p>The profile part, a place with the key points about a person's current status
(name, photo, location, employer, etc), is the one that has historically been
tied to social media. Personal websites do many times have an "about" page with
such information, but I find the lack of structure makes it way less useful than
a social media's profile.</p>
<p>However, there's actually a widely used open standard for encoding profiles as
well: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard</a>. It's mainly known as the format used on email clients to store
contacts, where they're even synchronized between server and clients using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> protocol. But vCards are also used for contacts in your phone: it's
possible to import and export contacts on iOS and Android using vCards.</p>
<p>So that's when I realized, if there's a widely used open standard for feeds, and
another for profiles, why not join the two? By embedding an RSS/Atom feed URL in
a vCard, it becomes a single file that has all the information needed to
identify a person and follow their updates. Since it's a single file, it's easy
to share it with others as well as store the vCards for all your connections
locally.</p>
<p>Now one interesting bit is that though the profile information on the vCard
might get outdated, there is actually a <code>SOURCE</code> property which is meant to
contain the URL where the latest version of the vCard can be retrieved. So by
hosting your vCard in a public URL, say your personal website, it's possible for
people that have already downloaded it to keep it up to date.</p>
<p>As for how the feed URL can be encoded in the vCard, after skimming over
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350">the latest version of the spec</a>, I originally intended to have it as a plain
<code>URL</code> property. But I wanted the main URL in the vCard to still be the
person's website, so some mechanism would be needed to differentiate between the
two URLs. At first I thought of using a <code>MEDIATYPE</code> parameter in the <code>URL</code>,
but the spec explicitly said that for protocols such as HTTP the
<code>Content-type</code> HTML header should be used instead. However, as it seems,
despite RSS/Atom feeds having standardized media types (<code>application/rss+xml</code>
and <code>application/atom+xml</code> respectively), in practice, <code>text/xml</code> is used
instead. In the end, this means that in order to tell that an URL in the vCard
is for an RSS/Atom feed, the URL would need to be fetched and read. To avoid
that complication, I decided, reluctantly, to use a non-standard property
instead, <code>X-FEED</code>, for the feed.</p>
<div id="trying-it-out">
<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>In order to try the idea out, I created <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/vcard-network">this repository</a> with a couple simple
scripts. First there's a <code>vcard-render</code> script that parses vCards and renders
them using a provided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)">jinja</a> template. The idea is that you can use it to render
your vCard and your connections' vCards in your website for example, which is
exactly what I use it for <a href="https://nfraprado.net/pages/vcard-network.html">in this page I've added to the website</a> (it can be
found from the About page). If you're curious as to how I integrated the script
into my website, see <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/blog/commit/148c9cf31eb10434ba127e94332e51397f18db99">this commit</a>.</p>
<p>The other script is <code>vcard-to-opml</code> which extracts the RSS feed from the
vCards supplied and generates an OPML file with them, which can then be imported
into a feed reader. The idea here is to run this script on the vCards of all the
people you have downloaded (your connections) so you can easily follow their
feeds. I use <a href="https://newsboat.org/">newsboat</a> as my feed reader, so I would add the following command
to a crontab to run it periodically (as soon as I get some real connections!):</p>
<pre>newsboat -i &lt;(awk 1 ~/ark/etc/dav/contacts/5DEB-65D21680-2F1-4AEA3480/* | ./vcard-to-opml.py)
</pre>
<p>Note: <code>awk</code> is used here instead of a simple <code>cat</code> because apparently those
vCards don't have a newline at the end of the file. I'm not sure if it's my
email provider's fault, where I store my vCards, or <a href="http://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/">vdirsyncer</a>'s fault, which
is the program I use to have a local copy of my vCards.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're interested in trying out using vCards and RSS to connect to people as
well, check out the <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/vcard-network">repository</a> that contains those scripts. And feel free to
reach out if you do so, you can find my email on... you guessed it, my vCard 😉.</p>
<p>Even if no one ever uses this, at least I now have a proper answer for the next
person that asks for my LinkedIn. "Just scan this QR code and you'll see my
profile" 🙂.</p>
