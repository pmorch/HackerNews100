Five years later, here we go again. </p><p> Before the delisting, EQT Private Equity plans to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to SUSE’s remaining shareholders. Marcel has committed to pay a price of EUR 16.00 per SUSE share, less the gross amount per share of an interim dividend paid by SUSE. This represents a 67% premium on SUSE’s closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023. </p><p> Both SUSE’s Management and Supervisory Boards have expressed support for the strategic opportunity presented by this delisting. They believe that it will enable SUSE to concentrate on its operational priorities and the execution of its long-term strategy without the pressure of public markets. </p><p> To facilitate the transaction, SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel, which includes provisions for paying the interim dividend. This interim dividend, to be paid to all shareholders before the settlement of the offer, will assist Marcel in financing its purchase of SUSE shares under the offer and covering specific transaction costs. </p><p> “The strategic opportunity of taking the company private gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “Our partnership with EQT Private Equity in a private setting has been fruitful before, and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration.” </p><p> The offer document will be published by Marcel soon, initiating an acceptance period of at least four weeks. Settlement of the offer is anticipated to occur in the first half of October 2023. Subsequently, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE is expected to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Afterward, the company will be taken private. </p><p> Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE is committed to declaring and paying an interim dividend to all shareholders, regardless of whether they accept the offer. This dividend will be funded through a combination of SUSE’s existing cash and additional borrowing, which is not expected to exceed EUR 500 million. </p><p> There is, however, no obligation for shareholders to accept the offer. EQT Private Equity assures stock owners that it won't pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders desiring to remain invested in SUSE in its new private setting will have the option to do so. </p><p> As usual, this transaction is subject to various conditions, including receipt by Marcel of an interim dividend for the SUSE shares held by it, which must be sufficient to fund the offer price for all tendered SUSE shares and certain transaction costs. </p><p> Considering the nature of the deal and Marcel's dominating stock position, I've no doubt this deal will go through. What that will mean for SUSE remains to be seen. I will say, though, that SUSE manages to keep going despite one ownership and management change after another. I'm sure it will make it through this one too. </p><p><span><b>Noteworthy Linux and open-source stories:</b></span></p><div><ul><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.36u8QeHTpms79eRxuzldUGjekXgqZX43BE6CK926niI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">New CrossOver 23 out for better Windows gameplay on MacOS, ChromeOS, and Linux</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RoZW5ld3N0YWNrLmlvL2hhc2hpY29ycC1hYmFuZG9ucy1vcGVuLXNvdXJjZS1mb3ItYnVzaW5lc3Mtc291cmNlLWxpY2Vuc2UvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9b3BlbnNvdXJjZXdhdGNoLmJlZWhpaXYuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXN1c2UtdG8tZ28tcHJpdmF0ZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI5NjMxMjQ2My02MWNmLTQwYzQtOWViYS1iNTgwNzc4NzU1OTkiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjQ3OWM2ZjA2LTE3NWUtNGU5My05ZGE4LTEzZGI5M2I1NTkyMyIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZGYzNzA4MmYtNjg4OS00MDZjLTk5YTAtZjc0NGQwZjI0ZmYzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjkyMzIwNDAzLjU0OCwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.fRcjTQH7H0GScCXWH8-0F_qDYl-E7NFNW9-wgvBGvMU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">HashiCorp Abandons Open Source for Business Source License</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.wKzq21AH1HBh4UQCvtoESpg5V81wvizO94wN5BeCTpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AMD and Intel CPU security bugs bring Linux patches</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>
      
      Oxalate nephropathy is an uncommon condition that causes acute kidney injury with the potential for progression to end-stage renal disease. Diagnosis is based on the kidney biopsy findings of abundant polarizable calcium oxalate crystals in the epithelium and lumen of renal tubules. We report a case of acute oxalate nephropathy in a 65-year-old woman, temporally associated with the consumption of an oxalate-rich green smoothie juice "cleanse" prepared from juicing oxalate-rich green leafy vegetables and fruits. Predisposing factors included a remote history of gastric bypass and recent prolonged antibiotic therapy. She had normal kidney function before using the cleanse and developed acute kidney injury that progressed to end-stage renal disease. Consumption of such juice cleanses increases oxalate absorption, causing hyperoxaluria and acute oxalate nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors. Given the increasing popularity of juice cleanses, it is important that both patients and physicians have greater awareness of the potential for acute oxalate nephropathy in susceptible individuals with risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, gastric bypass, and antibiotic use.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT shows a significant and systemic left-wing bias, according to a new study by the University of East Anglia (UEA).</p><div><p> The team of researchers in the UK and Brazil developed a rigorous new method to check for political bias.</p><p>  Published today in the journal Public Choice, the findings show that ChatGPT’s responses favour the Democrats in the US, the Labour Party in the UK, and in Brazil President Lula da Silva of the Workers’ Party.</p><p>  Concerns of an inbuilt political bias in ChatGPT have been raised previously but this is the first largescale study using a consistent, evidenced-based analysis.</p><p>  Lead author <a href="https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/fabio-motoki" target="_blank">Dr Fabio Motoki</a>, of <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/norwich-business-school" target="_blank">Norwich Business School</a> at the University of East Anglia, said: “With the growing use by the public of AI-powered systems to find out facts and create new content, it is important that the output of popular platforms such as ChatGPT is as impartial as possible.</p><p>  “The presence of political bias can influence user views and has potential implications for political and electoral processes.</p><p>  “Our findings reinforce concerns that AI systems could replicate, or even amplify, existing challenges posed by the Internet and social media.”</p><p>  The researchers developed an innovative new method to test for ChatGPT’s political neutrality.</p><p>  The platform was asked to impersonate individuals from across the political spectrum while answering a series of more than 60 ideological questions.</p><p>  The responses were then compared with the platform’s default answers to the same set of questions – allowing the researchers to measure the degree to which ChatGPT’s responses were associated with a particular political stance.</p><p>  To overcome difficulties caused by the inherent randomness of ‘large language models’ that power AI platforms such as ChatGPT, each question was asked 100 times and the different responses collected. These multiple responses were then put through a 1000-repetition ‘bootstrap’ (a method of re-sampling the original data) to further increase the reliability of the inferences drawn from the generated text.</p><p>  “We created this procedure because conducting a single round of testing is not enough,” said co-author Victor Rodrigues. “Due to the model’s randomness, even when impersonating a Democrat, sometimes ChatGPT answers would lean towards the right of the political spectrum.”</p><p>  A number of further tests were undertaken to ensure the method was as rigorous as possible. In a ‘dose-response test’ ChatGPT was asked to impersonate radical political positions. In a ‘placebo test’ it was asked politically-neutral questions. And in a ‘profession-politics alignment test’ it was asked to impersonate different types of professionals.</p><p>  “We hope that our method will aid scrutiny and regulation of these rapidly developing technologies,” said co-author Dr Pinho Neto. “By enabling the detection and correction of LLM biases, we aim to promote transparency, accountability, and public trust in this technology,” he added.</p><p>  The unique new analysis tool created by the project would be freely available and relatively simple for members of the public to use, thereby “democratising oversight,” said Dr Motoki. As well as checking for political bias, the tool can be used to measure other types of biases in ChatGPT’s responses.</p><p>  While the research project did not set out to determine the reasons for the political bias, the findings did point towards two potential sources.</p><p>  The first was the training dataset – which may have biases within it, or added to it by the human developers, which the developers’ ‘cleaning’ procedure had failed to remove. The second potential source was the algorithm itself, which may be amplifying existing biases in the training data.</p><p>  The research was undertaken by Dr Fabio Motoki (Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia), Dr Valdemar Pinho Neto (EPGE Brazilian School of Economics and Finance - FGV EPGE, and Center for Empirical Studies in Economics - FGV CESE), and Victor Rodrigues (Nova Educação).</p><p>  ‘More Human than Human: Measuring ChatGPT Political Bias’ is published by Public Choice.&nbsp;</p><p>  This publication is based on research carried out in Spring 2023 using version 3.5 of ChatGPT and questions devised by The Political Compass.</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>This is based on an internal quip doc I wrote up about careful communication in the context of rebuilding trust. I got a couple requests to turn it into a blog post for sharing purposes; here you go.🌈✨🥂</p>
<p>In this doc I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/cyen">Christine</a>, my wonderful, brilliant cofounder and CEO, and the time (years ago) when our relationship had broken down completely, forcing us to rebuild our trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>(Cofounder relationships can be hard. They are a lot like marriages; in their difficulty and intensity, yes, but also in that when you’re doing it with the right person, it’s all worth it. 💜)</p>
<h3>Tips for Careful Communication</h3>
<p>When a relationship has very little trust, you tend to interpret everything someone says in the worst possible light, or you may hear hostility, contempt, or dismissiveness where none exists. On the other side of the exchange, the conversation becomes a minefield, where it feels like everything you say gets misinterpreted or turned against you no matter how careful you are trying to be. This can turn into a death spiral of trust where every interaction ends up with each of you hardening against each other a little more and filing away ever more wounds and slights. 💔</p>
<p>Yet you HAVE to communicate in order to work together! You <i>have</i> to be able to ask for things and give feedback.</p>
<p>The way trust gets rebuilt is by ✨small, positive interactions✨. If you’re in a trust hole, you can’t hear them clearly, and they can’t hear you (or your intent) clearly. So you have to bend over backwards to overcommunicate and overcompensate.</p>
<p>There are lots of books out there on how to talk about hard topics. (We actually include a copy of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822">Crucial Conversations</a>” in every new employee packet.) They are all pretty darn cheesy, but it’s worth reading at least one of them.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try and cover all of that territory. What follows is a very subjective list of tactics that worked for Christine and me when we were digging our way out of a massive trust deficit. Power dynamics can admittedly make things more difficult, but the mechanics are the same.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge it is hard beforehand:</h3>
<p>“I want to say something, but I am having a hard time with it.”<br>
“I have something to say, but I don’t know how you’ll take it.”<br>
“I need to tell you something and I am anxious about your reaction.”</p>
<p>What this does: forces you to slow down and be intentional about the words you’re going to use. It gives the other person a heads up that this was hard for you to say. Most of all, it shows that you <em>do care</em> about their feelings, and <em>are trying</em> to do your best for them (even if you whiff the landing).</p>
<h3>… or check in afterwards.</h3>
<p>“I’m not sure how that came across. Is there a better way I could have phrased it?”<br>
“In my head that sounded like a compliment…how did you hear it?”<br>
“Did that sound overly critical? I’m not trying to dwell on the past, but I could use your help in figuring out a better way.”</p>
<p>It’s okay if it’s minutes or hours or days later; if it’s still eating at you, ✨<i>clear the fucking air</i>.✨</p>
<h3>Speak tentatively.</h3>
<p>“Speak tentatively” is the exact opposite of the advice that people (especially women) tend to get in business. But it’s actually super helpful when the relationship is frayed because you are explicitly allowing that they may have a different perception, and making it safer to share it.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, it looks like these results might be missing some data… do you see the same thing?” opens the door for a friendly conversation based on concrete outcomes, whereas “You’re missing data” might sound accusatory and trigger fear and defensiveness.</p>
<h3>Try to sound friendly.</h3>
<p>Say “please” and “thank you” a lot. Add buffer words like “Hey there”, or “Good morning!” or “lol”. Even just using 🌱emojis🍃 will soften your response to an almost unsettling degree. This may seem almost insultingly simple, but it works. When trust is low, the lack of frills can easily be read as brusque or rude.</p>
<h3>Take a breath.</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a physical panic response (sweating, heart racing, etc), announce that you need a few minutes before responding. Compose yourself. Firing off a reply while you are in fight-or-flight mode <em>reliably</em> leads to unintentional escalations.</p>
<p>If you need to take a few beats to read and process, <em>take the time</em>. But empty silence can also generate anxiety 🙂 so maybe say <i>something</i> to indicate “I’m listening, but I need a minute to absorb what you said”, or “I’m still processing”. (We often use “whoa…” as shorthand for this.)</p>
<p>(Alternately, if you find yourself <b>really pissed</b>, “whoa” becomes a great placeholder for yourself to get yourself under control 😬 before saying something you’ll regret having to deal with later.)</p>
<h3>“The story in my head”.</h3>
<p>When you are in a state where you are assuming the worst of someone and reading hostile intent into their words or actions, try to check yourself on those assumptions.</p>
<p>Repeat the words or behaviors back to them along with your interpretation, like: “The story in my head is that you asked me to send that status email because you don’t trust me to have done the work, or maybe even gathering evidence that I am not performing for a PIP.” This gives them the opportunity to reply and clarify what they actually meant.</p>
<h3>Engineer positive interactions, <span>even if</span> you have to invent them.</h3>
<p>Relationship experts say that there’s a magic ratio for happy, healthy relationships, which is at least<b>&nbsp;five positive interactions </b>for every<b> one negative interaction</b>. If you only interact with the people you have difficult relationships when you have something difficult to say, you are <em>always going to dread it</em>. Forever.</p>
<p>It might seem artificial at first, but look for chances to have any sort of positive interactions, and <em>seize them</em>.</p>
<h3>Communicate positive intent.</h3>
<p>In a low trust environment, you can assume everything you say will be read with a voice that is menacing, dismissive or sneering. It behooves you to pay extra attention to tone and voice, and to add extra words that overcommunicate your intended meaning. A neutral statement like “That number seems low”, or “Why is that number low?” will come out sounding brusque and accusatory, e.g. <i>why isn’t that number growing? it’s your fault, you should know this, I blame you, you’re bad at your job.</i> Not might: <i>it will</i>. Try to immunize your communication from distortion by saying things like,</p>
<p>“Hey, I know this just got dropped in your lap, but do you have any idea why this number is so low?”<br>
“This number seems lower than usual. I’m wondering if it’s due to this other thing we tried. Do you have any better ideas?”<br>
“I know it isn’t exactly in your wheel house, but can you help me understand this?”<br>
“I’m new to this system and still trying to figure out how it works. Should this number be going down like this?”</p>
<p>It may seem excessive and time consuming, but it will save you time and effort overall because you will have fewer miscommunications to debug. ☺️</p>
<h3>Give people the opening&nbsp;to do better.</h3>
<p>We tend to make up our minds about people very quickly, and see them through that lens from then on. It takes work to open our selves up again.</p>
<p>“Assume positive intent” is a laudable goal, but in practice falls short. If every word someone says sounds accusatory or patronizing to you, what are you supposed to do with that advice? Just pretend you don’t hear it, or tell yourself they mean well? That’s not sustainable; your anger will only build up.</p>
<p>But if you can hold just enough space for the idea that they <i>might</i> mean well, then you can give them the opportunity to clarify (and hopefully use different words next time). Like,</p>
<p>Person A: “Why is that number low?”<br>
Person B: “I’m not sure.”<br>
(pause)<br>
Person B: “…. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but the story in my head is that you think owning that number is part of my job, and now you’re upset with me, or you think I’m incompetent at my job.”<br>
Person A: “OMG no, not at all. I’m just trying to figure out who understands this part of the system, since it seems like none of us do! 😃 Sorry for stressing you out!”</p>
<p>and maybe next time it will start off like…</p>
<p>Person A: “Hey, do you have any idea why this number is low? It’s a mystery … nobody I’ve talked to yet seems to know.” 🙂</p>
<h3>Remember the handicaps, value the effort.</h3>
<p>Ever meet someone you didn’t like online, and realize they’re terrific in person? Online communication loses sooooo much in transit. Christine and I know each other extremely well, and <i>still</i> sometimes we realize we’re reading way too much into each other’s written words. That’s when we try to remember to move it to “mouth words”, aka zoom or phone. Not as good as in person, but eons better than text.</p>
<p>Once you’ve met someone in person, it’s usually easier to read their written words in their voice, too.</p>
<p>Some people just aren’t great at written communication. Some people have neurodiversities that make it difficult for them to hear tone. Some people have English as a second language. And so on. Do give points for effort; if they’re trying, obviously, they care about your experience.</p>
<p>To the best of your ability, try to resist reading layers of meaning into textual communication; keep it simple, overcommunicate intent, and <i>ask for clarity</i>. And if someone is asking you for clarity, <i>help them do a better job for you.</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE®, </span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>the company behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher and NeuVector and a global leader in enterprise open source solutions, is announcing that its majority shareholder </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel) </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>intends to take the company private by delisting it from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange via a merger into an unlisted Luxembourg entity in the legal form of an S.A.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>Marcel</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>, a holding company that is legally controlled by fund entities of the EQT VIII fund (referred to herein, together with Marcel, as EQT Private Equity), which in turn are managed and legally controlled by affiliates of EQT AB with its registered seat in Stockholm, Sweden, holds approximately 79% of the shares in SUSE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity has announced its intention to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to the other shareholders of SUSE (Offer) to buy their shares prior to the delisting. The offer price per SUSE share to be paid by Marcel will be EUR 16.00 less the gross amount per SUSE share of an interim dividend to be paid by SUSE to all shareholders. EUR 16.00 represents a premium of approximately 67 percent on the XETRA closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>SUSE’s Management Board and Supervisory Board support the strategic opportunity from delisting of the company</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> as it will allow SUSE to focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy. To this end SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel to facilitate the transaction, including through paying the interim dividend. The interim dividend will be paid to all shareholders prior to the settlement of the Offer and will allow Marcel to finance its purchase of SUSE shares under the Offer and certain transaction costs incurred by it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend amount (and therefore the offer price) will only be determined after the end of the acceptance period based on the acceptance ratio for the Offer. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>has underscored its commitment to supporting the company strategically and financially, and to co-operate closely with SUSE’s CEO and his leadership team.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I believe in the strategic opportunity of taking the company private – it gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “EQT Private Equity’s and SUSE’s partnership in a private setting has been fruitful before and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration”.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction timetable:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The offer document for the Offer will be published by Marcel in due course, followed by an acceptance period of at least four weeks. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Settlement of the Offer is expected to occur in the first half of October 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Following the settlement of the Offer, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 will resolve on SUSE’s merger with an unlisted Luxembourg entity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This will result in SUSE’s delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction structure: </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE has entered into a TFA with Marcel.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE has committed to declare and pay an interim dividend to all shareholders irrespective of whether they accept the Offer or not. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend per SUSE share will be determined and is payable after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The payment of the interim dividend will be funded by SUSE through a combination of existing cash and additional borrowing. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any additional borrowing will be in the form of loans taken out by companies of the SUSE group to a maximum of EUR 500 million. The amount of the loans taken out will only be determined after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is no obligation for shareholders to accept the Offer. EQT Private Equity does not intend to pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders who wish to stay invested in SUSE in a private setting may do so.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>For illustrative purposes, the table below sets out the gross interim dividend amount per share and other key parameters for different hypothetical acceptance ratios</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> based on the current number of outstanding SUSE shares.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>I have struggled, literally for years, with Quicken being dog slow to start. It could take 30+ seconds to start. From what I could remember, this problem has existed since I first installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>There were some other other small applications that were also doggedly slow to start. Further, changing font properties of a task in outlook was very slow too. It could take 10+ seconds for the font-properties window to fully populate. THAT should have been my clue as to the problem, but sadly I didn’t yet put 2+2 together.</p>
<p>To compound the problem, once quicken and the other apps were started the first time, they would restart fast for quite some time. You had to walk away from the computer for several hours before the problem would appear again.</p>
<p>I just accepted that Win10 was a pile of crap which, based on past versions of Windows, was a reasonable explanation. Another irritating Windows problem I just had to live with it.</p>
<p>Several years later, I had to make an extended road trip so I loaded my Win10 laptop up with Quicken, Outlook, and the various apps I have to use daily. Lo and behold Quicken started fast EVERY time, every day. OK, I realized the problem wasn’t just Win10 but something about that PC as well.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Aug 2021, I sat down and tried to figure out exactly what the issue was. Looking at my notes from those days, I tried re-installing quicken, experimenting with DNS servers, capturing network packets, monitoring it with process hacker, playing with virus scanner settings. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I went so far as to use procmon to carefully monitor all of the events generated by quicken. Procmon said quicken would spend 30 seconds opening every font I had. And I have a lot. It made no sense that quicken was messing with fonts at startup and the only thing I could see to do was not virus scan those files as they were read, but that made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought I might try to uninstall some of the many fonts in c:\windows\fonts only to find they all seemed to be ‘system’ fonts and I couldn’t uninstall them. That was 2 years ago, and I don’t recall exactly why I gave up on the font idea except I do recall finding it ridiculous the size and count of all of the required ‘system’ fonts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was out of ideas and my final ‘solution’ was to put quicken into task scheduler so it would start first thing in the morning so when I sat down to use it, it would be ready to go.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I was playing with Office Libre fonts and one of MY fonts was not in c:\windows\fonts. Perplexing because I know I was using it. I found it in C:\Users\dan\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts.</p>
<p>AHA! That’s new. A quick check of an old Win7 system I have and sure enough there is no such directory in Win7. Evidently all user fonts for Win10 get installed into that new directory. Ugh!!</p>
<p>Sure enough I have almost 900 files in that directory. Way back when, I used to do a lot of design work which required a lot of fonts. Those days are long gone, but when I install a new PC, I just copy all of my fonts over because I really don’t know which ones I may want in the future.</p>
<p>My first plan was to copy that fonts folder and then delete most of the user fonts to see if performance would be affected. Well, that failed immediately. Even though they are supposedly personal fonts, like the system fonts, I couldn’t delete most of the ones that I tried.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than screw around with Windows restrictions any longer, I booted the system under Linux using a thumb drive. In Linux it was simple to rename the user fonts directory to fonts-old.</strong></p>
<p>I then rebooted the PC under windows. Removing the fonts directory had no severe side effect. For the past 2 weeks, I have been monitoring performance and quicken is very fast. On an unloaded system it will start in about 5 seconds. That is what I would expect. Small apps I had problems with have all started equally fast. And changing fonts in outlook is fast again.</p>
<p>When I stumble onto a font I need (I have learned to make do almost entirely with Georgia and Helvetica now) I just “install” it by copying it from fonts-old into the normal fonts folder. The PC asks if I want to replace existing fonts and after I say yes, the fonts show up in the user font directory.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why Quicken and a handful of apps needs to scan every installed font on the system. I suspect those programmers are just calling some black-box windows function and that is really where the problem lies. It seems like the ONLY time all fonts should be scanned is when I bring up a font dialog box (like the issue in outlook). But I no longer need 900 font files, so this solution works for me!</p>

Regardless of any disagreements, it was always a pleasure to communicate with you.
<br>I believe you've always done a stellar job being friendly and patient with everyone,
<br>trying to reconcile disagreements.  When ever that didn't work, it was certainly not
<br>your fault; I hope everyone can at least agree on that. :-)

<br>I feel for your disappointment of giving up on something you have put so much effort in:
<br>It was a noble effort, and we have all learned a lot. If nothing else,
<br>you can take well-deserved satisfaction in shepherding R7RS-small.  Thank you.

<br>&gt;&gt; years.&nbsp; It has been a great pleasure to be part of the process&nbsp;that 
<br>&gt;&gt; you have so ably led.&nbsp; Your vast knowledge of the topics of Scheme 
<br>&gt;&gt; standardization, Scheme history, the details of various 
<br>&gt;&gt; implementations; your prodigious output of SRFIs and other proposals; 
<br>&gt;&gt; the friendly, open, and fair manner in which you have run the process; 
<br>&gt;&gt; and the improvements in our collective vocabulary just from reading 
<br>&gt;&gt; your messages have all been impressive to behold.
</p><p>
&gt; I spite of my expressed concerns about R7RS-large, I fully agree with 
<br>&gt; what Arthur has written above.
<br>&gt; I feel for your disappointment of giving up on something you have put so 
<br>&gt; much effort in:
<br>&gt; It was a noble effort, and we have all learned a lot. If nothing else,
<br>&gt; you can take well-deserved satisfaction in shepherding R7RS-small.  
<br>&gt; Thank you.
</p></div><p>Agreed on all counts.
</p><p>
When I came on the scene the default attitude among schemers was to have 
<br>endless turf wars about which implementation is 15% sparklier than 
<br>another. John's example in particular stood out like a lighthouse above 
<br>these rough seas. Instead of infighting, you have always been a tireless 
<br>champion of improving the whole. That's what it's all about. At the end 
<br>of the day, what's of value to humanity is a better overall language 
<br>with less friction and you have been working on exactly that.
</p><p>
Thank you in particular for giving new generations of schemers a chance 
<br>at a point when many old timers have given up hope that things will ever 
<br>improve. We will try our best to continue on the path you have laid, and 
<br>look forward to your participation should you find the time and energy 
<br>to make more contributions. Your massive knowledge base covering any 
<br>number of topics with precise recall has been an invaluable help on more 
<br>occasions than I can count.
</p><p>
I apologize for the unpleasant exchanges on R7RS-large. I would never 
<br>judge a project so harshly if it were not laying claim to the name of 
<br>Scheme. I am motivated by a sincere worry that the R6/R7 split will turn 
<br>into an R7/R8 split, and have tried my best to exhaust the polite 
<br>avenues for expressing that concern. I agree that a huge library is a 
<br>desirable thing and would be happy to see that goal come about through a 
<br>process fit for the purpose.

</p><p>
I guess the status of WG2 is up in the air right now, and that it is up 
to the Steering Committee to decide what to do. In the event that they 
don't decide to wind the working group up, I hope that they give it some 
direction, perhaps by asking for a detailed plan of work to be produced 
within a set time after agreeing to continue the WG and naming a new 
Chair. I would hope that, with some degree of focus demanded of us, we 
can produce something worthwhile.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/">https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37164173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"><p><strong>YOLO-Driven Development Manifesto</strong></p>

<p><em>You Only Launch Once!</em></p>

<p>We, the fearless proponents of YOLO-Driven Development, in the pursuit of breaking all the rules and embracing chaos, proudly present this manifesto. We recognize that traditional software development methodologies have their merits, but we believe in a more exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping approach to creating software. YOLO-Driven Development is not for the faint of heart; it’s for those who thrive on uncertainty, spontaneity, and a dash of recklessness. We hereby declare our commitment to the following principles:</p>

<p><strong>1. Embrace the Unknown</strong></p>

<p>Why waste time on planning, analysis, and careful consideration? YOLO-Driven Development thrives in the realm of ambiguity. Jump headfirst into coding without any clear understanding of the requirements. You’ll be amazed at the creative solutions you’ll conjure when you’re under the gun!</p>

<p><strong>2. All Nighters over All Sprints</strong></p>

<p>Who needs sleep when you have a looming deadline? Forget about the delicate balance between work and personal life. YOLO-Driven Development encourages marathon coding sessions fueled by caffeine and sheer determination. Burnout is for the weak!</p>

<p><strong>3. Code First, Test… Maybe Later</strong></p>

<p>Testing? Pfft, that’s so last-century. YOLO-Driven Development dictates that you write code like your life depends on it and only consider testing when the application crashes in spectacular fashion. It’s not a bug; it’s a feature waiting to be discovered!</p>

<p><strong>4. Duct Tape and WD-40 Are Your Allies</strong></p>

<p>Complex problems require ingenious solutions. In YOLO-Driven Development, you’ll master the art of duct-tape programming and WD-40 debugging. Your codebase will be a monument to human ingenuity, even if it’s held together with virtual spit and glue.</p>

<p><strong>5. Scope Creep is Your Muse</strong></p>

<p>Fixed scope? Nah, we prefer the thrill of never-ending scope creep. YOLO-Driven Development invites you to chase after ever-evolving requirements. Who cares about deadlines when you can chase the elusive perfection that is perpetually just around the corner?</p>

<p><strong>6. No Documentation, No Problem</strong></p>

<p>Who needs documentation when you have the power of intuition? YOLO-Driven Development encourages you to keep your genius solutions locked away in your head. After all, real developers don’t read documentation; they conjure it from thin air.</p>

<p><strong>7. Collaborative Chaos</strong></p>

<p>Teamwork? Sure, but let’s kick it up a notch. In YOLO-Driven Development, collaboration is an exercise in controlled chaos. Rally your teammates with the shared goal of adding more unpredictability to the mix. Assign tasks on a whim, switch roles randomly, and merge code without warning. The resulting blend of ideas and styles will surely keep everyone on their toes, and who knows, you might just stumble upon brilliance amidst the pandemonium!</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion, YOLO-Driven Development is not for everyone. It’s a high-stakes game where the only certainty is uncertainty. But for those who dare to embrace the chaos, who scoff at conventional wisdom, and who thrive on the thrill of code that could crash at any moment, YOLO-Driven Development offers a wild ride that you’ll never forget… if you survive it!</p>

The study was published on 16 August in <i>Nature. </i></p><h2>Young blood, old brains</h2><p>About a decade ago, scientists discovered that blood from young mice could restore youthful properties, including learning abilities, in older mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.

 </article><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that PF4 might be one of these components, including the fact that young mice have higher levels of this molecule in their blood than do older mice. Villeda and his colleagues tried injecting PF4 into aged mice without including other blood components. The researchers found that the ratios of various types of immune cells shifted to become more similar to what is typically seen in younger mice. Some immune cells also reverted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression.</p><p>Although PF4 was not able to cross the blood–brain barrier, its effects on the immune system also led to changes in the brain, probably through indirect mechanisms. Old mice that received doses of PF4 showed decreases in damaging inflammation in the hippocampus — a part of the brain that’s particularly vulnerable to the effects of ageing. They also showed increases in the levels of molecules that promote synaptic plasticity (the capacity to alter the strength of connections between nerve cells).</p><p>Aged mice injected with PF4 also did better than aged control mice in cognitive tests, such as remembering where to find a submerged platform they could rest on when forced to swim through a maze.</p><h2>Platelet plus</h2><p>Before this study, “nobody, to my knowledge, has really ever shown that platelets can play a role in cognition”, said platelet biologist Robert Campbell from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “I was really excited about it.”</p><p>Two other publications released today also suggest that PF4 has a role in regulating hallmarks of ageing.

 </article><p>PF4 is one of a handful of molecules related to ageing that Villeda and others have identified in recent years. Some are <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track-category="body text link">involved in cognition</a>, whereas others relate to aspects of ageing such as <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track-category="body text link">muscle loss</a>, and some have multiple functions.</p><p>Biotech companies, including <a href="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Elevian</a> and <a href="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Alkahest</a>, are trying to turn these discoveries into therapies that promote regeneration and healthy ageing. Treatments will probably need to take a range of factors relating to ageing into consideration, Villeda says, and different combinations of treatments might be appropriate for different people.</p><p>If decreases in the levels of PF4 are shown to precede Alzheimer’s disease, this molecule could be used as a biomarker to identify people who might benefit from other treatments, says physiologist Cheryl Conover at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Some existing treatments for Alzheimer’s work best if they’re used during the early stages of the disease, so a way to identify people who are at risk before they develop symptoms would be helpful.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil">https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163187">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/turmoil"><code>turmoil</code></a>,
a framework for developing and testing distributed systems.</p>
<p>Testing distributed systems is hard. Non-determinism is everywhere (network,
time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve.
Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down
development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness.</p>
<p><code>turmoil</code> strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the
network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single
process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide
fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and
delaying messages between hosts.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use <code>turmoil</code>, add the crate to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code><span>[dev-dependencies]</span>
<span>turmoil</span> = <span>"0.3"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/loom/latest/loom/#writing-tests"><code>loom</code></a>, we provide simulated networking types that mirror
<code>tokio::net</code>. Define a new module in your crate named <code>net</code> or any other name of
your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled
between <code>turmoil</code> and <code>tokio::net</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(not(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>))]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> tokio::net::*;

<span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> turmoil::net::*;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, write your software using networking types from this local module.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>mod</span> simulation {
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>simulate_it</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> turmoil::<span>Result</span> {
        <span>// build the simulation</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>sim</span> = turmoil::Builder::<span>new</span>().<span>build</span>();

        <span>// setup a host</span>
        sim.<span>host</span>(<span>"server"</span>, || <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// host software goes here</span>
        });

        <span>// setup the test</span>
        sim.<span>client</span>(<span>"test"</span>, <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// dns lookup for "server"</span>
            <span>let</span> <span></span><span>addr</span> = turmoil::<span>lookup</span>(<span>"server"</span>);

            <span>// test code goes here</span>

            <span>Ok</span>(())
        });

        <span>// run the simulation</span>
        sim.<span>run</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each host (including the test code) runs on its own <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html"><code>Runtime</code></a>, which is
managed by the simulation. Within <code>run()</code>, the simulation steps each runtime a
configurable duration until the test code completes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>This crate is still experimental. Your use cases and feedback are invaluable in
guiding our development.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/turmoil/issues">file issues</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/tokio">ping us on Discord in
#turmoil-simulation</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/">https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37162898">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>
<p>I am afraid to inform you that you have built a compiler.
I know you wanted a “simple prototype” that would just add that
one feature to your programming model.
You said that “SSA is an overkill” and “it’s just way too much infrastructure
to maintain for a simple task” and yet, six months later, you have pile of
string mangling scripts that do not work—breaking every time a user input
slightly deviates from things you’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Surely, switching to the unstable abstract syntax tree (AST) library provided by the compiler will be the
end of your woes; at least that way, someone else maintains a real parser and provides
at least a semblance of sane input for you to transform.
But wait, the AST is massive. “Do I really have to handle all 500 different AST nodes?” you ask yourself?
Surely not.
Your users aren’t crazy; they don’t use all the weird features of this language.
So you march on, and handle the 50 AST nodes that matter, certain, that this
will be the last of what you need to do to maintain this pile of hacks.</p>
<p>Ah, but wait! Inevitably, someone wanted to nest a for loop inside a switch
statement, a struct definition within that loop, and a conditional in
expression position.
Tired, you patch in support for each feature, distracting from the crucial
features you should be working on and shipping.
One of your brilliant team member suggests a pre-processing stage: de-nest all definitions,
hoist all expressions, flatten out all control, and that way, you only have to handle
50 AST nodes because you will <em>know</em>, yes <em>know</em>, that the program cannot have any other
shape.</p>
<p>Except once that engineer leave, who will <em>know</em> what assumptions you encoded?
Those littered asserts? The inscrutable “unreachable code” errors? Who will <em>know</em>,
how you simplified your AST?
So you rolled out your own AST library, so that you may compile, nay, <em>transpile</em> your
code and expose your assumptions in your data structures.<span>
<label for="sn-1">
</label>
</span>

<span>
Certain, of course, that because you’re <em>transpiling</em> JavaScript to JavaScript, it is going to
way easier than what real compilers do.
</span>
 What glorious engineering, you say to yourself.</p>
<p>In the last leg of your journey to avoid building a compiler, your manager tells you
that your code should run on older machines, which only support version 0.8.
Version 0.8, of course, does not support the brilliant type-level encodings your
transpiler generates to implement your feature.
Not my problem, your manager says.
So you write some code that simplifies your <em>transpiled</em> code further, making
it use only features present in version 0.8.
Done at last, you say to yourself, without having to build a compiler.</p>
<p>A parser, an intermediate representation, transformation passes, and a code generator.
Dear Sir, you have built a compiler.</p>
<p><em>Addressed to,</em><br>
<em>Those who did not want to build a compiler</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a> — the subreddit for all things AMD; come talk about Ryzen, Radeon, Threadripper, EPYC, rumors, reviews, news and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a> is community run and does not represent AMD in any capacity unless specified.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> PC build questions and Tech Support posts are only allowed in the Questions and Tech Support Megathread - you can find the latest linked in the sidebar or pinned on the front page.</p>

<p>You may also want to use <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp">/r/AMDHelp</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TechSupport">/r/TechSupport</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc">/r/buildapc</a> and <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/support-forums/ct-p/supprtforums">AMD's official community support forums</a></p>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> e-Begging, asking for free PCs, sponsorships, components, posting referral or affiliate links, as well as asking for buying or selling advice is not allowed on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a></p>

<p><strong>Rule 3:</strong> Be civil and follow side-wide rules, this means no insults, personal attacks, slurs, brigading, mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour</p>

<p>Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a></p>

<p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> All posts must be related to AMD, their technologies or products</p>

<p>If a post is made and it is not clear how it relates to AMD, an explanation in the thread will be required that details why it is relevant, if the post lacks said comment, it will be removed</p>

<p>Content that is primarily about a competitor, their technologies, products or other industry that merely references AMD, their products or technologies would not meet this criteria</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5:</strong> Battlestation posts, PC builds and pictures of PC components are <strong>only allowed</strong> between 0:00 UTC Saturday and 0:00 UTC Monday</p>

<p><strong>Pictures of boxes are not allowed under any circumstances</strong>; this includes packaging and damaged packaging</p>

<p><strong>Rule 6:</strong> Posts containing leaks, rumors, speculation or with other information not confirmed by AMD or one of AMD's partners (e.g. Sapphire, XFX, HP, Dell) must be flaired appropriately as rumor</p>

<p><strong>Rule 7:</strong> Shitposts, memes and other low-effort posts are not allowed on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a></p>

<p><strong>Rule 8</strong>: Straw polls and Reddit polls are not allowed — we encourage discussion and debate. Straw and Reddit polls are simple questions resulting in a yes/no answer or soliciting another ballot-type response</p>

<p><strong>Rule 9</strong>: Changing the title of posts is not allowed, you must use the suggested Reddit title or copy/paste the title of the original link/video/article</p>

<p>Posts with altered titles will be removed and repeat offenders may be banned</p>

<p><strong>Rule 10</strong>: Do not use Google AMP links, URL shorteners or post screenshots of Tweets, articles, videos or other content. You must submit the Tweet, article, video or other content as a link post</p>

<p><strong>Rule 11</strong>: Posts with the benchmark flair must contain multiple games or configurations of hardware. Exceptions will be made for posts containing singular applications or hardware configurations if the post is a benchmark for unreleased AMD hardware or a world record</p>

<p><strong>Rule 12</strong>: The mods of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a> reserve the right to allow posts/comments that could break any of the rules, when a situation has arisen where the post is funny, educational or useful to the users of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD">/r/AMD</a>. We also reserve the right to remove posts or comments that may not technically break the rules in situations where moderators feel the post is not appropriate</p>

<p>If you have a post you believe warrants an exception, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmd">message us via modmail</a></p>

Starting today, we’ll add new capabilities to SGE so it’s easier to understand and debug generated code.</p><p data-block-key="1s7rs">SGE currently provides AI-generated overviews to help with tasks across a number of programming languages and tools. For example, you can find answers to how-to questions, and see suggested code snippets for common tasks. With our new updates, segments of code in overviews will now be color-coded with syntax highlighting, so it’s faster and easier to identify elements like keywords, comments and strings, helping you better digest the code you see at a glance.</p><h2 data-block-key="7npms">Use generative AI to learn more easily as you browse the web</h2><p data-block-key="fb8kp">When you’re trying to understand the ins and outs of a new topic, you often need to digest long or complex web pages, and it’s not always easy to hone in on specific details.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5650651831645025424" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
So, a while ago I built a gaming PC with the following specification:</p><div><p><span>&nbsp; Case&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dan A4 v4.1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Motherboard&nbsp; &nbsp; Z690I Strix Gaming</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i5-12400F</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; CPU Cooler&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NH-L9i-17xx Chromax Black</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NA-FD1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corsair CMK32GX5M2B5200C40</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; GPU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GeForce RTX 3070 Eagle</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Storage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Seagate Firecuda 530 1TB</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Case fans&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Noctua A9x14 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; PSU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corsair SF750</span></p></div><p><span>And one day after months of use it froze mid-game and went into a BIOS loop and wouldn't boot. I quickly realized that only one of the&nbsp;</span>Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs was detected. After some unscrewing and experimenting with the two drives in the two slots I found that one of them was dead.</p><p>And then I left the PC alone for a few days and turned it on again.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There are two main arguments against hydrogen use in transportation. The first is that it is mostly generated from fossil fuels, which does not make it helpful against climate change. When it is genuinely green, it is obtained through electrolysis, a process that is only 70% to 80% efficient. That's not bad compared to internal combustion engines (ICEs), but fuel cell detractors use that to bash them anyway. Scientists at Tel Aviv University plan to kill that argument with a method that is over 90% efficient in generating green hydrogen.</p><div><p>
		The doctoral student Itzhak Grinberg and Dr. Oren Ben-Zvi explored the fact that photosynthesis breaks water into oxygen and hydrogen to try to reproduce the method plants adopt to do that. Microscopic organisms – probably some sort of algae – helped them with the enzymes that became the key to the idea they developed with the guidance of professors Iftach Yacoby and Lihi Adler-Abramovich. Their study was published in the June edition of Carbon Energy.</p><p>

In a plant, the sun powers the enzyme that decomposes the water molecules into gases – called hydrogenase. The solution the Israeli scientists developed was to replace the sun's power with electricity. An electrode feeds the enzymes, but the electric charge repels them. What Grinberg and Ben-Zvi did was create a chemical treatment that prevented that: a hydrogel mixed with hydrogenase.</p><p>

The researchers were pretty happy with the material they created because <em>"the gel assembles itself."</em> According to Adler-Abramovich, when it is placed in water, it makes nanometric fibers that hold hydrogenase in place. These materials are much cheaper than the platinum that electrolyzers have to use, among other precious metals. The hydrogen is also apparently produced with any kind of water, not only distilled water, as electrolyzers demand. The researchers said salt water is more beneficial to the enzyme to work, for example. That makes green hydrogen production much cheaper, without the need for any secondary process.</p><div><a id="xaegal_5" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_5.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(5, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" title="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" data-gidm="1905316" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="9"></picture></a><p>Photo: Nel ASA</p></div>

According to these scientists, it can cost 15 times more than gray hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be made from coal in a process called gasification – that's black or brown hydrogen. The scientists said gray, black, and brown hydrogen release 9 to 12 tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of hydrogen produced. Yet, they correspond to 95% of all hydrogen currently produced worldwide for agricultural and industrial needs. Even if this green hydrogen does not help move a vehicle, it is a welcome way to curb the production of the gray and black kinds.</p><p>

Currently, the hydrogen refueling infrastructure does not increase because green hydrogen prices are too high. In June, Alexander Vlaskamp warned that hydrogen costs four to five times more than it would be acceptable for truck buyers to use it. Although <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/fuel-cell-trucks-face-a-danger-worse-than-weight-that-s-hydrogen-costs-217098.html">the MAN CEO</a> has to justify why Volkswagen is betting so heavily on batteries, the green hydrogen cost was something that needed to be solved quickly. The Israeli production method may be the answer that can solve this once and for all. We just need to have a more refined and commercially usable system to confirm the benefits this idea may bring.</p><p>

If the prices really get more competitive, energy solar and wind farms may dedicate to producing hydrogen when there is no demand for the electricity they generate. That's a better idea than spending millions of dollars on expensive stationary storage systems: these batteries could have better uses in vehicles or houses. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/hydrogen/">Hydrogen</a> storage would still be a problem unless the gas was transformed into synthetic fuel. Hopefully, another scientific breakthrough could address that as soon as possible.

NamX wants its first vehicle – the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/NamX%20HUV/">HUV</a> – to use swappable hydrogen capsules that can be bought anywhere. If these capsules could be refilled directly from one of the production stations, the storage problem woulxd be quickly solved. Toyota is investigating a similar solution. If we can produce green hydrogen at reasonable prices, that will be a good starting point.</p><p>

It may also be the case that we have to develop vehicles in a different way. Riversimple proposed that when it argued that we are currently trying to make fuel cells fit the cars we already have, just like some carmakers tried to use internal combustion engine (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine" title="ICE - click for definition">ICE</span>) platforms to make electric vehicles. It did not work. FCEVs have to be conceived around fuel cells and not the other way around. If you check the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai NEXO, they are the perfect example of what Riversimple tried to demonstrate: they look like ordinary vehicles with motors and a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine and a fuel tank. It makes sense that an established automaker will try to keep things as they are, but that will bite them back when competitors find a better way to do that. The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cey2.411">Israeli scientists</a> may have found precisely what was missing to kick this off. Find yourself a comfortable seat to follow how everything unfolds from here. <i></i></p>

<p>Over 30 years ago the late Ian Murdock
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt">wrote</a>
to the comp.os.linux.development newsgroup about the completion of a brand-new
Linux release which he named "The Debian Linux Release".</p>
<p>He built the release by hand, from scratch, so to speak. Ian laid out
guidelines for how this new release would work, what approach the release
would take regarding its size, manner of upgrades, installation procedures; and
with great care of consideration for users without Internet connection.</p>
<p>Unaware that he had sparked a movement in the fledgling F/OSS community, Ian
worked on and continued to work on Debian. The release, now aided by volunteers
from the newsgroup and around the world, grew and continues to grow as one of
the largest and oldest FREE operating systems that still exist today.</p>
<p>Debian at its core is comprised of Users, Contributors, Developers, and
Sponsors, but most importantly, <strong><em>People</em></strong>. Ians drive and focus remains
embedded in the core of Debian, it remains in all of our work, it remains in
the minds and hands of the users of <em><strong>The Universal Operating System</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Debian Project is proud and happy to share our anniversary not exclusively
unto ourselves, instead we share this moment with everyone, as we come together
in celebration of a resounding community that works together, effects change,
and continues to make a difference, not just in our work but around the world.</p>
<p>Debian is present in cluster systems, datacenters, desktop computers, embedded
systems, IoT devices, laptops, servers, it may possibly be powering the web
server and device you are reading this article on, and it can also be found in
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux/">Spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Closer to earth, Debian fully supports projects for accessibility:
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/edu/">Debian Edu/Skolelinux</a> - an operating system
designed for educational use in schools and communities,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience">Debian Science</a> - providing free
scientific software across many established and emerging fields,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/blends/hamradio/about">Debian Hamradio</a> - for amateur
radio enthusiasts,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian-Accessibility</a> - a
project focused on the design of an operating system suited to fit the
requirements of people with disabilites, and
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/astro/">Debian Astro</a> - focused on supporting
professional and hobbyist astronomers.</p>
<p>Debian strives to give, reach, embrace, mentor, share, and teach with
internships through many programs internally and externally such as the Google
Summer of Code, Outreachy, and the Open Source Promotion Plan.</p>
<p>None of this could be possible without the vast amount of support, care, and
contributions from what started as and is still an all volunteer project.
We celebrate with each and every one who has helped shape Debian over all of
these years and toward the future.</p>
<p>Today we all certainly celebrate 30 years of Debian, but know that Debian
celebrates with each and every one of you all at the same time.</p>
<p>Over the next few days Celebration parties are planned to take place in
Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany
(CCCcamp), India, Iran, Portugal, Serbia, South Africa, and Turkey.</p>
<p>You are of course, invited to join us!</p>
<p>Check out, attend, or form your very own
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2023">DebianDay 2023 Event</a>.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you all so very much.</p>

<p>Great. The fusion hype is bad enough already. Now its resurgence is going to interrupt the series of posts I’m in the middle of publishing in order for this post to be “timely.”</p>
<p>The first (and much bigger) round of breathless excitement came in December 2022 when the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) announced a (legitimate) breakthrough in achieving fusion: more energy came out of the target than laser energy injected.</p>
<p>At the time, I brushed it off without even reading any articles because I already knew about the NIF’s purpose and limitations, and a few headlines told me everything I needed to know. Who cares how much <em>laser</em> energy went in: how much energy went into <em>creating</em> the laser energy? The laser I used for lunar ranging took 5 kW from the wall plug and delivered 2 W of laser power for a dismal 0.04% efficiency. Such is the cost for shaping ultra-brief pulses: lots of energy is thrown away. The headlines were clearly overblown.</p>
<p>Enough students in my energy class in Spring 2023 asked about the fusion breakthrough (doesn’t that mean we’re done?) that I dug into the details. Even so, I still deemed it unworthy of writing up as a post. But a few days ago, my friend asked me if I was excited about the recent fusion news. I hadn’t heard a peep, but after searching I found a new round of articles based on a second “net gain” laser shot and realized I probably ought to put out a quantitative post on the matter, reminiscent of my blogging origins.</p>
<p>In the end, the NIF fusion accomplishment might be called a stunt.&nbsp; Stunts explore what we <em>can</em> do (often after an insane amount of preparation, practice, and failure), rather than what’s practical.&nbsp; Stunts hide the pains and present an appearance of ease and grace, but it’s a show.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, it’s as if you spot a slot machine in a casino that looks very promising. You’re dying to play, because it just feels right—mysteriously appealing to your sense of self. It calls to you. You notice that it takes $2 tokens, but you have none. You go to the window to purchase a token, and are shocked to learn that one $2 token costs $400. Not wanting to look like an uninformed fool, you gulp and buy the token. This slot machine had better live up to its promise! You pull the lever, and surprise! You actually <em>do</em> win! You put in a $2 token and the machine makes very happy noises and flashes lots of lights as it spits out…$3 (and some neutrons, oddly). Queue the headlines! Want to play again?&nbsp; Actually, this wasn’t your first shot: just the first success after years of trying (but hush!).</p>

<h2>Energetics</h2>
<p>That’s the essence of the story. The December announcement indicated that they launched 2.05&nbsp;MJ of laser energy onto the target sphere, and 3.15&nbsp;MJ came out. The recent articles indicate a second “score,” but fail to give energy specifics, other than “more” energy out. I am assuming an incremental bump, still under 4&nbsp;MJ—otherwise the factor of improvement would be prominently touted in the coverage.</p>
<p>Let’s pause to say: well done! Honestly. No sarcasm. What they did was ridiculously hard, and it finally worked after more than a decade of trying. They actually produced a significant number of fusion events! There’s no faking that, and I’d like to see you try. So let’s be clear that I’m not knocking the accomplishment in itself. My major beef is how we interpret the implications for society. To be fair, the scientists did not supply the hype. They didn’t have to: the rest of the universe was more than ready to fill in that yawning gap.</p>
<p>As I scanned articles from December 2022, most were about the triumph, a reminder that the sun works by fusion, and talk about being the first major step toward limitless clean energy. That’s what people want to hear. It plays right into our cultural mythology: humans defy all limits through ingenuity and technology. Build a story around that theme, and you’ve got yourself some guaranteed click-bait.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> few articles mentioned the energetic price of generating the laser pulse. In particular, I found <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/department-of-energy-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-nif-livermore/672439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in The Atlantic</a> by Charles Seife:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “more energy out than laser energy in” equation masks several fundamental problems. NIF’s doped glass lasers have an efficiency of about 0.5 percent, meaning that they would have sucked in roughly 400 megajoules of energy from the grid in order to produce the 2.1 megajoules of light energy…</p></blockquote>
<p>The second was a <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/fusion-power-nif-hype-lose-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Think article</a> by Tom Hartsfield.</p>
<blockquote><p>The laser energy delivered to the target was 2.05 MJ, and the fusion output was likely about 3.15 MJ. According to multiple sources on NIF’s website, the input energy to the laser system is somewhere between 384 and 400 MJ.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s just the laser energetics. The whole facility consumes scads more for countless other purposes. According to the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLNL NIF FAQs</a> (are you letting me get away with a triple acronym?),</p>
<blockquote><p>NIF’s 192 powerful laser beams, housed in a <b>10-story building</b> the size of <b>3 football fields</b>, can deliver more than 2 million joules of ultraviolet laser energy in billionth-of-a-second pulses onto a target about the size of a pencil eraser.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is mine, to highlight the point that this is a massive laser and facility. It’s like ten Walmart superstores stacked on top of each other. The lighting <em>alone</em> is likely taking tens of kilowatts, which could hypothetically be run for less than a minute on the energy gain from the fusion pop.&nbsp; It would be fun to count all the megajoules that went into press coverage of the event!</p>
<h2>Power Plant Energetics</h2>
<p>Let’s connect the 3 MJ output to that of actual power plants, forgetting for a moment the tremendous energy loss represented in getting 3 MJ out from a 400 MJ input. A typical electrical power plant (nuclear, coal, etc.) delivers about 1 GW of electrical power. But it’s a heat engine operating at 30–40% thermodynamic efficiency. So it takes roughly 3 GW of <em>thermal</em> energy to export 1&nbsp;GW as electricity. 3&nbsp;GW is 3&nbsp;GJ per second, or 3,000&nbsp;MJ per second.</p>
<p>The same efficiency factor would apply to a putative fusion plant. The concept behind fusion power is that it’s <em>just</em> another thermal source—an excruciatingly elaborate way to boil water to make steam to drive a turbine to run a generator. So our 3&nbsp;MJ would need to be replicated 1,000 times per second to amount to 3&nbsp;GW.</p>
<p>Laser repetition rates can be all over the map. 1,000 Hz is not in itself unusually fast by any stretch. What is the repetition rate of the NIF laser? Handily, LLNL <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides these statistics</a>. The average since 2015 is 377 shots per year, with a high of 417 and a low of 327. That’s about a shot per day—or two on a good day. It’s only 100 million times shy of 1 kHz. Oh dear.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/12/the-energy-departments-fusion-breakthrough-its-not-really-about-generating-electricity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> of physicist Bob Rosner in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists helpfully puts the NIF in context (it’s not about societal energy). In it, he reinforces some of what we’ve covered, and adds some financial detail.</p>
<blockquote><p>This facility can do one shot a day; this is at slightly more than two megajoules (of output). For an energy source, it would have to do the same thing at least 10 times a second. If you ask, “Do the lasers exist that can do this?” Not in your dream. The pellet cost a bit over $100,000 to manufacture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 10 shots per second, I gather, is if the fusion yield could be improved by a couple orders of magnitude—approaching actual break-even. At $100,000 per (literal) pop, and even just ten shots per second, we’re talking a cool million dollars per second!</p>
<p>Let’s wave a magic wand for a minute and say that the 400 MJ input produced a 700 MJ output for a net of 300 MJ: 100 times the recent breakthrough. This accords with the ten shots per second mentioned above. What is the price of the delivered electricity? After thermodynamic inefficiency is accounted, we get 100 MJ out for $100,000 cost, or $1,000 per megajoule. We are accustomed to using the kilowatt-hour (kWh) as a measure of delivered energy, which is 3.6 MJ. The cost becomes, then, $3,600 per kWh. Typical electricity costs are in the neighborhood of $0.15–0.20 per kWh, so we’re dealing with a cost that is 20,000 times higher than nominal. And don’t forget, we used a magic wand to even get there. It’s closer to 2 million times more expensive currently, and as a net energy loser to boot.</p>
<p>Granted, the research and development phase is not characteristic of operational costs. But try knocking on a venture capitalist’s door and making the argument that you can trim costs to 0.005% of their current amount. Slam!</p>
<p>This massive reduction, incidentally, translates to a cost of $5 per pellet. I don’t care what mass-production slave labor you might dream of employing. A cryogenic hydrogen-ice target made to demanding precision specifications, containing deuterium and transmuted lithium (to make tritium) is not going to cost $5. You lost me at cryogenic. Also, they would have made many pellets by now and I’m sure don’t relish spending $100,000 each. If they’re clever enough to accomplish fusion, they would be clever enough to have already reduced costs dramatically if it were straightforward.</p>
<h2>Fusion Efficiency</h2>
<p>Here’s the part where I earn my keep as a physicist translating technical matters. I found details about the NIF targets in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/FST10-3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 paper</a> by Bernard Koziokiemski et al. The abstract alone clarifies much. The target is a shell of hydrogen ice 75 μm thick on a 1 mm radius sphere, cooled below 19 K. Pause for a moment to contemplate the challenges that would be involved if trying to maintain the targets at such low temperatures in a 3 GW power plant “furnace” environment.</p>
<p>Hydrogen ice has a density of 86&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which in the specified volume (10<sup>−9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) translates to 5×10<sup>19</sup> lattice sites (nuclei/atoms). Deuterium/tritium ice has a higher density than hydrogen ice, but the atomic spacing is unchanged so that the pure hydrogen calculation gives the correct number.</p>
<p>How many fusion events took place to crank out 3&nbsp;MJ of energy? Each deuterium–tritium fusion event releases 17.6&nbsp;MeV of energy, or 2.8×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J. Calling this 3×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J (among friends; makes for easy math), we find that we need 10<sup>18</sup> fusion events to amount to 3 MJ. Each event involves 2 nuclei. We calculated above that the shell contains 50×10<sup>18</sup> nuclei, meaning that 4% of them participated in fusion.</p>
<p>This event therefore produced a 4% yield. I’m actually very impressed! That’s nothing to sneeze at. The laser-induced implosion is very fast, very violent, and leaves lots of room for nuclei failing to “find” each other if not compressed almost flawlessly and symmetrically to sub-micron scale. Before doing the calculation, I might have guessed a yield orders-of-magnitude smaller.</p>
<p>So this news is both good and bad. Hats off for cracking into single-digit yield! But that leaves less room to improve. Even at 100% efficiency, we’d get just 25 times more energy out, or 75&nbsp;MJ. That’s still not enough to pay for the price of admission (400&nbsp;MJ, just for the laser part).</p>
<h2>NIF Purpose</h2>
<p>This avenue, therefore, seems painfully far away from achieving practical societal energy. Even 100% yield (for the present design) could not produce net energy. Even if it <em>could</em> produce net energy, the laser repetition rate is a million times too slow. And then, even if the laser could fire fast enough, the cost of each target is prohibitively high by over four orders-of-magnitude.</p>
<p>Then, we have a raft of practical considerations for turning an experimental facility into a functional power plant. No design exists at present to extract the heat produced at NIF. That’s not what it’s for—it wouldn’t make any sense to put effort in that direction.&nbsp; Such a design would have the unenviable thermal challenge of delivering cryogenic targets into a hellfire-hot environment. For energy extraction, tokamak designs like ITER are less unsuitable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case, all this to boil water. Bless their hearts.</p>
<p>But the NIF was never “about” societal energy. Its primary purpose is nuclear weapons research. This pesky thing called the nuclear test ban treaty means we can’t just go around detonating nuclear bombs whenever we feel like it. Surely we did not run out of South Pacific island paradises to blow to smithereens. The NIF allows study of matter at extremely high energy density. Other targets besides deuterium–tritium can be placed in the converging laser beams. Essentially, we can create the unbelievably hot conditions relevant to nuclear detonations in the safety of our own national lab.</p>
<p>Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) constitutes a small fraction of <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIF’s laser shots</a>. Most of the work is labeled HED for high-energy-density research. The people at NIF are under no false impression about the potential of this type of approach for generating societal energy. They know what they’re about. At the same time, why not poke? It certainly has some benefits in terms of public attention, translating to funding.</p>
<h2>How Embarrassing</h2>
<p>So what can we say about the public reaction to this news? Headlines in December gushed about the dawn of a new era of limitless energy. People got excited. Many of my students came away thinking it was basically a done deal—now just a matter of putting into practice. That’s how it works in entertainment: a genius breakthrough followed by immediate implementation free of complication. The emphasis is on human ingenuity, not on physical reality. In my experience, ideas are a dime-a-dozen. The hard part is coming up with an idea that can be practically brought to fruition.</p>
<p>I often encounter a disconnect on matters of this sort when interacting with people—whether about space colonization, fusion, renewable energy, or prospects for modernity’s continuation. I frequently find myself outnumbered. Why am I so negative about these things? The disconnect might have something to do with how information is received and processed. If all I had to go on were popular media accounts, word-of-mouth, and entertainment, I’d probably be similarly miscalibrated. But my background, training, experiences, and accomplishments enable an uncommon approach that is less dependent on what other people are saying, and more strongly tied to the underlying drivers. That’s not to say I’ll always have a more accurate take, but just that my process generally involves more independent thought and analysis than I suspect it does for most people.&nbsp; I’m no fun at parties.</p>
<p>In any case, the public reaction to the fusion story tells me a lot about our collective psychology. To me, it speaks to a sense of desperation. I think people sense that the “bad news” side of the ledger is overcrowded of late, and it’s starting to dawn on people that the future could possibly be worse than the present. This causes a cognitive dissonance in that our cultural narrative is one of progress, growth, and innovation. How can these competing visions be squared? News of fusion has the effect of temporarily permitting people to shed the anxiety and embrace the dream all the more strongly. Words that come to mind are: embarrassing, pathetic, humiliating.</p>
<p>What if you see a movie star across the street, overcome by excitement as they stop, look at you, and wave enthusiastically. You, of course, wave back. They <em>see</em> you. They recognize you as special, just as you knew all along. Only, it then becomes apparent that their movie star fling (according to the tabloids) was passing behind you. Now how do you feel? How could you fall for it? That’s the question I find myself asking about the fusion hype. It’s so obviously far from relevant, how could we (and the media establishment) fall for it?</p>
<p>My suspicion is that it plays perfectly into our culture’s irrational hopes and dreams. We have a weak spot in our armor for things that sound too good to be true. We want to believe the narrative (mythology) that humans are exempt from all limits, and that our ingenuity will save the day every time. We want to believe that the movie star would adore us, if only they got the chance to meet us.&nbsp; Instant besties!</p>
<p>Many in our culture truly believe in “the amazing future,” uncritically extrapolating our fossil-fueled joy ride into ever-more impressive innovations and technologies. Of course we will someday roam the galaxy. Of course we will have warp drive (how else would we roam the galaxy?). Of course fusion is a necessary stepping stone on this path. It’s silly to imagine warp drive and teleportation without first cracking fusion. So societal fusion power <em>has</em> to happen, in their imaginations.</p>
<p>The problem is that such imaginings are not tethered to physical reality. They are driven by ideology, or I would say mythology. The physical reality is that we are living in an ecologically, evolutionarily untested paradigm that is very recent (on relevant timescales) and powered by patently unsustainable practices and resource use. The cost is rapid ecological degradation and global disruption to the biosphere. It seems quite clear that the track we are on does not lead to the stars, but to ignominious self-termination of this whacky mode called modernity. It simply does not add up, once the mythology is stripped away. The venture capitalist of nature is about to slam the door on our faces.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/">https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we announced the launch of the Mullvad Browser, a browser built by the Tor Project team and distributed by <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad</a>.</p>
<p>Mullvad and the Tor Project have been part of the same community that is dedicated to developing technology that prioritizes protecting people's right to privacy for many years now. Mullvad contributes to the Tor Project at the highest level of membership, Shallot, and were a founding member of the Tor Project's Membership Program. They approached us to help them develop their browser because they wanted to leverage our expertise to create a product that is built on the same principles and with similar safety levels as the Tor Browser&nbsp;-- but that works independently of the Tor network. The result is the Mullvad Browser, a free, privacy-preserving web browser to challenge the all-too-prevalent business model of exploiting people's data for profit.</p>
<h2>Why use the Mullvad Browser?</h2>
<p>In short: the Mullvad Browser is Tor Browser without the Tor Network -- a browser that allows anyone to take advantage of all the browser privacy features the Tor Project has created. If people want to connect the browser with a VPN they trust, they can easily do so.</p>
<p>Our goal was to give users the privacy protections of Tor Browser without Tor. For instance, the Mullvad Browser applies a "hide-in-the-crowd" approach to online privacy by creating a similar fingerprint for all of its users. The browser's 'out-of-the-box' configurations and settings will mask many parameters and features commonly used to extract information from a person's device that can make them identifiable, including fonts, rendered content, and several hardware APIs. By default, Mullvad Browser has private mode enabled, blocks third-party trackers and cookies, and makes it easy to delete cookies between visiting pages during the same session.</p>
<p>The Mullvad Browser is another option for internet users who are looking for a privacy browser that doesn't need a bunch of extensions and plugins to enhance their privacy and reduce the factors that can accidentally de-anonymize themselves. And unlike other browsers on the market, Mullvad Browser's business model does not rely on capitalizing on users' behavioral data.</p>
<h2>Why collaborate?</h2>
<p>Our mission at the Tor Project is to advance human rights by building technology that protects people's privacy, provides anonymity and helps them bypass censorship. We want to give people options and demonstrate to the world that through partnerships like these, you can create technology with these values in mind.</p>
<p>That is why we jumped at the opportunity to help Mullvad with their browser. We agree with them that demand for a browser that is built to the same standards as Tor Browser exists.</p>
<p>We hope to inspire other tech builders and organizations to take a page out of our playbook --and think of privacy as a 'feature' that can enhance user experience-- and not as an afterthought. This collaboration with Mullvad illustrates that it is possible to build privacy-preserving technology that protects users like ours does together, rather than in competition with each other.</p>
<h2>What does that mean for us and Tor Browser?</h2>
<p>Let's be clear: Tor Browser is here to stay, and we'll continue to iterate and improve on it and our other services. We know that millions of users around the world rely on Tor Browser and other solutions that the Tor Project offers to safely connect to the internet, to browse anonymously online and to circumvent censorship. Therefore Tor Browser will continue to exist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to continue to maintain and improve Tor Browser, it is still one of the few solutions that provides anonymity online because it funnels traffic through the Tor network. A privacy browser plus the Tor network is a powerful combination and sometimes one of the few options that censored and surveilled users have in their region to freely and safely access the internet. Tor Browser is also a free solution for all, making it an affordable solution for people at risk.</p>
<p>This joint project with Mullvad has brought positive changes to Tor Browser by allowing us to address legacy issues, fix vulnerabilities for Tor Browser and make necessary UX improvements that benefit both Tor and Mullvad Browsers, as well as the global privacy-preserving tech ecosystem. And, over the last five years, the Tor Project has launched a number of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift">initiatives to increase adoption of our technologies</a> and made <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-advancing-privacy-innovation/">significant improvements</a> to the usability of our own products. And we are currently working on more to come!</p>
<p>We encourage you to check out the Mullvad Browser and its capabilities. It can be used without Mullvad VPN, although the combination is recommended. If you want to learn more about this partnership, you can visit <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad.net/browser.</a></p>

<p>New evidence suggests the world’s largest known asteroid impact structure is buried near the New South Wales town of Deniliquin.</p>


<p><em>Acknowledgment: I’d like to thank my colleague Tony Yeates, who originated the view of the Deniliquin multi-ring structure as an impact structure – and who was instrumental to this work.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195122002487">recent research</a> published by myself and my colleague Tony Yeates in the journal Tectonophysics, we investigate what we believe – based on many years of experience in asteroid impact research – is the world’s largest known impact structure, buried deep in the earth in southern New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure, yet to be further tested by drilling, spans up to 520 kilometres in diameter. This exceeds the size of the near-300km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_impact_structure">Vredefort</a> impact structure in South Africa, which to date has been considered the world’s largest.</p>
<h2>Hidden traces of Earth’s early history</h2>
<p>The history of Earth’s bombardment by asteroids is largely concealed. There are a few reasons for this. The first is erosion: the process by which gravity, wind and water slowly wear away land materials through time.</p>
<p>When an asteroid strikes, it creates a crater with an uplifted core. This is similar to how a drop of water splashes upward from a transient crater when you drop a pebble in a pool.</p>
<p>This central uplifted dome is a key characteristic of large impact structures. However, it can erode over thousands to millions of years, making the structure difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Structures can also be buried by sediment through time. Or they might disappear as a result of subduction, wherein tectonic plates can collide and slide below one another into Earth’s mantle layer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, new geophysical discoveries are unearthing signatures of impact structures formed by asteroids that may have reached tens of kilometres across – heralding a paradigm shift in our understanding of how Earth evolved over eons. These include pioneering discoveries of impact “ejecta”, which are the materials thrown out of a crater during an impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">Researchers think</a> the oldest layers of these ejecta, found in sediments in early terrains around the world, might signify the tail end of the Late Heavy Bombardment of Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">latest evidence</a> suggests Earth and the other planets in the Solar System were subject to intense asteroid bombardments until about 3.2 billion years ago, and sporadically since.</p>
<p>Some large impacts are correlated with mass extinction events. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a>, named after father and son scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, explains how non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out as a result of a large asteroid strike some 66 million years ago.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the Deniliquin structure</h2>
<p>The Australian continent and its predecessor continent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, have been the target of numerous asteroid impacts. These have resulted in at least 38 confirmed and 43 potential impact structures, ranging from relatively small craters to large and completely buried structures.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 0 0&quot;></svg>" data-src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip"></a><figcaption>This map shows the distribution of circular structures of uncertain, possible or probable impact origin on the Australian continent and offshore. Green dots represent confirmed impact craters. Red dots represent confirmed impact structures that are more than 100km wide, whereas red dots inside white circles are more than 50km wide. Yellow dots represent likely impact structures. <em>Image credit: Andrew Glikson and Franco Pirajno</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As you’ll recall with the pool and pebble analogy, when a large asteroid hits Earth, the underlying crust responds with a transient elastic rebound that produces <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-954.pdf">a central dome</a>.</p>
<p>Such domes, which can slowly erode and/or become buried through time, may be all that’s preserved from the original impact structure. They represent the deep-seated “root zone” of an impact. Famous examples are found in the Vredefort impact structure and the 170km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> in Mexico. The latter represents the impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2000, Tony Yeates suggested magnetic patterns beneath the Murray Basin in New South Wales <a href="https://www.aseg.org.au/publications/preview-old">likely represented</a> a massive, buried impact structure. An analysis of the region’s updated geophysical data between 2015 and 2020 confirmed the existence of a 520km diameter structure with a seismically defined dome at its centre.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure has all the features that would be expected from a large-scale impact structure. For instance, magnetic readings of the area reveal a symmetrical rippling pattern in the crust around the structure’s core. This was likely produced during the impact as extremely high temperatures created intense magnetic forces.</p>
<p>A central low magnetic zone corresponds to 30km-deep deformation above a seismically defined mantle dome. The top of this dome is about 10km <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL065345">shallower than the top</a> of the regional mantle.</p>
<p>Magnetic measurements also show evidence of “radial faults”: fractures that radiate from the centre of a large impact structure. This is further accompanied by small magnetic anomalies which may represent igneous “dikes”, which are sheets of magma injected into fractures in a pre-existing body of rock.</p>

<p>Radial faults, and igneous sheets of rocks that form within them, are typical of large impact structures and can be found in the Vredefort structure and the <a href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/maps/article/viewFile/14921/14892">Sudbury impact structure</a> in Canada.</p>
<p>Currently, the bulk of the evidence for the Deniliquin impact is based on geophysical data obtained from the surface. For proof of impact, we’ll need to collect physical evidence of shock, which can only come from drilling deep into the structure.</p>
<h2>When did the Deniliquin impact happen?</h2>
<p>The Deniliquin structure was likely located on the eastern part of the Gondwana continent, prior to it splitting off into several continents (including the Australian continent) much later.</p>

<p>The impact that caused it may have occurred during what’s known as the Late Ordovician mass extinction event. Specifically, I think it may have triggered what’s called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">Hirnantian glaciation stage</a>, which lasted between 445.2 and 443.8 million years ago, and is also defined as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X23000655">Ordovician-Silurian extinction event</a>.</p>
<p>This huge glaciation and mass extinction event <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">eliminated</a> about 85% of the planet’s species. It was more than double the scale of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Chicxulub impact</a> that killed off the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>It is also possible the Deniliquin structure is older than the Hirnantian event, and may be of an early Cambrian origin (about 514 million years ago). The next step will be to gather samples to determine the structure’s exact age. This will require drilling a deep hole into its magnetic centre and dating the extracted material.</p>
<p>It’s hoped further studies of the Deniliquin impact structure will shed new light on the nature of early <a href="https://www.livescience.com/37584-paleozoic-era.html">Paleozoic</a> Earth.</p>

<p><em>Hello dear reader, I will be improving this article based on the feedback that I received. I don't see myself as an expert, more like ever-learning amateur, so if you point out something, I will try to understand your point of view and correct any mistakes. Feel free to comment the article below, any and all feedback is welcome, just stay civil. </em></p>


<p>In the grand scheme of a software engineering path, there's a thread that weaves through every project, every failure, and every challenge. That thread is people. As a person with an engineering background, I do enjoy solving hard puzzles and fixing problems. But the most complex, intriguing, and ultimately rewarding aspect of my journey has always been managing people. I wasn’t a people person before — It’s not something I could do naturally — I had to read a lot, learn a lot, try different methodologies, and figure stuff out on the fly, but it’s still the most rewarding aspect of my job.</p>


<p>This guide is born out of those countless interactions, conversations, and experiences. Things that I’ve failed at. It's a distillation of lessons learned, a roadmap to help you, the engineering managers of today, navigate the choppy waters of managing difficult software engineers. </p>


<p><em>I'm not an expert, and am not trying to position myself as one, so if you disagree with anything here, let me know in the comments and we'll have a healthy discussion. </em></p>


<pre>🏄 Some people call developers snowflakes — they’re brilliant, opinionated, and unique in many ways. It’s easy to manage those that don’t deviate too much from all the other engineers. Still, I will focus more on those difficult employees rather than the general management of all developers.</pre>


<p>Why focus on the difficult ones, you ask? Well, it's simple. When everything is smooth sailing, when your team is balanced like a well-oiled machine, you don't need a guide. It's when you have conflicts, ego clashes, lone wolves, or when you're faced with a team member who's not pulling their weight, causing friction, or just not fitting in that's when you need a compass to guide you. And that's what this guide aims to be.</p>


<p>In the following sections, we'll delve into the various types of difficult employees you might encounter - from procrastinators and lone wolves to negative Nancies and over-promisers. We'll explore typical scenarios, describe their behaviors, and, most importantly, provide strategies for managing difficult employees effectively.</p>


<p>I will also touch a bit on the importance of communication techniques like Nonviolent Communication. We'll walk through the steps of implementing a Performance Improvement Plan and when it might be time to escalate issues and part ways.</p>


<pre>🏄 This guide is not a magic wand that will solve all your management challenges. But it's a starting point. It's also very subjective. Your mileage may vary. It's a collection of insights and advice that I hope will help you become a better manager to your team, even if some of them are not the most pleasant people to work with.</pre>


<p>So, let's embark on this journey together. Let's navigate these rough seas with your crew and turn challenges into opportunities for growth. As any seasoned sailor will tell you, it's not the calm seas but the storms that make a good captain.</p>


<h2 id="h-effectively-managing-the-norm">Effectively Managing the Norm</h2>


<p>Before diving deep into managing the difficult engineers, let’s focus first on managing those that are not as atypical. The "norm" refers to the majority of your team members who come in daily, do their job, and contribute to the team’s success — they’re competent professionals with healthy mental states and won't require any special attention. No issues, no conflicts, no special needs. These individuals form the backbone of your team and will probably represent 90% of the people you meet and work with.</p>


<p>I use a simple strategy to make sure these kinds of employees are happy — Trust, Growth, Comfort.</p>


<h3 id="h-trust">Trust</h3>


<p><strong>Trusting Them to Do the Right Things</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Assume Intelligence</strong>: Always start with the assumption that your team members are intelligent and will make informed decisions. This mindset fosters an environment of respect and empowers individuals to take initiative. It’s even better to assume they’re smarter than you and might know something you don’t. You probably hired them, so unless you’re hiring people who are worse than yourself (and I sure hope you don’t), you should assume they have better ideas than you do.</li>


<li><strong>Accountable Autonomy</strong>: Give them the freedom to make decisions and act on them. Keeping them accountable for those decisions is far more productive than questioning their every move. Autonomy comes with the price of accountability and should be stated explicitly. Do whatever you want, but you’re responsible for the fuck-ups as well.</li>


<li><strong>Allow fixable mistakes to happen</strong>: Trust means allowing room for errors. Of course, I’m not talking about senior developers with privileged access running rm -rf on production or dropping production database and deleting backups, and saying whoops — that’s a cause for corrective action. The mistakes can be divided into two parts: Mistakes that can be fixed and mistakes that cannot. Mistakes that can be fixed is anything where you write a postmortem, do a debriefing and continue on your way with lessons learned. Mistakes that cannot be fixed is people dying, something blowing up or your company going bankrupt. Allow them to make mistakes from which the company can recover and help them learn from them. <em><strong>Update: </strong>I suggest you also read the comments, there's a big discussion there regarding this point.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-growth">Growth</h3>


<p><strong>Challenging Them to Become Better</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge Regularly</strong>: Push your team members out of their comfort zones. Not talking about dropping them cold into projects where they have zero knowledge and expecting them to perform. More of — encouraging them to take on tasks that stretch their abilities, a bit more complicated than they’re used to, fostering their growth.</li>


<li><strong>Praise and Recognition</strong>: Recognize their achievements. Show them the milestones they can reach and celebrate with them when they do — be it with monetary incentives or a public announcement of their achievements. This not only boosts morale but also motivates them to aim higher.</li>


<li><strong>Constructive Feedback and clear Path</strong>: While praise is essential, it's equally important to address areas where they’re lacking. Nobody is perfect, and some of us are better at different things. However, the focus should be on improving where we excel and pulling up those things we’re bad at. They’re good at algorithms but bad at databases — time to deep dive into DBs. They’re good at small tasks but struggle with bigger things — time to learn software architecture. In any way, the feedback should be a tool for growth, not a weapon for criticism.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h3>


<p><strong>Keeping It Comfortable</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Limit Interruptions</strong>: Respect their time and focus. Avoid unnecessary meetings and interruptions. Embrace asynchronous communication, allowing team members to respond when it's most convenient, fostering efficiency and respect for individual work rhythms. If the wheels are turning, there’s no need to run around interrupting them constantly. Let people work.</li>


<li><strong>Streamlined Processes</strong>: Ensure that all auxiliary processes, from software tools to administrative tasks, are efficient, user-friendly, and non-interrupting (see above). A smooth operational environment reduces frustration and allows team members to focus on what needs to be done without constant notifications.</li>


<li><strong>Less thinking, more creating</strong>: As software engineers are more creative, the fewer decisions they have to make outside of their project, the better decisions they make inside of the project. Instead of them figuring out, “Is tomorrow a non-working day or not” — make the info easily accessible. Instead of them figuring out where to get snacks — have snacks ready. You get the idea.</li>
</ul>


<p>The list above can be the catalyst that propels your team to a new steady height of productivity. These are low-hanging fruits that can create a positive atmosphere that permeates every line of code. It can enhance the quality of the software your team produces, ensuring that every product you deliver is as good as it possibly can be.</p>


<p>But let's not sugarcoat it - being an effective leader in a software engineering team is not without its challenges. You're dealing with people, each with their unique personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.</p>


<pre>🏄 One of the most common - and often most daunting - challenges is dealing with difficult employees. Whether it's the brilliant coder who can't meet a deadline, the seasoned engineer who struggles with teamwork, or the talented newcomer who's always negative — there will be many, many individuals that will not conform to the normal management described above, and you’ll need to adapt.</pre>


<p>Let's explore the challenging types of software engineers, understand their behaviors, and learn practical strategies to manage them. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about building great software; it's about having fun while building great teams.</p>


<h2 id="h-difficult-software-engineers">Difficult Software Engineers</h2>


<p><em>I use the term "difficult" to differentiate between those employees where everything is going smoothly, and those where more effort is required.</em></p>


<p>Why is it important to understand different types of difficult employees? Well, think of it this way - if you're trying to debug a piece of code, you first need to understand what each line of code is doing, right? Similarly, to address and manage problematic behaviors effectively, you first need to understand these behaviors, their motivations, and their impact on the team.</p>


<p>In this section, we'll explore a variety of difficult employee types that you might encounter in a software engineering team. Each of these types presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth and improvement. By understanding these behaviors, you'll be better equipped to manage them effectively, turning potential obstacles into stepping stones toward a more harmonious and productive team.</p>


<p><em>I want to note that some scenarios are hyperbolized, and I’m not a communications guru, so if you have better examples— please put them in the comments; much appreciated.</em></p>


<h3 id="the-procrastinator">The Procrastinator</h3>


<p>Imagine this: It's a week before a major software release. Your team is buzzing with activity, tying up loose ends, and running final tests. But there's one team member, let's call him Joe, who's yet to complete a crucial piece of the project. Despite repeated reminders, Joe always seems to have an excuse — the build is taking too long, or it works on my machine but is failing on staging — always promises to get it fixed by “tomorrow". This is a classic example of a Procrastinator.</p>


<p>Procrastinators tend to delay tasks, often focusing on less important tasks while ignoring the critical ones. They may have poor time management skills, often underestimating the time required to complete tasks. This behavior can lead to missed deadlines, increased stress for the team, and potential risks to the project.</p>


<p>Managing a Procrastinator requires a balance of firmness and support. Set clear deadlines and regularly check in on their progress. Make them accountable for those deadlines. Help them prioritize tasks and offer time management training if necessary. Ensure they update the Project Management tools daily with the progress made and things finished.</p>


<p><strong>Remember, the goal is not micromanaging but guiding them toward better work habits.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-lone-wolf">The Lone Wolf</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is brainstorming ideas for a new feature. Ideas are flying around, and the energy is high. But there's one person, let's call her Lisa, who's sitting quietly, not participating. Later, you find out that Lisa has gone ahead and started working on the feature without discussing her approach with the team. She assumed she knows best how to tackle the problem. This is a typical Lone Wolf scenario.</p>


<p>Lone Wolves assume they’re the most competent person and prefer to work alone, often resisting collaborative efforts — I mean, why would you need someone else’s help if they’re far inferior to you? Usually, they do not participate in team discussions unless to tell everyone that they “could’ve done that in 3 days”. While their self-reliance can sometimes be an asset, it can also lead to a lack of cohesion and potential misalignment with team goals. And most importantly — people don’t enjoy working with Lone Wolves.</p>


<pre>🏄 I see Lone Wolves as a teenager mentality. They’re stuck in this mindset that they’re the most brilliant badass coders ever.</pre>


<p>There are two ways to manage the Lone Wolf — to embrace or make them collaborate. Embracing the Lone Wolves means that this person is of very high value to your business, and keeping him comfortable is more important than the overall team morale. Not recommended, but still a possible tradeoff if the Lone Wolf is a 100x Engineer in your eyes.</p>


<p>Managing a Lone Wolf involves forcing a culture of collaboration. Encourage them to share their ideas in the meetings and involve them in team decisions more directly. It would be great if you could put them in a team where they would not be the smartest. Assign them a mentor to help them see themselves in a different light. Give them tasks that require collaboration and, most important of all — provide constructive criticism of their behavior and set ground rules for collaboration — they can either stay on the same level as they are now or grow out of this lone wolf mentality and be an even more awesome coder who people enjoy working with.</p>


<h3 id="the-negative-nancy">The Negative Nancy</h3>


<p>Let's set the scene: Your team is in a meeting discussing a new project. There's a sense of excitement in the air, a buzz of anticipation. But then there's one person, let's call him Mark, who seems to find a problem with every idea, a flaw in every plan. He constantly focuses on the negatives, rarely offers solutions, and thinks everything is impossible and the status quo is just fine. This is your typical Negative Nancy.</p>


<p>First of all — seeing issues in ideas is not a problem per se. It’s mostly the negative way the issue is portrayed. Suppose there’s a challenge that needs to be overcome to achieve the idea. In that case, Negative Nancies usually tend to say it’s impossible because of X, not that “we can make it happen if we do X and Y, which will require significant effort, but it’s still doable.”</p>


<p>Negative Nancies tend to overly focus on the negative aspects of situations, overlooking potential solutions. They may complain frequently, resist change, and spread negativity within the team. This behavior can dampen team morale and hinder creativity and innovation. “Why are they forcing us to do X? Urgh, I like how things are now.”</p>


<p>Managing a Negative Nancy involves understanding where they’re coming from — from a position of “nothing should affect my comfort, the more issues I find, the less I need to do and the less I need to move out of my comfort zone”. This negativity should be addressed directly and privately, asking them to bring solutions instead of problems. Encourage positive interactions and remind them that change will happen regardless of them and that things will move on without them if they continue to focus on the negatives. If the behavior continues, involving HR or considering whether this employee is a good fit for the team may be necessary.</p>


<h3 id="the-over-promiser">The Over-Promiser</h3>


<p>Imagine this: You're planning a new software release. One of your team members, let's call her Sarah, promises to deliver a complex functionality within a month. You're impressed by her confidence, but two weeks after she told you that “everything is fine, I’m handling it,” the functionality is nowhere near complete; even worse, it’s about 20% done. This is a classic Over-Promiser scenario.</p>


<p>Over-Promisers tend to be overly optimistic about their capabilities or the time required to complete tasks and secretive when things don’t go as planned. Even during status updates, they can say, “It’s going great,” even though they’re struggling to find a solution and face some blockers — because they still hope to finish it on time. They often fail to deliver on their promises, which leads to frustration and mistrust within the team and with the Product Owners.</p>


<pre>🏄 Over-Promisers are usually the younger developers who have not missed deadlines that often yet, and they’re still getting the hang of how much they can do and how fast.</pre>


<p>Managing an Over-Promiser involves setting realistic expectations together with the teammates — figuring out a proper deadline for this big thing that needs to be built and splitting it up into meaningful tasks (also together with the teammates) — after that, everyone agrees on how much time each of those parts will take. I don’t think there’s a way to help them make more accurate commitments besides getting more experience. If it’s a senior dev — make them accountable for the deadlines that they set. Encourage them to communicate early and openly about any challenges they're facing.</p>


<h3 id="the-know-it-all">The Know-It-All</h3>


<p>Possible Scenario: You're in a team meeting, discussing a complex problem. Different team members suggest solutions, debating pros and cons, and a healthy collaboration is happening. But then, all of a sudden, someone, let’s call him Alex, speaks up and says that he’s heard enough, everyone is stupid, all the solutions are bullshit, and his solution is the only correct one. No way you should question or poke holes in his suggestion, as nobody is more brilliant than him. He vehemently dismisses others' ideas and resists feedback. This is your typical Know-It-All.</p>


<pre>🏄 It’s very similar to lone wolf, but they don’t insist on working alone — they insist on their solution being built and praised.</pre>


<p>Know-It-Alls tend to be arrogant and closed-minded. They often lack the ability to listen to others and are highly resistant to change or new ideas. As you can imagine, this behavior is quite annoying for others who want to spar with ideas and figure out the best way to build something. Overall this stifles creativity, hinders team collaboration, and creates a hostile work environment.</p>


<p>Nobody enjoys working with the know-it-alls. They tend to shut down any, even small improvement suggestions. Imagine someone with a superiority complex — any hint that their idea is imperfect leads to a defensive discussion.</p>


<p>How to handle the know-it-all — the first step is addressing the behavior directly in a 1:1 meeting — they are likely unaware of their shortcomings, as they think everything they do is perfect. Send them this article, and tell them if they see themselves in the description above. After the confrontation — emphasize mutual respect and open-mindedness — all ideas need to be discussed/sparred/disassembled, even if they seem perfect; only then can anyone be sure the solution is correct. Encourage them to ask for feedback all the time.</p>


<p><strong>If the behavior continues, give a formal warning and consider involving HR in the meeting.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-silent-types">The Silent Type</h3>


<p>Scenario: Your team is in a lively discussion, brainstorming ideas for a new awesome feature. Everyone is participating except for one person. Let’s call her Emily. She sits quietly, not contributing to the discussion. Later, you find out that she had a great idea but didn't feel comfortable sharing it. This is a typical Silent Type scenario.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing about this type irrespective of the gender of the person. Still, I’d like to point out that female developers often have a more challenging time voicing their opinion when the team culture is similar to the frat house and values the loudest voices the most.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Silent Types, in general, tend to be introverted and may struggle with communication. Even though they might immediately see the issues with the solution, they might think, “It’s not worth it to share the concerns, to antagonize someone.” They often keep their thoughts to themselves, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for collaboration.</p>


<pre>🏄 The silent type is usually a by-product of a toxic culture where the conflicts don’t get resolved in a healthy way; hence everyone avoids them instead of dealing with them head-on. This also means other “bad” archetypes are present on the team, e.g., the know-it-all.</pre>


<p>Managing a Silent Type involves creating a safe and inclusive environment and encouraging others to speak up even when there will be conflicts of ideas. Healthy debates must happen regularly so everyone sees that voicing their opinion is not something to be afraid of. Provide various channels/platforms for communication — one-on-one meetings, meetings in a smaller group, group chats, email discussion — which may be more comfortable for them.</p>


<p><strong>But most important, recognize and value their contributions to make them feel more included even if they’re not the loudest voice in the room.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-perfectionist">The Perfectionist</h3>


<p>So, let’s set the scene: You see a Pull Request pop up from one of your team members. Let’s call him Tom. You start reviewing a piece of code — The code is well-written and does the job, but Tom is not satisfied. He's been tweaking and refining it for days, trying to make it "perfect,” eventually turning it into a one-liner. The problem? Other tasks are piling up, deadlines are looming, code looks cool only to Tom, and Tom's quest for perfection is causing delays. This is your typical Perfectionist.</p>


<p>Very often, Perfectionists are recent graduates. They tend to focus on minute details, often at the expense of the bigger picture. They may struggle with the KISS principles and delegation and have high, sometimes unrealistic, standards for themselves and others. In their mind, the code is art, and they should not be rushed while creating an art piece. This behavior leads to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and increased stress for the whole team.</p>


<p>So how can you manage a perfectionist? <strong>Easy. Lower their expectations of themselves, help them focus on what's most important — a working solution that is not-overengineered, does not read like a poem, and is maintainable in 2 years.</strong> Encourage them to prioritize simple solutions and set realistic standards. Ask them for a second opinion on the “readiness” of the code.</p>


<p>If necessary, provide coaching on time management and book suggestions to build effective coding habits.</p>


<h3 id="the-unreliable-one">The Unreliable One</h3>


<p>Scenario: You're managing a project with a tight deadline. One of your team members, let's call her Anna, is responsible for a critical part of the project. Despite her assurances that she'll complete the task on time, the deadline comes and goes, and the task is still incomplete. This is a classic Unreliable One scenario.</p>


<p>Unreliable employees are identified by their tardiness — constantly late, submitting unfinished work, and skipping meetings. They lack commitment, discipline, or time management skills. Or all three combined. Their inconsistent performance can lead to mistrust and frustration within the team and potentially (highly likely) jeopardize project timelines.</p>


<p>Managing an Unreliable One involves setting clear expectations and holding them accountable — meaning giving formal warning after the first incident. During the first incident, provide feedback on the impact of their behavior on the team and the project. If the habit continues, set up a performance improvement plan and agree transparently on future disciplinary action. Remember, reliability is a key component of a high-performing team, and addressing issues promptly and effectively is important.</p>


<p><strong>If you don’t handle the unreliable employees, you’re doing a disservice to your team, who are trying to be effective and rely on them. </strong>They will need to spend time thinking about ways to work around them rather than work with them.</p>


<h3 id="the-conflict-instigator">The Conflict Instigator</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is working harmoniously on a project, but there's one person, let's call him Jake, who seems to thrive on conflict. He makes fun of others’ code, pokes at people, and often instigates arguments, spreads rumors, or creates a hostile environment. This is your typical Conflict Instigator.</p>


<p>Conflict Instigators tend to be argumentative, aggressive, and disruptive. They thrive on drama and create a toxic work environment. This behavior can lead to decreased team morale, increased stress, and reduced productivity.</p>


<p>In my opinion (Of course, you can correct me in the comments) — There’s only one way to handle such employees — with immediate addressing of the actions in private, emphasizing the importance of staying professional and a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior in the future. If it continues — cut fast and don’t look back. It’s not worth the effort to keep them on the team. Remember, a healthy team is a productive team, and toxic conflict should be addressed promptly and effectively.</p>


<h3 id="the-burned-out-employee">The Burned-Out Employee</h3>


<p>Scenario: One of your top performers, let's call her Lisa, has been showing signs of burnout. She's been great the last year, hitting milestone after milestone, but recently she’s been working long hours, missing deadlines, and seems disengaged. She's not the enthusiastic, motivated team member she used to be. This is a typical Burned-Out Employee scenario.</p>


<pre>🏄 I don’t consider a burned-out employee as a “bad employee,” but they can still have a negative impact — they are the ones you need to help and make sure they can thrive again.</pre>


<p>Burned-out employees exhibit signs of exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. They struggle to meet deadlines, have the lowest output on the team, and make more mistakes than over the previous observable period.</p>


<p>Managing a Burned-Out Employee involves addressing the issue with as much empathy and concern as you have. Suggest they take a vacation or sabbatical. Go all-in on work-life balance and provide resources for stress management.</p>


<p>Remember, your team members are your most valuable asset, and their well-being should always be a priority.</p>


<h2 id="communication-tips">Communication Tips</h2>


<p>Managing difficult employees means figuring out ways to ensure you and your employees thrive, even if the circumstances are against you. One tool stands out as particularly crucial: communication. In a software engineering team, clear and effective communication is not just a nice-to-have; it's a must-have. Bad communication is the reason teams fail.</p>


<p>Think about it. How often have you seen a project go off track due to a simple misunderstanding? How many conflicts could have been avoided with better communication? How many great ideas have been lost in the noise of poor communication?</p>


<h3 id="nonviolent-communication">Nonviolent Communication</h3>


<p>One powerful communication tool I've found particularly useful is Nonviolent Communication (NVC). Developed by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg, NVC is a method of communication that promotes empathy and understanding.</p>


<p>At its core, NVC involves four steps: Observation, Feeling, Need, and Request.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong> involves stating the facts we observe that are affecting our well-being.</li>


<li><strong>Feeling</strong> is about sharing how we feel in relation to what we observe.</li>


<li><strong>Need</strong> is expressing what we need or value that is causing our feelings.</li>


<li><strong>Request</strong> involves clearly requesting what we want without demanding it.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a management context, NVC can be a game-changer. It can help you communicate effectively with your team, constructively address issues, and build strong, positive relationships.</p>


<p>I’m not going to talk much about it, but I’m going to give you some links to read:</p>

</ul>


<h3 id="active-listening-and-empathy">Active Listening and Empathy</h3>


<p>As a manager, your role is not just to talk; it's also to listen. Active listening is a crucial skill that involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, and responding thoughtfully. It's not just about hearing the words; it's about understanding the emotions, ideas, and thoughts behind those words.</p>


<pre>🏄 My business partner, who’s a great salesperson, has this rule — after someone finishes talking to you — wait a few seconds before responding, organize your thoughts, and process what they said, only after you’re sure they’ve said everything they wanted to do you respond to them.</pre>


<p>Active listening can be improved through paraphrasing, asking open-ended questions, and showing empathy. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, plays a crucial role in management. Cultivating compassion involves being open to others' perspectives, showing genuine interest in their experiences, and responding with kindness and understanding. <strong>Simply put, before you judge anyone as a "difficult" employee, you put yourself in their shoes and see from their side.</strong> Talk with them, listen, we're all humans.</p>


<p>Your role is not just to lead; it's also to support, understand, and inspire.</p>


<h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next?</h2>


<p>Once you've identified and understood the types of difficult employees in your team and have communicated effectively with them, the question arises - what's the next step? What are the options? This section will guide you through the subsequent stages, from implementing Performance Improvement Plans to escalating issues when necessary.</p>


<h3 id="performance-improvement-plans">Performance Improvement Plans</h3>


<p><strong>If, after many 1:1s with the person, you could not find a solution that helps both — the employee and the company — and they still continue behavior, it's time to make it formal.</strong></p>


<p>A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a formal document that outlines an employee's performance issues and the steps they need to take to improve. It's an escalation tool that can help managers address performance issues in a structured, supportive manner.</p>


<p>A PIP may be necessary when an employee's performance is consistently not meeting expectations, despite feedback and coaching. It's a step that should be taken when other, less formal interventions have not resulted in any improvement.</p>


<p>Implementing a PIP involves several steps — first, clearly outline the performance issues and the expected improvements. Then, set realistic, measurable goals and a timeline for achieving them. Provide support and resources to help the employee improve, and schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress.</p>


<p>Monitoring progress is crucial. Regular feedback can help the employee understand where they're improving and where they still need to work. Remember, the goal of a PIP is not to punish but to support the employee in their transformation and to improve their performance.</p>


<p>To illustrate, let's consider a case study. An engineer in our team was consistently missing deadlines and marking tickets as done that would later be returned from the QA as unfinished. We implemented a PIP, setting clear expectations and defining strict rules how the behavior needed to change. Regular check-ins helped keep the engineer on track, and within a few months, their performance had significantly improved. The key lessons? Making it formal — helps a lot. It’s like getting a police ticket; people tend to react more seriously when you make it clear that it’s already escalating.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-escalate">Time to Escalate</h3>


<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, an issue may need to be escalated. This could be due to persistent performance issues, serious misconduct, or if the employee's behavior negatively affects the team, e.g., with the conflict instigator.</p>


<p>Documenting the issue is crucial. Keep a record of the performance issues, the steps taken to address them, and the employee's response. This documentation can provide a clear picture of the problem and the efforts made to resolve it.</p>


<p>When escalating an issue, follow your organization's procedures. This may involve discussing the matter with HR or higher management. Remember, escalation is not a failure on your part as a manager. It's a step towards resolving an issue that's beyond your control. It's about ensuring a positive, productive work environment for your entire team.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-part-ways">Time to Part Ways</h3>


<p>There will come a time when, despite all efforts to improve a situation, it becomes clear that an employee is not a good fit for the team or the organization. This is a difficult realization and one that should not be taken lightly.</p>


<p>Termination should be considered when an employee's behavior or performance is consistently and significantly below expectations, despite repeated feedback, coaching, and support. Other reasons might include severe misconduct or an evident lack of alignment with the company's values or culture.</p>


<p>Termination is a last resort and should be considered only when all other avenues have been exhausted. It's a decision that can significantly impact the individual and the team, so it's crucial to handle it with care.</p>


<p>The process should be clear, fair, and transparent. The employee should be informed of the decision in a private, face-to-face meeting, and the reasons for the termination should be explained clearly. Treat the employee, even if you think they’re a “bad employee,” with respect and dignity throughout the process. Offer support where possible, and provide feedback to help them in their future careers.</p>


<p>Managing difficult employees is not just about addressing problematic habits; it's about understanding these behaviors, communicating effectively, and guiding your team members toward improvement. </p>


<p>Everyone has to have a second chance at becoming better.</p>

              I personally believe in: "If you're building a road, build it like a runway. But if you have to do it in an hour with two people, start with something your customer can just travel on, but reliably” (Quality is paramount, but if time and resources are at play, ensure a reliable, quality barebone MVP first)".
            </li><br>
            <li>
              You can probably win a hackathon by going at tachyon speed, compromizing quality and structure. But good luck making a customer happy with that! Check the <a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow" target="_blank">evolution of nps </a>if you like!

They talk about getting lucky or unlucky on the Q3 and Q4 on CodeSignal. It feels like getting into Big Tech pretty much just means getting good at competitive programming—if you pass the test, you get the job.</p><p>LeetCode is definitely good for improving at programming in the long run. I haven’t been to Google, so I’m not sure, but you might actually need LeetCode to get a job there. But for Apple (and many other places), you definitely don’t need it, and I’d recommend that you don’t spend too much time grinding it.</p><p>I interned at Apple over the summer. Apple is unique in the hiring process that interviews are completely team-dependent. Some teams might ask you to do LeetCode, but in my case, I didn’t even have a technical interview.</p><p>Recently I’ve been asked a lot on how I got the job, so I’m going to summarize the process here instead of responding to every DM. I’ll go over how I learned Swift, the main programming language that I use. I’ll talk about the recruitment process, the interview experience, and anything else that I can remember.

I was able to avoid this by jumping right into the app dev process — I’d code until I didn’t know what do and then search up a solution. I wasn’t worried about efficiency or the “best way” to do something—you naturally learn this stuff after doing it for a while. Angela’s course was useful for getting started, but to get a good grasp at what you’re doing, you should be building projects.</p><p><span>Another thing that helped was Stack Overflow. It’s been kind of dead ever since ChatGPT showed up (and also the community is not at all friendly for newbies), but I’d still recommend </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">making an account</a><span>. You’ll be able to ask questions, but more importantly, you can answer other people’s questions. “Learn by teaching” as they say.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, it’s 2023 now and Angela’s course is outdated :( so I’d recommend starting with Paul Hudson’s </span><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">100 Days of SwiftUI</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">100 Days of Swift</a><span>.

I remember that my manager specifically pointed out that he didn’t care about where I went to school or my GPA — he said something like “it only matters what you can do.” That day I also met one of my future coworkers, who gave me some tips on improving Find’s scrolling performance.</p><p>In February 2023 I went back to campus to meet the rest of the team. I talked with another manager about old age, college, and kids. It was really chill, but this was probably the behavioral assessment — they wanted to make sure I wasn’t some complete weirdo.</p><p>There was no LeetCode or technical interview. I signed the offer letter in March.</p><p><span>Obviously, this wasn’t your normal entry-level big tech interview process. I asked some other interns about their experiences — most people had a coding problem (one of my friends got two-sum, the first question on LeetCode) and the personality interview was more important. But I’m sure that at a higher position, for full-timers, there’s plenty of people who get recruited and get fast-tracked in the process. There’s nothing stopping you from taking shortcuts or a different pathway when applying for jobs. Do something different, like DM’ing the lead for the team you want to join. Make them </span><em>want</em><span> to hire you, and the interview turns into a free tour of HQ, lunch included.</span></p><p>Working at Apple was more work than I expected. I thought I’d be going in, having lunch, then leaving. I saw vlogs from people at Meta showing off the rock climbing wall and bowling alley that they had right in the office. My friend from Google was talking about how she had a couple meetings per day and the rest was just free time.</p><p>Well, not at Apple. I was there from 8 to 8, to catch the shuttle. Before my intern presentation I was working up until 12 (but that’s on me and my bad time management). You had to pay for breakfast/lunch/dinner and even the gym ($18/month). The prices were fair, but it’s not like the free food and stuff you get from the rest of big tech.</p><p>It was really fun. I was doing what I’d been doing for several years, but this time I was getting paid. I met some really cool interns and people from the design team who were absolutely cracked.</p><p>We had free corporate housing (got to be 18+ for this, so my friend actually had to live with his cousin) in this brand-new complex in Mountain View. The doors had smart locks on them that seemed cool, but were always broken. There was a hot tub on the roof complete with pool table and everything.</p><p>About the work, I was there from June 5th to August 11, so my time was relatively short and I had to cram to finish my stuff near the end. The corporate structure was definitely way different from what I was used to, but it’s well managed and gets stuff done. If you get the chance, Apple’s really worth checking out.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3316696,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Apple Park at night</figcaption></figure></div><p>When I go on r/csCareerQuestions on reddit there’s so many posts about LeetCode, DP (dynamic programming, not double penetration), FAANG, etc… there’s people sharing tips on how to “crack the interview” and people saying “the best approach is repetition.”</p><p>I feel like people are so fixated on LeetCode and all these other coding questions that they’re forgetting that this is just one path to getting a job. There’s plenty of other ways that aren’t as hard and don’t require hours grinding over some dumb problem. Is it really worth grinding so much? Studying the most advanced Data Structures and Algorithms that you’ll easily learn just from building? And after getting the job, are you even going to use the stuff that you spent so much time practicing? </p><p>But it’s true lots of companies now just use LeetCode as their main differentiator in hiring. We can thank Google for this flawed hiring process—asking the same boring, time-consuming questions that test for proficiency in a roundabout way. Is it a coincidence that Apple was the only Big Tech company that didn’t do layoffs?</p><p>The LeetCode craze is a real problem in the field. Sometimes it feels like all the high-paying jobs require it, and as a result we see all these people burning themselves out over useless questions when they could be developing their skills organically.</p><p>Eventually I think Big Tech and the rest of the industry will move away from LeetCode and shift to project-based interviews. They might give you a take-home assignment and you can show them how applicable and relevant your skills are. But until then, I’d recommend working on cool side projects and doing stuff that matters. You’ll become irresistible :)</p><p>I’ll be going to college in September, so I can’t speak much on it yet. I just know that it’s not necessary and even not applicable for some roles, like iOS dev. So don’t stress if you didn’t learn a thing.</p><p><span>How do I fix my career? I'm a Software Engineer who learned northing during college. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15swcy4/how_do_i_fix_my_career_im_a_software_engineer_who/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Reddit</a></p><p>So that’s how I got my job at Apple without going to college or doing a single LeetCode question. But I’m not saying that you should drop out or stop doing LeetCode completely — you need college for stuff like ML research and you need LeetCode for backend. It’s just that I see a lot of people just trying to get a job — any job — in tech, and they constrain themselves to a specific role or profile. That’s definitely not the play in this horrible job market.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p><span>Leave a comment or ping me on Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/aheze0" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">@aheze0</a><span> anytime.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

If anyone's interested in learning more about this, I posted this on reddit and answered a bunch of questions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mv68gv/photos_designed_and_3d_printed_my_own_manual/" target="_blank">here</a>!</i></p><p>It's been a minute hasn't it? :)</p><p>A lot has changed since the last post (no more drones, moved to a new town, had a kid...), including the dumpster fire that is 2020. As of 7 months ago, the world changed in a completely unexpected way and during quarantine, I found myself craving a completely unexpected thing...</p><p>At <a href="https://www.bresslergroup.com/" target="_blank">Bresslergroup</a>&nbsp;where I work, the office has always had a handful of coffee dorks (I use that term affectionately) and as a result, we have a fairly large amount of coffee production paraphernalia...including an espresso machine.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvpae_UtIgk/X35tJWPkJPI/AAAAAAACMuo/anM5lBHaXNgrXZkBciGCCivSfyl77u5FACLcBGAsYHQ/s2355/81RfdzPfrQL.jpg"><img data-original-height="2025" data-original-width="2355" height="550" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvpae_UtIgk/X35tJWPkJPI/AAAAAAACMuo/anM5lBHaXNgrXZkBciGCCivSfyl77u5FACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h550/81RfdzPfrQL.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>I must confess that when we first got the machine, I still thought it was pronounced "expresso" and didn't have a clue about the differences between it and coffee. Over time, I learned the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#:~:text=The%20act%20of%20producing%20a,the%20coffee%20at%20high%20pressure." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pulling a shot</a>, how <a href="https://coffeebros.com/blog/guide-to-coffee-grind-size/" target="_blank">grind profile</a> and bean type affected taste and the actual extraction process...but mostly I just wanted that sweet, syrupy elixir.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't until I was completely deprived of my usual mid afternoon caffeine break that I realized how much I missed espresso. I inherited a used <a href="https://amzn.to/30LnP4Z" target="_blank">hand grinder</a> from a friend, bought some specialty beans for the first time in my life from a <a href="https://www.lucid.coffee/" target="_blank">local coffee shop</a>, and proceeded to make pourover each morning using the most jank setup my cheap self could manage:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2FIib0OHUs/X35uR5TUFcI/AAAAAAACMu0/Ixx9ry8kEykJ9g-GcqBN-N0fwMB4Ru6kACLcBGAsYHQ/s848/sdfadf.PNG"><img data-original-height="848" data-original-width="724" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2FIib0OHUs/X35uR5TUFcI/AAAAAAACMu0/Ixx9ry8kEykJ9g-GcqBN-N0fwMB4Ru6kACLcBGAsYHQ/w546-h640/sdfadf.PNG" width="546"></a></p><p>Despite how it looks, this setup actually worked really well. Inconvenient? Mildly. Inexpensive? Oh baby, yes. Was I dogged with thoughts about whether or not this method <i>actually</i>&nbsp;brewed good coffee? Day and night.&nbsp;Although this managed to scratch the caffeine itch for at least a month, my overwhelming <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo" target="_blank">FOMO</a> and the fortuitous closing of a local Sur La Table led to the (very cheap) purchase of these two goodies:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ta16wnitg8c/X35z-KUWpKI/AAAAAAACMvQ/Y8YYI8ppawITJyh7S_31sEutzb--3ObMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1147/sdfasdfasdfasd.PNG"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1147" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ta16wnitg8c/X35z-KUWpKI/AAAAAAACMvQ/Y8YYI8ppawITJyh7S_31sEutzb--3ObMQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/sdfasdfasdfasd.PNG" width="640"></a></p><p><i>Things are starting to look a little bit more respectable.</i></p><p>I had heard a lot about the much lauded&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3jKUvmw" target="_blank">AeroPress</a>, especially from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ" target="_blank">James Hoffmann</a> (a veritable David Attenborough of all things coffee, quite a delight to listen to!) who highly recommends the brewer due to how forgiving it is with producing great coffee, even with subpar technique. After trying it for a few days, I realized I didn't much like the taste of <a href="http://www.craftcoffeeguru.com/immersion-vs-drip-pour-over-coffee-brewing/#:~:text=Immersion%20coffee%20brewing%20is%20any,Clever%20Dripper%20or%20an%20Aeropress.&amp;text=Once%20you're%20ready%2C%20you,cup%20of%20immersion%2Dbrewed%20coffee!" target="_blank">immersion brewing</a> and turned my attention to its much flashier partner, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3dfuut5" target="_blank">Melitta style #2 coffee filter cone</a>. Now I could finally make pourovers for guests without having to apologize for my janky setup.</p><p>None of this was espresso though and despite being cheaper, <a href="https://www.roastycoffee.com/manual-vs-automatic-espresso-machines/#:~:text=Favored%20by%20the%20traditionalists%2C%20manual,needed%20to%20pull%20a%20shot." target="_blank">manual espresso machines</a> like the <a href="https://www.flairespresso.com/product-page/flair-signature-pro-2" target="_blank">Flair</a>&nbsp;and highly regarded <a href="https://www.cafelatstore.com/products/robotpowdercoating" target="_blank">Cafelat Robot</a> were both well out of my budget (I mean c'mon, I spent an embarrassing amount of time at the supermarket debating whether or not I should spend <i>one cent</i>&nbsp;more per filter on unbleached paper vs. bleached paper). I found myself falling deep<i>&nbsp;</i>into the rabbit hole of coffee research, digging up old <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/" target="_blank">Home-Barista</a> forum posts, reading Amazon reviews of products that claimed to make espresso, and binge watching videos on tamping techniques, grinder types, and even roasting coffee. The more I read, the more I realized that the cheapest way to do this was to just to DIY it.</p><p>And so, a week later, this was staring back at me in CAD:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-7lOmsbTYA/X36Cx39lp-I/AAAAAAACMvk/u2ZN9dC9mwkmCqqP2F38P1Oai6sYZ7SawCLcBGAsYHQ/s830/proofofconcept.PNG"><img data-original-height="830" data-original-width="634" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-7lOmsbTYA/X36Cx39lp-I/AAAAAAACMvk/u2ZN9dC9mwkmCqqP2F38P1Oai6sYZ7SawCLcBGAsYHQ/w488-h640/proofofconcept.PNG" width="488"></a></p><p><i>Uhhh...what the heck am I looking at?</i></p><p>Maybe I should back up a bit and explain: what exactly <i>is </i>espresso? The short answer is "what comes out when you force nearly boiling water through finely ground coffee beans at very high pressure". For a more eloquent and detailed explanation, read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso" target="_blank">wiki article</a>. It's what's served in Italy when you ask for coffee or "un caffè por favore" because that's where it originated (<a href="https://italyexplained.com/italian-coffee-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">fun fact, if you sit down instead of waiting at the bar for your espresso, you'll be charged more</a>). It's fuller bodied, more intense, and arguably more flavorful than regular 'ol coffee and requires the aforementioned special (read: expensive) equipment to produce. </p><p><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2425/8607/articles/Bottomless-Portafilter-Espresso-Extraction-Detail_23462530-15d2-487c-98e0-4d69f12b278d_2400x.jpg?v=1563398660"><img data-original-height="533" data-original-width="800" height="427" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2425/8607/articles/Bottomless-Portafilter-Espresso-Extraction-Detail_23462530-15d2-487c-98e0-4d69f12b278d_2400x.jpg?v=1563398660" width="640"></a></p><p><i>Mmmm doesn't that just look </i>so<i>&nbsp;good?</i></p><p>The key to good espresso is the high pressure (among other things). Specifically almost 9x atmospheric pressure, or about 131 psi. For reference, your car tires are (only) filled to <b>30-35</b> psi! Most <a href="https://coffeemachinewarehouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/La-Marzocco-Linea-Classic-7.jpeg" target="_blank">semi-automatic espresso machines like the one in your local coffee shop</a> use high pressure water pumps to hit that pressure. Manual machines like the ones I talked about above need even more effort by requiring the user to manually press down on levers with moderate to high force to generate the same pressures. See below:</p>

Instead, I settled on the simpler idea of harnessing the power of compressed gas. Instead of using a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage" target="_blank">mechanical advantage</a> lever to push a piston, compressed CO2 would be dispensed from a small and inexpensive <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/1131/7305/products/Threaded_16g_Co2_Cartridge_1024x1024.jpg?v=1530133590" target="_blank">12g or 16g cartridge</a> which would then generate the requisite pressure to properly extract espresso. This concept is not actually novel; both an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1930097708/sippy-espresso-maker-on-the-go?ref=discovery" target="_blank">unsuccessful kickstarter</a> and a <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/reviews/mypressi-twist-second-look-t12595.html" target="_blank">now-defunct handheld espresso maker</a> (with a <a href="https://mypressi.com/" target="_blank">fanatical user base</a>) employed this mechanism. <i>(EDIT: See the end of this post regarding concerns about CO2 potentially affecting flavor)</i></p><p>What about the brew chamber? Well, in <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Lever-Espresso-Machine/" target="_blank">some lever designs</a>&nbsp;which use conventional portafilter baskets and handles, the water chamber is separate by necessity which leads to more parts. I really loved the design of the <a href="https://www.cafelatstore.com/products/robot-basket" target="_blank">Cafelat Robot basket</a>, which holds <i>both</i> the water and the coffee grounds in a very simple setup that requires no preheating. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.francescoceccarelli.eu/Macchine/Faema/baby_faemina/baby_v.1.0_verde_215_eng.htm" target="_blank">Faema Baby</a> lever machine from the 1960s, this setup, though unconventional, has a <i>very </i>loyal following.

Also some have wondered about whether or not the liquid CO2 would lower the temperature of the water. Considering we only need 2g of CO2 and that it already boils before hitting the brew chamber (not to mention water's insanely high specific heat), I have not noticed any noticeable drop in temp during extraction. I use compressed air now and also have not noticed a difference.)</i></p></div>

Dart 3.1 contains a handful of minor updates and a few API adjustments to further use class modifiers introduced in 3.0 (which you can read more about in the </em><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#310" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>changelog</em></a><em>). Mostly, though, we’ve been spending our time on new roadmap items that we hope to see reach beta and stable over the coming releases. Stay tuned for more about that in the future!</em></p><p id="c46f"><em>So, in place of a traditional release post, we’re revisiting a subset of Dart 3’s major features to talk about how they can completely change, and in some cases, greatly improve the way you write and structure your Dart code.</em></p></div><div><h2 id="0796">How do you model data?</h2><p id="752b">Object-oriented (OO) and functional languages differ in many ways, but it’s arguable that <em>how each paradigm models data</em> is the defining characteristic that separates them. Specifically, the question of modeling different variations of related data and the operations on those variants.</p><p id="5eaa">But <em>“how should I model this data?”</em> is usually not something we consciously give much thought to when starting a new project. We tend to default to whatever data modeling paradigm is common to the type of language we’re using, as opposed to the inverse of choosing the language based on the model that makes the most sense for our data.</p><p id="7e1e">If you’re using an OO language, you’ll model data with class hierarchies and operations on subtypes. If you’re using certain functional languages, the equivalent to the class hierarchy model is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">algebraic data type</a> model, whose equivalent to operating on subtypes is switching over them with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Simplified side-by-side comparison of the object-oriented class hierarchy model and the functional algebraic data type model</figcaption></figure><p id="189d">Dart is an object-oriented language, but has been steadily incorporating functional features over time, allowing for a more multi-paradigm approach to data modeling. Most recently, Dart 3 added <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a>, new functionality on <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#switch-statements-and-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">switch</a>, and <a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed types</a>. These features make it possible to implement algebraic data types in Dart, allowing you to write functional style code while continuing to maximize the capabilities of Dart’s object-oriented core.</p><p id="782e">Multi-paradigm languages like Dart give you the tools and the opportunity to choose how you design anything from a single line expression, to entire class hierarchies. You can consider which model makes the most sense for your project, or even just for your personal preference. To help you make the best decision, this article summarizes the structure and strengths of each paradigm separately, and then teaches you how to use new features in Dart 3 to refactor some classic object-oriented designs that most benefit from being written in a functional style.</p><h2 id="f3be">Object-oriented approach</h2><p id="077c">When you have operations specific to different data types, the standard organization approach in OO languages is to create a method on a base class, and a set of subclasses that override the base class to define their unique behavior. Each subclass has its data and operations together in one place inside its declaration.</p><p id="7024">Take this (high-level pseudocode) example of modeling recipes. It makes sense to have recipe objects, coupling ingredients and steps together with the recipe. The recipe base class would probably have some functions for the cooking methods that each recipe overrides with their unique requirements:</p><figure></figure><p id="4989">Class hierarchies with instance methods make it easy to add new subclasses without having to touch any existing code. This works perfectly for some domains, like Flutter, where you have countless widgets that all extend the <code>Widget</code> class. Each widget can uniquely extend and override any necessary behavior directly inside their definition. You <em>definitely</em> don’t need to know how every widget subtype defines its methods to add specialized behavior to your own widgets.</p><h2 id="ff91">Functional approach (algebraic data types)</h2><p id="4f68">You can think of functional style architecture as the inverse of OO architecture. Instead of having all the code for <em>one type in one place</em> (OO instance methods in subclass declarations), you have all the code for <em>one operation in one place</em> (functional switching over types to define behavior).</p><p id="954a">Which begs the question, when <em>does</em> it make sense to know how every subtype in a hierarchy defines an operation? It could be for a few reasons:</p><ul><li id="9d30">When adding, maintaining, and understanding variants of the same operation’s behavior across types is easier to do when they’re all side by side in the code.</li><li id="11c7">When you can’t modify the subclasses yourself, but you want to define new behavior that is specific to each of them.</li><li id="0322">When the variations of an operation’s behavior for different types are more related to each other than they are to the types that they’re operating on<em>.</em></li></ul><p id="829a">Sometimes it’s obvious, but mostly it’s just a perspective shift. Think about the recipe example again. From the point of view of, say, an oven manual, it would make a lot more sense to group bake instructions together in one place for each recipe:</p><figure></figure><p id="c41e">In this example, the program structure is focused on the <code>bake</code> operation. Whatever types <code>bake</code> operates on are simply different possible outputs of the same function; <code>bake</code> is independent of the types it operates on.</p><p id="dc9c">This is the <strong>algebraic data type model </strong>(named “algebraic” after mathematical set theory). It’s the core organizational model of functional languages, in the same way class hierarchies are core to OO languages. Algebraic data types separate behavior from data by grouping behavior for all types together by operation.</p><p id="5639">And now, it’s possible to cohesively implement algebraic data types with Dart 3!</p><h2 id="170c">Modeling object oriented algebraic data types</h2><p id="302b">Functional languages generally implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">algebraic data types</a> by pattern matching over the cases in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sum type</a> to assign behavior to each variant. Dart 3 achieves the same with <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#switch-statements-and-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a> in switch cases, and takes advantage of the fact that OO subtyping already naturally models sum types. This allows us to implement truly <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#algebraic-data-types" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">multi-paradigm algebraic data types</a> using objects that blend into Dart seamlessly.</p><p id="e835">The following sections show you how to design algebraic data type models in Dart, alongside pre-Dart 3 examples of the same functionality.</p><ul><li id="6a4b">First, we’ll explain how to group type-based variants of an operation together by switching over <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">object patterns</a>.</li><li id="5d72">Then, we’ll take a step back and look at how to architect the subclasses themselves with the new <a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed</a> class modifier, to ensure the switch defines behavior for <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#exhaustiveness-checking" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">all possible subtypes the object might take</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="db12">Grouping behaviors across types</h2><p id="43c2">Individual parts of the Dart language (like statements, classes, and literals) each have their own definitions in class hierarchies, but are all subject to operations from multiple systems (such as parser, formatter, and compiler operations). Imagine how confusing the language implementation would be if every function that applied to every language element had to be defined inside those elements’ declarations! It would look something like this:</p><figure></figure><p id="fc20">Dart’s internal code already naturally leans towards the functional approach of separating functions from type definitions for this reason. Take the <code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/analyzer/lib/src/error/annotation_verifier.dart" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">annotation_verifier</a></code> library in Dart’s analyzer. It contains functions that define behavior for annotations (like <code>@override</code> or <code>@deprecated</code>) depending on the part of code the annotation is attached to (like how <code>@override</code> affects a class as opposed to a field).</p><p id="8ebd">But assigning behavior per type is not as straightforward as making the decision to separate the behavior out in the first place. The standard way to define behaviors by type uses chained <code>if-else</code> statements, which you see a lot in the annotation verifier. Take the following verification function written without using any Dart 3 features. It verifies the behavior of the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/4079a47cc4fb8f88e2dd9b7faff3bd587931a379" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">recently contributed</a> <code>@visibleOutsideTemplate</code> annotation that opts out of the cascading effects of another annotation, <code>@visibleForTemplate</code>:</p><figure></figure><p id="f8a6">The function uses elaborate chained <code>if-else</code> statements, testing whether the grandparent of the annotation is a certain kind of declaration (either <code>ClassDeclaration</code>, <code>EnumDeclaration</code>, or <code>MixinDeclaration</code>), and then defining its behavior based on the type.</p><p id="8380">With Dart 3, you can use object patterns in switch cases to significantly refactor this structure to a more declarative style, making it shorter and easier to read. And the original author <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/4079a47cc4fb8f88e2dd9b7faff3bd587931a379/pkg/analyzer/lib/src/error/annotation_verifier.dart#L417-L426" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">did just that</a>! 16 lines of chained <code>if-else</code> statements are pared down to a 7-line switch statement:</p><figure></figure><p id="c090">Each case here is an <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">object pattern</a> that matches against the static type of <code>grandparent</code>. Instead of saying <code>if (object is Type &amp;&amp; object.property != null)</code>, each case checks if the object’s pattern matches the pattern <code>Type(propertyOfType)</code>. Plus, when an object matches an object pattern, it implicitly requires that it’s not <code>null</code>, so there’s no need for an explicit null check!</p><p id="293c">Object patterns can also contain nested <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#variable" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">variable patterns</a> that allow you to extract (or <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#destructuring" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>destructure</em></a>) property values from an object in the same line of code you’re matching against. The syntax <code>(:var metadata)</code> just means “match and declare a new variable with the same name as this getter”. This is how the variable <code>metadata</code> comes into scope for the final for loop. Pretty concise!</p><p id="9df7">Notice that the <code>for</code> loop is now common between each case. Each type’s <code>declaredElement</code> property is actually a different subtype of another type, <code>InterfaceElement</code> (either a <code>classElement</code>, <code>enumElement</code>, or <code>mixinElement</code>). So, the pre-Dart 3 chained <code>if-else</code> statement iterated over <code>metadata</code> in each <code>if</code> clause separately, to ensure <code>final annotation</code> would be type safe for each of the possible types that <code>metadata</code> could take.</p><p id="db57">Now, the refactored structure uses deeply nested object patterns for each case, to upcast <code>metadata</code> to its supertype, <code>InterfaceElement</code>. This makes a single shared <code>for</code> loop iterating over <code>metadata</code> type safe across the cases.</p><figure><figcaption>Annotated depiction of the syntax for a deeply nested object and variable patterns</figcaption></figure><p id="7482">Switching over object patterns matters to Dart’s algebraic data type implementation because of its ability to concisely test subtypes and destructure values. A nice side effect is the simultaneous assurances that can be provided by a single line of code. To reiterate, each case pattern in this refactor is simultaneously verifying:</p><ul><li id="cf86">The object is one of the types <code>ClassDeclaration</code>, <code>EnumDeclaration</code>, or <code>MixinDeclaration</code>.</li><li id="a3b7">The object has the property <code>declaredElement</code>.</li><li id="9a7b"><code>declaredElement</code> has the property <code>metadata</code>.</li><li id="4be8"><code>metadata</code> is of type <code>InterfaceElement</code>.</li><li id="5d46">None of the objects or properties in question are <code>null</code>.</li></ul><p id="3739">This is the perfect example of how thoroughly Dart 3 implements patterns to account for so many nuances of OO languages, and really make object-oriented algebraic data types a realistic design option in Dart.</p><p id="ab03">Type tests over object patterns are great for separating behavior from types. But its missing one feature of OO subtyping, where the compiler lets you know if you declare a new subtype but don’t define behavior for one of its supertype’s abstract methods. How can Dart’s algebraic data type model implement the same safety assurances when we’re no longer dealing with instance methods on type declarations? The answer is <em>exhaustiveness checking</em>.</p><h2 id="94da">Exhaustiveness checking</h2><p id="b090">Functional languages’ implementations of algebraic data types use enumerable sum types, which means the compiler is always aware of all the possible variations of the type being switched over. The compiler can then let you know if your switch is missing a case, and therefore that it’s possible some values might fall through that switch without being addressed.</p><p id="f965">This is called <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#exhaustiveness-checking" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">exhaustiveness checking</a>. It has technically always existed in Dart for enumerable types like enums and booleans. Those types have a set of possible values that cannot change, and if you’re switching over them, the compiler knows when you’ve missed one and warns you. Using a <code>default</code> clause is another kind of pseudo exhaustiveness. Since <code>default</code> matches all cases not explicitly accounted for, it causes the compiler to consider a switch exhaustive without knowing if all potential types are actually accounted for.</p><p id="74ae">As mentioned, we wanted to use subtypes instead of sum types for Dart’s version of algebraic data type modeling. But since classes in Dart can be extended from any library, it would be impossible for the compiler to exhaustively enumerate subtypes of a class since it can’t know if any subclasses are declared in external libraries.</p><p id="3ac5">To get around this and complete Dart’s algebraic data type implementation, we added the <code><a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed</a></code><a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> class modifier</a> to Dart 3. A <code>sealed</code> class cannot be extended or implemented from any library but its own (<a href="https://dart.dev/language/libraries" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the file that contains its definition</a>). This ensures the compiler is always aware of any and all possible subtypes, making them fully enumerable.</p><p id="ef6d">Here’s an example of an actual refactor that went into the Dart SDK as part of the 3.1 release: <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/c3e815bc7ad488eddf00344ab4106485a9d1ba32#diff-e98c6de423bf7e0b5b961cd10efed50330004229243aa87c18ad6314fef054b0L879-R879" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealing </a><code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/c3e815bc7ad488eddf00344ab4106485a9d1ba32#diff-e98c6de423bf7e0b5b961cd10efed50330004229243aa87c18ad6314fef054b0L879-R879" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FileSystemEvent</a></code> so its subtypes can be exhaustively switched over. Brace yourself, refactors are hard…</p><figure></figure><p id="b9a5">Just kidding, that wasn’t hard at all! It should be noted, though, that sealing an existing class hierarchy is a breaking change. Code targeting older versions of Dart won’t be able to implement or extend the class, so always check dependencies and alert any users that might be subtyping your classes elsewhere.</p><p id="2a5f">Sealing <code>FileSystemEvent</code> allows the events produced by <code>FileSystemEntity.watch</code>, which correspond to the subtypes of <code>FileSystemEvent</code>, to be exhaustively switched over. It’s typical to listen to this stream of events and use <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/52273" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">chained </a><code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/52273" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">if-else</a></code> statements to determine an action based on the type of the events that occur.</p><p id="a1ce">But sealing the base class doesn’t only allow you to switch over object patterns, like the <code>_checkVisibleOutsideTemplate</code> example in the previous section. It also ensures that while doing so, you’re accounting for every possible value that could arise for that type, without the need for a <code>default</code> case:</p><figure></figure><p id="521e">If a new subtype was ever added that extends <code>FileSystemEvent</code>, perhaps <code>FileSystemSyncEvent</code> for example, the compiler would be aware of it because it could only be added to the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/sdk/lib/io/file_system_entity.dart" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">same library</a> as <code>FileSystemEvent</code>. Since the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler requires any switch over its instances to be exhaustive, and will generate <a href="https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#non_exhaustive_switch_expression" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">an error</a> to alert the user (who wrote the switch, not the library owner) of unhandled cases:</p><pre><span id="d150">The type 'FileSystemEvent' is not exhaustively matched by the switch cases since it doesn't match 'FileSystemSyncEvent'</span></pre><p id="870d">Combining sealed classes and switches over object patterns enables a complete, object-oriented algebraic data type style of program architecture in Dart.</p><h2 id="2454">Bonus functional features</h2><p id="df8c">The exhaustive switch example above includes even more functional features from Dart 3 than just the ones that facilitate algebraic data types.</p><p id="e96c">Notice that the switch is to the right of the <code>_fileListener</code> function’s return statement—that’s Dart 3’s new <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">switch expression</a>. General emphasis on expressions and functions is a key element of functional languages. Dart 3 made switch expressions that can produce a value and go anywhere an expression is allowed.</p><p id="7a31">And what is <code>_fileListener</code> returning in the previous example, anyway? That’s a <a href="https://dart.dev/language/records" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">record</a>, another new Dart 3 feature also related to functional programming. Records let you return multiple heterogeneous values from a function, extending the usefulness of functions in Dart, and moving further away from reliance on custom classes (which would be the only other way to return multiple values of different types without losing their types in the process).</p><h2 id="7cbc">Summary</h2><p id="f975">You can model algebraic data types in Dart by:</p><ul><li id="1a21">Writing a function that switches <em>on</em> an instance of a sealed class, and <em>over</em> its subtypes,</li><li id="10ba">And defining variances in the behavior of each subtype in the switch cases.</li></ul><p id="18c7">Switching over object patterns allows you to keep all the operations together in a succinct way, and exhaustiveness checking ensures the compiler will alert you if you’re missing behavior definitions for any types. And it’s all built on top of the object-oriented classes Dart already uses.</p><p id="a0bc">The best part is, you don’t have to pick either an object-oriented or functional style; the two paradigms blend together and you can use whichever style best fits the operation you’re defining.</p><p id="b1cc">You can make existing class hierarchies more functional with minor modifications, and even mix the use of instance methods with algebraic data types within the same class hierarchy. Whether it makes sense to couple behavior closely to a type, or group behavior for different types in one function, you can use the style that makes the most sense.</p><p id="9caf">We hope this introduction piques your interest in functional programming and trying out the new Dart 3 features.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>The New York Times</em> and OpenAI could end up in court. </p><p>Lawyers for the newspaper are exploring whether to sue OpenAI to protect the intellectual property rights associated with its reporting, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. </p><p>For weeks, <em>The Times</em> and the maker of ChatGPT have been locked in tense negotiations over reaching a licensing deal in which OpenAI would pay <em>The Times </em>for incorporating its stories in the tech company's AI tools, but the discussions have become so contentious that the paper is now considering legal action. </p><p>The individuals who confirmed the potential lawsuit requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p><p>A lawsuit from <em>The Times</em> against OpenAI would set up what could be the most high-profile legal tussle yet over copyright protection in the age of generative AI. </p><p>A top concern for <em>The Times</em> is that ChatGPT is, in a sense, becoming a direct competitor with the paper by creating text that answers questions based on the original reporting and writing of the paper's staff. </p><p>It's a fear heightened by tech companies using generative AI tools in search engines. Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI, is now powering its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. </p><p>If, when someone searches online, they are served a paragraph-long answer  from an AI tool that refashions reporting from <em>The Times</em>, the need to visit the publisher's website is greatly diminished, said one person involved in the talks.</p><p>So-called large language models like ChatGPT have scraped vast parts of the internet to assemble data that inform how the chatbot responds to various inquiries. The data-mining is conducted without permission. Whether hoovering up this massive repository is legal remains an open question. </p><p>If OpenAI is found to have violated any copyrights in this process, federal law allows for the infringing articles to be destroyed at the end of the case. </p>

Hollywood is already doing body scans</a></p><hr><p>In other words, if a federal judge finds that OpenAI illegally copied <em>The Times</em>' articles to train its AI model, the court could order the company to destroy ChatGPT's dataset, forcing the company to recreate it using only work that it is authorized to use. </p><p>Federal copyright law also carries stiff financial penalties, with violators facing fines up to $150,000 for each infringement "committed willfully." </p><p>"If you're copying millions of works, you can see how that becomes a number that becomes potentially fatal for a company," said Daniel Gervais, the co-director of the intellectual property program at Vanderbilt University who studies generative AI. "Copyright law is a sword that's going to hang over the heads of AI companies for several years unless they figure out how to negotiate a solution." </p><p><em>The Times </em>talks with OpenAI follow <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/13/2023/new-york-times-drops-out-of-ai-coalition">reports</a> that the paper will not join other media organizations in attempting to negotiate with tech companies over use of content in AI models. A person at <em>The Times</em> said not participating is unrelated to any potential litigation against OpenAI, which declined to comment through a spokesperson. </p>

      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1187523435">Thousands of authors urge AI companies to stop using work without permission</a></p><hr><p>While a spokesman for <em>The Times</em> would not comment, the paper's executives have publicly nodded at the tension.</p><p>In June, Times CEO Meredith Kopit Levien said at the Cannes Lions Festival that it is time for tech companies to pay their fair share for tapping the paper's vast archives. </p><p>"There must be fair value exchange for the content that's already been used, and the content that will continue to be used to train models," she said. </p><p>The same month, Alex Hardiman, the paper's chief product officer, and Sam Dolnick, a deputy managing editor, described in a memo to staff a new internal initiative designed to capture the potential benefits of artificial intelligence. </p><p>They cited "protecting our rights" among their chief  fears: "How do we ensure that companies that use generative AI respect our intellectual property, brands, reader relationships and investments?"</p><h3>A Times suit would join other copyright holders taking aim at AI companies </h3><p>Any potential suit <em>The Times</em> files would join other similar legal actions leveled against OpenAI in recent weeks. </p><p>Comedian Sarah Silverman joined a class-action suit against the company, alleging that she never gave ChatGPT permission to ingest a digital version of her 2010 memoir "The Bedwetter," which she says the company swallowed up from an illegal online "shadow library" </p><p>Other generative AI companies, like Stability AI, which distributes the image generator Stable Diffusion, have also been hit with copyright lawsuits. </p><p>Getty Images is suing Stability AI for allegedly training an AI model on more than 12 million Getty Images photos without authorization. </p><p>"Copyright holders see these instances are reckless, and AI companies see it as gutsy," Vanderbilt's Gervais said. "As always, the final answer will be determined by who ends up winning these lawsuits." </p><p>Legal experts say AI companies are likely to invoke a defense citing what is known as "fair use doctrine," which allows for the use of a work without permission in certain instances, including teaching, criticism, research and news reporting. </p><h3>Key question for AI suits: Will 'fair use' apply? </h3><p>There are two legal precedents that will likely play a part in the pending AI copyright disputes.</p><p>The first is <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/case/authors-guild-v-google-inc/">a 2015 federal appeals court ruling</a> that found that Google's digitally scanning of millions of books for its Google Books library was a legally permissible use of "fair use," and not copyright infringement. </p><p>The court found that Google's digital library of books did not create a "significant market substitute" for the books, meaning it did not compete with the original works. </p><p>Legal experts say proving that in the AI cases will be a major hurdle to overcome for OpenAI. </p><p>The second case expected to be relevant to the AI copyright suits is the Andy Warhol Foundation case the Supreme Court decided in May. </p><p>In it<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-869_87ad.pdf">, the high court found</a> that Andy Warhol was not protected by fair use doctrine when he altered a photograph of Prince taken by Lynn Goldsmith. Importantly, the court found that Warhol and Goldsmith were selling the images to magazines. </p><p>Therefore, the court wrote, the original and the copied work shared "the same or highly similar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary work would otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or licensed derivatives of it."</p><p>Lawyers for <em>The Times</em> believe OpenAI's use of the paper's articles to spit out descriptions of news events should not be protected by fair use, arguing that it risks becoming something of a replacement for the paper's coverage. </p><p><em>NPR's David Folkenflik contributed to this report. </em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good day, comrades!</p><p>Today I'd like to share the good news that WebAssembly is finally coming
for the rest of us weirdos.</p><div>
<h2>A world to win</h2>
<p>WebAssembly for the rest of us</p>
<p>17 Mar 2023 – BOB 2023</p>
<p>Andy Wingo</p>
<p>Igalia, S.L.</p>
</div><p>This is a transcript-alike of a talk that I gave last week at <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2023/en/program.html">BOB
2023</a>, a gathering in Berlin of
people that are using "technologies beyond the mainstream" to get things
done: Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, and so on.  PDF slides <a href="https://wingolog.org/pub/2023-bobkonf-wasm-for-the-rest-of-us-slides.pdf">here</a>, and I'll link the video too when it becomes available.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the story</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is an exciting new universal compute platform</p>
</div><p>WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the pitch</h2>
<p>Predictable portable performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-level</li>
<li>Within 10% of native</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliable composition via isolation</p>
<ul>
<li>Modules share nothing by default</li>
<li>No nasal demons</li>
<li>Memory sandboxing</li>
</ul>
<p>Compile your code to WebAssembly for easier distribution and composition</p>
</div><p>If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an
abstract machine, to me there are two main areas in which it is an
advance over the alternatives.</p><p>Firstly it's "close to the metal" -- if you compile for example an
image-processing library to WebAssembly and run it, you'll get similar
performance when compared to compiling it to x86-64 or ARMv8 or what
have you.  (For image processing in particular, native still generally
wins because the SIMD primitives in WebAssembly are more narrow and
because getting the image into and out of WebAssembly may imply a copy,
but the general point remains.)  WebAssembly's instruction set covers a
broad range of low-level operations that allows compilers to produce
efficient code.</p><p>The novelty here is that WebAssembly is both portable while also being
successful.  We language weirdos know that it's not enough to do
something technically better: you have to also succeed in getting
traction for your alternative.</p><p>The second interesting characteristic is that WebAssembly is (generally
speaking) a principle-of-least-authority architecture: a WebAssembly
module starts with access to nothing but itself.  Any capabilities that
an instance of a module has must be explicitly shared with it by the
host at instantiation-time.  This is unlike DLLs which have access to
all of main memory, or JavaScript libraries which can mutate global
objects.  This characteristic allows WebAssembly modules to be reliably
composed into larger systems.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the hype</h2>
<p>It’s in all browsers! Serve your code to anyone in the world!</p>
<p>It’s on the edge! Run code from your web site close to your users!</p>
<p>Compose a library (eg: Expat) into your program (eg: Firefox), without risk!</p>
<p>It’s the new lightweight virtualization: Wasm is what containers were to VMs! Give me that Kubernetes cash!!!</p>
</div><p>Again, the remarkable thing about WebAssembly is that it is succeeding!
It's on all of your phones, all your desktop web browsers, all of the
content distribution networks, and in some cases it seems set to replace
containers in the cloud.  Launch the rocket emojis!</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the reality</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is a weird backend for a C compiler</p>
<p>Only some source languages are having success on WebAssembly</p>
<p>
What about Haskell, Ocaml, Scheme, F#, and so on – what about <i>us</i>?
</p>
<p>Are we just lazy? (Well...)</p>
</div><p>So why aren't we there?  Where is Clojure-on-WebAssembly?  Where are the
F#, the Elixir, the Haskell compilers?  Some early efforts exist, but
they aren't really succeeding.  Why is that?  Are we just not putting in
the effort?  Why is it that Rust gets to ride on the rocket ship but Scheme does not?</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the reality (2)</h2>
<p>WebAssembly (1.0, 2.0) is not well-suited to garbage-collected languages</p>
<p>Let’s look into why</p>
</div><p>As it turns out, there is a reason that there is no good Scheme
implementation on WebAssembly: the initial version of WebAssembly is a
terrible target if your language relies on the presence of a garbage
collector.  There have been some advances but this observation still
applies to the current standardized and deployed versions of
WebAssembly.  To better understand this issue, let's dig into the guts
of the system to see what the limitations are.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0</h2>
<p>Where do garbage-collected values live?</p>
<p>For WebAssembly 1.0, only possible answer: linear memory</p>
<pre>(module
  (global $hp (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
  (memory $mem 10)) ;; 640 kB</pre>
</div><p>The primitive that WebAssembly 1.0 gives you to represent your data is
what is called <i>linear memory</i>: just a buffer of bytes to which you can
read and write.  It's pretty much like what you get when compiling
natively, except that the memory layout is more simple.  You can obtain
this memory in units of 64-kilobyte pages.  In the example above we're
going to request 10 pages, for 640 kB.  Should be enough, right?  We'll
just use it all for the garbage collector, with a bump-pointer
allocator.  The heap pointer / allocation pointer is kept in the mutable
global variable <tt>$hp</tt>.</p><div>
<pre>(func $alloc (param $size i32) (result i32)
  (local $ret i32)
  (loop $retry
    (local.set $ret (global.get $hp))
    (global.set $hp
      (i32.add (local.get $size) (local.get $ret)))

    (br_if 1
      (i32.lt_u (i32.shr_u (global.get $hp) 16)
                (memory.size))
      (local.get $ret))

    <b>(call $gc)</b>
    (br $retry)))
</pre>
</div><p>Here's what an allocation function might look like.  The allocation
function <tt>$alloc</tt> is like malloc: it takes a number of bytes and returns
a pointer.  In WebAssembly, a pointer to memory is just an offset, which
is a 32-bit integer (<tt>i32</tt>).  (Having the option of a 64-bit address
space is planned but not yet standard.)</p><p>If this is your first time seeing the text representation of a
WebAssembly function, you're in for a treat, but that's not the point of
the presentation :)  What I'd like to focus on is the <tt>(call $gc)</tt> --
what happens when the allocation pointer reaches the end of the region?</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (2)</h2>
<p>
What hides behind <tt>(call $gc)</tt> ?
</p>
<p>Ship a GC over linear memory</p>
<p>Stop-the-world, not parallel, not concurrent</p>
<p>
But... <b>roots</b>.
</p>
</div><p>The first thing to note is that you have to provide the <tt>$gc</tt> yourself.
Of course, this is doable -- this is what we do when compiling to a
native target.</p><p>Unfortunately though the multithreading support in WebAssembly is
somewhat underpowered; it lets you share memory and use atomic
operations but you have to create the threads outside WebAssembly.  In
practice probably the GC that you ship will not take advantage of
threads and so it will be rather primitive, deferring all collection
work to a stop-the-world phase.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (3)</h2>
<p>Live objects are</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots</li>
<li>any object referenced by a live object</li>
</ul>
<p>Roots are globals and locals in active stack frames</p>
<p>
<b>No way to visit active stack frames</b>
</p>
</div><p>What's worse though is that you have no access to roots on the stack.  A
GC has to keep live objects, as defined circularly as any object
referenced by a root, or any object referenced by a live object.  It
starts with the roots: global variables and any GC-managed object
referenced by an active stack frame.</p><p>But there we run into problems, because in WebAssembly (any version, not
just 1.0) you can't iterate over the stack, so you can't find active
stack frames, so you can't find the stack roots.  (Sometimes people want
to support this as a <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/issues/105">low-level
capability</a>
but generally speaking the consensus would appear to be that overall
performance will be better if the engine is the one that is responsible
for implementing the GC; but that is foreshadowing!)</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (3)</h2>
<p>Workarounds</p>
<ul>
<li>handle stack for precise roots</li>
<li>spill all possibly-pointer values to linear memory and collect conservatively</li>
</ul>
<p>Handle book-keeping a drag for compiled code</p>
</div><p>Given the noniterability of the stack, there are basically two
work-arounds.  One is to have the compiler and run-time maintain an
explicit stack of object roots, which the garbage collector can know for
sure are pointers.  This is nice because it lets you move objects.  But,
maintaining the stack is overhead; the state of the art solution is
rather to create a side table (a "stack map") associating each potential
point at which GC can be called with instructions on how to find the
roots.</p><p>The other workaround is to spill the whole stack to memory.  Or,
possibly just pointer-like values; anyway, you conservatively scan all
words for things that might be roots.  But instead of having access to
the memory to which the WebAssembly implementation would spill your
stack, you have to do it yourself.  This can be OK but it's sub-optimal;
see <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/02/07/whippet-towards-a-new-local-maximum">my recent post on the Whippet garbage
collector</a>
for a deeper discussion of the implications of conservative
root-finding.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (4)</h2>
<p>Cycles with external objects (e.g. JavaScript) uncollectable</p>
<p>A pointer to a GC-managed object is an offset to linear memory, need capability over linear memory to read/write object from outside world</p>
<p>No way to give back memory to the OS</p>
<p>Gut check: gut says no</p>
</div><p>If that were all, it would already be not so great, but it gets worse!
Another problem with linear-memory GC is that it limits the potential
for composing a number of modules and the host together, because the
garbage collector that manages JavaScript objects in a web browser knows
nothing about your garbage collector over your linear memory.  You can
easily create memory leaks in a system like that.</p><p>Also, it's pretty gross that a reference to an object in linear memory
requires arbitrary read-write access over all of linear memory in order
to read or write object fields.  How do you build a reliable system
without invariants?</p><p>Finally, once you collect garbage, and maybe you manage to compact
memory, you can't give anything back to the OS.  There are proposals in
the works but they are not there yet.</p><p>If the BOB audience had to choose between <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse is Better and The Right
Thing</a>, I think the BOB
audience is much closer to the Right Thing.  People like that feel
instinctual revulsion to ugly systems and I think GC over linear memory
describes an ugly system.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (5)</h2>
<p>
<i>There is already a high-performance concurrent parallel compacting GC in the browser</i>
</p>
<p>Halftime: C++ N – Altlangs 0</p>
</div><p>The kicker is that WebAssembly 1.0 requires you to write and deliver a
terrible GC when there is already probably a great GC just sitting there
in the host, one that has hundreds of person-years of effort invested in
it, one that will surely do a better job than you could ever do.
WebAssembly as hosted in a web browser should have access to the
browser's garbage collector!</p><p>I have the feeling that while those of us with a soft spot for languages
with garbage collection have been standing on the sidelines, Rust and
C++ people have been busy on the playing field scoring goals.  Tripping
over the ball, yes, but eventually they do manage to make within
striking distance.</p><div>
<h2>Change is coming!</h2>
<p>Support for built-in GC set to ship in Q4 2023</p>
<p>With GC, the material conditions are now in place</p>
<p>
Let’s compile <i>our</i> languages to WebAssembly
</p>
</div><p>But to continue the sportsball metaphor, I think in the second half our
players will finally be able to get out on the pitch and give it the
proverbial 110%.  Support for garbage collection is coming to
WebAssembly users, and I think even by the end of the year it will be
shipping in major browsers.  This is going to be big!  We have a chance
and we need to sieze it.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm</h2>
<p>Spritely + Igalia working on Scheme to WebAssembly</p>
<p>Avoid truncating language to platform; bring whole self</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Value representation</b>
</li>
<li>Varargs</li>
<li>Tail calls</li>
<li>Delimited continuations</li>
<li>Numeric tower</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Even with GC, though, WebAssembly is still a weird machine.  It would
help to see the concrete approaches that some languages of interest
manage to take when compiling to WebAssembly.</p><p>In that spirit, the rest of this article/presentation is a walkthough of
the approach that I am taking as I work on a WebAssembly compiler for
Scheme.  (Thanks to <a href="https://spritely.institute/">Spritely</a> for supporting
this work!)</p><p>Before diving in, a meta-note: when you go to compile a language to,
say, JavaScript, you are mightily tempted to cut corners.  For example
you might implement numbers as JavaScript numbers, or you might omit
implementing continuations.  In this work I am trying to not cut
corners, and instead to implement the language faithfully.  Sometimes
this means I have to work around weirdness in WebAssembly, and that's
OK.</p><p>When thinking about Scheme, I'd like to highlight a few specific areas
that have interesting translations.  We'll start with value
representation, which stays in the GC theme from the introduction.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values</h2>
<pre>;;       any  extern  func
;;        |
;;        eq
;;     /  |   \
;; <b>i31</b> <b>struct</b>  array
</pre>
<p>
The unitype: <tt>(ref eq)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Immediate values in <tt>(ref i31)</tt>
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixnums with 30-bit range</li>
<li>chars, bools, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
Explicit nullability: <tt>(ref null eq)</tt> vs <tt>(ref eq)</tt>
</p>
</div><p>The GC extensions for WebAssembly are phrased in terms of a type system.
Oddly, there are three top types; as far as I understand it, this is the
result of a compromise about how WebAssembly engines might want to
represent these different kinds of values.  For example, an opaque
JavaScript value flowing into a WebAssembly program would have type
<tt>(ref extern)</tt>.  On a system with <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations">NaN
boxing</a>,
you would need 64 bits to represent a JS value.  On the other hand a
native WebAssembly object would be a subtype of <tt>(ref any)</tt>, and might
be representable in 32 bits, either because it's a 32-bit system or
because of pointer compression.</p><p>Anyway, three top types.  The user can define subtypes of <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>array</tt>, instantiate values of those types, and access their fields.
The life cycle of reference-typed objects is automatically managed by
the run-time, which is just another way of saying they are
garbage-collected.</p><p>For Scheme, we need a common supertype for all values: <a href="https://medium.com/@samth/on-typed-untyped-and-uni-typed-languages-8a3b4bedf68c">the unitype, in
Bob Harper's memorable
formulation</a>.
We can use <tt>(ref any)</tt>, but actually we'll use <tt>(ref eq)</tt> -- this is the
supertype of values that can be compared by (pointer) identity.  So now
we can code up <tt>eq?</tt>:</p><pre>(func $eq? (param (ref eq) (ref eq))

</pre><p>Generally speaking in a Scheme implementation there are <i>immediates</i> and
<i>heap objects</i>.  Immediates can be encoded in the bits of a value,
whereas for heap object the bits of a value encode a reference (pointer)
to an object on the garbage-collected heap.  We usually represent small
integers as immediates, as well as booleans and other oddball values.</p><p>Happily, WebAssembly gives us an immediate value type, <tt>i31</tt>.  We'll
encode our immediates there, and otherwise represent heap objects as
instances of <tt>struct</tt> subtypes.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values (2)</h2>
<p>
Heap objects subtypes of <tt>struct</tt>; concretely:
</p>
<pre>(struct $heap-object
  (struct (field $tag-and-hash i32)))
(struct $pair
  (<b>sub $heap-object</b>
    (struct <b>i32</b> (ref eq) (ref eq))))
</pre>
<p>GC proposal allows subtyping on structs, functions, arrays</p>
<p>Structural type equivalance: explicit tag useful</p>
</div><p>We actually need to have a common struct supertype as well, for two
reasons.  One is that we need to be able to hash Scheme values by
identity, but for this we need an embedded lazily-initialized hash
code.  It's a bit annoying to take the per-object memory hit but it's a
reality, and the JVM does it this way, so it must not be so terrible.</p><p>The other reason is more subtle: WebAssembly's type system is built in
such a way that types that are "structurally" equivalent are
indistinguishable.  So a pair has two fields, besides the hash, but
there might be a number of other fundamental object types that have the
same shape; you can't fully rely on WebAssembly's dynamic type checks
(<tt>ref.test</tt> et al) to be able to query the type of a value.  Instead we
re-use the low bits of the hash word to include a type tag, which might
be 1 for pairs, 2 for vectors, 3 for closures, and so on.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values (3)</h2>
<pre>(func $cons (param (ref eq)
                   (ref eq))

    ;; Assume heap tag for pairs is 1.
    (i32.const 1)

(func $%car (param <b>(ref $pair)</b>)
            (result (ref eq))
  (struct.get $pair 1 (local.get 0)))
</pre>
</div><p>With this knowledge we can define <tt>cons</tt>, as a simple call to
<tt>struct.new_canon pair</tt>.</p><p>I didn't have time for this in the talk, but there is a ghost haunting
this code: the ghost of nominal typing.  See, in a web browser at least,
every heap object will have its first word point to its "hidden class" /
"structure" / "map" word.  If the engine ever needs to check that a
value is of a specific shape, it can do a quick check on the map word's
value; if it needs to do deeper introspection, it can dereference that
word to get more details.</p><p>Under the hood, testing whether a <tt>(ref eq)</tt> is a pair or not should be
a simple check that it's a <tt>(ref struct)</tt> (and not a fixnum), and then a
comparison of its map word to the run-time type corresponding to
<tt>$pair</tt>.  If subtyping of <tt>$pair</tt> is allowed, we start to want inline
caches to handle polymorphism, but the checking the map word is still
the basic mechanism.</p><p>However, as I mentioned, we only have structural equality of types; two
<tt>(struct (ref eq))</tt> type definitions will define the same type and have
the same map word (run-time type / RTT).  Hence the <tt>_canon</tt> in the name of
<tt>struct.new_canon $pair</tt>: we create an instance of <tt>$pair</tt>, with the
<i>canonical</i> run-time-type for objects having <tt>$pair</tt>-shape.</p><p>In earlier drafts of the WebAssembly GC extensions, users could define
their own RTTs, which effectively amounts to nominal typing: not only
does this object have the right structure, but was it created with
respect to this particular RTT.  But, this facility was cut from the
first release, and it left ghosts in the form of these <tt>_canon</tt> suffixes
on type constructor instructions.</p><p>For the Scheme-to-WebAssembly effort, we effectively add back in a
degree of nominal typing via type tags.  For better or for worse this
results in a so-called "open-world" system: you can instantiate a
separately-compiled WebAssembly module that happens to define the same
types and use the same type tags and it will be able to happily access
the contents of Scheme values from another module.  If you were to use
nominal types, you would't be able to do so, unless there were some
common base module that defined and exported the types of interests, and
which any extension module would need to

values.  I went through all of the basic value types in Guile and
checked that they could <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/blob/main/examples/basic-types.wat">all be represented using GC
types</a>,
and it seems that all is good.  Now on to the next point: varargs.</p><div>

<p>Problem: Wasm functions strongly typed</p>
<pre>(func $list (param ???) (result (ref eq))
  ???)</pre>
<p>Solution: Virtualize calling convention</p>
</div><p>In WebAssembly, you define functions with a type, and it is impossible
to call them in an unsound way.  You must call <tt>$car</tt> exactly 2
arguments or it will not compile, and those arguments have to be of
specific types, and so on.  But Scheme doesn't enforce these
restrictions on the language level, bless its little miscreant heart.
You can call <tt>car</tt> with 5 arguments, and you'll get a run-time error.
There are some functions that can take a variable number of arguments,
doing different things depending on incoming argument count.</p><p>How do we square these two approaches to function types?</p><div>
<pre>;; "Registers" for args 0 to 3
(global $arg0 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg1 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg2 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg3 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))

;; "Memory" for the rest
(type $argv (array (ref eq)))
(global $argN (ref $argv)
        (array.new_canon_default
          $argv (i31.const 42) (i31.new (i32.const 0))))</pre>
<p>Uniform function type: argument count as sole parameter</p>
<p>Callee moves args to locals, possibly clearing roots</p>
</div><p>The approach we are taking is to virtualize the calling convention.  In
the same way that when calling an x86-64 function, you pass the first
argument in <tt>$rdi</tt>, then <tt>$rsi</tt>, and eventually if you run out of
registers you put arguments in memory, in the same way we'll pass the
first argument in the <tt>$arg0</tt> global, then <tt>$arg1</tt>, and eventually in
memory if needed.  The function will receive the number of incoming
arguments as its sole parameter; in fact, all functions will be of type
<tt>(func (param i32))</tt>.</p><p>The expectation is that after checking argument count, the callee will
load its arguments from globals / memory to locals, which the compiler
can do a better job on than globals.  We might not even emit code to
null out the argument globals; might leak a little memory but probably
would be a win.</p><p>You can imagine a world in which <tt>$arg0</tt> actually gets globally
allocated to <tt>$rdi</tt>, because it is only live during the call sequence;
but I don't think that world is this one :)</p><div>

<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (1)</h2>
<p>Problem: Lightweight threads/fibers, exceptions</p>
<p>Possible solutions</p>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, built-in coroutines</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">binaryen</a>’s asyncify (not yet ready for GC); see Julia
</li>
<li>
<b>Delimited continuations</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Bring your whole self”</p>
</div><p>Before diving in though, one might wonder why bother.  Delimited
continuations are a building-block that one can use to build other, more
useful things, notably exceptions and light-weight threading / fibers.
Could there be another way of achieving these end goals without having
to implement this relatively uncommon primitive?</p><p>For fibers, it is possible to <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2018/05/16/lightweight-concurrency-in-lua">implement them in terms of a built-in
coroutine
facility</a>.
The standards body seems willing to include a coroutine primitive, but
it seems far off to me; not within the next 3-4 years I would say.  So
let's put that to one side.</p><p>There is a more near-term solution, to use <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1294#issuecomment-520231415">asyncify to implement
coroutines</a>
somehow; but my understanding is that asyncify is not ready for GC yet.</p><p>For the Guile flavor of Scheme at least, delimited continuations are
table stakes of their own right, so given that we will have them on
WebAssembly, we might as well use them to implement fibers and
exceptions in the same way as we do on native targets.  Why compromise
if you don't have to?</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (2)</h2>
<p>Prompts delimit continuations</p>
<pre>(define k
  (call-with-prompt ’foo
    ; body
    (lambda ()
      (+ 34 (abort-to-prompt 'foo)))
    ; handler
    (lambda (continuation)
      continuation)))

(k 10)       ;; ⇒ 44
(- (k 10) 2) ;; ⇒ 42</pre>
<p>
<tt>k</tt> is the <tt>_</tt> in <tt>(lambda () (+ 34 _))</tt>
</p>
</div><p>There are a few ways to implement <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2010/02/26/guile-and-delimited-continuations">delimited
continuations</a>,
but my usual way of thinking about them is that a delimited continuation
is a slice of the stack.  One end of the slice is the <i>prompt</i>
established by <tt>call-with-prompt</tt>, and the other by the continuation of
the call to <tt>abort-to-prompt</tt>.  Capturing a slice pops it off the stack,
copying it out to the heap as a callable function.  Calling that
function splats the captured slice back on the stack and resumes it
where it left off.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (3)</h2>
<p>Delimited continuations are stack slices</p>
<p>Make stack explicit via minimal continuation-passing-style conversion</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn all calls into tail calls</li>
<li>Allocate return continuations on explicit stack</li>
<li>Breaks functions into pieces at non-tail calls</li>
</ul>
</div><p>This low-level intuition of what a delimited continuation is leads
naturally to an implementation; the only problem is that we can't slice
the WebAssembly call stack.  The workaround here is similar to the
varargs case: we virtualize the stack.</p><p>The mechanism to do so is a continuation-passing-style (CPS)
transformation of each function.  Functions that make no calls, such as
leaf functions, don't need to change at all.  The same goes for
functions that make only tail calls.  For functions that make non-tail
calls, we split them into pieces that preserve the only-tail-calls
property.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (4)</h2>
<p>Before a non-tail-call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push live-out vars on stacks (one stack per top type)</li>
<li>Push continuation as funcref</li>
<li>Tail-call callee</li>
</ul>
<p>Return from call via pop and tail call:</p>
<pre>(return_call_ref (call $pop-return)
                 (i32.const 0))</pre>
<p>After return, continuation pops state from stacks</p>
</div><p>Consider a simple function:</p><pre>(define (f x y)
  (+ x (g y))
</pre><p>Before making a non-tail call, a "tailified" function will instead push
all live data onto an explicitly-managed stack and tail-call the
callee.  It also pushes on the return continuation.  Returning from the
callee pops the return continuation and tail-calls it.  The return
continuation pops the previously-saved live data and continues.</p><p>In this concrete case, tailification would split <tt>f</tt> into two pieces:</p><pre>(define (f x y)
  (push! x)
  (push-return! f-return-continuation-0)
  (g y))

(define (f-return-continuation-0 g-of-y)
  (define k (pop-return!))
  (define x (pop! x))
  (k (+ x g-of-y)))
</pre><p>Now there are no non-tail calls, besides calls to run-time routines like
<tt>push!</tt> and <tt>+</tt> and so on.  This transformation is implemented by
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=guile.git;a=blob;f=module/language/cps/tailify.scm;h=f9ebb63d20b7ad736e74c39327d854de0fb798af;hb=refs/heads/wip-tailify">tailify.scm</a>.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (5)</h2>
<p>
<tt>abort-to-prompt</tt>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pop stack slice to reified continuation object</li>
<li>Tail-call new top of stack: prompt handler</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling a reified continuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push stack slice</li>
<li>Tail-call new top of stack</li>
</ul>
<p>No need to wait for effect handlers proposal; you can have it all now!</p>
</div><p>The salient point is that the stack on which <tt>push!</tt> operates (in
reality, probably four or five stacks: one in linear memory or an array
for types like <tt>i32</tt> or <tt>f64</tt>, three for each of the managed top types
<tt>any</tt>, <tt>extern</tt>, and <tt>func</tt>, and one for the stack of return
continuations) are managed by us, so we can slice them.</p><p>Someone asked in the talk about whether the explicit memory traffic and
avoiding the return-address-buffer branch prediction is a source of
inefficiency in the transformation and I have to say, yes, but I don't
know by how much.  I guess we'll find out soon.</p><div>

<li>
On web: <tt>BigInt</tt>
</li>
<li>On edge: Wasm support module (mini-gmp?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic dispatch for polymorphic ops, as usual</p>
</div><p>First, I would note that sometimes the compiler can unbox numeric
operations.  For example if it infers that a result will be an inexact
real, it can use unboxed <tt>f64</tt> instead of library routines working on
heap flonums (<tt>(struct i32 f64)</tt>; the initial i32 is for the hash and
tag).  But we still need a story for the general case that involves
dynamic type checks.</p><p>The basic idea is that we get to have fixnums and heap numbers.  Fixnums
will handle most of the integer arithmetic that we need, and will avoid
allocation.  We'll inline most fixnum operations as a fast path and call
out to library routines otherwise.  Of course fixnum inputs may produce
a bignum output as well, so the fast path sometimes includes another
slow-path callout.</p><p>We want to minimize binary module size.  In an ideal
compile-to-WebAssembly situation, a small program will have a small
module size, down to a minimum of a kilobyte or so; larger programs can
be megabytes, if the user experience allows for the download delay.
Binary module size will be dominated by code, so that means we need to
plan for aggressive dead-code elimination, minimize the size of fast
paths, and also minimize the size of the standard library.</p><p>For numbers, we try to keep module size down by leaning on the platform.
In the case of bignums, we can punt some of this work to the host; on a
JavaScript host, we would use <tt>BigInt</tt>, and on a WASI host we'd compile
an external bignum library.  So that's the general story: inlined fixnum
fast paths with dynamic checks, and otherwise library routine callouts,
combined with aggressive whole-program dead-code elimination.</p><div>

		<p>When NP-hardness pops up on the internet, say because some silly blogger wants to <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2012/03/22/nintendo-np-hard/">write about video games</a>, it’s often tempting to conclude that the problem being proved NP-hard is actually very hard!</p>
<p>“Scientists proved Super Mario is NP-hard? I always knew there was a reason I wasn’t very good at it!” Sorry, these two are unrelated. NP-hardness means hard in a narrow sense this post should hopefully make clear. After that, we’ll explore what “hard” means in a mathematical sense that you can apply beyond NP-hardness to inform your work as a programmer.</p>
<p>When a problem is NP-hard, that simply means that the problem is sufficiently expressive that you can use the problem to express logic. By which I mean boolean formulas using AND, OR, and NOT. In the Super Mario example, the “problem” is a bundle of (1) the controls for the player (2) the allowed tiles and characters that make up a level, and (3) the goal of getting from the start to the end. Logic formulas are encoded in the creation of a level, and solving the problem (completing the level) is the same as finding conditions to make the logical formula true.</p>

<p>In this sense, NP-hardness doesn’t make all of Super Mario hard. The levels designed to encode logical formulas are contrived, convoluted, and contorted. They abuse the rules of the game in order to cram boolean logic into it. These are&nbsp;<em>worst case levels</em>. It’s using Mario for a completely unintended purpose, not unlike <a href="https://github.com/j2kun/general-audience-math-essays/blob/master/reductions-mathematical-hacks.md">hacking</a>. And so NP-hardness is a worst case claim.</p>
<p>To reiterate, NP-hardness means that Super Mario has&nbsp;<em>expressive power</em>. So expressive that it can emulate other problems we believe are hard in the worst case. And, because the goal of mathematical “hardness” is to reason about the limitations of algorithms, being able to solve Super Mario in full generality implies you can solve any hard subproblem, no matter how ridiculous the level design.</p>
<p>The P != NP conjecture says that there’s no polynomial time algorithm to determine whether boolean logic formulas are satisfiable, and so as a consequence Super Mario (in full generality) also has no polynomial time algorithm.</p>
<p>That being said, in reality Super Mario levels do not encode logical formulas! If you use the knowledge that real-world Super Mario levels are designed in the way they are (to be solvable, fun), then you can solve Super Mario with algorithms. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44">There are many examples</a>.</p>
<p>In general, the difficulty of a problem for humans is unrelated to the difficulty for algorithms. Consider multiplication of integers. This is a trivial problem for computers to solve, but humans tend to struggle with it. It’s an <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_does_mathemagic">amazing feat</a>&nbsp;to be able to multiply two 7 digit numbers&nbsp;in less than 5 seconds, whereas computers can multiply two thousand-digit numbers in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding">protein folding</a> is known to be an NP-hard problem, but it’s been turned into a <a href="https://fold.it/">game sufficiently easy for humans to solve</a> that players have contributed to scientific research. Indeed, even some of the most typically cited NP-hard problems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman</a>, have heuristic, practical algorithmic solutions that allow one to solve them (very close to optimally) in hours on inputs as large as <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/">every city on earth</a>.</p>
<p>So the mathematical notions of hardness are quite disconnected from practical notions of hardness. This is not even to mention that some NP-hard problems can be efficiently approximated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_approximation_scheme">within any desired accuracy</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the math a bit more. “Hardness” is a family of ideas about comparisons between problems based on reusability of algorithmic solutions. Loosely speaking, a problem $ R$ is hard with respect to a class of problems $ C$ if an algorithm solving $ R$ can be easily transformed into an algorithm solving any problem in $ C$. You have to say what kinds of transformations are allowed, and the transformation can be different for different target problems in $ C$, but that’s the basic idea.</p>
<p>In the Super Mario example, if you want to solve logical formulas, you can transform a hypothetically perfect mario-level-playing algorithm into a logic solver by encoding the formula as a level and running the mario-level-playing algorithm on it as a black box. Add an if statement to the end to translate “level can/can’t be finished” to “formula can/can’t be satisfied,” and the transformation is complete. It’s important for NP-hardness that the transformation only takes polynomial time. Other kinds of hardness might admit more or restrict to fewer resources.</p>
<p>And so this is what makes Mario NP-hard, because boolean logic satisfiability is NP-hard. Any problem in NP can be solved by a boolean logic solver, and hence also by a mario-level-player. The fact that boolean logic solving is NP-hard is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem">difficult theorem to prove</a>. But if we assume it’s true, you can compose the transformations to get from any NP problem to Super Mario.</p>
<p>As a simple example of a different kind of hardness, you can let $ C$ be the class of problems solvable using only a finite amount of memory (independent of the input). You have probably heard of this class of problems by another name, but I’ll keep you guessing until the end of the post. A $ C$-hard problem $ R$ is one for which an algorithmic solution can be repurposed to solve any finite-memory-solvable problem.</p>
<p>We have to be careful: if the transformation between solutions allows us polynomial time (in the size of the input) like it did for NP-hardness, then we might have enough time in the transformation alone to solve the entire problem, removing the need for a solution to $ R$ in the first place! For this reason, we have to limit the amount of work that can be done in the transformation. We get a choice here that influences how interesting or useful the definition of hardness is, but let’s just pick one and say that the transformation can only use finite <em>time </em>(independent of the input).</p>
<p>To be fair, I actually don’t know if there are any hard problems with respect to this definition. There probably are, but chances are good that they are not members of $ C$, and that’s where the definition of hardness gets really interesting. If you have a problem in $ C$ which is also $ C$-hard, it’s called&nbsp;<em>complete</em> for $ C$. And once you’ve found a complete problem, from a theoretical perspective you’re a winner. You’ve found a problem which epitomizes the difficulty of solving problems in $ C$. And so it’s a central aim of researchers studying a complexity class to find complete problems. As they say in the business, “ABC: always be completing.”</p>
<p>As a more concrete and interesting example, the class $ P$ of all polynomial-time solvable problems has a complete problem. Here the transformations are a bit up in the air. They could either be logarithmic-space computations, or what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_(complexity)">NC</a>, which can be thought of as poly-logarithmic time (very fast) parallel computations. I only mention NC because it allows you to say “P-complete problems are hard to parallelize.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the choice, there are a number of very useful problems known to be P-complete. The first is the&nbsp;<em>Circuit Value Problem</em>, given a circuit (described by its gates and wires using any reasonable encoding) and an input to the circuit, what is the output?</p>
<p>Others include <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/02/linear-programming-and-the-most-affordable-healthy-diet-part-1/">linear programming</a> (optimize this linear function with respect to linear constraints), data compression (does the compressed version of a string $ s$ using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch">Lempel–Ziv–Welch</a>&nbsp;contain a string $ t$?), and type inference for partial types. There are many more in this <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.31.2644&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">compendium of Greenlaw et al.</a>&nbsp;Each one is expressive enough to encode any instance of the other, and any instance of any problem in P. It’s quite curious to think that gzip can solve linear programs, but that’s surely no curiouser than super mario levels encoding boolean logic.</p>
<p>Just as with NP-hardness, when a problem is P-hard that doesn’t automatically mean it’s easy or hard for humans, or that typical instances can’t be easily parallelized. P-hardness is also a worst case guarantee.</p>
<p>Studying P-completeness is helpful in the same way NP-completeness is helpful. Completeness informs you about whether you should hope to find a perfect solution or be content with approximations and heuristics (or incorporate problem context to make it easier). Knowing a problem is P-complete means you should not expect <strong>perfect</strong> efficient parallel algorithms, or <strong>perfect&nbsp;</strong>efficient algorithms that use severely limited space. Knowing a problem is NP-hard means you should not expect a&nbsp;<strong>perfect</strong> polynomial time solution. In other words, if you are forced to work with those restrictions, the game becomes one of tradeoffs. Hardness and completeness focus and expedite your work, and clarify a principled decision making process.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
<p>P.S. The class of problems solvable in a finite amount of memory is just the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language">regular languages</a>. The “finite memory” is the finite state machine used to solve them.</p>

<p><span>In modern </span><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/vampires"><span>vampire</span></a><span> lore, the</span> process for becoming undead typically involves a darkly romantic setting, a fang-y bite, and a long, dramatic drink from the neck. But that’s the result of the last hundred years or so of vampire stories. In post-medieval <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/poland">Poland</a>, undead evil was far more banal and less elegant; it was believed to possess the souls of those who had the misfortune to die early in epidemics, by suicide, or simply before being baptized. So when it came time to bury these poor souls, care was taken to ensure they would not provide an easy vessel for a malicious, supernatural force.</p>
<p>In late July 2023, archaeologists working on a 17th-century cemetery outside the southeastern Polish village of Pień excavated the remains of a child who appeared to have been interred in the period’s “anti-vampire” style. The child (its sex is unknown) placed face-down—with a padlock near its feet.</p>
<p>“That was very typical for an anti-vampire security practice,” says Dariusz Poliński, from the Middle Ages department at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, who led the excavation.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to know a post-medieval undertaker’s exact intentions, but Poliński’s conclusions about the practice were bolstered by a similar grave nearby. in 2022, his team excavated the body of a young woman who’d also been buried with a padlock, this time on her toe, and a sickle positioned over her throat.</p>
<p>The locks, sickle, and prone position fall into the category of burial known as apotropaic—that is, people buried in a way meant to ward off evil. Said evil could come from forces outside the grave or, more often, within. Should a vampire or other undead presence awaken, the reasoning goes, the lock and downward-facing position would hold it in place. Woe to the revenant who tried to rise with a sharp sickle positioned over its throat.</p>
<p>Apotropaic graves of this sort date back to the Early Middle Ages and have also appeared in Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Romania. In addition to the features observed at Pień, such burials may involve decapitations, stakes through the chest, or protective coins placed in the deceased’s mouth. They tend to appear most frequently during times of mass tragedy—epidemics, wars, or any other time when people might see the tragedy around them and assume that evil is afoot.</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century Poland was an ideal setting for this. That is, it was an especially brutal time to be alive. “This was a century of wars, crisis, and very cold weather,” Poliński says. “It was a small ice age.”</p>

<p>There were several plagues throughout the 1600s—including cholera epidemics that spread across Eastern Europe in waves—that may have led to a spike in ritual and fear surrounding death, especially those whose deaths weren’t easily explained. Similar graves have been found at a 17th-century site in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113564">northwest Poland</a>. A <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26160144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1674 account</a> describes a town that was terrorized by a revenant that drank human blood (the townspeople, eventually, decapitated him).</p>
<p>Marek Polcyn, an anthropologist at Ontario’s Lakehead University, suggests another potential reason for anti-demonic burials in 17th-century Poland. In a paper, “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/buried-with-sickles-early-modern-interments-from-drawsko-poland/791AADE59597383DA4D5EA0221034AF9">Buried with Sickles: Early Modern Interments from Drawsko, Poland,</a>” Polcyn writes that the rise of Catholic dogma during the Counter-Reformation—when the Catholic Church pushed back against Protestantism—caused a resurgence of folkloric beliefs. As Catholic clergy stoked fears of the devil and witchcraft, he argues, Polish villagers turned back to traditional Slavic beliefs, including superstitions about the living dead.</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/HcErykLvdn4HTLrM3kF7ruOsi_AQKR55NGbV_PO5eWQ/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy83MGI2Mzk5YWEw/ZmUzMjA4NGVfSU1H/XzMxMDkuSlBH.jpg" alt="A padlock placed on the woman's foot was intended, archaeologists believe, to hinder her escape from the grave." width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-96105" data-src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/HcErykLvdn4HTLrM3kF7ruOsi_AQKR55NGbV_PO5eWQ/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy83MGI2Mzk5YWEw/ZmUzMjA4NGVfSU1H/XzMxMDkuSlBH.jpg"><figcaption>A padlock placed on the woman’s foot was intended, archaeologists believe, to hinder her escape from the grave. <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.umk.pl/">Photo Łukasz Czyżewski/Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the term “anti-vampire” is often used to describe these burials, Polcyn points out that “vampire” is a modern term, and is applied to just one of several undead forces in Slavic folklore. The <em>upiór—</em>a sort of proto-vampire—was an unclean or cursed spirit; the <em>strzyga </em>was a witch-like demon; and the <em>strigoi</em> was a shape-shifter that craved human blood. But scholars say that the graves were a kind of catch-all practice that could have applied to any of these beasties.</p>
<p>To sort through the superstition and get at the social processes behind the bodies at Pień, Poliński’s team is conducting genetic testing, specifically for evidence of disease or unusual physical attributes. Any variation, in a time of such social stress, might have inspired the fear behind the rituals.</p>
<div><p>Poliński knows there’s also the chance that there will be nothing unusual about the woman and child. As during the 17th-century <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witch-house-salem">witch trials</a> centered around Salem, Massachusetts, he says, Polish villagers might not have needed much to label a person as a supernatural threat—sometimes a grudge was at work, or perhaps scapegoating.</p><p>“It also might have been something very simple,” he says, “like an argument between neighbors.”</p></div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We conducted a search for narrowband radio signals over four observing
sessions in 2020-2023 with the L-band receiver (1.15-1.73 GHz) of the 100 m
diameter Green Bank Telescope. We pointed the telescope in the directions of 62
TESS Objects of Interest, capturing radio emissions from a total of ~11,860
stars and planetary systems in the ~9 arcminute beam of the telescope. All
detections were either automatically rejected or visually inspected and
confirmed to be of anthropogenic nature. In this work, we also quantified the
end-to-end efficiency of radio SETI pipelines with a signal injection and
recovery analysis. The UCLA SETI pipeline recovers 94.0% of the injected
signals over the usable frequency range of the receiver and 98.7% of the
injections when regions of dense RFI are excluded. In another pipeline that
uses incoherent sums of 51 consecutive spectra, the recovery rate is ~15 times
smaller at ~6%. The pipeline efficiency affects SETI search volume calculations
as well as calculations of upper bounds on the number of transmitting
civilizations. We developed an improved Drake Figure of Merit for SETI search
volume calculations that includes the pipeline efficiency and frequency drift
rate coverage. Based on our observations, we found that there is a high
probability (94.0-98.7%) that fewer than ~0.014% of stars earlier than M8
within 100 pc host a transmitter that is detectable in our search (EIRP &gt; 10e12
W). Finally, we showed that the UCLA SETI pipeline natively detects the signals
detected with AI techniques by Ma et al., 2023.

In particular, it focuses on physical manufacturing.</p><p>It's in the form of a fictitious personal tale. A plant manager struggles to save his plant from closure, and his marriage from falling apart.</p><p>The lesson is about lean management.</p><p>My main takeaway is the realization that when we try to optimize something, we focus on how to do something more efficiently. What more often is a problem is that people and processes are blocked from doing work. They spend a lot of time waiting and doing nothing. Focusing on reducing waits will produce better results than focusing on doing the work faster. Of course reducing the waits might mean doing some targeted piece of work faster. It could also mean doing better scheduling or focusing on other resource contention.</p><p>Recently I used this mindset to optimize a legacy DB struggling under the weight of a hodgepodge of unmaintained code. It worked wonderfully. Instead of fixing the slowest queries, focused on fixing the ones that block the most often. The result was that the DB <i>was</i> able to handle the workload after all.

I'm not sure what possessed me to read these books but I was curious about both industries since they are significant parts of the economy but I knew next to nothing about them.<p>The banking book is called "The Most Fun I Never Want To Have Again: A Mid-Life Crisis in Community Banking"[0] and it tells the story of an attempted bank startup in Georgia just before the financial crisis. It has a very clear explanation of the bank business model and how small banks make money. One of the surprising things I took away from it is that bank founders think of starting a bank in ways that are very similar to how tech founders think of starting of company. The main difference is that the bank business model is already well understood to those in the industry and success depends much more on your positioning in the market than it does on innovation.</p><p>The insurance book is called "Risk &amp; Reward: An Inside View of the Property/Casualty Insurance Business"[1] and is by Stephen Catlin, who founded an insurance company that he grew to several thousand employees with offices around the world and later sold for $4 billion. Very UK centered since that's mostly where his career took place but I don't think the fundamentals of the industry change that much around the world. Pretty detailed on the mechanics of how insurance underwriting works and what insurance underwriters think about when pricing risk. Made me realize insurance is much more like trading than I'd previously thought.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ELPOA3S/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ELPOA3S/</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073NRDNSC/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073NRDNSC/</a>

The thesis is that the Christian Church inadvertently created modern society by prohibiting polygamy and cousin marriage.</p><p>The topic of polygamy is what’s really stuck in my head. Polygamy is a more natural state for civilized human societies than we think it is. It may be to women’s advantage to choose an “elite” spouse she has to share because it could mean a better quality of life for her and her children than the alternatives. Chris Hemsworth could have two dozen wives if it were legal and social acceptable (and he wanted to), and his wives might be happy with that. But the downside (or one of them) is that it creates huge imbalances in society—men find it really hard to find a mate. They then do risky stuff to make it into the elite to try to attract a mate—steal to accumulate wealth or kill potential romantic rivals.</p><p>This isn’t in the book, but it made me think—are we back in that same position now? Polygamy isn’t *technically* legal or common, but you still have plenty of people who have many romantic partners—just not at the same time. We know the what the activity of dating apps looks like—a very small subset of “elite” men get an outsized proportion of likes and matches from women. It’s slim pickings for the rest of the men. Are men, unable to find a mate, going to resort to risky behavior to try to make it into that subset that are able to attract women?

The earth is absolutely covered in life.</p><p>And it all came out of mud!</p><p>I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to nerd out on ecology, aquariums, water, etc.

The book focuses on rural China and it's challenges. The gist of the book is that countries generally move from low to middle income by doing cheap labor. The move from middle to high income requires a educated workforce. If you don't have enough educated workers across the board you fall into the middle income trap where you have large structural unemployment and get high crime. This happened to Mexico and Brazil for example. China's rural population struggles with a low education level. The author investigated why. The answers come down to a mix of health issues, lack of education on how to raise babies, dysfunction in the education system and the houku system.<p>Short interesting read for anyone interested in China or development economics. The book does a great job composting to other countries and showing that way how development works and doesn't.

He recently started a new series called Hierarchy, which I also recommend. They're very "grounded" fantasy, and the magic systems is very woven into society and its structure. The human relationships in his books are pretty nuanced, which is why I like his works so much.

But its more for the different perspective of a chinese writer talking about western events, and the general outlook of how events progress - the downplay of individuality, the scope of things, and some history of the chinese point of view.<p>However what I didn’t like throughout all 3 books is just how predictable the antagonists are … like the main characters devise a plan, stick to it and things unfold generally how they’ve predicted, with very few (though big) exceptions.</p><p>Maybe thats also part of the chinese perspective? I’m used to Branden Sanderson type of narrative where the bad guys are smarter than the good ones, outplay and counter moves, and apply constant pressure, but can be outplayed themselves as well.</p><p>Three body problem was more like if the other side has an advantage, there’s nothing you can do, and if they don’t, just follow the plan … But apart from that incredible series.

Just giving myself some time for experience to percolate and synthesize into something worth publishing. Meanwhile, I'll give one instance of how it helps practically.<p>Say, I manage engineers, and I have a new intern, who is supposed to behave in a particular way, with particular standards. Their words strongly suggest sincerity, but again and again their actions go in the opposite direction. Why does this happen, what's the "problem"?</p><p>From Bohms framework, this sort of behavior is way too common, and it is due to the paradoxical nature of our psychological machinery. It's not a problem, it's a paradox. In the mind of the intern, there tends to be competing and opposing needs. One hand, they want higher quality output (verbally asserted). On the other hand, the unspoken parts of the mind demand comfort and energy saving. On top of this "incoherent" intentions/results, the intern will seem like they're lying, since words and actions/results don't match. They say they want quality, but behavior goes another way.</p><p>So, I see this entire situation clearly, so I become more patient. I understand it's not a simple situation, there's a lot going on underneath the hood. I can help this intern see their inner contradiction, generate higher awareness, make them work with less inner friction (and eventually less external friction). My process for helping someone out becomes accurate, crisp and helpful due to these additional insights from Bohm.</p><p>This is just one instance of Bohms framework helping me out in a practical organizational context.

What a ride. I know it's a famous series, but I'm outside the US and so only recently became aware of its existence, and also therefore went in mostly blind as to the subject (I knew very little of LBJ prior). Am partway through the 2nd book now, with the conclusion of the 1948 Texan Senate Democratic primary, and my mouth just sort of hung open for pages at a time during that.<p>Caro's a talented writer, but what really shows through is just the sheer years of hard work he clearly put into the books. I don't know how one can focus for so many years on just one writing project.

                  <p><span>The Road by Cormac McCarthy. He passed away in June 2023 and I read this shortly after for the first time. A powerful work that, despite the world building, focuses on the love between a father and son. It's a shocking novel in many ways, but ultimately I found it profoundly hopeful. Even in the direst of circumstances love gives strength to endure.</span></p></div></td></tr>

He's just so, so bleak.</p><p>The Road put me in a bad place mentally for two or three years. Outer Dark still fucks with me when I think about it. Blood Meridian. Just that. Just the title.</p><p>He's the kind of author that I want to recommend to everyone, but also have to add an asterisk of what to be careful of.
