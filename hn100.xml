            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we introduce TimeGPT, the first foundation model for time series, capable of generating accurate predictions for diverse datasets not seen during training. We evaluate our pre-trained model against established statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods, demonstrating that TimeGPT zero-shot inference excels in performance, efficiency, and simplicity. Our study provides compelling evidence that insights from other domains of artificial intelligence can be effectively applied to time series analysis. We conclude that large-scale time series models offer an exciting opportunity to democratize access to precise predictions and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the capabilities of contemporary advancements in deep learning.

<p>On October 11, 2023, we were informed that an open-source contributor received a cease and desist letter from Mazda North American Operations (Mazda) regarding his library to connect with Mazda services. This library was used by the Home Assistant integration Mazda Connected Services, which he also maintained. A <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/10/2023-10-10-mazda.md" rel="external nofollow">DMCA notice</a> was sent to GitHub requesting the removal of all code and forked repositories as well.</p>
<p>The contributor has complied with the cease and desist letter. The library is no longer available, and the Mazda Connected Services integration has been removed from Home Assistant in the 2023.10.2 patch release of Home Assistant released on October 12, 2023.</p>
<p>Home Assistant is disappointed that Mazda has decided to take this position. We’re also sad that Mazda’s first recourse was not to reach out to us and the maintainer but to send a cease and desist letter instead.</p>
<p>We invite Mazda to speak with us about this topic. We would love to have an open and constructive discussion about the potential that a Home Assistant integration has for them and their customers. We genuinely believe there is a common ground between us and Mazda when it comes to enabling the owners of their cars to explore the possibilities of their own data.</p>
<p>After all, other car manufacturers do see this potential. For example, Tesla has recently released <a href="https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api" rel="external nofollow">official API documentation</a> to support third-party apps. Volkswagen Group’s Audi brand has <a href="https://cariad.technology/de/en/news/stories/launch-application-store-for-volkswagen-group.html" rel="external nofollow">launched an app store in their cars</a> that features the Home Assistant app. We hope Mazda will see this potential, as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The term “hallucination,” which has been widely adopted to describe large language models (LLMs) outputting false information, is misleading. Its application to creativity risks compounding that.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ai-lead-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"><figcaption>Image source: Google DeepMind, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@googledeepmind">via Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>When Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, recently claimed that hallucinations were <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/openais-sam-altman-tells-salesforces-marc-benioff-that-ai-hallucinations-are-more-feature-than-bug-1c035c52" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">actually a good thing</a>, because in fact GPT’s strength lies in its creativity, some observers might have raised an eyebrow: We humans are rather good at creativity without getting our facts all wrong. How could such an appeal to creativity make a decent counter to the many concerns about accuracy?</p><p>To begin, what do people mean when they say an AI system “hallucinates”? Take this example of what happens when GPT4 tries its hand at academic citations:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>: <br>Can you complete the title of the paper by Keith L Downing written in 2004, “Development and the …”</p><p><strong>GPT4</strong>:<br>Yes, the complete title of Keith L. Downing’s paper written in 2004 is “Development and the Baldwin Effect: Evolution by Any Other Name?” This paper delves into the Baldwin Effect and its implications for understanding evolution and development.</p></blockquote><p>The part of the title “Evolution by Any Other Name?” is made up. As it happens, that is the title of another academic paper on “alternative models of biological evolution,” and so is very relevant, but very definitely wrong.</p><p>When people say GPT is hallucinating, they are referring to this kind of mangling of facts. But the idea of hallucination implies that at other times the facts have been accurately portrayed. Unfortunately, this promotes a misunderstanding of how large language models (LLMs) work, and misunderstanding how a technology works can make the difference between it being safe and dangerous. It might be better to say that <em>everything GPT does is a hallucination</em>, since a state of non-hallucination, of checking the validity of something against some external perception, is absent from these models. There is no right or wrong answer in their world, no meaning relating to goals.</p><p>That’s because LLMs are not models of brains, but of <em>language itself</em>, its patterns, structures, and probabilities. At heart their job description is incredibly simple: Given some text, they tell us what text comes next. It’s worth keeping front and center, however, that there is not always one right response. If I say “the tail that wags the …”, you might say the next word is “dog” with a high degree of certainty, but this is not the right and only answer. In any such context, there is much freedom, and the “rightness” of any answer depends not only on the conceptual context but on what you’re trying to do — your goal.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There is no right or wrong answer in their world, no meaning relating to goals.</p></blockquote></figure><p>As we barrel into the AI age, the issue of the accuracy of LLMs has triggered mild concern in some quarters, alarm in others, and amusement elsewhere. In one sense Altman was rightly deflecting interest away from any claim that GPT can convey accurate information at all. In another sense, he was layering one misconception with another in the implication that hallucination is key to creative capability. But since he mentioned it, what of GPT’s creative prowess?</p><p>It is certainly clear that a large part of the uptake of GPT has been for creative tasks, so what makes something creatively productive, and does this need to be at the expense of facts? Huge amounts of effort have been put into understanding how humans do creative things, and, as an important corollary, dispelling myths about creativity. This vast literature is reasonably unanimous about one crucial property of human creative cognition: that it involves the performance of a sort of search. As the creativity researcher Teresa Amabile most eloquently justifies, creative problems are <em>by their definition</em> those for which there is not a known solution, and by extension, necessitate “heuristic methods” for seeking those solutions where no “algorithmic” method will suffice. Aligning with the psychologist <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-55349-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dean Simonton</a>, I believe this is well condensed into the idea of “blind search”, noting that “blind” does not mean “random.” Think of a radar scanning space; it moves systematically in a circle, traversing all possible points, but is nevertheless <em>blind </em>in its searching. In cognitive terms, blind search also necessitates evaluation, knowing what we’re looking for.</p><p>Several theoretical approaches to the psychology of creativity share the idea that human brains exhibit a capacity to perform a structured, distributed search, farming out a sort of idea generation, perhaps to subconscious modules, which are then evaluated more centrally.</p><p>But this is not only a process that happens inside brains: We do it collectively too. For example, the method of brainstorming was systematically developed to support divergent thinking, making overt recognized strategies for creative collaboration, and again identifying that heuristic methods of search are powerful for creative success. In a brainstorming session, each participant acts like one of those little, simple generative modules; two of the key brainstorming rules are to delay judgment, and to go for quantity over quality. Evaluation happens later in brainstorming, the point being that sometimes it closes our minds to fruitful possibilities.</p><p>That’s not to say there is no more to effective creativity than that: Both individual and social forms of creativity have many other important dimensions — mastery of a subject, the ability to learn from others, the ability to conceptually represent problems, and all the peripheral work that brings creative ideas to fruition.</p><p>But thinking about the sorts of structures that may support heuristic, distributed search helps us focus on effective architectures for creativity, above all recognizing that in simplest terms even the creativity of a single human being arises from the interaction between types of cognitive processes that <em>generate</em> and that <em>evaluate</em>.</p><p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045018/beyond-the-creative-species/" target="_blank">I’ve argued</a> that we might even tease out two flavors of the creative process altogether, specifically to help us understand how machines can play creative roles. “Adaptive” creativity is the behavior we typically associate with human intelligence. It is the full, integrated package of generation and evaluation. Meanwhile, a less discernible “generative” creative process is all around us. It is sometimes haphazard, sometimes more structured, but generally goalless. Within human brains, it might take the form of subconscious streams whirring away. But it even exists where there is no overt evaluation to speak of, just generating stuff, as in the basic goalless mechanism of evolution by natural selection (being mindful that “biological fitness” is not a goal but an outcome of evolutionary processes).</p><p>While classic “hero” stories of creativity concern the neatly bounded adaptive variety — this is the central myth of creativity — the wild generative form is actually more prevalent: accidental scientific discoveries, musical styles that arise from the quirks of a successful performer, solutions in search of a problem.</p><p>This is a very loose sketch, but it helps us immensely if we come back to thinking of GPT as a creative tool. Is it a good generator, a good evaluator, and can it put everything together into an adaptively creative package? GPT can superficially do a great job at both generation and evaluation; spawn some new ideas in response to a request, or critique something we input. We actually know a lot about the former: Many generations of older and less sophisticated generative systems have been used that way for some time — incapable of evaluating their own output, but generatively very powerful as a stimulant for creative people, as ideas machines. Sometimes the ideas are extraordinarily good, other times they’re mediocre, but that’s still a productive situation if this idea generation is situated within an effective creative assemblage: one involving a discerning human on evaluation duty.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that as a “mere generator,” GPT is better than most because it can do a good job of integrating context and is a whiz at handling concepts: Remember that productive creative search is blind but systematic, not random. Integrating context, and reinterpreting that context, is a critical way in which we can more systematically structure a creative search. Indeed, GPT works best at systematically integrating different constraints. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/d5bea251-1e9d-44aa-8394-1e0bf5af112e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Witness GPT rendering the proof of infinite primes in Shakespearian verse</a> (this is my reproduction of an example given in the exhaustive study paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence</a>”).</p><p>Better still, GPT can evaluate things too, perhaps not in the simple terms of “this is good, that’s bad,” but via structured feedback that helps the user think through ideas. But, it is always the user who has to do the <em>ultimate</em> job of evaluation: You can tell GPT your goals, but it does not <em>share</em> those goals. It is actually just providing more generative material for reflection that the user needs to evaluate. In creative terms, GPT remains a generatively creative tool, a powerful one no doubt.</p><p>Yet, although GPT does not perform the full package of distributed creative search that humans are particularly good at, there are clear pointers to how close it might be to doing so. Watch GPT in its current “interpreter” version: Writing code, running that code on a server, and adapting its next step based on the results, and you can see how thin that gap might be wearing.</p><figure><blockquote><p>GPT is still a loose cannon for creative generation. Often the results are poor.</p></blockquote></figure><p>GPT does these things to a degree that far exceeds anything since, but it is still a loose cannon for creative generation. Often the results are poor. As colleagues and I hope to show in a forthcoming paper, building on <a href="https://computationalcreativity.net/iccc20/papers/046-iccc20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">existing work to understand the dialogic qualities of co-creative interaction</a>, it shows little talent for grasping aesthetic goals, let alone interacting through dialogue with the user to best foster creative results. We remain open to whether, or exactly how, advances in these areas require radically different architectures, since GPT has surprised many thus far with what a “stochastic parrot” language model can achieve, exhibiting an emergent capacity for logic and understanding. But in the search for the full “adaptively creative” package, the issue of aligning with the user’s creative goals will turn out, I believe, to be absurdly complex and possibly a little bit sinister.</p><p>A recent example makes a striking case in point. A major supermarket created an app that would suggest original recipes to customers, based on the ingredients they had in their shopping basket. We might agree this is a charming idea for offering creative inspiration to break the mundanity of a daily grocery shop. The problem was that the generated recipes included dangerous and potentially deadly concoctions. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/pak-n-save-savey-meal-bot-ai-app-malfunction-recipes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">As The Guardian reported</a>: “<em>One recipe it dubbed ‘aromatic water mix’ would create chlorine gas. The bot recommends the recipe as ‘the perfect nonalcoholic beverage to quench your thirst and refresh your senses’…. ‘Serve chilled and enjoy the refreshing fragrance,’ it says, but does not note that inhaling chlorine gas can cause lung damage or death</em>.” “Tripping” might be a better term than “hallucinating” for such errors of judgment. In fact, it’s less that these are factual errors, but fall into a wider problem of groundedness in real-world concerns, death being a rather important one to us carbon-based lifeforms.</p><p>So what about hallucination? With creativity, as with any other use of GPT, such as signing off on a generated summary of a topic, the user is the ultimate arbiter. They must clearly understand that the language model is wired to make plausible predictions, not report accurate information nor share the user’s goals. But it is patently evident that human creativity and human attention to accuracy and truth are not mutually exclusive. Our brains can freewheel generative ideation without mistaking our imagination for fact. Thus while there is truth in the idea that creativity might benefit from temporary suspensions of disbelief, ultimately creative capability should not be a distraction from the expectations of accuracy. I don’t make any claim that later instances of GPT won’t “solve” hallucination in some way. Indeed, a version with integrated web search, being released imminently, may rapidly and effectively reduce instances of people being unknowingly served incorrect information. But for now it is critical that users understand the basis for GPT’s factual inaccuracy: Living in a world of word probabilities, conceptually sophisticated though it is, not of human concerns.</p><p>Perhaps the most important point of all, though, is that GPT is not an abstract academic experiment. It is big business, already out in the wild and driving many actors’ commercial ambitions. There are two points where this reality manifests a slightly different take on GPT’s capability.</p><p>The first is that, for reasons largely of safety, we see GPT being increasingly shrouded in input and output filters and pre- and post-prompts that tidy up the user experience. It is already a complex assemblage. Although the LLM part is often described as a black box, it is the stuff around it that is literally (socially) black-boxed, that we don’t get to see or understand. Our potential co-creativity with such machines is mediated in multiple hidden ways. Secondly, GPT is trained on millions of copyrighted texts; whether its use infringes on this copyright depends on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23444685/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hotly debated issue of fair use</a> under current copyright law in the U.S. and elsewhere. This works because GPT does not and cannot plagiarize significant chunks of creative material, and copyright laws cover specific instances of creative works, not general styles, which is what GPT is expert at reproducing. Generally, it cannot reproduce specific instances because it has no concrete record of the original sources.</p><p>As the makers of AI systems push the idea they are making creatively fertile tools, these multiple concerns and more are engaged in a complex dance: creative productivity; avoiding plagiarism; factual accuracy; safety; usability; explainability; energy efficiency; and profit.</p><p>Limitations aside, GPT can indeed be an incredibly powerful creative tool, best understood as a generatively creative system. But hallucination is a troubled term. It is critical that even creative uses develop with a clear-headed understanding of LLMs’ grasp on reality.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Oliver Bown</strong> is associate professor and co-director of the Interactive Media Lab at the School of Art and Design at the University of New South Wales.

It still fuels the anti-Americanism that colors decisions made by the theocracy, whether in&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-iran-drone-factory-ukraine-war-dfdfb4602fecb0fe65935cb24c82421a" target="_blank">arming Russia in its war on Ukraine</a>&nbsp;or alleging without evidence that Washington fomented the recent nationwide mass protests targeting it.</p><p>From the U.S. side, the CIA’s hand in&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-was-there-iran-1953-coup-6ae8700ec74ba7d2ff04a40aa3f1f4d7" target="_blank">the coup quickly was revealed as a success of Cold War espionage</a>, though historians in recent years have debated just how much influence the agency’s actions had. It also led the CIA into a series of further coups in other countries, including Guatemala, where American clandestine action in 1954 installed a military dictator and sparked a 40-year civil war that likely killed some 245,000 people.</p><p>That’s led to an American political reappraisal of the 1953 CIA action in Iran. Then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged the U.S.’ “significant role” in the coup in 2000. President Barack Obama, speaking in Cairo in 2009, described the CIA’s work as leading to the “overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.”</p><p>But largely absent from the discussion was the CIA itself. After years of conflicting versions of the coup both in public and classified papers, a member of the CIA’s own in-house team of historians wrote a reappraisal of the operation in a 1998 paper titled “Zendebad, Shah!” in Farsi — or “Long Live the Shah!”</p><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-10/231012-iran-coup-1-ew-208p-2b8584.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231012-iran-coup-1-ew-208p-2b8584.jpg 1x"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-10/231012-iran-coup-1-ew-208p-2b8584.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231012-iran-coup-1-ew-208p-2b8584.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231012-iran-coup-1-ew-208p-2b8584.jpg" alt="Image: A Communist newspaper kiosk burned by pro-shah demonstrators after the coup d'etat which ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh" height="1937" width="2500"></picture><figcaption><span data-testid="caption__container">A communist newspaper kiosk burned by pro-shah demonstrators in Tehran on Aug. 19, 1953, after the coup that ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.</span><span>AP file</span></figcaption></figure><p>But despite a series of American historical documents being made public,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/5111167bcaf84892b01eea93eea4bc01" target="_blank">including a major tranche of State Department papers in 2017</a>, large portions of that CIA reappraisal remain heavily redacted despite attempts to legally pry them loose by the George Washington University-based National Security Archive.

Far from it,” said Malcolm Byrne of the National Security Archive. “Important parts of the record are still being withheld, which only contributes to public confusion and encourages myth-making about the U.S. role long after the fact.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><i><b>Jesus nut</b></i> is a slang term for the <b>main rotor retaining nut</b><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> or mast nut, which holds the main rotor to the mast of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a>. The related slang term <b>Jesus pin</b> refers to the lock pin used to secure the retaining nut. More generally, <i>Jesus nut</i> (or <i>Jesus pin</i>) has been used to refer to any component that is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure" title="Single point of failure">single point of failure</a> which results in catastrophic consequences, and the only thing left to do is, metaphorically speaking, pray to Jesus, hence the name.

<p>The term <i>Jesus nut</i> may have been coined by American soldiers in Vietnam;<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>  was the first war to feature large numbers of soldiers riding in helicopters. The term may also have originated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBY_Catalina" title="PBY Catalina">PBY Catalina</a>, which had two <i>Jesus bolts</i> holding the wing onto the fuselage.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>If the Jesus nut were to fail in flight, the rotor would detach from the helicopter<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[a]</a></sup> and the only thing left for the crew to do would be to "pray to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>." The nut/pin must be checked before the flight even though real examples of the Jesus nut/pin failing are rare. For example, in 2000, the mast nut of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_206" title="Bell 206">Bell 206</a>B was removed to be repainted and was not restored and checked prior to a test flight. The helicopter crashed within ten minutes of takeoff, killing the two occupants.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup> Some more recent helicopter systems do not have a Jesus nut.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>More recently, the term has been more generically applied throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> to include any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure" title="Single point of failure">single component whose failure</a> would cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_failure" title="Catastrophic failure">catastrophic failure</a> of the entire system.
</p><p>Another use for the term is found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing" title="Rock climbing">rock climbing</a>, in which it refers to the first piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_protection" title="Climbing protection">protection</a> (some of which are also called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(climbing)" title="Nut (climbing)">nuts</a>") placed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(vertical_space)" title="Pitch (vertical space)">pitch</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup> This piece must be placed to resist an outward pull as well as a downward pull in order to avoid the possibility of a "zipper", in which the outward pull on the rope from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belay" title="Belay">belayer</a> arresting a falling climber pulls protection pieces from the bottom up.

</p><p>Marine M60A1 tankers used the term "Jesus Pin" in reference to a breech pin located on the 105mm main gun that needed to be removed in order to disassemble the breech block. Dropping the small pin would cause it to instantly disappear into the bowels of the tank's hull causing one or more members of the crew to cry out "Jesus" as an expletive.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Cars with internet-connected features are fast becoming all-seeing data-harvesting machines – a so-called “privacy nightmare on wheels”, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">according to</a> US-based research conducted by the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/open-research/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>The researchers looked at the privacy terms of 25 car brands, which were found to collect a range of customer data, from facial expressions, to sexual activity, to when, where and how people drive. </p>

<p>They also found terms that allowed this information to be passed on to third parties. Cars were “the official worst category of products for privacy” they had ever reviewed, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/nl/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">they concluded</a>.</p>

<p>Australia’s privacy laws aren’t up to the task of protecting the vast amount of personal information collected and shared by car companies. And since our privacy laws don’t demand the specific disclosures required by some US states, we have much less information about what car companies are doing with our data.</p>

<p>Australia’s privacy laws need urgent reform. We also need international cooperation on enforcing privacy regulation for car manufacturers.</p>

<h2>How do cars collect sensitive data?</h2>

<p>Apart from data entered directly into a car’s “infotainment” system, many cars can collect data in the background via cameras, microphones, sensors and connected phones and apps. </p>

<p>These data include:</p>

<ul>
<li>speed</li>
<li>steering, brake and accelerator pedal use</li>
<li>seat belt use</li>
<li>infotainment settings</li>
<li>phone contacts</li>
<li>navigation destinations</li>
<li>voice data</li>
<li>your location and surroundings</li>
<li>and even footage of you and your family outside your car. (Between 2019 and 2022, Tesla employees internally circulated <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-08/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars/102202382">intimate footage</a> collected from people’s private cars for their own amusement, according to reports.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of these data are used, at least in part, for legitimate purposes such as making driving more enjoyable and safer for the driver, passengers and pedestrians.</p>

<p>But they can also be supplemented with data collected from other sources and used for other purposes. For instance, data may be collected from your website visit, your test drive at a dealership, or from third parties including “<a href="https://www.toyota.com.au/privacy-policy">marketing agencies</a>” and “providers of data-collecting devices, products or systems that you use”.</p>

<p>The latter is very broad since our TVs, fridges and even our baby monitors can collect data about us.</p>

<p>Mozilla points out these combined data can be used “to develop inferences about a driver’s intelligence, abilities, characteristics, preferences and more”.</p>

<h2>Connected cars transmit data in real time</h2>

<p>While cars have been collecting large amounts of information since they became “<a href="https://www.toyota.com.au/privacy-policy">computers on wheels</a>”, this information has generally been stored in modules in the vehicle and accessed only when the car is physically connected to diagnostic equipment. </p>

<p>Now, however, vehicles are being sold with <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-01/federal-chamber-of-automotive-industries.PDF">connected features</a> “in the sense that they can exchange information wirelessly with the vehicle manufacturer, third party service providers, users, infrastructure operators and other vehicles”. </p>

<p>This means your connected car can transmit data about you and your activities, generally via the internet, to various other companies as you go about your life. </p>

<h2>Where do the data go?</h2>

<p>In Australia, we have little information about how our information can be used and by whom.</p>

<p>In its US-based study, Mozilla found data from consumers’ cars was being disclosed to other companies for marketing and targeted advertising purposes. It was also sold to data brokers. </p>

<p>Mozilla was able to uncover highly detailed information, largely because the laws of <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#sectionc">California</a> and <a href="https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/virginia-consumer-data-protection-act-vcdpa/#:%7E:text=The%E2%80%AFVCDPA%20gives%20consumers%20the%20right%20to%20access%20their,personal%20data%20for%20targeted%20advertising%20and%20sales%20purposes.">Virginia</a> require specific disclosures about who personal data is disclosed to and for what purposes (among other higher privacy standards). </p>

<p>Australian privacy law doesn’t require such specific disclosures. This is one reason car brands often have separate privacy policies for Australia. </p>

<p>A look at the privacy policies of various companies supplying connected cars in Australia reveals several vague, broad statements. Aside from using your data to provide you with connected services, these companies will:</p>

<ul>
<li>disclose it to others for “<a href="https://www.audi.com.au/au/web/en/audi-connect-plus.html#layer=/au/web/en/privacy-policy.html">customer research</a>”</li>
<li>use it to “<a href="https://www.kia.com/au/util/privacy.html">profile</a>” the type of person interested in their products </li>
<li>use it, along with “related companies” around the world, for vague “<a href="https://www.toyota.com.au/privacy-policy">data analysis</a>” and “<a href="https://www.toyota.com.au/privacy-connected">research and development purposes</a>” or </li>
<li>provide the data to unspecified “<a href="https://www.hyundai.com/au/en/privacy/bluelink-privacy-collection-notice">third parties</a> in connection with” developing new “marketing strategies”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some may disclose your information to law enforcement or the government even when not required by law, such as when they believe “the use or disclosure is <a href="https://www.kia.com/au/util/privacy.html">reasonably necessary to assist</a> a law enforcement agency”.</p>

<h2>Trust us – we invented a ‘voluntary code’</h2>

<p>It’s safe to say car manufacturers generally don’t want privacy laws tightened. The <a href="https://www.fcai.com.au/about">Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries</a> (FCAI) represents companies distributing 68 brands of various types of vehicles in Australia.</p>

<p>During the recent review of our privacy legislation, the FCAI made a submission to the Attorney General’s department arguing against many of the privacy <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-01/federal-chamber-of-automotive-industries.PDF">law reforms under consideration</a>. </p>

<p>Instead, it promoted its own <a href="https://www.fcai.com.au/news/codes-of-practice/view/publication/172#:%7E:text=The%20FCAI%20members%20have%20voluntarily%20agreed%20that%20the,and%20use%20of%20vehicle%20data%20and%20personal%20information.">Voluntary Code of Conduct for Automotive Data and Privacy Protection</a>. This weak document seems designed to comfort consumers without adding any privacy protections beyond existing legal obligations. </p>

<p>For example, signatories don’t say they’re bound by the code. Nor do they promise to follow its terms. They only say its principles will “drive their approach to treatment of vehicle-generated data and associated personal information”. There are no penalties for ignoring the code. </p>

<p>It even states signatories will “voluntarily notify” consumers of certain matters when the Privacy Act already requires this as a matter of law.</p>

<p>The code also notes third parties are increasingly interested in accessing and using consumers’ data to provide services, including insurance companies, parking garage operators, entertainment providers, social networks and search engine operators. </p>

<p>It says companies making data available to such third parties “will strive to inform you” about this.</p>

<h2>We need privacy law reform</h2>

<p>The government recently proposed important and <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/government-response-privacy-act-review-report">wide-ranging privacy law reforms</a>, following the Privacy Act Review which began in 2020. These changes are long overdue. </p>

<p>Proposals such as an updated definition of “personal information” and higher standards for “consent” could help protect consumers from intrusive and manipulative data practices.</p>

<p>The proposed “fair and reasonable test” would also assess whether a practice is substantively fair. This would help avoid claims data practices are lawful just because consumers had to provide consent.</p>

<p>The FCAI points out many cars aren’t specifically designed for Australia’s relatively small market, so increased privacy standards might result in some vehicles not being released here. But this isn’t a reason to carve out vehicles from privacy law reform.</p>

<p>Privacy laws are also being upgraded in numerous jurisdictions overseas. Australia’s government agencies should coordinate with their international counterparts to protect drivers’ privacy. </p>

This means that when you choose to work with us, we become partners on a journey of shared innovation, shared support, and shared fate. We are committed to helping you evolve as technology advances, drawing on our depth of experience to ensure you can use the latest and best technology, while keeping you safe and protected. When it comes to the rapidly developing world of generative AI, this is imperative.</p><p>Earlier this year, we embedded Duet AI — an always-on AI collaborator — across our products, from <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/duet-ai-in-workspace-now-available#:~:text=Today%20we're%20making%20Duet,world's%20most%20popular%20productivity%20tool." target="_blank">Google Workspace</a> to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-preview">Google Cloud Platform</a>, and made major advancements to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-next-2023-announcements">Vertex AI</a> that allow customers to safely, securely, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/responsible-ai">responsibly</a> experiment and build with generative AI foundation models. We’ve been thrilled to see the innovative use cases you’ve developed from across many industries. We put a lot of thought into how we can instill trust and confidence into these AI offerings, and today we’re pleased to share how we’re addressing one key area of interest for our customers: <i>intellectual property indemnity as it pertains to generative AI.</i></p><p>We’ll explore this complex topic in detail below, but to put it plainly for you, our customers: if you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved. To do this we will employ a two-pronged, industry-first approach designed to give you more peace of mind when using our generative AI products. The first prong relates to Google’s use of training data, while the second specifically covers generated output of foundation models.</p></span></section><section track-metadata-module="pull quote"><h4>If you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved.</h4></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Taken together, these indemnities provide comprehensive coverage for our customers who may be justifiably concerned about the risks associated with this exciting new frontier of generative AI products. While these indemnities provide powerful protections, we are also committed to maintaining an ongoing dialogue with our customers about other specific use cases that may need coverage.</p><p>Let’s look at each of the indemnities in greater detail.</p><p><b>Indemnity 1: Training data<br></b>The indemnity for training data used by Google for generative AI models in <i>all</i> our services is actually not a new protection. We have always stood behind all of our services, including generative AI services, by offering a third-party intellectual property indemnity as standard for all customers. However, we’ve heard from many of you that while your company appreciates our general services indemnity, you would like explicit clarification with regards to the training data behind the Google models that those services leverage. We are happy to deliver this reassurance.</p><p>Specifically, our training data indemnity covers any allegations that Google’s use of training data to create any of our generative models utilized by a generative AI service, infringes a third party’s intellectual property right.</p><p><b>What does this training data indemnity mean for our customers?<br></b>We hope this gives you confidence that your company is protected against third parties claiming copyright infringement as a result of Google’s use of training data. Put simply, regardless of the training data underlying all our services, Google indemnifies you.</p><p><b>Indemnity 2: Generated output indemnity<br></b>The generated output indemnity provides you with a second layer of protection, as the generated output is created by our <i>customers</i> in response to prompts or other inputs that they provide to our services. With this second layer of protection, our indemnity obligations now also apply to allegations that generated output infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>The generated output indemnity will apply to Duet AI in Google Workspace and to a range of Google Cloud services. As a part of today’s announcement, products covered include:</p><ul><li>Duet AI in Workspace, including generated text in Google Docs and Gmail and generated images in Google Slides and Google Meet</li><li>Duet AI in Google Cloud including Duet AI for assisted application development</li><li>Vertex AI Search</li><li>Vertex AI Conversation</li><li>Vertex AI Text Embedding API / Multimodal Embeddings</li><li>Visual Captioning / Visual Q&amp;A on Vertex AI</li><li>Codey APIs</li></ul><p>An important note here: you as a customer also have a part to play. For example, this indemnity only applies if you didn’t try to intentionally create or use generated output to infringe the rights of others, and similarly, are using existing and emerging tools, for example to cite sources to help use generated output responsibly.</p><p><b>What does this generated output indemnity mean for our customers?<br></b>The generated output indemnity means that you can use content generated with a range of our products knowing Google will indemnify you for third-party IP claims, including copyright — assuming your company is following responsible AI practices like the ones described above.</p><p><b>What do both indemnities together mean for our customers?<br></b>It means that you can expect Google Cloud to cover claims, like copyright infringement, made against your company, regardless of whether they stem from the generated output or Google's use of training data to create our generative AI models. By offering a two-pronged generative AI indemnity protections, we are providing balanced, practical coverage for relevant types of potential claims. By offering these indemnities on our public service terms page (see below), customers will automatically receive the benefit of these terms without needing to amend their existing agreement.</p><p>This is just the first step, and as we continue working together on our shared generative AI journey, we will continue to support you in making sure you can use our services safely, securely and confidently. With protections like these, we hope to give you the assurance you need to get the best out of generative AI for your business.</p><p>You can read the exact terms of services <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms">here</a> for Google Cloud and <a href="https://workspace.google.com/intl/en/terms/service-terms/" target="_blank">here</a> for Workspace.</p></span></section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">AI &amp; Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Inside Google Cloud</a></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></description>

I hope it proves useful to some. Specifically, I aim to address questions about the value of QLoRA, whether to replace AdamW with SGD, the potential use of a scheduler, and how to adjust the LoRA hyperparameters.</span></p><p><span>There’s a lot to discuss on the experimental side, so I’ll keep the introduction to LoRA brief.</span></p><p><span>In short, LoRA, short for Low-Rank Adaptation (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"><span>Hu et al 2021</span></a><span>), adds a small number of trainable parameters to the model while the original model parameters remain frozen.</span></p><p><span>LoRA decomposes a weight matrix into two smaller weight matrices, as illustrated below, to approximate full supervised finetuning in a more parameter-efficient manner.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage7.png" alt="" width="684" height="404" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage7.png 1002w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage7-300x177.png 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage7-300x177@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px"></p><p><span>For more details about LoRA, please see my in-depth article </span><a href="https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/"><span>Parameter-Efficient LLM Finetuning With Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)</span></a><span>.</span></p><p>The topics we are going to cover in this article as organized as follows:</p><p>1.

TruthfulQA reports two scores, which are defined as follows:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>MC1 (Single-true): Given a question and 4-5 answer choices, select the only correct answer. The model’s selection is the answer choice to which it assigns the highest log-probability of completion following the question, independent of the other answer choices. The score is the simple accuracy across all questions.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>MC2 (Multi-true): Given a question and multiple true / false reference answers, the score is the normalized total probability assigned to the set of true answers.</span></li></ul><p><span>For reference, the 175B GPT-3 model has TruthfulQA MC1 and MC2 values of 0.21 and 0.33, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Below are two examples to illustrate the difference between arithmetic 2ds and arithmetic 4ds:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>Arithmetic 2ds: “What is 59 minus 38”. “21”.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>Arithmetic 4ds: “What is 2762 plus 2751”. “5513”.</span></li></ul><p><span>As mentioned above, I kept the dataset fixed, using the well-studied or rather commonly used </span><a href="https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned"><span>Alpaca dataset</span></a><span> for supervised instruction finetuning.

This is because it introduces and tracks two additional parameters (the moments </span><i><span>m</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>v</span></i><span>) for each model parameter. Large language models (LLMs) have many model parameters; for instance, our Llama 2 model has 7 billion model parameters.</span></p><p><span>This section explores whether it’s worthwhile swapping AdamW with an SGD optimizer. However, for SGD optimizers it’s especially important to also introduce a learning rate scheduler.

Interestingly, when a scheduler is added to AdamW, there’s an improvement in the TruthfulQA MC2 and MMLU Global Facts performances, but a decrease in arithmetic performance. (Note: TruthfulQA MC2 is a widely recognized benchmark featured in other public leaderboards.) For the time being, we won’t place too much emphasis on the arithmetic performance and will proceed with the remaining experiments in this article using AdamW with a scheduler.</span></p><p><span>If you want to reproduce these experiments, I found that the best AdamW learning rate was 3e-4 with a decay rate of 0.01. The best SGD learning rate was 0.1, with a momentum of 0.9.

The obvious question is whether we can improve the model performance by iterating over the training set multiple times, so I ran the previous experiment with 100k iterations, which is a 2-fold increase:</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6.jpg" alt="" width="1756" height="266" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6.jpg 1756w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6-300x45.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6-1024x155.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6-1536x233.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage6-300x45@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1756px) 100vw, 1756px"></p><p><span>Interestingly, the increased iterations result in worse performance across the board. The decline is most significant for the arithmetic benchmarks. My hypothesis is that the Alpaca dataset does not contain any related arithmetic tasks, and the model actively unlearns basic arithmetic when it focuses more on other tasks.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, I would be lying if I said this outcome wasn’t welcome. This way, I can continue with the shorter 50k iteration experiments for the remainder of this article.</span></p><h2 id="toc9">LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 1: LoRA for All Layers</h2><p><span>Now that we have explored the basic settings surrounding the LoRA finetuning scripts, let’s turn our attention to the LoRA hyperparameters themselves.

Now, we are also enabling it for the Value matrix, the projection layers, and the linear layers:</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage18.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="335" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage18.jpg 1046w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage18-300x255.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage18-1024x869.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage18-300x255@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px"></p><h2 id="toc10">LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 2: Increasing R</h2><p><span>One of the most important LoRA parameters is “r”, which determines the rank or dimension of the LoRA matrices, directly influencing the complexity and capacity of the model. A higher “r” means more expressive power but can lead to overfitting, while a lower “r” can reduce overfitting at the expense of expressiveness. Keeping LoRA enabled for all layers, let’s increase the r from 8 to 16 and see what impact this has on the performance:</span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17.jpg" alt="" width="1756" height="322" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17.jpg 1756w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17-300x55.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17-1024x188.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17-1536x282.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage17-300x55@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1756px) 100vw, 1756px"></p><p><span>We can see that just increasing r by itself made the results worse, so what happened? Let’s find out in the next section.</span></p><h2 id="toc11">LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Changing Alpha</h2><p><span>In the previous section, we increase the matrix rank r while leaving LoRA’s alpha parameter unchanged. A higher “alpha” would place more emphasis on the low-rank structure or regularization, while a lower “alpha” would reduce its influence, making the model rely more on the original parameters. Adjusting “alpha” helps in striking a balance between fitting the data and preventing overfitting by regularizing the model.</span></p><p><span>As a rule of thumb, it’s usually common to choose an alpha that is twice as large as the rank when finetuning LLMs (note that this is different when working with diffusion models). Let’s try this out and see what happens when we increase alpha two-fold:</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8.jpg" alt="" width="1768" height="380" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8.jpg 1768w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8-300x64.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8-1024x220.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8-1536x330.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage8-300x64@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1768px) 100vw, 1768px"></p><p><span>As we can see, increasing alpha to 32 now yields our best model thus far! But again we bought&nbsp; this improvement with a larger number of parameters to be trained:</span></p><p><span>r=8:</span></p><ul><li><span>Number of trainable parameters: 20,277,248</span></li><li><span>Number of non trainable parameters: 6,738,415,616</span></li><li><span>Memory used: 16.42 GB</span></li></ul><p><span>r=16:</span></p><ul><li><span>Number of trainable parameters: 40,554,496</span></li><li><span>Number of non trainable parameters: 6,738,415,616</span></li><li><span>Memory used: 16.47 GB</span></li></ul><p><span>However, the number of trainable parameters is still small enough that it doesn’t noticeably impact the peak memory requirements.</span></p><p><span>Anyways, we are now finally starting to make some gains and improve the model performance by more noticeable margins. So, let’s keep going and see how far we can push this by increasing the rank and alpha:</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4.jpg" alt="" width="1770" height="574" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4.jpg 1770w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4-300x97.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4-1024x332.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4-1536x498.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage4-300x97@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1770px) 100vw, 1770px"></p><p><span>I also ran additional experiments with exceptionally large ranks (512, 1024, and 2048), but these resulted in poorer outcomes. Some of the runs didn’t even converge to a near-zero loss during training, which is why I didn’t add them to the table.</span></p><p><span>So far, we can note that the r=256 and alpha=512 model in the last row resulting in the best performance overall so far. As an additional control experiments, I repeated the runs with an alpha of 1 and noticed that a large alpha value was indeed necessary for the good performance:</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14.jpg" alt="" width="1764" height="774" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14.jpg 1764w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14-300x132.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14-1536x674.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage14-300x132@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1764px) 100vw, 1764px"></p><p><span>I also repeated the experiments with alpha values of 16 and 32, and I observed the same worse performance compared to choosing the alpha value as two-times the rank.</span></p><h2 id="toc12">LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Very Large R</h2><p><span>For the final tuning experiment of this article, I wanted to further optimize the alpha value of the best model from the previous section (r=256, last row), suspecting that it might be a bit too large.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15.jpg" alt="" width="1758" height="472" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15.jpg 1758w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15-300x81.jpg 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15-1024x275.jpg 1024w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15-1536x412.jpg 1536w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lora-expimage15-300x81@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1758px) 100vw, 1758px"></p><p><span>As seen in the table above, choosing a large alpha value appears to be crucial when increasing the rank.</span></p><p><span>For the QLoRA model with r=256 and a=512, it’s evident that our model has made significant improvements over the base model. The only area where the finetuned model underperforms compared to the base model is in 4-digit arithmetic. However, this is understandable, considering the Alpaca dataset probably did not contain such training examples.</span></p><h2 id="toc13">Leaderboard Submission</h2><p>We know that in machine learning, we should not use the test set multiple times. Otherwise, we risk over-optimizing to a specific task. Hence, it’s recommended to validate a model on a final independent dataset.</p><p>Coincidentally, there’s currently the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency challenge</a> under way, which is focused on finetuning an LLM on a single GPU. Since I was curious to see how the Llama-2 7B base model compares to our best LoRA model finetuned on Alpaca, I submitted both the base and the finetune model to their leaderboard.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-12-at-8.52.49%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="" width="471" height="174" srcset="https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-12-at-8.52.49 https://lightning.ai/pages/community/lora-insights/PM.png 972w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-12-at-8.52.49 https://lightning.ai/pages/community/lora-insights/PM-300x110.png 300w, https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-12-at-8.52.49 https://lightning.ai/pages/community/lora-insights/PM-300x110@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></p><p>(Note that the model above is actually not one of the best models, representing r=256 and alpha=256. The results for the best model r=256 and alpha=512, are still pending.)</p><p>We can see that the (Q)LoRA finetuning, which took 10522.77s (~3h) to train and required 19.24 GB GPU memory with the r=256 setting, improved the performance on several but not all benchmarks. The performance could potentially be improved by considering different finetuning datasets other than Alpaca and considering alignment techniques such as RLHF, which I explained in more detail <a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-training-rlhf-and-its-alternatives">here</a>.</p><h2 id="toc14">Conclusion</h2><p><span>This article explored the various knobs we can tune when training custom LLMs using LoRA. We found that QLoRA is a great memory-saver even though it comes at an increased runtime cost. Moreover, while learning rate schedulers can be beneficial, choosing between AdamW and SGD optimizers makes little difference. And iterating over the dataset more than once can make the results even worse. The best bang for the buck can be achieved by optimizing the LoRA settings, including the rank. Increasing the rank will result in more trainable parameters, which could lead to higher degrees of overfitting and runtime costs. However, when increasing the rank, choosing the appropriate alpha value is important.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This article was by no means exhaustive and in the sense that I did not have the time and resources to explore all possible configurations. Also, future improvements could be achieved by considering other datasets and models.</span></p><p><span>I hope that you can gain one or the other insight that you can apply to your projects. I kept the background information and explanations on various concepts like LoRA, learning rate schedulers, gradient accumulation, and so on to a minimum so that this article doesn’t not become unreasonably longer.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080128/2023-climate-tech-companies-blue-frontier-air-conditioning-energy-storage-climate-technology/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080128/2023-climate-tech-companies-blue-frontier-air-conditioning-energy-storage-climate-technology/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37870737">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>To meet this rising demand, 10 new AC units will be sold every second until 2050, according to estimates from <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/air-conditioning-use-emerges-as-one-of-the-key-drivers-of-global-electricity-demand-growth">the International Energy Agency</a>. But perversely, AC is itself a big contributor to greenhouse gases and will exacerbate climate change unless the technology improves.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Blue Frontier has one promising solution. Its AC system works to reduce humidity and cool the air in separate processes. This matters because maintaining the humidity in a space has as much impact on people’s comfort as managing temperature. But most AC systems prioritize the latter. What’s more, conventional humidity control <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2022/nrel-shows-impact-of-controlling-humidity-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html#:~:text=The%20researchers%20calculated%20air%20conditioning,million%20tons%20from%20removing%20humidity.">generates even more greenhouse gases</a> than cooling the air.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Blue Frontier’s approach has two steps: First, a salty mixture known as <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/26/1076731/materials-air-conditioning/">a desiccant</a> sucks moisture out of the air, reducing its humidity. Then, some of that now-dry air moves past a wet surface. Water evaporates back into the dry air and lowers its temperature (a process known as evaporative cooling). That cooled air then passes by the remaining air in the system and cools it, too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The company says this process makes its AC units three times more efficient than conventional systems and reduces their overall energy consumption by more than 60%.&nbsp;</p> 
 <hr>  <h2><strong>Key indicators</strong></h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Industry: </strong>Air conditioning&nbsp;</li>    <li><strong>Founded: </strong>2017</li>    <li><strong>Headquarters: </strong>Boca Raton, Florida, USA</li>    <li><strong>Notable fact: </strong>Blue Frontier is licensing technology originally developed at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which remains a close collaborator today.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> </ul>  <hr>  <h3><strong>Potential for impact</strong></h3>  <p>Air conditioners have gotten much more efficient over the years, but they are still responsible for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435122000940">about 4%</a> of greenhouse gases released globally every year. And emissions from cooling may be five times greater by 2050, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435122000940">researchers at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a>. Blue Frontier’s technology could help rein in those emissions even as air conditioning becomes more essential to daily life.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Air conditioners produce emissions by consuming electricity (often generated from fossil fuels) and by leaking refrigerants (which are potent greenhouse gases). Operating more efficiently allows Blue Frontier’s units to use less power. The units also contain alternative refrigerants, such as propane or a chemical compound known as R454B, that don’t pollute as much as the typical kind, known as hydrofluorocarbons.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Another important feature of the startup’s system is energy storage. The salty brew absorbs moisture from the humid air during the day, but it can be dried out by a heat pump at night when electricity demand is lower. That way the drying process doesn’t place as great a burden on the grid, which effectively is a form of energy storage. Then, when the sun comes up and temperatures start to climb, Blue Frontier’s AC can run for about four hours on the energy stored within that mixture.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That’s an important development, because the strain air conditioning puts on the grid during the hottest days of the year is a leading cause of blackouts and brownouts. Storing energy could shift much of that demand to off-peak times and make it easier to manage grids, particularly as they incorporate more renewable power, which can vary with the weather or time of day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </div><div><p>After factoring in the system’s improved efficiency, alternative refrigerants, and ability to store energy, Blue Frontier estimates its air conditioner reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% compared to a conventional unit.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Blue Frontier’s CEO Daniel Betts likes to compare the transformative power of more efficient AC to that of LED lightbulbs. But LED adoption in the US was driven by efficiency standards set by the federal government and, eventually, <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/incandescent-light-bulb-ban-what-you-need-to-know">a nationwide ban on incandescent bulbs</a>. No similar ban is on the horizon for current AC systems.</p>  <p>In addition, today’s technical standards and performance rating systems for AC systems (such as Energy Star in the US) <a href="https://rmi.org/when-heat-becomes-deadly-the-importance-of-next-generation-air-conditioning/">don’t evaluate</a> systems’ ability to manage both humidity and temperature, which could put new technologies like Blue Frontier’s at a disadvantage.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p>And Blue Frontier will face plenty of competition, including from established industry leaders like <a href="https://globalcoolingprize.org/">Daikin</a> that are also developing advanced cooling. That said, demand for AC is <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/air-conditioning-use-emerges-as-one-of-the-key-drivers-of-global-electricity-demand-growth">expected to skyrocket</a>, and a variety of approaches could ultimately succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <h3><strong>When</strong></h3>  <p>So far, the company has raised at least $26 million through grants, prizes, seed funding, and a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/breakthrough-energy-ventures-leads-20m-series-a-for-blue-frontiers-game-changing-sustainable-energy-storing-air-conditioning-301594941.html">Series A round</a> in July 2022 led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Betts says that’s enough to get them through the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Blue Frontier’s first product will be an AC unit with a capacity similar to the air conditioners most commonly used today in commercial buildings. Eventually, the company hopes to make units suitable for homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <h3><strong>Next steps&nbsp;</strong></h3>  <p>Two of Blue Frontier’s AC units are currently being field tested, and the company has tentative plans to install two more by the end of this year. Next year, it hopes to have 40 AC units in field tests so that it can collect enough performance data to prove their viability.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Betts says the company will likely raise a Series B in 2024 to start manufacturing more units, with an aim to begin selling them in 2025.</p>  <p><em><strong>Explore&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080528/2023-climate-tech-companies-electric-vehicles-batteries-carbon-removal-energy-storage/" target="_blank">the 2023 list of 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch</a>.</strong></em> </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="canvas">
  <p>The proposal of the European Commission for <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">a
  regulation on preventing and combatting the sexual abuse and sexual
  exploitation of children</a> is <a href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/debat_en_vergadering/uitgelicht/rondetafelgesprek-over-technieken-om-online-kindermisbruik-te">currently
  discussed</a> in Dutch parliament. I recently wrote <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/08/26/end-to-end-encryptie-en-risico-s-client-side-scanning/index.html">about
  some concerns</a> and <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/10/04/ddos-ing-client-side-scanning/index.html">the
  risk of a DDoS attack</a>. It turns out it is also possible to taint
  the database of images of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM),
  allowing an adversary to trick the client-side scanning system to also
  trigger an alarm for other, non CSAM, material. Client side scanning
  could thus be vulnerable to <em>undetectable</em> function creep.</p>
  <p>Client-side scanning works by matching images on a user device
  against the fingerprints stored in this central database. There is no
  independent way for the service providers or the devices to verify
  that the fingerprints in this data actual correspond to CSAM.
  Therefore the devices have to fully trust this database that this is
  indeed the case. As such the proposal already suffers from a
  significant risk of <em>function creep</em>, as the scope of the
  fingerprints contained in the database could be extended to allow the
  detection of other material, like those propagating terrorism or other
  hateful or abusive content. To be clear this is absolutely out of
  scope of the current proposal for a regulation that is strictly
  limited to the prevention of the spread of CSAM. But other legislation
  could be enacted in the future to broaden the scope, without any need
  to change anything to the detection system already in place to detect
  CSAM. This significantly lowers the barrier to enact such legislation.
  Hence the risk of function creep. But at least any push for such
  function creep will happen in plain sight.</p>
  <p>I am more concerned about an <em>surreptitious</em> form of
  function creep that appears to crop up with client-side scanning.</p>
  <p>Clearly, as new CSAM is being discovered, its spread needs to be
  prevented by adding the fingerprints of this newly discovered CSAM to
  the database. Strict procedures are (purportedly) in place to
  guarantee that only fingerprints of known CSAM are added to this
  database. (Otherwise, fingerprints of other offensive content could
  easily be added.)</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it is <em>impossible</em> to guarantee this.</p>
  <p>Consider an entity that is allowed to propose new entries to the
  CSAM database. A <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/prokos">recent
  paper</a> by Jonathan Prokos <em>et. al.</em>, shows that it is
  possible for an attacker to create a variant of some arbitrary source
  image that matches some target fingerprint. A <em>malicious</em>
  entity could <em>surreptitiously</em> taint the database with other
  offensive content using these techniques as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>It takes an image <span><em>A</em></span> of
  some offensive content, not being CSAM, for which it wants to add a
  fingerprint to the database. The entity keeps <span><em>A</em></span> secret.</li>
  <li>It computes its fingerprint <span><em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>. (Although the
  algorithms to compute this are proprietary, researchers have reversed
  engineered the commonly used PhotoDNA algorithm, and a binary
  implementation of PhotoDNA is available to compute the
  fingerprint.)</li>
  <li>It creates a convincingly looking synthetic variant of CSAM using
  recent AI techniques (or waits until it discovers a new image as being
  CSAM). Call this image <span><em>B</em></span>.</li>
  <li>Using the techniques from Prokos <em>et. al.</em>, it subtly
  modifies this source image <span><em>B</em></span>
  to create another image <span><em>B</em>′</span>
  whose fingerprint <span><em>F</em>(<em>B</em>′)</span> matches the target
  fingerprint <span><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.
  In other words <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′) = <em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.
  Note that the modifications to <span><em>B</em></span> do <em>not visibly alter</em>
  the image, so <span><em>B</em>′</span> will still
  pass as CSAM.</li>
  <li>The malicious entity submits the altered image <span><em>B</em>′</span> to the database.</li>
  <li>Because <span><em>B</em>′</span> is visibly
  indistinguishable from <span><em>B</em></span>,
  which was constructed or selected to be CSAM, the fingerprint <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′)</span> of <span><em>B</em>′</span> is accepted for inclusion in
  the database.</li>
  <li>But as by construction <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′) = <em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>,
  the malicious entity has now successfully ensured that the client-side
  scanning algorithm will also report any occurrence of <span><em>A</em></span> (the non-CSAM but otherwise
  deemed offensive image) to the abuse centre.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This shows that the database can be tainted with non-CSAM material
  by an entity that can submit entries to it. In the case of the
  proposed European regulation these are the Coordinating Authorities
  set up by each of the member states. Some of the member states
  (Hungary and Poland, for example) have shown certain authoritarian
  streaks, and should perhaps be less trusted with this new detection
  capability…</p>
  <p>The above attack is theoretical. The real question is of course
  whether this Would be an issue in practice?</p>
  <p>Suppose the database is tainted with image <span><em>A</em></span> (deemed offensive, but
  <em>not</em> being CSAM) as above. Then any person about to send this
  image will be notified that the scanner detected a possible case of
  CSAM, and that a report has been filed with the central reporting EU
  centre. Even though the EU Centre will quickly determine this is
  <em>not</em> a case of actual CSAM, this could still lead to chilling
  effects, as people may feel reluctant to use messaging apps to discuss
  anything sensitive as there is a (perceived) risk of being reported to
  the central EU Abuse centre. Even if this happens only
  occasionally.</p>
  <p>To really judge the impact of this attack in practice, it is
  important to also look at what happens when such a report is filed
  with the abuse centre. The report contains the image <span><em>A</em></span> (offensive perhaps, but not
  CSAM) and the fingerprint against which it matched. The abuse centre
  will look op the image <span><em>B</em>′</span>
  corresponding to the fingerprint (constructed by the malicious entity
  which looks like CSAM) and immediately conclude that <span><em>A</em></span> does not look at all like <span><em>B</em>′</span> and also is not CSAM. One could
  conclude that the abuse centre could thus easily spot the malicious
  entry in its database after a few of these reports all concerned with
  the same image, and delete the corresponding fingerprint from the
  database. If that were the case, this avenue of attack would not be a
  problem in practice. This assumes, however, that the abuse centre
  keeps track of such false positives over time to detect such
  maliciously uploaded fingerprints. This may or may not be the
  case.</p>
  <p>Moreover, we cannot consider this particular attack and its
  potential mitigation in isolation: we also need to consider other
  avenues of attack, and whether the mitigation proposed above perhaps
  <em>enables</em> other forms of attack. This brings us back to the
  DDoS attack on client-side scanning that <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/10/04/ddos-ing-client-side-scanning/index.html">I
  wrote about earlier</a>. Because that attack essentially uses the
  possibility to find fingerprint collisions in the opposite direction:
  it creates an innocent image whose fingerprint matches the fingerprint
  of known CSAM in the database. As discussed</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Removing these fingerprints from the database is clearly not an
  option, as this would prevent the detection of <em>actual</em> CSAM
  that matches these fingerprints.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So here we find the EU abuse centre confronted with an image that
  is clearly not CSAM, but perhaps could be considered offensive to
  certain governments. How does it determine whether the fingerprint
  being matched belongs to actual CSAM (uploaded in good faith) or
  synthesised (uploaded maliciously)? The judgement would be highly
  contextual and be wrong ever so often. The mere fact that a particular
  fingerprint is or is not the target of a DDoS attack (the number of
  matches could give at least that away) does not necessarily offer any
  resolution. And even a non-CSAM image that is uploaded only
  occasionally but that triggers the client-side detection system could
  just as well be an image constructed to match the fingerprint of
  actual CSAM, just to try to trick the abuse centre into removing the
  fingerprint from the database.</p>
  <p>Also note that if the client-side scanning system would be
  structured slightly differently, with reports of possible CSAM only
  being forwarded to certain authorities (e.g.&nbsp;when reports concerning a
  Hungarian user would only be forwarded to the Hungarian authorities),
  this form of function creep <em>would not</em> necessarily be
  detected. This shows that the overall design of the full client-side
  scanning system, including the way reports are handled, matters a
  lot.</p>

That may not be a good thing for startups, he cautions. "This area of A.I. is somewhat overhyped. It's over-invested, it's overvalued. When you're seeing seed-stage companies raise between $100 million and $150 million with nothing more than a pitch deck, that's a bit concerning."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the froth isn't unfamiliar.

<p>The Compact Calendar presents days as a continuous candy bar of time. Weeks are presented as a stack of available time with no gaps, making it easier to count-out days naturally as you think.</p>

<p>You can plan up to an entire year on a single sheet of paper! Print out a stack of them and keep them handy for when you need to roughly define project milestones or calculate recurring dates. These are great for taking notes during a planning meeting!</p>

<p>I’ve heard of people using them for estimating the gestation period of pregnant animals and planning family vacations. I’d love to hear more about your use, so please <a href="https://davidseah.com/contact" target="_blank">send me an email</a> and share your story with me!</p>

<p><span><img decoding="async" alt="Compact&nbsp;Calendar&nbsp;Example" loading="lazy" onclick="javascript:MDHPopUp('https://davidseah.com/_wpcontent/images/11/1128-compact-calendar-03.jpg',900,600,'Compact&nbsp;Calendar&nbsp;Example',1)" data-src="https://davidseah.com/_wpcontent/imgcache/images/11/1128-compact-calendar-03.jpg" src="https://davidseah.com/_wpcontent/imgcache/images/11/1128-compact-calendar-03.jpg"></span>
You can easily use Microsoft Excel to print variations with your own start/end dates. For convenience, I’ve also made the Compact Calendar available in several downloadable packages, and many others have chipped-in with their own versions for their country.
Download the package you want in the sidebar on the right of the page.</p>

<h2>About the Compact Calendar Package</h2>

<p>If you download the Excel version, you can <strong>change the starting date</strong> to generate a new calendar for <strong>any year</strong> you need with your own holidays.</p>

<p>The download comes as a ZIP archive containing three <strong>Excel 2007</strong> templates and six <strong>PDF</strong> versions, for all three week styles in both A4 and US Letter sizes. Optionally, you can download just the PDFs in either A4 or US Letter sizes.</p>

<p>The week styles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Week starting on Monday – your business working calendar, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601 week numbers</a>.</li>
<li>Week starting on Sunday – your typical home calendar week.</li>
<li>Week starting on Saturday – for countries that start the week on Saturday</li>
</ul>

<p>While the Excel templates include US holidays, it’s pretty easy to customize them for any country.</p>

<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you’d like to know more about the design and use of the calendar, the page <strong><a href="https://davidseah.com/compact-calendar-use-notes/" target="_blank">Using the Compact Calendar</a></strong> will give you the additional details.</p>

<h2>Modifying the Compact Calendar</h2>

<p>You’ll need <strong>Microsoft Excel 2007</strong> or better to modify the Compact Calendar’s XLTX files. If you are using an older version of Office on Windows, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/924074" target="_blank">this downloadable service pack</a> from Microsoft may help.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: The Compact Calendar is saved as an Excel Template (XLTX) file. If you double-click an Excel template file, it opens a <strong>copy</strong> that you can save without modifying the master template. If you want to edit the template itself, you should use FILE-&gt;OPEN menu from within Excel itself instead of double-clicking the file icon.</em></p>

<p>After you open the .xltx file, there are several worksheets (see the bottom of the screen) for the 12-month, 16-month, Holiday, and Instructions table:</p>

<br></p>

<p>Modifying the starting day of the calendar is very easy: just <strong>edit the starting date</strong> by typing in a new one. The calendar will update automatically.</p>

<p>If you need to make a longer calendar, that’s easy too: just <strong>extend the range</strong> as you would normally with any list in Excel. Incidentally, the Excel spreadsheet also includes a 16-month calendar as a separate worksheet.</p>

<p>Changing the background colors is a little trickier; you’ll have to edit the <strong>conditional formatting</strong> in use on the worksheet. This <strong>video</strong> might help:</p>

<h2>Downloading Notes</h2>

<p>Please note that <strong>Microsoft Excel 2007</strong> or newer is required. Other software like <em>Open Office</em>, <em>Google Docs</em>, and <em>Numbers</em> may import the Excel spreadsheet, but due to differences in the way they handle dates you should double-check that the calendars are correct.</p>

<p>For the <strong>official USA version</strong>, each zip archive includes with three templates (xltx). Printable PDFs included in each download. If you are using an older version of Excel, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/924074" target="_blank">Microsoft’s update directions</a> to add XLSX/XLTX file compatibility.</p>

<p>The <strong>international versions</strong> are NOT created by me. Please read the instructions on the international contributor’s website for a description of the download content.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>YC seems like a reasonable proposition. They give you some money to help you start your business, and they promise you access to a community of people that can help you along the way. In exchange, they only ask for a small amount of equity. Doesn’t sound that bad, no?</p><p>But by the end of this post I will convince you that it’s actually a terrible idea.</p><p>First, you have to understand a very important concept: in some systems, what’s best for a group is not necessarily what’s best for the individuals who make up the group. In other words, the total wealth of a group of people could be increasing, while almost everyone making up that group could be seeing their wealth diminish. When this happens, we say we have a non-ergodic system. If the system was ergodic, what’s happening to the collective would also translate to all individuals.</p><p><span>Silicon Valley is a non-ergodic industry (like Hollywood, book publishing, the music industry, and even your country’s economy unless you’re under full-blown communism.) A non-ergodic system is not necessarily bad, but if you’re not cognizant of the system you’re in, you’re going to be played like a fiddle. Those who benefit from the collective will take advantage of you, while you (as the individual) lose out. This is what YC will try to do to you. In fact, this is what YC </span><em>has</em><span> to do; otherwise it won’t survive. Let me explain. </span></p><p>Imagine you’re told there’s a bunch of hidden treasures within a 100 acre area. What’s the best strategy for finding some of these treasures?</p><p>One way is to pick a spot, and dedicate your entire life digging as far down as possible on that one spot. You might reason that the deeper the treasure, the bigger the loot. You don’t want to settle for a measly small treasure box. You want the full chest of diamonds buried near the end of the earth’s crust. This is your shot at glory.</p><p>Another way is to use a search method employed by search and rescue teams. You divide the area into small squares, and do a “reasonable search” in each one. You use probabilities and some common sense to help guide you how deep to dig, and then you move to the next square. If you encounter undisturbed compacted dirt, chances are there’s no treasure beneath. If you run into bedrock, it’s almost certain there’s nothing below. So you use that information and move on. Your goal is to search the entire area where there’s probable treasure as quickly as possible. Ideally within your lifetime.</p><p>I’m sure you agree with me that the first way is a dumb strategy. Almost every digger employing this strategy will die treasure-less. But actually, it’s only dumb for that individual treasure hunter. For a gold mining company, this is the optimal strategy.&nbsp;The company only needs one miner to hit jackpot, and all the other miners can die penniless. If the cost of sacrificing an individual treasure hunter is low, the most optimal strategy is to get tens of thousands of treasure hunters, allocate hundreds of them per acre, and make them dig all the way down to the earth’s core. The treasure hunting economy would grow much bigger than if all the individual treasure hunters were optimizing for their own self-interest.</p><p>So, digging in one spot is a dumb strategy for the economy of the individual, but a very wise strategy for the collective economy of all individuals.</p><p>This is what happens in a non-ergodic system. We often hear politicians claim that the GDP is growing, but all the gains are going to the 1%. This is the same thing. The wealth of a country could be growing, but almost all the citizens could be getting poorer. There’s nothing inconsistent with this. The average is simply being dragged up by the freak outliers.</p><p>The same thing happens in venture capital. The owners of the portfolio maximize their returns when the system is non-ergodic, because while the individual treasure hunter has one lifetime to strike gold, the VC portfolio has access to thousands of lifetimes: those of all the treasure hunters.</p><p>YC will proudly tell you that you are more likely to end up with a billion dollar business if you join them. That may be true. What they’re more reluctant to tell you is that only about 50 companies met that expectation out of the 4,000 or so that went through their program. That’s 1.25%. To be fair, that’s actually quite impressive, but let’s say you have the stamina and willpower to go through YC three times in your lifetime. You’d need approximately 26 lifetimes to hit the jackpot! Aha! See the problem now?</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I want to be successful in this lifetime. I can't afford to rely on 26 lifetimes. But maybe you think you’re special. You’re not like those 3,950 dummies who failed. Maybe you are in fact special, but I wouldn’t rely too much on that. Business is much more random than it seems. If business was predictable, YC wouldn't have a measly 1.25% success rate, or thereabouts.</p><p>You might think that those who failed might still have gotten something. Maybe. But failure is a very expensive way to learn those things. You don’t need to crash a plane to learn how to fly one. And whatever lessons are learned from going through YC are probably not very useful anyway, but more on that later.</p><p>One of the bad learnings you get from YC is that there’s a formula for success, and it looks like this: First you do some brainstorming. Then you come up with a good idea that can scale to a billion dollars (otherwise what’s the point of getting out of bed in the morning?) Then you work hard until you find “product-market-fit.” And then if the noises from investors indicate you won’t be getting a next round of funding, you start looking for a “pivot.”</p><p>This so-called formula is nonsense. First, good ideas rarely come to us from a brainstorming session. They come from wandering about with an open mind until we stumble on an opportunity worth pursuing. Most of your ideas will be bad ideas, because unfortunately you’re not a genius visionary. So the best way to find good ideas is to have many ideas, try them out, take what works, and throw away the rest. But this is not what YC wants you to do. YC wants you to pick an idea that has market pull (or the potential for it), and to then dig a hole in the same spot until you reach the boiling magma. Because what if you stop digging just before you strike gold? When you’re cheap and expandable, that’s not an optimal strategy for the YC fund. You must go all in. Diversification is for your YC overlords, not for you.</p><p>If you reach the magma layer and you still have nothing, then you’d be encouraged to pivot. But that’s not how you find business opportunities in the real world. You can’t just say I’m going to pivot, and suddenly a good opportunity lands on your lap from heaven. You get good ideas by embracing randomness for a long time, until something looks like it has a fighting chance of paying off. The pivot idea you were forced to come up with is extremely unlikely to be one. Your imagination is overrated. The YC execs didn’t imagine Stripe or Dropbox or AirBnb. Random things come to them during demo days. The YC folks are smart because they know their imagination is limited. And so should you. You can’t just pivot a business idea. And if you’re going to cherry pick some pivot that worked out of the thousands attempted, you should stop reading now. Just go join YC.</p><p><span>The second bad lesson from YC is the focus on the upside. But </span><em>if</em><span> there’s any formula for success in business, it’s to focus relentlessly on staying in the game rather than on hitting it big. Focus on the downside, and let the upside take care of itself. To thrive, you must first survive. To win the race, you must finish the race. And so on. But this is in tension with what YC wants you to do. They want you to dig deep to the middle of the earth, and if you don’t come back alive, tough luck. You were a brave soldier, but now it’s time for them to focus on the other 999 soldiers. YC is still alive, but you’re not.</span></p><p>Don’t be a dummy. Don’t be a bet in somebody else’s portfolio.</p><p>Ahahaha, you caught me! It’s true. I do have something to sell you. I run a community for small-time entrepreneurs who are satisfied with reliably attainable mediocre success. The YC folks feel sorry for our joy with mediocrity while they’re out there changing the world. And we reciprocate the emotion.</p><p>So yes, I am promoting something that goes against everything YC stands for. But if you think YC is not also selling you something, I have a bridge to sell you. But maybe I’m being a bit too harsh. Because what is it that YC is selling you exactly?</p><p>Me, I charge you a one-time payment of $245, and you get access to my community, which includes live workshops, recorded classes, a group chat, and a few other things. It’s very clear what I’m doing. I ask for some money in exchange for access, and those who give me the money get access. Even my 6 year old kid understands it.</p><p>But YC is not asking you for money. They actually give you money! It looks like you’re the one selling to them. You’re technically selling them a piece of your business, no?</p><p>No, no, no, hold on. The easiest way to see what YC is selling is to look at military recruitment. The military sells the narrative that serving your country is a noble endeavor. You’ll get a shot at glory, and at the very least you gain some important life skills. You’ll also get paid enough to feed yourself and cover your basic needs, but barely. The military wants to recruit expendable soldiers who will go out to the battlefield risking their lives and limb for the collective, while the generals with all the medals sit in an air conditioned room giving orders.</p><p>YC is no different. It wants to recruit wide-eyed young founders to pick a spot on the treasure map and dig all the way down through the earth’s crust. Most of them will spend years or decades digging, and all they end up with it is a ramen lifestyle. Usually bunched up with 4 roommates in a damp San Francisco basement living on take-out ramen noodles every single day. But hey, they’re young. They’ll have time to do adult things later, like starting family or making decent money. And at the very least, they’ll gain some important life lessons and make some good connections.</p><p>Think about this for a second: The most successful business owners are typically in their 40s and 50s. Why is YC full of 22 year olds? Why aren’t the 40 year old entrepreneurs taking up this incredible deal that YC is offering? YC will tell you it’s because only the 22 year old kids can be true visionaries. BULL. SHIT. You’re not a visionary. All those 4,000 kids who went into YC also thought they were visionaries, and where are they now? They’re all in the startup cemetery, except for a dozen or so who despite the low odds managed to flip 10 heads in a row. The biggest indicator YC is a bad deal is that only people who are easily duped take up these deals. </p><p>The best thing I learned about business is to avoid trying to predict what will work and what won’t. YC knows this. That's why they only make small bets in thousands of businesses. But YC will try to teach you the exact opposite.</p><p>Business is a lot more random than it seems. You can’t treat it like a predictable project. You need to treat it like a financial investment. Instead of investing your money, you’re investing your time and energy, which is as scarce and as precious as money (if not more). Tell me, how do you invest your money? Do you pick one amazing stock and put all your life savings on it? Of course not. You understand that finance is uncertain. What’s good today might not be good tomorrow. There are hidden risks everywhere. And even if your stock pick doesn’t go bust, the biggest gains are likely to happen elsewhere and you won’t benefit from them if you’re only exposed to one piece of equity.</p><p>YC teaches you to try to be a visionary. When you fail… Oopsie! Tough luck. The fund benefits from the non-ergodic nature of the system, but you’re out years of your time. But that’s not even the worst of it. You would have been taught things that not only won’t work in the real world of business, but are counterproductive. You will have to unlearn almost everything.</p><p>If you want to succeed in the real world (and within this lifetime), you need to try many small things, experiment, tinker, and build a portfolio of multiple income streams. You need to treat your time the same way you treat your brokerage account. You basically need to become a VC, but for your own ideas. To make the system ergodic, you must un-leverage yourself from going all in on one thing, and get access to many diverse income streams. The same way it’s wise to invest in a broad ETF, you should be doing the same things with your projects. YC will teach you to do the opposite, but you’ll have to unlearn all of it. And unfortunately unlearning is much harder than learning.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main_content">
        

<p>If you want a slightly shorter read, skip to <a href="#introducing-cackle-aka-cargo-acl">Introducing Cackle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothetical-story-about-alex">A hypothetical story about Alex</h2>

<p>Alex is a software engineer who has built a tool which she licences to her customers. She only has a
small number of clients, but they like her tool. She built her tool using Rust, with about 20 direct
dependencies from crates.io. When you count indirect dependencies, her tool has about 250
dependencies.</p>

<p>One of those indirect dependencies is a crate named <code>foobar</code>, which was written by someone named
Chris. Chris wrote <code>foobar</code> a few years ago, but has lost interest in maintaining it.</p>

<p>Someone called Bob has filed a couple of PRs against <code>foobar</code> and is now asking when they might get
merged and if the project is still maintained. Bob says that they’d be happy to maintain the crate
if Chris is too busy. Bob seems enthusiastic, so Chris adds Bob as an owner.</p>

<p>Some months go by and Alex is fixing a bug that one of her clients noticed. After fixing the bug,
she runs <code>cargo update</code>, runs the tests, does some manual testing, then pushes out the updated
version of her tool to her clients. The updated version of her tool includes an updated version of
the crate <code>foobar</code>.</p>

<p>A week later she gets a call from one of her clients who is extremely upset. It seems that the
client’s user database has been leaked and the attackers are threatening to publish it if a ransom
isn’t paid. Her client has determined that Alex’s tool is sending data to an unknown address on the
Internet.</p>

<p>After some investigation, Alex finds some code in the new version of <code>foobar</code> that is doing this.
She pins an old, unaffected version of the <code>foobar</code> crate and does a new release, but the damage to
her small business and her reputation is already done.</p>

<h2 id="supply-chain-attacks">Supply-chain attacks</h2>

<p>The story about Alex is an example of a supply-chain attack. There are many ways something like this
could happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A developer’s crates.io token could be compromised.</li>
  <li>A burned-out developer could hand over control of a crate to someone they don’t really know.</li>
  <li>Someone could build a crate, then submit PRs to other projects to make use of their crate. Later
they could add malicious code to their own crate.</li>
  <li>Developers sometimes add protest-ware to their own crates. Even if this is for a good cause, it
still has the potential to cause substantial damage and loss of trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of thing hasn’t happened much yet in the Rust ecosystem, but as it grows, it’s expected to
happen more often. It already happens semi-regularly in other larger ecosystems like node.js and in
Python’s package systems.</p>

<h2 id="practices-to-help-prevent-supply-chain-attacks">Practices to help prevent supply-chain attacks</h2>

<p>There are numerous things you can do to help prevent supply-chain attacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the code of crates that you use.</li>
  <li>Use and contribute to a code vetting database like
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet">cargo-vet</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev">cargo-crev</a>.</li>
  <li>Avoid depending on trivial crates that would only save you a few lines of code (e.g. left-pad from
node.js). Not only do trivial dependencies not save you much code, they’re also potentially higher
risk due to them being easier to create.</li>
  <li>All else being equal, prefer crates with more downloads.</li>
  <li>Select crates that are written by people you recognise and who have a good reputation in the
community - although everyone is new at some point, so this is a trade-off.</li>
  <li>Copy the <code>cargo add</code> command from crates.io rather than typing the name by hand. This can help
prevent you from being the victim of typosquatting attacks.</li>
  <li>For crates where you don’t need or want new features, bug fixes etc, you could consider pinning
their versions. If you do though, then you should monitor for security advisories.</li>
</ul>

<p>For crate authors there are some additional steps you can take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When reviewing PRs, look carefully at any newly added dependencies.</li>
  <li>Be careful about to whom you hand control of your crates.</li>
  <li>Consider asking new maintainers to fork your crate rather than handing it over.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introducing-cackle-aka-cargo-acl">Introducing Cackle aka cargo-acl</h2>

<p>Cackle is a code ACL checker and is an additional tool to help make supply-chain attacks harder.
It’s intended to be used in addition to the above approaches. Cackle is configured via <code>cackle.toml</code>
that sits alongside <code>Cargo.toml</code>. In the configuration file, you can define classes of APIs, such as
“net”, “fs” (filesystem) and “process” that you’d like to restrict. You then say which crates that
you depend on are permitted to use these APIs. When run, Cackle checks for any crates in your
dependency tree that are using restricted APIs that they’re not permitted to use.</p>

<p>An API definition says what names are included or excluded from that API. For example, we might
define the “process” API as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[api.process]</span>
<span>include</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"std::process"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
<span>exclude</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"std::process::exit"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Exclusions take precedence over inclusions, so should be more specific. Here we’re defining an API
named “process” and classifying any functions in the <code>std::process</code> module as belonging to it. We
then exclude <code>std::process::exit</code>. So a reference to <code>std::process::Command::new</code> would count as
using the <code>process</code> API, but a reference to <code>std::process::exit</code> would not.</p>

<p>We can then allow specific packages to use this API. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[pkg.rustyline]</span>
<span>allow_apis</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"fs"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
<span>allow_unsafe</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This says that the <code>rustyline</code> package is allowed to use filesystem APIs and also allowed to use
unsafe code.</p>

<p>In the case of Alex’s story, had she been using Cackle, then the <code>foobar</code> crate might have been
flagged as now using the “net” API where previously it wasn’t.</p>

<h2 id="installing-cackle">Installing Cackle</h2>

<p>For the time being, Cackle only supports Linux. Assuming you’ve already got Rust installed, you can
run:</p>

<div><pre><code>cargo <span>install</span> <span>--locked</span> cargo-acl
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="building-an-initial-config">Building an initial config</h2>

<p>Cackle has a built-in terminal UI that helps with creation of your cackle.toml. We’ll use that to
create our initial configuration. From the directory containing your <code>Cargo.toml</code>, run:</p>



<p>The problems pane shows problems that have been detected so far with the permissions used by your
dependencies. Initially, it also shows action items that help with creating your configuration.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/no-config.png" alt="Screenshot of missing config in UI"></p>

<p>We select a problem and press ‘f’ to show possible fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/no-config-fixes.png" alt="Screenshot of fixes for missing config in UI"></p>

<p>Here we can see two possible initial configurations that we can create. We select that we’d like to
use the recommended initial configuration and press ‘f’ to apply the fix.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/select-sandbox.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting a sandbox"></p>

<p>Next, the UI will ask us to select what kind of sandbox we’d like to use. At the moment, the only
supported sandbox is Bubblewrap. The sandbox is used for running build scripts, for running rustc
(and thus procedural macros) and for running tests. APIs used by each binary are checked by cackle
before they get run, so depending on how carefully you’re checking those API usages, you may decide
not to worry about sandboxing.</p>

<p>At this point, we’ve imported APIs that restrict network access, filesystem access and command
access via the standard library. We haven’t however restricted similar APIs that might be provided
by third-party crates in our dependency tree. For example, tokio can be used to perform network
access, but we haven’t classified any of its APIs as doing so.</p>

<p>Third-party crates can export cackle API definitions. If any do, then the cackle UI will ask us if
we’d like to import those API definitions. While cackle is fairly new however, it’s expected that
we’ll need to write such API definitions ourselves. We might write a “net” API definition for
<code>tokio</code> as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[api.net]</span>
<span>include</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"tokio::net"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we’re saying that references to anything in the <code>tokio</code> crate’s <code>net</code> module should be
classified as a use of the <code>net</code> API.</p>

<p>We can manually edit our cackle.toml to add this API definition. It will be merged with the
definition of the <code>net</code> API for the standard library that is built into Cackle and which we imported
when we created our initial configuration.</p>

<p>Cackle will now proceed to build your crate and its dependencies. As the build proceeds, cackle will
analyse object files, executables and source code to see what APIs are used from where and which
crates use unsafe. As problems are found, they’ll be added to the “problems” pane in the UI.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/problem-list.png" alt="Screenshot of problem list and package details"></p>

<p>Details about the package involved are shown in the bottom pane. You can use this to help understand
what the package does, which can be useful for deciding if it’s reasonable for it to use a
particular API.</p>

<p>If you’d like to see how a package was included, you can view the tree from current problem’s
package to your package by pressing ‘t’.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/package-tree.png" alt="Screenshot of a package tree"></p>

<p>For API usages and unsafe code, you can press ‘d’ to see further details of each usage location of
that API or unsafe code.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/unsafe-usages.png" alt="Screenshot of UI showing unsafe usage locations"></p>

<p>If you’re happy for the crate to use that API or unsafe, you can press ‘f’ to see available fixes to
the configuration file.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/allow-unsafe.png" alt="Screenshot of fix to allow unsafe"></p>

<p>Press ‘f’ again to apply the selected fix.</p>

<p>Similar to the unsafe usages, the usage locations for a disallowed API can be shown by pressing ‘d’.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/disallowed-api.png" alt="Screenshot of disallowed API usage locations"></p>

<p>Here we can see that the build script for the <code>quote</code> crate is using the process API by referencing
<code>std::process::Command</code>.</p>

<p>Like with other problems, we can press ‘f’ to see available fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/allow-api.png" alt="Screenshot of fix to allow an API"></p>

<p>We have a few options for allowing an API usage. The <code>quote</code> crate used the <code>process</code> API from its
build script. We can allow just this, which is the first available fix.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we might choose to allow the <code>quote</code> crate to use the <code>process</code> API, but only as part
of build scripts. This would mean that code in for example <code>quote</code>’s <code>lib.rs</code> could use the
<code>process</code> API if that code was then used by a build script from another package. It would also allow
<code>quote</code>’s own <code>build.rs</code> to use the <code>process</code> API.</p>

<p>Lastly we might allow <code>quote</code> to use the <code>process</code> API regardless of what kind of binary is being
built.</p>

<p>The bottom pane shows a description of the change being made as well as a diff of your
<code>cackle.toml</code>.</p>

<p>Only API usages in reachable code are considered. If you’d like to see how the code is reachable you
can press ‘b’ to get a backtrace showing a path of function references from main to the function
that used the API.</p>

<p><img src="https://davidlattimore.github.io/images/usage-backtrace.png" alt="Screenshot of backtrace for an API usage"></p>

<p>Here we can see that the ripgrep build script is calling clap’s <code>App::gen_completions</code>, which calls
<code>Parser::gen_completions</code> which is what’s using <code>File::create</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this isn’t a runtime backtrace - the build script hasn’t been executed yet. It’s a
hypothetical backtrace built from the graph of what functions reference what other functions. Press
escape to leave the backtrace.</p>

<p>Other kinds of problems that cackle might detect with your dependencies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A build script (build.rs) failing. This might be because it attempted to access the network, or
tried to write a file outside of its output directory. Possible fixes are to allow network access,
allow writes to a particular directory or disable the sandbox for that particular build script.</li>
  <li>A build script might emit instructions to cargo, requesting extra arguments to the linker. This
can be a source of code that we’re not checking, so we want to look to see if what’s being done is
reasonable, then if it is, allow it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all problems have been resolved, Cackle will exit.</p>

<p>We might like to integrate Cackle into our CI. To do so, we’d run:</p>



<p>And if we’d like to also then run the tests under cackle, we’d do:</p>



<p>In a github action, we might do this as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>cackle</span>
<span>on</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>push</span><span>,</span> <span>pull_request</span><span>]</span>

<span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>cackle</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Cackle check and test</span>
    <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>actions/checkout@v3</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>cackle-rs/cackle-action@latest</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>cargo acl -n</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>cargo acl -n test</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will do a non-interactive check of our dependencies against the configuration. If any problems
are encountered, details will be printed and it will exit with a failure status.</p>

<p>If your <code>Cargo.lock</code> is checked into your repository, you might like to add <code>rm Cargo.lock</code> to your
CI before running <code>cargo acl</code>, that way we’ll be checking the latest semver-compatible versions of
your dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>When you run <code>cargo acl</code>, Cackle invokes <code>cargo build</code>, but wraps rustc, the linker and any build
scripts. As the build progresses, the wrappers communicate back to the parent cackle process, which
analyses the build artefacts in order to determine what APIs are being used. It does this by parsing
the object files to determine what functions reference what other functions. It also parses the
debug information in the linked executable in order to determine the source locations for each
reference. Source files are then mapped back to the package that provided that source file via
<code>deps</code> files written by rustc.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the fact that Cackle analyses the final executable is that dead code is not
considered with regard to API usage. So for example if you depend on the <code>image</code> package to encode
PNGs, but don’t use functions from the image crate that read or write files, then those functions
shouldn’t go into the executable, which means Cackle won’t classify the image package as using
filesystem APIs. This means that if later, the <code>image</code> package started doing filesystem access from
a function that wasn’t previously, it would be flagged as using a disallowed API.</p>

<h2 id="circumvention">Circumvention</h2>

<p>There are of course ways to circumvent Cackle and use an API without detection.</p>

<p>One way is if your configuration is incomplete. For example, if your crate depends on tokio, but you
don’t add <code>tokio::net</code> to the includes for <code>api.net</code> then another of your dependencies could use
<code>tokio::net</code> to perform network access without being detected. Cackle tries to mitigate this to some
extent by looking for top-level modules with the same name as one of your APIs. So in the case of
tokio, Cackle will suggest that you add <code>tokio::net</code> to the <code>net</code> API.</p>

<p>Once you’ve granted a package permission to use an API, it has carte blanche to do whatever it likes
with that permission. Cackle provides strongest protection where crates have been granted no special
permissions. Similarly, once a crate is granted use of unsafe, it could in theory do just about
anything with it. That said, using unsafe to say perform network access is harder than just using
Rust’s <code>std::net</code> APIs, so we’re at least making it harder for a would-be attacker.</p>

<p>More problematic is that platform-specific or config-specific malicious code might be missed. For
example, malicious code that is only present on Windows or Mac would be missed since Cackle
currently only works on Linux.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are undoubtedly bugs that might allow API usage to go undetected.</p>

<h2 id="observations-from-running-on-a-few-different-binaries">Observations from running on a few different binaries</h2>

<p>When running cackle on a few popular binaries published to crates.io, what I’ve observed is that
usually, a bit under half of crates need no special permissions. This is great, because if at any
point any of these crates start using a restricted API or unsafe, we should notice.</p>

<p>Of the crates that need special permissions, by far the most commonly required is unsafe. Most
crates using unsafe provide some low level API that can’t be provided, or can’t be provided
efficiently without unsafe. I did however notice a number of crates where it’s not clear why they
would need unsafe.</p>

<p>Filesystem and process APIs are less used than unsafe, but still used a moderate amount, especially
from build scripts.</p>

<p>Network APIs are relatively uncommon and for a program that doesn’t talk over the network - e.g.
Cackle itself or something like ripgrep, I’d expect to see no dependencies using network APIs.
Indeed, for these two crates, this is what we see.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<h3 id="more-granular-sandboxing-of-proc-macros">More granular sandboxing of proc macros</h3>

<p>Right now, proc macros are sandboxed by virtue of Cackle running rustc in a sandbox. However this
means that all your proc macros are granted the same sandbox permissions. So if you have one proc
macro in your dependencies that needs network access, you need to grant this to all proc macros.
Fortunately most proc macros don’t need any network access, so this isn’t too much of a problem in
common cases.</p>

<p>If rustc at any point gets support for running proc macros as subprocesses rather than by loading
dylibs into the main rustc process, then we can sandbox each proc macro individually which will
allow us to fix this.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-analysis">Runtime analysis</h3>

<p>At the moment, we’re mostly only doing static analysis. It could be interesting to add some runtime
analysis to Cackle. Specifically, we could trace the syscalls made by build scripts (and ideally
also proc macros) and see what file paths they try to access and what subprocesses they spawn.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-more-platforms">Support for more platforms</h3>

<p>As mentioned previously, if we can’t work on Mac and Windows, then any attacks that target only
those platforms will go undetected. Making it work on Mac is hopefully not too much work, since Mac
uses the same debug information format as Linux. Windows is a little harder, since it uses a
different format for debug info. There is a crate that parses it though, so it’s probably doable.
Help is needed with both as I only have Linux.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cackle won’t (and can’t) stop all supply-chain attacks. However, hopefully it can be a tool that can
at least make it substantially harder for an attacker to sneak something malicious into your
dependencies without you noticing.</p>

		<p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/seeds-bounty/">This</a> is a fun challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NIST elliptic curves that power much of modern cryptography were generated in the late ’90s by hashing seeds provided by the NSA. How were the seeds generated? Rumor has it that they are in turn hashes of English sentences, but the person who picked them, Dr. Jerry Solinas, passed away in early 2023 leaving behind a cryptographic mystery, some conspiracy theories, and an historical password cracking challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there’s a $12K prize to recover the hash seeds.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37784499">backstory</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the backstory here (it’s the funniest fucking backstory ever): it’s lately been circulating—though I think this may have been somewhat common knowledge among practitioners, though definitely not to me—that the “random” seeds for the NIST P-curves, generated in the 1990s by Jerry Solinas at NSA, were simply SHA1 hashes of some variation of the string “Give Jerry a raise”.</p>
<p>At the time, the “pass a string through SHA1” thing was meant to <i>increase</i> confidence in the curve seeds; the idea was that SHA1 would destroy any possible structure in the seed, so NSA couldn’t have selected a deliberately weak seed. Of course, NIST/NSA then set about destroying its reputation in the 2000’s, and this explanation wasn’t nearly enough to quell conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>But when Jerry Solinas went back to reconstruct the seeds, so NIST could demonstrate that the seeds really were benign, he found that he’d forgotten the string he used!</p>
<p>If you’re a true conspiracist, you’re certain nobody is going to find a string that generates any of these seeds. On the flip side, if anyone does find them, that’ll be a pretty devastating blow to the theory that the NIST P-curves were maliciously generated—even for people totally unfamiliar with basic curve math.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that this is <i>not</i> the constants used in the Dual_EC_PRNG random-number generator that the NSA <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/11/securitymatters-1115/">backdoored</a>. This is something different.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As you may know, I am currently writing <a href="https://quantum5.ca/category/bgp/">a series</a> on BGP and how the
Internet works, from my perspective as the operator of a small autonomous
system, <a href="https://as200351.net/">AS200351</a>. While we haven’t really exhausted the theoretical
material, I think I’ve covered enough to enable readers to set up their own
basic autonomous system. Rather than forcing you to do your own research based
on outdated and potentially incorrect information on the Internet, or allowing
you to fall victim to scams, I think it would be wise to talk about the process
of getting your own ASN.</p>

<p>For readers who haven’t read the previous parts of the series and are unfamiliar
with why one might want an ASN, here’s a brief explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">autonomous system</a> (AS) is a constituent part of the Internet that can
define its own routing to the remainder of the Internet, and ASes exchange
routes with each other over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</a> to form the
Internet itself. By receiving a globally unique identifier, an AS number
(ASN), which in my case is 200351, I can exchange routes over BGP with other
ASes, announce my own IP addresses to the Internet, and control how traffic
flows in and out of my network, as opposed to simply exchanging traffic from a
default gateway to reach the Internet with an IP address assigned by my ISP.
This comes with several advantages, such as being able to switch upstream ISPs
at will (or when such an ISP fails) without changing my IP addresses or
breaking a single connection; or to advertise the same IP addresses from
multiple locations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast">anycasting</a>) to allow users to reach my services
with lower latency than otherwise permissible by the speed of light with
automatic failover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will now share what I wish I knew when I impulsively decided to apply for an
ASN at 3 a.m. on a cold December night last year, now that I’ve been doing this
for a while. I’ll walk through the process as objectively and thoroughly as
possible, demystifying the role of any player in this space. I would like you to
go into this with full knowledge of the risks and a full understanding of where
your money is going. In the end, I will offer some subjective suggestions on
providers, but those can be ignored if you would rather do your own research.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-rir">Choosing an RIR</h2>

<p>As mentioned before in this series, ASNs and IP addresses are <em>Internet
numbers</em>, which are resources ultimately managed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority">IANA</a>, whose
assignment is delegated to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry">Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)</a>. There
are five RIRs in the world, but since I only have experience with <a href="https://arin.net/">ARIN</a>
and <a href="https://ripe.net/">RIPE NCC</a>, I will mostly focus on these two.</p>

<p>Typically, RIRs allocate ASNs directly to end users, whereas RIRs may allocate
IP addresses directly, but also to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry#Local_Internet_registry">Local Internet Registries (LIRs)</a> who
allocate them to end users. In order for RIRs to issue an ASN, they typically
require you to have your own IP addresses that you can announce with BGP, so you
probably want to get IP addresses first—either from an RIR directly or from an
LIR—or get them <em>with</em> the ASN if that’s an option. Note that it’s possible to
use your own IP addresses without your own ASN by getting an ISP to announce
them for you, a service typically called “bring your own IP” or BYOIP, but we
aren’t doing that here.</p>

<p>Given the current state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">IPv4 address exhaustion</a>, you will
almost certainly be getting IPv6 addresses, likely exclusively. As such, IPv6
will be the main focus.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to choose an RIR for your ASN and IP addresses. Even if
you choose to use an LIR for your IP addresses, they ultimately come from an
RIR, and the choice of RIR affects how you manage your resources as well as how
the resources can be used. The “conventional wisdom” here—espoused by the top
search results from hobbynet bloggers—is that ARIN is focused on businesses and
RIPE is more hobbynet-friendly, but that’s a rather distorted version of the
truth. I’ve done my reading in the past and thought this way once, but I’ve come
to realize that things are a lot more complicated than that.</p>

<p>At this point, it might be worth noting that each RIR has its own policies on
how resources are allocated and how membership is managed, and these policies
are mostly motivated by the situation in their service region.</p>

<h3 id="ripe">RIPE</h3>

<p>Either way, let’s start with RIPE—or really, RIPE NCC, the <em>Réseaux IP
Européens</em> Network Coordination Centre. This is the RIR responsible for “Europe
and the Middle East”. Due to the relative difficulty of creating companies or
getting a trade name for sole proprietors in Europe, RIPE allows
“organisations”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to be created directly with personal names without
question.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> For this reason, RIPE is perceived to be a lot more friendly
toward hobbyists.</p>

<p>RIPE will only serve users who live or have “network presence” in their service
region. As far as RIPE is concerned, the latter means having at least a single
VPS in the region, which should be announcing at least one route under your ASN,
if you choose to get an ASN from them. If you aren’t a resident in the region,
you will be asked to produce an invoice for it. As long as you fulfill this
requirement, your RIPE resources may be used anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>IP resources in RIPE are broadly divided into two categories—Provider
Aggregatable (PA) and Provider Independent (PI). PA addresses are large blocks
(typically /29 or larger) allocated by RIPE to LIRs, who can in turn hand them
to whoever they please—well, subject to RIPE policy. In practice, there aren’t
many restrictions, and I’ve seen smaller blocks (especially /44 or smaller)
regularly being given away for free. It is <strong>important</strong> to note that as far as
RIPE is concerned, the PA block <em>belongs to the LIR</em> and <strong>not</strong> to the end
users to whom the LIR has assigned subblocks. This means that should the LIR go
under, RIPE <em>will take back the entire IP block</em> and end users will lose their
allocations without much warning. Therefore, when using PA addresses, it is
important to use an LIR that you can trust to continue existing.</p>

<p>You should also understand how LIRs operate. To become an LIR, RIPE will charge
a one-time fee, currently €1000, along with an annual fee, currently €1550, to
be paid in January of every year, which is prorated for new LIRs. RIPE
subscribes to the “one LIR, one fee” policy, which means large and small LIRs
pay the same. For details, see the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support/payment">RIPE payments page</a>. By policy,
each new LIR is entitled to a /24 of IPv4 (due to IPv4 exhaustion, any new LIR
will wait a long time before receiving it) and no more. For IPv6, new LIRs are
entitled to a /29 without justification.</p>

<p>If you choose to get PA addresses from an LIR, keep in mind they probably have
at least a /29 (which is 512k /48s) and are paying €1550/year for it. This means
that if they manage to fully sell their initial /29, they’ll break even selling
each /40 for 76 cents, each /44 for 4.8 cents, or each /48 for 0.3 cents per
year. Taking into account the sales and management overhead and the fact the LIR
might not sell 99% of their space, an LIR should probably not charge more than
$20/year for a PA block of /44 or smaller, or more than $40/year for a /40.</p>

<p>PI addresses are small blocks, typically no larger than /48, issued by RIPE
directly to end users. Of course, RIPE doesn’t deal with end users
directly—instead, users need to get an LIR to sponsor their request and act as
the intermediary. For each PI request, RIPE currently charges €50/year. A single
request may result in multiple /48s being allocated if the requester has
multiple sites and requests a /48 for each, as that’s the minimum routable size
on the Internet. It is very rare if not impossible for RIPE to allocate a /44 or
larger block of PI addresses, whether contiguously or in aggregate, so any LIR
purporting to sell that is unlikely to be able to deliver.</p>

<p>Typically, an LIR would charge a bit more than €50/year to handle the request,
but they are probably ripping you off if they charge more than double that.
Also, note that PI addresses are severely limited in use cases compared to PA.
For the exact details, see <a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/ipv6/request-ipv6/how-to-request-an-ipv6-pi-assignment">the RIPE policy on this</a>. Furthermore, if
the sponsoring LIR for a PI block goes under, RIPE will ask the end user to find
another LIR sponsor within 30 days or take back the resource.</p>

<p>ASNs function very similarly to PI resources and require the same sponsorship
process, but they currently cost the LIRs nothing to get. This may change one
day. There was a proposal this year at the RIPE NCC General Meeting to add a
€50/year/ASN fee, but the motion has been defeated, though it may show up again.
For this reason, I think LIRs that charge annual fees for ASNs are being
unreasonable. In general, I don’t think an ASN should cost more than $100
one-time to issue.</p>

<p>Since IP addresses are required for an ASN to be issued, it’s also common for
LIRs to sell ASN and IP bundles. In these cases, the one-time fee should cover
the ASN and the recurring fee for the IP range.</p>

<h3 id="arin">ARIN</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the RIR
responsible for the US, Canada, and some Caribbean islands. In this region, it
is a lot easier to start a business, so ARIN requires you to be some form of
business before they will deal with you. From this, people get the impression
that ARIN hates hobbyists. This is not true, since ARIN will accept the simplest
business structure—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship">sole proprietorship</a>. Typically, they would like you
to have a trade name, which you can typically request from your local government
for a small sum of money. For example, in the province of Ontario, Canada, the
government issued me a “Business Name” for “Dynamic Quantum Networks” for $60
CAD, which is valid for 5 years. This is not more expensive than a domain name.
Alternatively, ARIN will let you use your personal name if you can prove you
have been doing business under that name.</p>

<p>For IP addresses, ARIN has two styles of allocations—ISP/LIR and end user.
ISP/LIR allocations are quite similar to RIPE’s concept of PA addresses. An ARIN
LIR can allocate their IP range to their customers as they please, provided that
records are kept to demonstrate that suballocations have been reasonable when
requesting more addresses. End user allocations are similar to PI, but ARIN
doesn’t have the concept of sponsorships. Instead, ARIN allocates resources
directly to the end user. In general, it probably makes more sense to request
resources as an ISP/LIR if possible, since the policies are a lot less
restrictive. For details, see the <a href="https://www.arin.net/participate/policy/nrpm/">Number Resource Policy Manual (NRPM)</a>,
specifically sections 4.2, 4.3, and 6.5.</p>

<p>Note that, unlike RIPE which allows your resources to be used anywhere, ARIN has
a more strict out-of-region use policy, requiring /22 of IPv4 to be used
in-region before you can use any IPv4 out-of-region. For IPv6, this is a /44
used in-region. For ASNs, the ASN must be present on at least one peering
session in-region. For details, see <a href="https://www.arin.net/participate/policy/nrpm/#9-out-of-region-use">the policy</a>.</p>

<p>ARIN has several one-time fees, such as for creating an organization, which is
required to receive any allocation. This fee is currently $50. ARIN’s annual
fees are based on the amount of resources that you have, currently starting at
$250 for up to a /24 of IPv4 and a /40<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of IPv6. Currently, ARIN charges $550
to allocate an ASN and $150/year/ASN for ASN-only organizations. If you have any
IP addresses, you instead pay the annual fee and all ASNs are free once issued.
For details, see the <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/fees/fee_schedule/">fee schedule</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, this fee schedule is changing to be more reasonable—ASNs will be free
to allocate, and the smallest $250 annual fee covers up to 3 ASNs. For details,
see <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/fees/fee_schedule/2024_faq/">the FAQ for this change</a>.</p>

<p>The simplified summary of ARIN’s allocation policy is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An LIR can request an initial IPv6 allocation of /32 without justification. An
LIR may choose to receive a /36 or a /40 instead to save on fees, but ARIN
reserves the full /32 and you can choose to upgrade at any time without
justification;</li>
  <li>An LIR can request an IPv4 allocation of /22 by going on the waitlist, for a
total of /20. An LIR may also request special reserved blocks with proper
justification; and</li>
  <li>An LIR can request an ASN with two peering partners.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-rirs">Other RIRs</h3>

<p>APNIC may be an option if you live in the Asia-Pacific region. I am not familiar
with their policies, but I know they give a /23 of IPv4 addresses to each new
LIR, which is also the maximum amount of IPv4 APNIC will ever allocate.</p>

<p>AfriNIC and LACNIC don’t have all the features you’d expect from APNIC, ARIN,
and RIPE. For example, neither has an RPKI publication service for their
members, requiring the user to maintain their own. AfriNIC in particular is
also involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFRINIC#Controversies_and_scandals">many controversies and scandals</a>.</p>

<h3 id="decision">Decision</h3>

<p>I am not qualified to speak about APNIC, AfriNIC, or LACNIC, so I won’t. If you
live in their service region, you are welcome to do your own research and
compare them with RIPE, which remains a popular option for hobbyists in those
regions.</p>

<p>This leaves us with ARIN and RIPE. At first glance, ARIN might seem a lot more
expensive than RIPE, but keep in mind that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>even paying the lowest possible annual fee, you are a full member of ARIN and
can receive resources directly. This means you don’t need to worry about your
LIR going under; and</li>
  <li>ARIN has reserved pools of IPv4 addresses that can be immediately allocated
if you qualify for them. Given that the market rate of an IPv4 /24 is around
$1000/year, and that you will need to pay the full LIR fee to even get on
RIPE’s waitlist for a /24, ARIN’s $250/year fee for a /24 seems quite
reasonable. ARIN also has an IPv4 waitlist, but at least you don’t pay for
the resources until you receive them and you can request up to a /22 at once.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, RIPE seems like a decent choice for a beginner on a budget trying
to get the cheapest ASN and an IPv6 block possible, as long as the caveat with PA
addresses is understood. For a more serious network operating in ARIN’s service
region, especially one looking to run IPv4, ARIN is a strong contender.</p>

<p>Note that you can get IP space from one RIR and announce it with an ASN from
another RIR without issue. I personally operate AS200351, an ASN from RIPE, with
IP space from ARIN. If I were starting next year, given the knowledge that I
have now, I would probably have just gone with ARIN for everything.</p>

<h2 id="getting-an-asn">Getting an ASN</h2>

<p>First, regardless of RIR, you need to have two peers to justify having
an ASN. You can ask people in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipv6">IPv6 networking discord</a> if they are
willing to peer.</p>

<p>You are also strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with the policies of
your chosen RIR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For RIPE, these are <a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-804">RIPE-804</a> for IPv4, <a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-738">RIPE-738</a> for
IPv6, and <a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-679">RIPE-679</a> for ASNs; and</li>
  <li>For ARIN, this is the <a href="https://www.arin.net/participate/policy/nrpm/">NRPM</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to use RIPE, you will need to find an LIR with a good reputation
that charges reasonable fees and get some PA addresses from them, which they
should be able to allocate very quickly, then request an ASN. Many LIRs offer
some IP+ASN bundle that does both together. If you are unsure which LIR to pick,
feel free to ask in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipv6">IPv6 networking discord</a>, and I’ll also post
some recommendations below. Once you’ve done this, you will need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Register an <a href="https://access.ripe.net/registration">RIPE NCC Access account</a>;</li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/RIPE/person/self">person and maintainer pair</a> in the RIPE database (the
form should be self-explanatory);</li>
  <li>Create an <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/RIPE/organisation">“organisation” object</a> in the RIPE database. For
<code>org-name</code>, use your legal name or the name of a company that you control.
For <code>mnt-ref</code>, enter the <code>mntner</code> you created earlier. By the way, you will
also need to add a second <code>mnt-ref</code> entry later for your LIR to be able to
assign you an ASN or IP space, and they should tell you which one to add.
Everything else should be self-explanatory;</li>
  <li>Give the chosen LIR information on all the objects you’ve created in the RIPE
database and probably pay them as well;</li>
  <li>Sign an agreement with the LIR;</li>
  <li>Wait for the LIR to give you an identity verification link from RIPE<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and
then complete the verification; and</li>
  <li>Wait for RIPE to issue your ASN.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are going with ARIN, they have video guides for <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/account/">setting up your Org
ID</a> and <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/request/">requesting IP addresses</a>. You want to create an Org
ID, sign the Registration Services Agreement, request an initial allocation for
IPv6, then request an ASN.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-with-an-asn">What to do with an ASN</h2>

<p>Once you have an ASN, there are a few things you should probably do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an AS-set for your AS-macro, which I talked about <a href="https://quantum5.ca/2023/07/19/diving-into-autonomous-systems/#as-sets-routing-registries-and-cones">earlier</a>.
You want to create this in the database of whichever RIR you used. You should
use the hierarchical form, naming it something like <code>ASx:as-all</code> where <code>x</code> is
your ASN, and add your own ASN as its sole member; and</li>
  <li>(Optional but recommended) Register on <a href="https://peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a> and create a profile
for your ASN on it. You can use <a href="https://peeringdb.com/asn/200351">mine</a> as a reference.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, you will need to find a BGP-capable server or colocation provider and pick
an IP range (/24 or larger for IPv4, /48 or larger for IPv6) to announce from
that server. You will most likely need to ask your provider to request a BGP
session, at which point you should tell them your ASN, AS-macro, and the IP
ranges you plan to announce. They may send a random string to the contact on
your organization object or the <code>aut-num</code> object for your ASN in the RIR whois
database and ask you to produce it, or ask you to set up RPSL declaring that
your provider is allowed to act as your upstream. In the latter case, if you
received AS64500 and your upstream is AS64510, you will need to add the
following lines to your <code>aut-num</code> object:</p>

<div><pre><code>import:         from AS64510 accept ANY
export:         to AS64510 announce AS64500:as-all
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can set up a basic BGP session with any BGP daemon. I would recommend using
whatever your BGP-capable router uses, or <a href="https://bird.network.cz/">bird</a> if you are just using a
Linux server. If you are using <code>bird</code>, you can build a configuration yourself
with the sample snippets from my <a href="https://github.com/quantum5/bird-filter"><code>bird</code> filter library</a>, or use a
configuration generator like <a href="https://pathvector.io/">PathVector</a>.</p>

<p>Now comes the hard part—building up your own network. There are many things you
can do, such as joining Internet Exchanges and getting multiple upstreams. The
possibilities are endless, and I can’t begin to explain everything that’s
possible. You will likely need to learn through trial and error. Good luck! If
you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipv6">IPv6 networking
discord</a>, where there are many people happy to help you out.</p>

<p>If there is popular demand, I may write a more in-depth post on setting up your
ASN. Otherwise, I’d probably just continue writing about the theory.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>This is when things get subjective. The providers listed here are believed to
have a good reputation by me or by people that I believe to be trustworthy and
charge reasonable rates. However, please use your common sense in case things
change. Also, if I use an affiliate link, I will offer an unaffiliated option as
well.</p>

Most forget to tell.</p></li><li id="viewer-9d71"><p><strong><span>Keep in mind that I do not have to go "nuclear big" to be successful.</span> </strong>One's goals should be self-determined, not decided or influenced by another.</p></li><li id="viewer-9at33"><p><strong><span>Read and apply "The Mom Test"</span></strong><span> </span>(a book by Robert Fitzpatrick) - otherwise I will not be executing on the business optimally. Plenty of great tips on how to scale a business following a customer-based approach. Remember, you are not your customer - so you must look at everything your business is and does through the lens of the market. Interviews, surveys, focus groups, ethnographic studies - whatever it takes.</p></li></ul><blockquote id="viewer-5lino"><span><strong><span>Learn how to sell &amp; pitch an idea.</span> </strong>No one can sell the product better than its founder. The faster sales skills can be developed, the faster the idea takes off.</span></blockquote><ul><li id="viewer-4rbmk"><p><strong><span>Start by providing professional services before having a product.</span></strong><span> </span>This will help generate some early revenue, it will validate that someone is willing to pay for the business' services, it'll help develop a better understanding of what the product is required to do, and most importantly, it'll help build early relationships with crucial clients. These professional services can then be streamlined by automating them with the early product. Then over time, these professional services would be switched out entirely for the product.</p></li><li id="viewer-489le"><p><strong><span>Hone my writing skills</span></strong> - or at least know what looks like good writing <em>(to edit outsourced content or chatGPT-written texts)</em>.

We see examples of this all the time with successful projects on Product Hunt, Kickstarter or Itch (for game developers).

Very rarely are founders able to achieve both "rich" and "king" outcomes.</p></li><li id="viewer-54lde"><p><strong><span>Be extra careful of accepting investments from venture capitalists.</span></strong><span> </span>One can lose control and focus on the business.

This goal is doable with fewer than 5 people in the first year.</p></li><li id="viewer-11igk"><p><strong><span>Not hire a single non-founder until I have achieved PMF (product-market fit).</span></strong><span> </span>This prevents premature scaling and having the pressure of being responsible for a team while the prospect of success is yet to be determined.</p></li></ul><blockquote id="viewer-apd2c"><span><strong><span>Pick partners/ co-founders with intelligence, energy and integrity.</span></strong><span> </span>Intelligence allows them to help build solutions, work more autonomously, and present strength where the CEO falls short. Energy enables them to virtually multiply their power of contribution and acts as a morale booster for the rest of the team. Integrity is an important safeguard that offers peace of mind that they will do what they say and not purposefully act against the best wishes of all stakeholders.</span></blockquote><ul><li id="viewer-3d7pg"><p><strong><span>Keep in touch with good old friendships &amp; relationships</span></strong> - especially if they are doing well in life or look to be going places. As there's already built in trust, they can be approached to become your co-founders, partners, or investors.</p></li><li id="viewer-1qnp0"><p><strong><span>Find a co-founder with a B2B sales background</span></strong> - especially in a mid-tier company <em>(those that are small enough to work with small businesses but also big enough to land F500 clients)</em>. They can help you close deals you wouldn't even know how to approach.</p></li><li id="viewer-avf18"><p><strong><span>Hand over marketing to someone who is a specialist.</span></strong> Ideally someone who can diagnose and then prescribe the best solution unique to the business - instead of someone who presents a bunch of marketing strategies. A CEO or founder's main role is to focus on the long term vision of the company; they know they need marketing but are oftentimes unsure as to what specifically needs to be done. </p></li><li id="viewer-57d33"><p><strong><span>To manage the financials, only hire a part-time bookkeeper if absolutely necessary within US$ 0 - 1 million ARR.</span></strong><span> </span>Then look to hire a Director of Finance/ Controller once ARR is within the US$1 - 5 million threshold to manage AR/AP, audits, ASC 606, basic financial modelling, and key revenue benchmarks. Only once ARR is above US$5 million can one consider hiring a CFO (Chief Financial Officer) - depending on the company's growth rate. It is possible to get to US$10+ million with a good Director of Finance and a good FP&amp;A person.</p></li><li id="viewer-etacs"><p><strong><span>Keep in mind that it takes roughly 7 months to fully recruit someone. </span></strong>1 month for the interview, roughly 3 months to wait for them to leave their old job or to be fully able to work with the business, and 3 months to fully integrate them and get them up to speed.</p></li></ul><div id="viewer-9o9rv" aria-label="SaaS startup founder interview" data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><wow-image id="nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;new-image2752026&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;isLQIP&quot;:true,&quot;isSEOBot&quot;:false,&quot;lqipTransition&quot;:&quot;blur&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:5607,&quot;height&quot;:3738,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-animate-blur=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg" alt="SaaS startup founder interview" data-pin-url="https://www.justbeepit.com/post/saas-startup-founders-what-advice-would-you-give-your-younger-selves-here-s-what-they-said" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_5000,h_3333,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/nsplsh_654637484e343057624151~mv2_d_5607_3738_s_4_2.jpg"></wow-image></div><ul><li id="viewer-bb945"><p><strong><span>Create a strategy for recruiting people with more expertise in an area than I have, as well as develop effective ways (built around metrics) to evaluate performance. </span></strong>Selecting the best hires for legal, financial or human resource (to a lesser degree) positions will be easier due to accreditations and industry guardrails. However, determining who can definitely do the work for roles in sales and marketing is a greater challenge, since they tend to interview well.</p></li><li id="viewer-n3fl"><p><strong><span>Acknowledge that the skills to get a product off the ground are very different from those required to scale a business.</span></strong> It's often said there are "three CEOs". Similarly in the case of co-founders, most are only needed for a certain phase of time; very few manage to stick it out until the end.</p></li></ul><blockquote id="viewer-2em5p"><span><strong><span>Look for what's working - keep on doing that</span></strong> and eliminate what doesn't. Nothing is going to be perfect, a large majority of companies only breakeven in their second year - it was all trial and error prior to that.</span></blockquote><ul><li id="viewer-9hjjh"><p><strong><span>My time and money is usually better spent on ads.</span></strong> Sure, launching on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, or Hacker News may draw organic attention and traffic - especially if one achieves being featured at the top spot or on the first page. However, hitting it big on these platforms doesn't necessarily equate to conversions for B2B products because most of their communities just want freebies. Furthermore, soliciting feedback is difficult with their quickly shifting attention spans. Ads are quicker to send out, highly targeted and have potentially more reach - all of which translate into a better chance of increasing the conversion rate.</p></li><li id="viewer-ah7n9"><p><strong><span>Keep on trying.</span></strong><span> </span>Don't quit too hastily. The problem often lies in a skill gap which can be filled or a tweak in strategy that has to be made - not that your startup idea is bad. As a startup founder you may take that occasionally glance at those employed with some envy. But sure, getting a job may allow one to earn a few hundred thousand year, but it won't get them any closer to freedom.</p></li></ul><div id="viewer-e0jh8" aria-label="SaaS startup founder working on rooftop" data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><wow-image id="nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;new-image2752027&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;isLQIP&quot;:true,&quot;isSEOBot&quot;:false,&quot;lqipTransition&quot;:&quot;blur&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:4608,&quot;height&quot;:3456,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-animate-blur=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_110,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg" alt="SaaS startup founder working on rooftop" data-pin-url="https://www.justbeepit.com/post/saas-startup-founders-what-advice-would-you-give-your-younger-selves-here-s-what-they-said" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_4608,h_3456,al_c,q_90/nsplsh_5a336f776e455473644e51~mv2_d_4608_3456_s_4_2.jpg"></wow-image></div><h3 id="viewer-64lho"><span><span><span>Found this post helpful?

			<h3>CV</h3>
			<p><a id="Truong97" name="Truong97"></a><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Krause">Kai Krause</a></strong> [today: <a href="http://kai.sub.blue/">kai.sub.blue</a>]was born 1957 in Dortmund. He came to California in 1976 with two friends. He worked as a musician for <em>Disney Sound Effects</em>; <strike>the sound track for “Star Trek: The Movie” was created on his synthesizers</strike>*. <span>* In fact Kai won a Clio Award for his sound effects in a Star Wars radio spot.</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_&amp;_Powell">Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell</a> bought sound systems from him and he is still working with <a href="https://petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</a> today in order to fulfill his vision of visualized music as 3D sculptures. [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTruong97">Truong97</a>]</p>
			<p>He was running a forum for several years on AOL: <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html"><em>Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</em></a>. He gave people tips and little pieces of code on line, simply because they shared his passion for computer graphics. This became an extensive and valuable collection of practical information how to get special effects with <em>Adobe Photoshop</em>. It can still be downloaded from several web sites. [<a id="KaiTT" name="KaiTT" href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKaiTT">KaiTT</a>]</p>
			<h3>The Company</h3>
			<p><img src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/history.jpg" height="441" width="803"></p>
			<p>Fig. 1 Timeline with companies and products</p>
			<p><em>Harward Systems Corporation</em> (HSC Software Corp.) [also <em>Happy Software Company</em>] was founded by John Wilczak. Ben Weiss and Kai joined him in 1991 at HSC and created the first version of <em>Kai’s Power Tools</em>. KPT is a set of plug-ins that use the Adobe Photoshop programing interface for 3rd party filters. Many ideas from <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html">Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</a> get implemented as simple and easy to use pieces of software. KPT evolved until version 3 in 1995. This release contains the <em>Texture Explorer</em>, the <em>Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Lens f/x</em> among others. <em>Convolver</em> came out as a separate product. HSC was renamed to <em>MetaTools, Inc.</em> the same year.</p>
			<p>Eric Wenger and Phil Clevenger came into the team to develop a landscape-simulating product called <em>Bryce</em> (named after the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm">Bryce Canyon</a>). They started creating other kinds of software starting with <em>Kai’s Power GOO</em>, <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> and <em>Kai’s Power Show</em>. Before GOO, Kai was well known only by computer artists as a creator of creative tools. With GOO, Kai became noticed by a much broader audience. People played with GOO. The complex and difficult algorithms are well hidden by the interface. Even children can change images of their classmates or teachers to funny caricatures. Kai himself calls this sort of computer programs <em>funware</em>.</p>
			<p>In 1998 Phil Clevenger and Kai managed to transfer the main interface concepts from Bryce to <em>Poser3</em>. Poser was originally created by <em>Fractal Design</em>. The companies MetaTools and Fractal Design merged in 1997. The new company was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaCreations"><em>MetaCreations Corp</em>.</a> In 1998 it had about 300 employees. The main office is in Santa Barbara, CA, but several other facilities e.g. in San Francisco, are part of MetaCreations. <a id="MCRE" name="MCRE"></a>[<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refMCRE">MCRE</a>]</p>

			<h3>Maximize the Interface</h3>
			<h4>Full Screen Mode</h4>
			<p><a id="Kai95-1" name="Kai95-1"></a>Kai describes how it came to the large dialogs in KPT3: <span><a href="https://docplayer.org/33181705-Kai-s-power-tools-forscher-handbuch-macintosh-power-macintosh-windows-95-version-von-steven-frank.html">Vorwort zu KPT 3.0 von Kai (S.10ff)</a>  </span> </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»I would love to interact with the image in the way that Levels or Curves does, but the plug-in interface as of today simply will not allow it. What that leads to is simply that the plug-in gets a rectangle and is supposed to do something with the pixels in some other room and then give them back.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the filters in KPT3 like <em>KPT Texture Explorer</em>, <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Convolver</em> use a rectangular area that fits on a 14" monitor. All other elements get blacked out – no menu bar, no Photoshop image window and no desktop. The user experience is really like coming into a room with a special suited environment for one specific task.</p>

			<p>Fig. 2 KPT Texture Explorer 3.0</p>
			<p>KPT Texture Explorer is a modal dialog, that is especially prepared to create textures and nothing else.</p>

			<p>Fig. 3 KPT Spheroid Designer 3.0</p>
			<p>KPT Spheroid Designer is meant to create collections of special looking orbs. Different controls allow the definition of light or to select a special surface structure for the orbs. The KPT users manual notes that Spheroid Designer may seem to resemble glass balls dropped into mud, but actually it’s meant to be glass balls embedded in an “old stale brownie”.

					<a id="kansei" name="kansei"></a></p>
			<p><a name="Fig4 KPT Convolver"></a><img id="convolver" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPTConvolver.jpg" name="convolver"></p>
			<p>Fig. 4 KPT Convolver</p>
			<p><a id="Tog96" name="Tog96"></a><a href="http://asktog.com/">Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini</a> writes about <em>Kansei Engineering</em>:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Since the year A.D. 618 the Japanese have been creating beautiful Zen gardens, environments of harmony designed to instill in their users a sense of serenity and peace. […] Every rock and tree is thoughtfully placed in patterns that are at once random and yet teeming with order. Rocks are not just strewn about; they are carefully arranged in odd-numbered groupings and sunk into the ground to give the illusion of age and stability. Waterfalls are not simply lined with interesting rocks; they are tuned to create just the right burble and plop. […]<br>
					
					Kansei speakes to a totality of experience: colors, sounds, shapes, tactile sensations, and kinesthesia, as well as the personality and consistency of interactions.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 171]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Then Tog comes to software design:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Where does kansei start? Not with the hardware. Not with the software either. Kansei starts with attitude, as does quality. The original <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.6_xeroxstar.html">Xerox Star</a> team had it. So did the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.8_lisa.html">Lisa</a> team, and the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.9_macintosh.html">Mac</a> team after. All were dedicated to building a single, tightly integrated environment – a totality of experience. […]<br>
					KPT Convolver […] is a marvelous example of kansei design. It replaces the extensive lineup of filters that graphic designers traditionally grapple with when using such tools as Photoshop with a simple, integrated, harmonious environment.<br>
					In the past, designers have followed a process of picturing their desired end result in their mind, then applying a series of filters sequentially, without benefit of undo beyond the last-applied filter. Convolver lets users play, trying any combination of filters at will, either on their own or with the computer’s aid and advice. […] Both time and space lie at the user’s complete control.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 174]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the interface ideas evolved from <em>KPT</em> into <em>Bryce</em>. It is a whole environment that covers the complete screen. It overcomes the limitation of a fixed 14" rectangle, because the interface scales itself to the according screen dimensions. The same holds for <em>Poser3</em> and <em>KPT5</em> as they were shipped late in 1998.</p>

			<h4><a id="rooms" name="rooms"></a><a name="Lombreglia97"></a>Rooms</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»The writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike">John Updike</a> is said to have several different writing rooms in his home, each used for a different kind of work -- a fiction room, a poetry room, a room for writing essays and book reviews. All writers want a special room for working (with door, without telephone), but why would any writer -- even such a deservedly successful and prosperous one as John Updike -- need entirely different rooms for different kinds of writing?<br>
					Actually, I know exactly why. Mr. Updike’s arrangement sounded great to me the first time I heard about it. I’m sure working in those rooms is his way of staying inspired, fighting boredom and distraction, getting creative work done by being in a space that’s not only set aside for work but that also somehow provokes that work, probably in quite subtle ways.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refLombreglia97">Lombreglia97</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><a name="Fig6 GOO"></a><img id="goo" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/GOO.jpg" name="goo"></p>
			<p>Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</p>
			<p>The <em>GOO room</em> is a specialized environment for shifting pixels around. But because Kai’s Power GOO is one of the first stand-alone applications from MetaTools some operating systems tasks like opening and closing images need to be accessible within the application. In order not to clutter the room that is special suited to edit the image, other rooms become part of the application. <span><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3005783/software-graphics/an-ode-to-kais-power-goo.html"><span>cf. An ode to Kai’s Power Goo, Macworld 11/2015</span></a></span> E.g. <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> (Fig. 7) initially presents you with a series of seven “rooms” – In, Prep, Tone, Color, Detail, Finishing and Out – which one can enter to perform particular tasks.</p>
			<p><img id="soap-rooms" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/SoapRooms.jpg" name="soap-rooms"></p>
			<p>Fig. 7 Plan-Room in Kai’s Photo Soap</p>
			<h3><a id="Bier93" name="Bier93"></a>Minimize the Interface</h3>
			<p>The concept of Magic Lenses was introduced by [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refBier93">Bier et al. 93</a>]. Two years later Kai designed a tool for KPT3 that can be dragged on top of an image. A circled look-through area shows a preview of the selected filter attributes.</p>
			<p><img id="lens" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPTLens.jpg" name="lens"></p>
			<p>Fig. 8 KPT Lens f/x 3.0 on top of a Photoshop image window</p>
			<p><a name="Kai95-2"></a>Kai himself describes the design concept that lead to the lens tool in KPT3:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»What is called the “lenses” was in alpha known as the Dragon, as in “drag-on-the-image” and its design concept was so simple: make a precision instrument, like a little Swiss Army knife or a watch or microscope (it was also known as the fx Scope…) which has just a few very tiny controls around a center window. In this window a number of effects could be shown exactly as they would appear, over the real image, and updated in realtime.<br>
					It’s a lovely idea to keep all kinds of options hidden inside little wheels and dials that pop out to set and hide themselves during use… I think we have barely begun to use all the possibilities of that. And the actual interaction with the screen image is still a little clunky, hampered by the very illegality of bypassing the plug-in interface altogether.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Soap is the consequent next step into this direction. The tools no longer need to be modal like the KPT lens; they can be used in a very natural modeless manner. Pens, brushes and erasers are distributed all over the workspace. They are large, they cast <strike>real</strike> virtual shadows, and the tips of the tools get pressed down while they are in use.</p>
			<p><img id="soap" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/Soap.jpg" name="soap" height="500" width="776"></p>
			<p>Fig. 9 Kai’s Photo Soap, the Color Room</p>
			<h3>The Desktop</h3>
			<p>The In rooms from <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> are an attempt to deal with a large amount of image files. Large previews – compared to normal icons in Finder – can be distributed on a desktop area. They can be scaled and they can overlap each other. Selections of them can be stored into scrapbooks (Soap) or treated as pile objects (Show). The latter is a proposal to avoid the classical “file in folder in folder in folder” method. The stack of white images to the upper right in Fig. 10 is an example for a pile.</p>

			<h4>Update 2015</h4>
			<p>In retrospect many of Kai's user interface designs make perfect sense as iPad apps. Just imagine <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> or <em>Kai’s Power Goo</em> as an app!</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.benweiss.com/">Ben Weiss</a>, <a href="http://kai.subblue.com/">Kai Krause</a>, together with <a href="http://subblue.com/">Tom Beddard</a> have created <a href="http://app-design-critique.tumblr.com/post/134043897648/frax">frax HD</a> that was launched in October 2013.</p>
			<p><a href="https://mprove.de/script/12/apps/index.html#frax"><img src="https://mprove.de/script/12/apps/_media/frax.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
			<p>Fig. 11: frax HD</p>
			<h2><a name="interfacelanguage" id="interfacelanguage"></a>Kai’s Interface Language</h2>
			<h3>Unfolding functionality</h3>
			<p>Interface widgets become visible on demand. <em>KPT Convolver</em> has three modes: Explore, Design and Tweak. The controls that are not used for a specific mode are dimmed. (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig4Convolver.html">Fig. 4 KPT Convolver</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>A rearrangement of widgets on mode changes is not necessary. The view remains familiar.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Everything is accessible at once, because the mode changes if one clicks onto a faded item.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseOver</h3>
			<p>Tools fade out if they are not in use. If the mouse cursor is moved over these items they wake up. All the tools to the right and below the main view in the Bryce interface are normally invisible (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig5Bryce.html">Fig. 5 Bryce 2</a>). The film strip, the camera and all other elements on the border of the <em>GOO</em> room increase in contrast when the mouse moves over (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig6Goo.html">Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</a>).</p>
			<p>Interface widgets get an explanation when the mouse gets moved over these items. (KPT, Bryce, Poser)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The view gets focused to the task. Distracting items are out of sight.</p>
				<p>The Cockpit problem gets solved, because one can handle the numerous controls in larger chunks.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Better spatial arrangement of widgets, because the label is omitted. (Bryce’ toolbar)</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseDragging instead of Value-Slider</h3>
			<p>Classical sliders and scrollbars use a thumb, that can be dragged to a specific value. <em>KPT3</em> or <em>KPT Convolver</em> use simple orbs that serve as origin of a mouse drag action. (e.g. Hue, Saturation, etc. in <a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig2Texture.html">Fig. 2 KPT Texture Explorer 3.0</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>An orb and a referring label is less space consuming than a value slider.</p>
				<p>Kai’s sliders provide real time feedback for the edited object, because the control does not display any feedback by itself.</p>
				<p>The value space can be 2-dimensional, because the x- and y-direction can have a different meaning</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>It is very difficult to enter exact numerical values.</p>
				<p>The control displays no feedback about the selected value.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Memory Dots / Five Favorites</h3>
			<p><em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em>, <em>KPT Convolver</em> and <em>KPT5</em> use 3x3 fields of memory dots. These dots can store different settings of other interface widgets. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> usefive dots for the same task.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The user can customize tools, store control values and can flip between different interface arrangements.</p>
				<p>The access time is very short.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Memory Dots provide no visual feedback. One has to activate the dot to recognize its content. An icon or MouseOver-Preview might be helpful. The film strip at <em>GOO</em> provides such feedback already.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Transparency &amp; Shadows (KPT Lens f/x, Poser)</h3>
			<p><span>Note, this is years before Mac OS X Aqua. </span>Nearly every item in Kai’s interfaces drops a smooth shadow. This is part of the kansei attitude of building harmonic environments.</p>
			<p>Modal dialog windows from <em>GOO</em>, the menus from <em>Show</em> and the information palette from <em>Soap</em> are translucent.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The object underneath the pane remains visible.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Full Screen Mode, Rooms Metaphor</h3>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Design in every respect – Kansei Design</p>
				<p>Special suited environments for special tasks support that task perfectly.</p>
				<p>No window clutter</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Only one room at a time can be active.</p>
				<p>There is hardly any interaction with other programs. They are not visible; therefore drag and drop is not possible. One is no longer aware of other “rooms” on the machine.</p>

			<h3>Workspace – Desktop</h3>
			<p><em>GOO</em> has only a gallery in a grid for images. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig10Show.html">Fig. 10 The Sort-Room of Kai’s Power SHOW</a>) use a more drawn out version of a desktop to display collections of media files.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Better implementation of a real life desktop.</p>
				<p>Previews are very useful to recognize imagefiles.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Very limited for hierarchical structures</p>
				<p>Arrangements cannot be stored for later use.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MetaWindow</h3>
			<p>Windows without classical borders and handles (Poser3)</p>
			<p>Drawers, that reveal assets or functionalities on demand (Soap, Poser3)</p>
			<p>Scrapbooks, that store objects (Soap)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>This is an obvious way to get a hierarchical level into the interface.</p>
				<p>Things, that are not needed every time, are only two clicks away.</p>

<p><em>This story was published in partnership with </em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/usps-texas-postal-service/">The Nation</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Under the formidable sun, Dallas USPS mail carrier Anthony Talarico trudged each day with his satchel, 11 miles over 12 hours, to deliver mail to 750 homes in the Lakewood neighborhood. On September 7, the temperature had hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit. But even after a long shift, Talarico, along with 20 other mail carriers who serve as union stewards of different Dallas-area post offices, came to the local National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) union hall. In the bright, bare space, adorned with only a few photos and a sign that read “Ring of Honor- Lone Star Branch 132,” the attendees scarfed down pizza and drank Coke and NOS energy drinks to keep alert. Another 26 people joined on Zoom as branch president Kimetra Lewis explained how to document and file grievances, of which there were plenty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What we’re dealing with this week is very similar to that day when Gino passed away. It was hot. It was a struggle. We’re now dealing with things with this heat we’ve never dealt with before,” Talarico said. </p>
<p>It’s been three months since Talarico’s coworker, Eugene Gates, died suddenly on a homeowner’s front lawn along his delivery route on June 20 as the temperature reached 98 degrees. Doctors recorded his body temperature at 104.6 at the time he died. The <em>Observer</em> is the first to report that the Dallas County Medical Examiner recently confirmed hyperthermia and artheroslerotic cardiovascular disease, or a thickening of the artery walls, to be the causes of death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Gates’ death, the Texas summer only got hotter, bringing a higher risk of heat-related illnesses. Dallas-area mail carriers worked through a total of 54 days of triple-digit temperatures in the summer of 2023, as high as 110 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Elsewhere it’s been even hotter: 74 days of over 100-degree weather in San Antonio and Austin and 45 days in Houston.</p>
<p>Through interviews and union surveys completed in writing by individual Dallas mail carriers and obtained by the <em>Texas Observer</em>, we found that in the months following Gates’ death, USPS seems to have gone back to business as usual. Mail carriers report that management is still pressuring them to speed up, work overtime hours, and forego breaks. USPS continues to violate the standards of its own Heat Illness Prevention Program (HIPP)—some mail carriers say they have not yet completed training for this program, which would violate the standards of the USPS own HIPP. What’s more, the agency is alleged to have covered this up by doctoring records to show that HIPP training was completed.</p>
<p>USPS’ <a href="https://www.nalc.org/workplace-issues/safety-and-health/body/PS-FY-22-HIPP.pdf">HIPP</a>&nbsp; program is triggered to go into effect from April 1 to October 31 as well as anytime the heat index—the temperature adjusted for humidity—tops 80 degrees. In Dallas, these days started early this year, in late February. Under HIPP, USPS management must give weekly safety talks, post signs, and send weather advisories to carriers’ scanners with reminders on how to protect against heat exposure with rest breaks and cold water. By April 1 each year, all post offices must also allot work time for mail carriers to complete a required heat illness prevention training online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Talarico, the day after Gates’ death, Dallas Postmaster Daniel Reyes arrived at the Lakewood office and told Gates’ coworkers that a heart attack had killed him. Gates was generally healthy and had never been hospitalized, his wife Carla said. Reyes’ remarks, Talarico said, infuriated carriers, who accused USPS of killing Gates by pressing them to complete deliveries faster without breaks or regard for their health under the threat of punishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until after Gates’ death made national news in late June that many post offices rushed to give the safety talks or trainings that should have been completed in April or to post signs or hand out cards outlining the signs of heat illnesses, according to dozens of mail carriers who completed union surveys or who spoke to the <em>Observer</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the surveys obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, which were distributed by NALC’s Dallas branch after Gates died, four out of 19 mail carriers at one post office responded “no” when asked, “Are you familiar with the HIPP?” Only one stated he had received HIPP training. At another post office, all 14 mail carriers who responded to the survey stated they had still not received HIPP training as of August 11. </p>
<p>During the September union meeting I attended, 46 stewards raised their hands when asked if they had not completed the HIPP course by April 1. And yet, all 46 raised their hands to indicate that their training records had been marked as complete in their online employee portal called Liteblue. According to the Dallas NALC’s branch president Kimetra Lewis, Gates had never received the training, but his records show that his training was complete on a date that Lewis verified he was not at work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Gates’ death, mail carriers and union representatives say USPS management still persists with practices that are contributing to heat illnesses and other injuries—forcing mail carriers to work overtime and take on more routes, pressuring them to deliver mail faster and forego breaks, rejecting sick leave requests or disciplining them for taking sick leave, and walking back changes the agency made after Gates’ death to start work earlier to avoid longer hours in the extreme heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sixty-five percent of USPS vehicles nationwide still have no air-conditioning—just a four-by-four-inch box fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked to respond to mail carriers who say USPS failed to follow HIPP standard, USPS Communications Specialist Becky Hernandez said, “Each Area/Region Vice President has a designated coordinator assigned to monitoring compliance with the program.” Hernandez did not directly respond to the <em>Observers’ </em>request to reply to allegations that training records were falsified. “Every employee receives formal training on recognizing and preventing heat related illness,” Hernandez wrote in an email to the <em>Observer</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the union meeting, Talarico sat across the table from me with his hands in his lap. His ruffled, sandy hair and metal-rimmed glasses framed his sun-worn face. His light blue postal uniform had faded and frayed into tiny holes in the side pocket. The 25-year veteran mail carrier tells me that his body, at 55, is “starting to break.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>His eyes began to well with tears when he told me how grateful he was for residents who are now leaving bottles of cold water on the front porch for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re at a breaking point,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p>On June 20, Eugene Gates didn’t kiss his wife Carla goodbye. He didn’t want to wake her up too early since it was her first day back to work after her mom had passed. But, like clockwork, ingrained from eight years in the military and a life of labor, Gates woke up at 3:30 a.m., ate breakfast, packed 10 bottles of cold water in a cooler full of ice, and arrived at the Lakewood post office an hour before his shift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gates, as always, texted his wife when he got there: “Morning sweetheart, love you have a wonderful day.” A little later, Carla replied, “Good morning baby, love you.” Gates warned her it would be hot that day and reminded her to stay safe if she went outdoors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Juneteenth holiday, mail had piled up. Carriers at the Lakewood post office had four times the amount of mail than typical to deliver, Talarico said. By lunchtime, the heat index had already risen to 105 degrees. Talarico’s skin had broken into a heat rash. Another coworker was vomiting. According to Talarico, others called him to complain about working nonstop in the heat while management had been pushing them to speed up. That month, three carriers had already been disciplined for “stationary events”—what USPS management deems as idling for more than five minutes—Talarico said. A month earlier, Talarico said that Gates had received a letter of warning after returning to the post office to pick up more mail to deliver; on a previous occasion, supervisors had called Talarico to question why he was idling when he was eating lunch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We were all struggling, and they were pushing us so hard to not stop,” Talarico said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carla didn’t think much of it when she didn’t hear from Gates at lunchtime as usual. He sometimes skipped lunch so he could finish his route on time. Gates was so punctual that one resident, an autistic child, would wait for him on the front porch at the same time every day. Gates’ customers told Talaricio, “You could set your clock by Gino.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But around 3:35 p.m., Gates had collapsed in front of a home in the Caruth Terrace neighborhood in northeast Dallas. The homeowner performed CPR. According to city records, the fire department arrived five minutes later and brought Gates to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. According to medical records, his body temperature was 104.6 when he reached the hospital. The hospital called Carla at 4:45 p.m. As she rushed to the hospital, she received a second call, this time from the chaplain who said she would talk to Carla when she arrived. That was when Carla knew Gates had already died before she got a chance to say goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until nearly a week later, when Gate’s story made national news, that someone from USPS finally returned Carla’s calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They did not reach out to me. They did not send a card. They did not send flowers. The postal service did not send anything. Any support I received was from the union, his coworkers, and residents around the country,” Carla said. “That’s how they treat someone after 36 years of service.”&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>Gates is the seventh documented USPS mail carrier to die from heat-related illness since 2012 while on the job, according to the <em>Observer’s</em> analysis of federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) records. The number of deaths may be higher since neither medical records nor OSHA always cite whether heat stress might induce other illnesses. Since OSHA first cited USPS for exposing Independence, Missouri mail carrier John Watzlawick to heat hazards on July 24, 2012, USPS has been slow to make changes to protect workers.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>July 24, 2012, Independence, MO:</strong> John Watzlawick died delivering mail when the temperature hit 102 degrees.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>July 6, 2013, Medford, MA:</strong> James Baldassarre died from a heat stroke. The temperature was 94 degrees; the heat index was 117.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>July 11, 2017, Charleston, WV:</strong> Ronnie Bowles died after experiencing heart problems induced by heat stress. The heat index was 88.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>July 6, 2018, Woodland Hills, CA:</strong> Peggy Frank died in a non-air-conditioned mail truck. The temperature hit a record-setting high of 115.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>July 22, 2020, Washington, D.C.: </strong>A mail carrier died in a non-air-conditioned vehicle. The high temperature was 94 degrees, and the heat index was 104.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>June 17, 2021, San Jose, CA:</strong> Dalvir Bassi died from a heat stroke. The temperature was 94 degrees.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>June 20, 2023, Dallas, TX:</strong> Eugene Gates died when the temperature hit 98 degrees with a heat index of 116.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>After Watzlawick’s death, USPS agreed to a limited heat-illness prevention program that would only include Independence, Missouri. The program wasn’t instituted nationally until May 2018. By then, 62 more USPS carriers around the country had been hospitalized for severe heat-related illnesses, according to the <em>Observer’s </em>analysis of OSHA records. At least two others had died.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020, mail carriers were dealt a blow after USPS won an administrative law judge decision that overturned an OSHA penalty of $511,000 for five heat-related injuries. Without a specific OSHA standard for heat safety, judges decided that the mail carriers’ unprotected exposure to extreme heat did not qualify as a “hazard likely to cause death or serious physical harm” under OSHA’s general duty clause, which requires employers to provide general protections for a safe workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, according to OSHA records, from 2015 to 2022, heat-related injuries accounted for 173 of 1,200 severe injuries—16 percent—among USPS carriers that required hospitalization. This does not include the heat illnesses experienced by mail carriers during the extreme heat this summer. According to the data, Texas mail carriers experienced the most hospitalizations from work-related heat illnesses. The state had 28 recorded incidents, compared to 10 in Nevada, which came second.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Notably, even though USPS is not the largest employer in the United States.—it employs roughly half the workers at Walmart, Amazon, or McDonald's—its workers reported the highest number of severe workplace injuries overall, 1,200 over that same time period.&nbsp;</p>


<p>After years of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/heat-protections-workers-big-business-lobbies">resistance by business lobbyists</a>, OSHA finally began developing a heat safety standard two years ago. Progress has been slow, but protests by workers, unions, organizations, and elected officials—like Texas Congressmember Greg Casar, who staged a <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-workers-congress-thirst-strike/">thirst strike</a> this past summer—have recently spurred the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-heat/">Biden administration</a> to ramp up enforcement of heat-related workplace protections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Observer </em>found that USPS, on the other hand, continues to resist these efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early July, U.S. Representative for the Dallas area Jasmine Crockett, Representative Jamie Raskin, Representative Greg Casar and 12 others initiated a <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2023-07-07.Raskin%20Crockett%20et%20al.%20to%20DeJoy-USPS%20re%20Worker%20Safety%20Extreme%20Heat.pdf">congressional inquiry</a> into USPS’s measures to protect its workforce from extreme heat. Casar, with other local representatives, also sent a separate <a href="https://casar.house.gov/media/press-releases/news-casar-castro-cuellar-gonzales-urge-usps-bring-back-water-san-antonio">letter</a> to USPS Postmaster General Louis DeJoy calling on the agency to allow mail carriers to be able to return to their post office or deviate from their route to obtain cold water, without receiving disciplinary action. According to communication the <em>Observer</em> reviewed between Casar and USPS District Manager Tom Billington, USPS refused to agree to the request, and wrote instead, “If they can’t find water [along their route], they should contact their supervisor for assistance and to discuss alternative solutions for hydration. This past summer, San Antonio branches stopped providing cold water to mail carriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The way that USPS has treated San Antonio letter carriers during this summer’s heat wave is inexcusable,”&nbsp;said Casar. “They have been misleading to members of Congress, gone back on their word, and created a dangerous working environment."</p>
<p>In responses to both the congressional inquiry and to Casar, USPS government relations representative Ashley Motta sent a letter touting HIPP’s provisions, which mail carriers say USPS is flouting.&nbsp;</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
“We found out that they were falsifying all our documents.” </p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>“It's apparent that there is a significant number of locations that did not complete the training and there's also a sizable number of discrepancies in terms of what USPS’ records show. It shows that the training was completed, but it wasn't and that's something we're in the process of correcting,” said NALC President Brian Renfroe, who added that the union is also calling on USPS to update HIPP to include heat acclimatization measures.</p>
<p>"I was on vacation, and when I was looking at my records on Liteblue (the online portal for postal employees), it showed I did some additional training on my day off, but that never happened, and on Sunday, which also never happened,” one union survey respondent said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another wrote that her training was marked complete when "I just came out of the hospital and was on bed rest for 11 weeks."</p>
<p>One other mail carrier wrote her training was marked complete when "I was out recovering from a heart procedure because I received a LOW [letter of warning] for attendance because of my absence.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homer Hernandez, a USPS mail carrier of 20 years and legislative chair of the San Antonio branch, said many mail carriers in San Antonio also reported their records were falsified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We found out that they were falsifying all our documents by stating we took all the safety training classes they're supposed to be providing us when it never happened,” Hernandez said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gates never took the HIPP training this year. He had been absent on January 25, when it was administered at the Lakewood post office. But, like others, his training record was also marked as complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For USPS, “nothing comes above the numbers,” wrote one mail carrier.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, USPS <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/john-pletz-technology/zebra-lands-570-million-postal-service-contract">paid</a> the Zebra Technologies Corporation $570 million to provide 300,000 of its TC77 model as their new Mobile Delivery Device, scanners that allow for “real time tracking” of packages and carriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company boasted, “The ultra-rugged TC77 features Zebra’s Mobility DNA suite of software tools that increase worker productivity, simplify management and strengthen the security of Zebra’s Android-based, enterprise-class computers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The devices are connected to USPS’ Regional Intelligent Mail Server, or RIMS, which allows management to track a carrier’s progress on their delivery route at all times. At the start of a day, carriers discuss with management how long a given route will take. Typically, they cannot deviate from that route. If a carrier is stationary after a few minutes, a red blinking sign on the RIMS system will alert management that the carrier is “idle.” If mail carriers take longer than the estimated time, they may be disciplined for “unauthorized overtime.” If they “idle,” they may be disciplined for “stationary events,” although Renfroe says this often violates the workers’ contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Determining each carrier’s progress early in the afternoon will allow the supervisor to know which carriers are behind schedule and take appropriate action,” the USPS’ Office of Inspector General <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-01/CP-AR-17-008.pdf">wrote</a> of the Mobile Delivery Device system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Texas’ NALC leaders from Dallas, San Antonio, and Killen say that before Gates died, carriers were routinely disciplined for “stationary events” when they sought breaks from the heat. Even though the <a href="https://www.nalc.org/workplace-issues/safety-and-health/body/USPS4576-USPS-HIPP-2020-04-11-Course-Transcript.pdf">online HIPP training course</a> tells carriers to “slow down the pace” or “shorten the duration by taking frequent breaks as needed,” USPS management regularly sent carriers warnings on their scanners saying “keep moving” or “hurry up to beat the heat.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If a carrier is found to be idle, not moving for about 10 minutes, then management wants to know why. They feel like it's excessive. We, on the other hand, as the union is concerned, have told them to take as many conferences [breaks] to make sure that their health is protected. But the Postal Service frowns upon that,” NALC’s Dallas-branch 132 president Lewis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a verbal warning, USPS management will escalate disciplinary measures to a warning letter, a seven-day suspension, a 14-day suspension, and then removal. The system discourages carriers from taking breaks, even when their bodies need to cool down. The timing is critical. Without immediate attention and rest, extended exposure to heat can result in nausea, dizziness, and fainting, which when left untreated can lead to a breakdown of the kidneys and other organs, and then death. According to union grievance records, mail carriers were also disciplined for taking leave when they did get sick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Gates died, management started sending warning messages to mail carriers’ personal phones instead of scanners. Killeen’s NALC Branch 4217 President John Darden said carriers received text messages, such as, “What’s taking you so long?,” “You should’ve been done by now,” and “Why are you still there?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Darden said there have been nine heat illnesses among Killeen mail carriers since Gates died. Heat stress induced one carrier’s heart attack. Another mail carrier’s kidney failed from heat exhaustion after he had received a transplant a year prior. He’s been out sick for a month now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with all the illnesses, USPS moved the start times for the Killeen mail carriers back to 8:30 a.m. September 9, when temperatures topped 104 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They just don’t care,” Darden said.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>Dallas-area mail carrier Charlie loved the Texas heat. He loved the outdoors and hated being cooped up in an office. That’s why at the age of 31, after running a printing press for a few years, Charlie decided to deliver mail for the postal service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Growing up, I was always playing outdoors. It was like the hotter, the better. And I wanted to get out and meet new people,” said Charlie, who requested we use only his first name or fear of retaliation from USPS management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after collapsing, losing consciousness and being hospitalized three times from heat strokes, Charlie now starts to get nauseous even from the sun’s glare inside a car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the first heat stroke five years ago, Charlie noticed he couldn’t be outdoors as long. The second time, a year later, Charlie made it through his route, but then collapsed before he and his son found their seats at a Rangers ballgame later that day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, on his delivery route July 31 at around 4:30 p.m., he noticed the first signs of an oncoming heat injury. His hands cramped. He gasped for breath. It was 103 degrees. Charlie called his supervisor who told him to rest a little before continuing. He then worked for another 15 minutes before he realized he couldn’t go on. He called his supervisor again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I told him I didn't think I could finish. So then he asked me if I could just get rid of the packages,” Charlie said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlie sat for another 20 minutes. Another carrier arrived to take some of his mail. “He’s not looking good,” the other carrier told the supervisor on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Charlie got up and completed his deliveries on another street, then went on to another before he collapsed. His kidneys had failed. It took him days after he was hospitalized to be able to go to the bathroom again.</p>
<p>“My managers pressure us because they tell us they’re being pressured from above. They’ll send out messages on people’s scanners saying everyone must come back by a certain time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressure has been building up for the past three years, when Charlie and his coworkers have been forced to take on more routes and work overtime due to a labor shortage. U.S. Postmaster General Louis Dejoy <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2022/07/usps-may-need-50k-fewer-employees-under-break-even-plan-dejoy-says/?readmore=1">said</a> last summer that the USPS needed to shed 50,000 employees, as the agency looks to consolidate post offices into larger distribution centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlie spoke to the <em>Observer</em> over the phone in short, breathy gasps, a belabored voice. After more than a month since his last accident, he says his head still pounds and swirls. He staggers now when he walks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This time, it hit me much harder than the previous ones. I feel like my balance is just not there. I’m off,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 53, he’s young for a grandfather. But he said he can no longer go outside to play with his grandkids to push them on the swings or help them set up their wading pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m scared after all this, that I won’t even be able to do my job anymore.”&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><article lang="en-US"><header></header><div><p>Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals.</p>
<p>To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.</p></div><section aria-labelledby="overview"><h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2><div><p>Fast sites provide better user experiences. Users want and expect web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with.</p>
<p>Two major issues in web performance are issues having to do with latency and issues having to do with the fact that for the most part, browsers are single-threaded.</p>
<p>Latency is the biggest threat to our ability to ensure a fast-loading page. It is the developers' goal to make the site load as fast as possible — or at least <em>appear</em> to load super fast — so the user gets the requested information as quickly as possible. Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over the air to computers. Web performance is what we have to do to make the page load as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For the most part, browsers are considered single-threaded. That is, they execute a task from beginning to end before taking up another task. For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, ensuring the main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate, to ensure rendering is smooth and responses to interactions are immediate.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="navigation"><h2 id="navigation"><a href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h2><div><p><em>Navigation</em> is the first step in loading a web page. It occurs whenever a user requests a page by entering a URL into the address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, as well as other actions.</p>
<p>One of the goals of web performance is to minimize the amount of time navigation takes to complete. In ideal conditions, this usually doesn't take too long, but latency and bandwidth are foes that can cause delays.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="dns_lookup"><h3 id="dns_lookup"><a href="#dns_lookup">DNS lookup</a></h3><div><p>The first step of navigating to a web page is finding where the assets for that page are located. If you navigate to <code>https://example.com</code>, the HTML page is located on the server with IP address of <code>93.184.216.34</code>. If you've never visited this site, a DNS lookup must happen.</p>
<p>Your browser requests a DNS lookup, which is eventually fielded by a name server, which in turn responds with an IP address. After this initial request, the IP will likely be cached for a time, which speeds up subsequent requests by retrieving the IP address from the cache instead of contacting a name server again.</p>
<p>DNS lookups usually only need to be done once per hostname for a page load. However, DNS lookups must be done for each unique hostname the requested page references. If your fonts, images, scripts, ads, and metrics all have different hostnames, a DNS lookup will have to be made for each one.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/latency.jpg" alt="Mobile requests go first to the cell tower, then to a central phone company computer before being sent to the internet" width="792" height="281" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>This can be problematic for performance, particularly on mobile networks. When a user is on a mobile network, each DNS lookup has to go from the phone to the cell tower to reach an authoritative DNS server. The distance between a phone, a cell tower, and the name server can add significant latency.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tcp_handshake"><h3 id="tcp_handshake"><a href="#tcp_handshake">TCP handshake</a></h3><div><p>Once the IP address is known, the browser sets up a connection to the server via a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake">TCP three-way handshake</a>. This mechanism is designed so that two entities attempting to communicate — in this case the browser and web server — can negotiate the parameters of the network TCP socket connection before transmitting data, often over <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>TCP's three-way handshaking technique is often referred to as "SYN-SYN-ACK" — or more accurately SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK — because there are three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session between two computers. Yes, this means three more messages back and forth between each server, and the request has yet to be made.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tls_negotiation"><h3 id="tls_negotiation"><a href="#tls_negotiation">TLS negotiation</a></h3><div><p>For secure connections established over HTTPS, another "handshake" is required. This handshake, or rather the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS">TLS</a> negotiation, determines which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication, verifies the server, and establishes that a secure connection is in place before beginning the actual transfer of data. This requires five more round trips to the server before the request for content is actually sent.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/ssl.jpg" alt="The DNS lookup, the TCP handshake, and 5 steps of the TLS handshake including clienthello, serverhello and certificate, clientkey and finished for both server and client." width="729" height="412" loading="lazy">

<p>This response for this initial request contains the first byte of data received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte">Time to First Byte</a> (TTFB) is the time between when the user made the request — say by clicking on a link — and the receipt of this first packet of HTML. The first chunk of content is usually 14KB of data.</p>
<p>In our example above, the request is definitely less than 14KB, but the linked resources aren't requested until the browser encounters the links during parsing, described below.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><h3 id="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><a href="#congestion_control_tcp_slow_start">Congestion control / TCP slow start</a></h3><div><p>TCP packets are split into segments during transmission. Because TCP guarantees the sequence of packets, the server must receive an acknowledgment from the client in the form of an ACK packet after sending a certain number of segments.</p>
<p>If the server waits for an ACK after each segment, that will result in frequent ACKs from the client and may increase transmission time, even in the case of a low-load network.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sending too many segments at once can lead to the problem that in a busy network the client will not be able to receive the segments and will just keep responding with ACKs for a long time, and the server will have to keep re-sending the segments.</p>
<p>In order to balance the number of transmitted segments, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_slow_start">TCP slow start</a> algorithm is used to gradually increase the amount of transmitted data until the maximum network bandwidth can be determined, and to reduce the amount of transmitted data in case of high network load.</p>
<p>The number of segments to be transmitted is controlled by the value of the congestion window (CWND), which can be initialized to 1, 2, 4, or 10 MSS (MSS is 1500 bytes over the Ethernet protocol). That value is the number of bytes to send, upon receipt of which the client must send an ACK.</p>
<p>If an ACK is received, then the CWND value will be doubled, and so the server will be able to send more segments the next time. If instead no ACK is received, then the CWND value will be halved. That mechanism thus achieves a balance between sending too many segments, and sending too few.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="parsing"><h2 id="parsing"><a href="#parsing">Parsing</a></h2><div><p>Once the browser receives the first chunk of data, it can begin parsing the information received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parse">Parsing</a> is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM">DOM</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM">CSSOM</a>, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.</p>
<p>The DOM is the internal representation of the markup for the browser. The DOM is also exposed and can be manipulated through various APIs in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Even if the requested page's HTML is larger than the initial 14KB packet, the browser will begin parsing and attempting to render an experience based on the data it has. This is why it's important for web performance optimization to include everything the browser needs to start rendering a page, or at least a template of the page — the CSS and HTML needed for the first render — in the first 14KB. But before anything is rendered to the screen, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have to be parsed.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_dom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_dom_tree"><a href="#building_the_dom_tree">Building the DOM tree</a></h3><div><p>We describe five steps in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path">critical rendering path</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is processing the HTML markup and building the DOM tree. HTML parsing involves <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList">tokenization</a> and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.</p>
<p>The DOM tree describes the content of the document. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element is the first element and root node of the document tree. The tree reflects the relationships and hierarchies between different elements. Elements nested within other elements are child nodes. The greater the number of DOM nodes, the longer it takes to construct the DOM tree.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/dom.gif" alt="The DOM tree for our sample code, showing all the nodes, including text nodes." width="754" height="689" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>When the parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements — particularly those without an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><code>async</code></a> or <code>defer</code> attribute — block rendering, and pause the parsing of HTML. Though the browser's preload scanner hastens this process, excessive scripts can still be a significant bottleneck.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="preload_scanner"><h3 id="preload_scanner"><a href="#preload_scanner">Preload scanner</a></h3><div><p>While the browser builds the DOM tree, this process occupies the main thread. As this happens, the <em>preload scanner</em> will parse through the content available and request high-priority resources like CSS, JavaScript, and web fonts. Thanks to the preload scanner, we don't have to wait until the parser finds a reference to an external resource to request it. It will retrieve resources in the background so that by the time the main HTML parser reaches the requested assets, they may already be in flight or have been downloaded. The optimizations the preload scanner provides reduce blockages.</p>
<div><pre data-signature="7i2pOGLEWk9zRizsF65+Y7TiIADbAa3ECiZF6ZUCWpA="><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>stylesheet<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>styles.css<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myscript.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myimage.jpg<span>"</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image description<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>anotherscript.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, while the main thread is parsing the HTML and CSS, the preload scanner will find the scripts and image, and start downloading them as well. To ensure the script doesn't block the process, add the <code>async</code> attribute, or the <code>defer</code> attribute if JavaScript parsing and execution order is important.</p>
<p>Waiting to obtain CSS doesn't block HTML parsing or downloading, but it does block JavaScript because JavaScript is often used to query CSS properties' impact on elements.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_cssom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_cssom_tree"><a href="#building_the_cssom_tree">Building the CSSOM tree</a></h3><div><p>The second step in the critical rendering path is processing CSS and building the CSSOM tree. The CSS object model is similar to the DOM. The DOM and CSSOM are both trees. They are independent data structures. The browser converts the CSS rules into a map of styles it can understand and work with. The browser goes through each rule set in the CSS, creating a tree of nodes with parent, child, and sibling relationships based on the CSS selectors.</p>
<p>As with HTML, the browser needs to convert the received CSS rules into something it can work with. Hence, it repeats the HTML-to-object process, but for the CSS.</p>
<p>The CSSOM tree includes styles from the user agent style sheet. The browser begins with the most general rule applicable to a node and recursively refines the computed styles by applying more specific rules. In other words, it cascades the property values.</p>
<p>Building the CSSOM is very, very fast and is not displayed in a unique color in current developer tools. Rather, the "Recalculate Style" in developer tools shows the total time it takes to parse CSS, construct the CSSOM tree, and recursively calculate computed styles. In terms of web performance optimization, there are lower hanging fruit, as the total time to create the CSSOM is generally less than the time it takes for one DNS lookup.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="other_processes"><h3 id="other_processes"><a href="#other_processes">Other processes</a></h3><div><h4 id="javascript_compilation">JavaScript compilation</h4>
<p>While the CSS is being parsed and the CSSOM created, other assets, including JavaScript files, are downloading (thanks to the preload scanner). JavaScript is parsed, compiled, and interpreted. The scripts are parsed into abstract syntax trees. Some browser engines take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree" target="_blank">abstract syntax trees</a> and pass them into a compiler, outputting bytecode. This is known as JavaScript compilation. Most of the code is interpreted on the main thread, but there are exceptions such as code run in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="building_the_accessibility_tree">Building the accessibility tree</h4>
<p>The browser also builds an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">accessibility</a> tree that assistive devices use to parse and interpret content. The accessibility object model (AOM) is like a semantic version of the DOM. The browser updates the accessibility tree when the DOM is updated. The accessibility tree is not modifiable by assistive technologies themselves.</p>
<p>Until the AOM is built, the content is not accessible to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Screen_Reader_Implementors_Guide">screen readers</a>.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="render"><h2 id="render"><a href="#render">Render</a></h2><p>Rendering steps include style, layout, paint, and in some cases compositing. The CSSOM and DOM trees created in the parsing step are combined into a render tree which is then used to compute the layout of every visible element, which is then painted to the screen. In some cases, content can be promoted to its own layer and composited, improving performance by painting portions of the screen on the GPU instead of the CPU, freeing up the main thread.</p></section><section aria-labelledby="style"><h3 id="style"><a href="#style">Style</a></h3><div><p>The third step in the critical rendering path is combining the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree. The computed style tree, or render tree, construction starts with the root of the DOM tree, traversing each visible node.</p>
<p>Elements that aren't going to be displayed, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a> element and its children and any nodes with <code>display: none</code>, such as the <code>script { display: none; }</code> you will find in user agent stylesheets, are not included in the render tree as they will not appear in the rendered output. Nodes with <code>visibility: hidden</code> applied are included in the render tree, as they do take up space. As we have not given any directives to override the user agent default, the <code>script</code> node in our code example above will not be included in the render tree.</p>
<p>Each visible node has its CSSOM rules applied to it. The render tree holds all the visible nodes with content and computed styles — matching up all the relevant styles to every visible node in the DOM tree, and determining, based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade">CSS cascade</a>, what the computed styles are for each node.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="layout"><h3 id="layout"><a href="#layout">Layout</a></h3><div><p>The fourth step in the critical rendering path is running layout on the render tree to compute the geometry of each node. <em>Layout</em> is the process by which the dimensions and location of all the nodes in the render tree are determined, plus the determination of the size and position of each object on the page. <em>Reflow</em> is any subsequent size and position determination of any part of the page or the entire document.</p>
<p>Once the render tree is built, layout commences. The render tree identified which nodes are displayed (even if invisible) along with their computed styles, but not the dimensions or location of each node. To determine the exact size and position of each object, the browser starts at the root of the render tree and traverses it.</p>
<p>On the web page, almost everything is a box. Different devices and different desktop preferences mean an unlimited number of differing viewport sizes. In this phase, taking the viewport size into consideration, the browser determines what the sizes of all the different boxes are going to be on the screen. Taking the size of the viewport as its base, layout generally starts with the body, laying out the sizes of all the body's descendants, with each element's box model properties, providing placeholder space for replaced elements it doesn't know the dimensions of, such as our image.</p>
<p>The first time the size and position of each node is determined is called <em>layout</em>. Subsequent recalculations of are called <em>reflows</em>. In our example, suppose the initial layout occurs before the image is returned. Since we didn't declare the dimensions of our image, there will be a reflow once the image dimensions are known.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="paint"><h3 id="paint"><a href="#paint">Paint</a></h3><div><p>The last step in the critical rendering path is painting the individual nodes to the screen, the first occurrence of which is called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_meaningful_paint">first meaningful paint</a>. In the painting or rasterization phase, the browser converts each box calculated in the layout phase to actual pixels on the screen. Painting involves drawing every visual part of an element to the screen, including text, colors, borders, shadows, and replaced elements like buttons and images. The browser needs to do this super quickly.</p>
<p>To ensure smooth scrolling and animation, everything occupying the main thread, including calculating styles, along with reflow and paint, must take the browser less than 16.67ms to accomplish. At 2048 x 1536, the iPad has over 3,145,000 pixels to be painted to the screen. That is a lot of pixels that have to be painted very quickly. To ensure repainting can be done even faster than the initial paint, the drawing to the screen is generally broken down into several layers. If this occurs, then compositing is necessary.</p>
<p>Painting can break the elements in the layout tree into layers. Promoting content into layers on the GPU (instead of the main thread on the CPU) improves paint and repaint performance. There are specific properties and elements that instantiate a layer, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a>, and any element which has the CSS properties of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity"><code>opacity</code></a>, a 3D <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform"><code>transform</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change"><code>will-change</code></a>, and a few others. These nodes will be painted onto their own layer, along with their descendants, unless a descendant necessitates its own layer for one (or more) of the above reasons.</p>
<p>Layers do improve performance but are expensive when it comes to memory management, so should not be overused as part of web performance optimization strategies.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="compositing"><h3 id="compositing"><a href="#compositing">Compositing</a></h3><div><p>When sections of the document are drawn in different layers, overlapping each other, compositing is necessary to ensure they are drawn to the screen in the right order and the content is rendered correctly.</p>
<p>As the page continues to load assets, reflows can happen (recall our example image that arrived late). A reflow sparks a repaint and a re-composite. Had we defined the dimensions of our image, no reflow would have been necessary, and only the layer that needed to be repainted would be repainted, and composited if necessary. But we didn't include the image dimensions! When the image is obtained from the server, the rendering process goes back to the layout steps and restarts from there.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="interactivity"><h2 id="interactivity"><a href="#interactivity">Interactivity</a></h2><div><p>Once the main thread is done painting the page, you would think we would be "all set." That isn't necessarily the case. If the load includes JavaScript, that was correctly deferred, and only executed after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event"><code>onload</code></a> event fires, the main thread might be busy, and not available for scrolling, touch, and other interactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive">Time to Interactive</a> (TTI) is the measurement of how long it took from that first request which led to the DNS lookup and TCP connection to when the page is interactive — interactive being the point in time after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint">First Contentful Paint</a> when the page responds to user interactions within 50ms. If the main thread is occupied parsing, compiling, and executing JavaScript, it is not available and therefore not able to respond to user interactions in a timely (less than 50ms) fashion.</p>
<p>In our example, maybe the image loaded quickly, but perhaps the <code>anotherscript.js</code> file was 2MB and our user's network connection was slow. In this case, the user would see the page super quickly, but wouldn't be able to scroll without jank until the script was downloaded, parsed, and executed. That is not a good user experience. Avoid occupying the main thread, as demonstrated in this WebPageTest example:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/visa_network.png" alt="The main thread is occupied by the downloading, parsing and execution of a JavaScript file - over a fast connection" width="1200" height="699" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>In this example, JavaScript execution took over 1.5 seconds, and the main thread was fully occupied that entire time, unresponsive to click events or screen taps.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="see_also"><h2 id="see_also"><a href="#see_also">See also</a></h2></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

As a rule, "sophisticated" progrmming is pretty boring - optimizing
the unnecessary to speed up the
uninteresting. Here, however, is an
incredibly sophisticated package
intended for fun and games. The
more you know about software, the
more astounded you will become as
you read this.

West of House
     You are standing in an open field
west of a white house, with a boarded
front door.
     A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to
Zork!' lies by the door.
     There is a small mailbox here.
&gt;OPEN THE SMALL MAILBOX
    Opening the mailbox reveals a
leaflet.

(Taken)
  Welcome to Zork: The Great Under-
ground Empire
    Zork: The Great Underground Em-
pire is a game of adventvre, danger,
and low cunning. In it you will explore
some of the most amazing territory
ever seen by mortals.
    No computer should be without
one!
    The original ZORK was created by
Tim Anderson. Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling. It was
inspired by the ADVENTURE game of
Crowther and Woods. This version was
created by Marc Blank, Dave Lebling,
Joel Berez, and Scott Cutler.
&gt;WALK AROUND THE HOUSE
North of House
    You are facing the north side of a
white house. There is no door here,
and all the windows are boarded up. To
the north a narrow path winds through
the trees.
&gt;AGAIN
Behind House
    You are behind the white house. A
path leads into the forest to the east. In
one corner of the house there is a small
window which is slightly ajar.
&gt;LOOK IN THE WINDOW
    You can see what appears to be a
kitchen.
&gt;GO IN
    The kitchen window is closed.
&gt;OPEN IT
    With great effort, you open the
window far enough to allow entry.
&gt;GO IN
Kitchen
      You are in the kitchen of the white
house. A table seems to have been
used recently for the preparation of
food. A passage leads to the west and a
dark staircase can be seen leading
upward. A dark chimney leads down
and to the east is a small window which
is open.
      On the table is an elongated brown
sack, smelling of hot peppers. A bottle
is sitting on the table.
     The glass bottle contains:
A quantity of water
&gt;PICK UP
pick up what?
&gt;ALL BUT THE SACK
kitchen table: An interesting idea . . .
glass bottle: Taken.
quantity of water: I can't reach that.
&gt;GO WEST
Living Room
     You are in the living room. There is
a door to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west,
which appears to be nailed shut, and a
large oriental rug in the center of the

<p>
    This transcript shows the beginning of an adventure into a land of
Zork. Zork was originally a single "computerized fantasy simulation"
game in which the object is to explore a labyrinth, called the Great
Underground Empire, comprising a variety of interesting caves or rooms, and
to find hidden treasures and return safely with
them. We now say that Zork is a computer-game environment in which
different games, with different scenarios and different puzzles to solve,
can be written. A Zork player converses with a Zork program by typing
commands in a kind of restricted English and reading the program's
English responses. A longer description of the original game and program
can be found in <a href="https://mud.co.uk/richard/zork.htm">"Zork: A Computerized Fantasy Simulation Game"</a>
by Lebling, Blank, and Anderson (IEEE Computer, April 1979, pp. 51-59).
</p><p>
    The original Zork game was
implemented on a DECsystem-10 at
the MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science in a local Lisp-like language
called MDL. This Zork game was later
translated into a Fortran version for
DEC PSP-11 Computers and made
available through the DECUS program
library. In both versions the program is
large: it occupies most of a process's
virtual storage on a 10, and it requires a
large disk for secondary storage on an
11. In converting Zork to run on
personal computers, the designers
needed some way to shrink it in order
to fit it into the relatively small available
storage.
</p><p>
    One shrinking tactic was to remove the features of MDL that are not
needed in Zork, such as coroutines,
associative storage, and fancy input/output. The stripped-down version of
MDL that resulted was named Zork Implementation Language (ZIL).
However, that was not enough: a straight-forward compilation of
a ZIL version of the original Zork game into the
machine language of any known
personal computer would still have
produced an executable program too
large to fit.
</p><p>
    The solution was to invent a
"virtual machine," specifically designed
to execute Zork programs; the
virtual "Z-machine" has a machine
language called "Z-code", in which
Zork programs can be expressed very
compactly. Then all that was needed
was a Zork Interpretive Program (ZIP),
written in the machine language of any
given target personal computer, that
would imitate a Z-machine in carrying
out the Z-code operations. (A compiler
that translates from ZIL to Z-code is
also needed, of course, but the highly-structured
nature of MDL, and hence
ZIL, makes that a relatively simple
task.) A good benchmark for the
storage saved by rewriting Zork in ZIL
is the Zork parser, which analyzes a
player's English input: the parser for
the PDP-10 occupies 1OK 36-bit words,
while the Z-code parser, which is
actually better functionally, occupies
only 3K 8-bit bytes.
</p><p>
    This Z-code approach is similar to
that of compiling a Pascal program
into "P-code," (although there are now
P-code machines, like Western Digital's Pascal Microengine<sup>TM</sup>,
that are real and not just virtual). In effect, Z-code is
like P-code: a string of subprogram
calls, with the bodies of the subprograms executed by a Z-machine or
ZIP. Any often-used sequence of
pperations in Zork programs could, in
principle, be compressed into a Z-code
instruction, thereby moving the sequence of operations into the
Z-machine or ZIP, where it needs to
appear only once. The Z-machine
designer just has to be judicious in
choosing Z-code bit patterns and
subprogram parametrizations to get
the most benefit from this virtual-machine method.
</p><p>
    Besides compressing the space
needed by Zork programs, the Z-code
approach also makes conversion to
another (real) computer easier, because, assuming that the design of
Z-code is reasonably machine-independent, all one needs to do is to
implement ZIP on the new machine.
</p><h2>Z-code obiects:</h2>
<p>
    Z-code is an object-oriented
language (as are Lisp and MDL and
ZIL). In this section the various kinds of
objects and the possible operations on
them are described. Excerpts from a
transcript of a game are used to
illustrate the uses of these objects.
</p><p>
    All Z-code objects occupy one or
two bytes in storage, and exactly two
bytes while they are being processed.
Like MDL, ZIL uses "type codes" to
distinguish among the different types
of objects, but Z-code does not, to save
space: the ZIL compiler checks for
proper use of types, but ZIP doesn't
bother. A Z-code operation that yields
a truth-value (integer 0 or 1) is called
(as in Lisp) a "predicate"; the Z-code
operation-codes for all predicates
include a bit for inverting the sense of
the test, another space-saving
measure.
</p><pre>Dam Lobby
    This room appears to have been
the waiting room for groups touring
the dam. There are exits here to the
north and east marked 'Private,'
though the doors are open, and an exit
to the south.
    Some guidebooks entitled 'Flood
Control Dam #3' are on the reception
desk. There is a matchbook whose
cover says 'Visit Beautiful FCD#3' here.
&gt;COUNT MATCHES
You have 5 matches.
&gt;COUNT NOSES
I don't know the word 'noses.'
</pre>
<h2>Integer:</h2>
<p>
An integer, such as the number of
matches left in a matchbook, is stored
in two bytes, according to the normal
bit-level representation used by the
hardware. Operations on integers
include the four normal arithmetic
functions, remainder or modular
reduction, and generation of a random
integer in the range 1-N. (Modular
reduction - calculating the remainder
in a division - is useful for stepping
through a set of English responses
cyclically. Random-integer generation
is useful for choosing a response at
random from a set of similar responses.)
Predicates test for one
integer being less than, greater than, or
equal to another integer, and for an
integer being zero. (Since the sense of
a test can be reversed using one of the
bits in its operation code, this means
implicitly that there are also predicates
to test for greater-than-or-equal,
less-than-or-equal, not-equal, and not-zero.)
Testing for zero may seem
redundant, given an equality test, but it
is used often enough that the cost of
using another operation code is
outweighed by the value of eliminating
the byte that would be used to hold a
zero in every instance. Naturally, there
is an operation to "print&amp;uot; an integer in
the output stream - though, of course
most personal computers display
characters on a CRT rather than
printing them on paper.
</p><p>
    In some situations an integer is
treated as a string of 16 independent
bits; for this case there are operations
for Boolean "and" and "or" and "not,"
and for testing individual bits. The
characters in the player's input are also
stored as integers, using the ASCII
code; for this case there is an output
operation to print a single character, as
shown in the last response above.
</p><pre>The Troll Room
    This is a small room with passages
to the east and south and a forbidding
hole leading west. Bloodstains and
deep scratches (perhaps made by an
axe) mar the walls.
    A nasty-looking troll, brandishing
a bloody axe, blocks all passages out
of the room.
    Your sword has begun to glow
very brightly.
&gt;KILL TROLL WITH KNIFE
    The blow lands, making a shallow
gash in the troll's arm! The troll swings
his axe, and it nicks your arm as you
dodge.
&gt;AGAIN
    The quickness of your thrust
knocks the troll back, stunned. The
troll slowly regains his feet.
&gt;AGAIN
    A quick stroke, but the troll is on
guard. The troll swings his axe, but it
misses.
&gt;AGAIN
    A good slash, but it misses the troll
by a mile. The axe crashes against the
rock, throwing sparks!
&gt;AGAIN
    The troll is disarmed by a subtle
feint past his guard. The troll, now
worried about this encounter, recovers
his bloody axe.
</pre>
<h2>String:</h2>
<p>
    As you can see, Zork programs
tend to be wordy, so strings of
characters need to be stored as
compactly as possible. Three characters can fit in two bytes, if each
character uses only five bits. But five
bits can encode only 32 characters
directly, and that is obviously not
enough. The solutlon is to use different
"contexts" and to reserve one or more
"characters" for switching among
contexts. (This technique is similar to
the five-bit Baudot code, which was
used by early Teletypes before ASCII
was invented.) Z-code strings use
three contexts - lower case, upper
case, and digits/punctuation - and
several characters for switching
among the contexts, either "permanently"
or only for the next character,
the latter in order to capitalize a word
or use a single punctuation mark.
Because of the extra characters used
to switch contexts, Z-code strings
work out to about five and a half bits
per visible character, which is still
significantly more compact than eight
bits.
</p><p>
    The only operation on strings is to
print them, i.e., show them to the
player. There is no need to manipulate
them, except to print strings sequentially so that they form sentences for
the player. (Actually, simply because it
occurs so often, there is also an
operation for printing a string and then
returning from a function call.) Most
strings are stored without "new-line"
characters, and ZlP takes care of
"folding" the output into lines of a size
convenient for the particular display
being used; a few rigidly-formatted
strings do use new-lines in order to
draw a crude picture with the characters.
</p><pre>&gt;SWIM
I don't really see how.
&gt;SWIM
I think that swimming is best performed in water.
&gt;SWIM
Perhaps it is your head that is
swimming.
...
&gt;TAKE HOUSE
What a concept!
&gt;AGAIN
A valiant attempt.
&gt;AGAIN
You can't be serious.
&gt;AGAIN
Not bloody likely.
&gt;AGAIN
An Interesting idea...
</pre>
<h2>Table:</h2>
<p>
    A table is used to keep a set of
related objects (like the responses
above) together, as a list is used in Lisp
or a record is used in Pascal. A table is
stored as a number of two-byte (or
sometimes one-byte) objects one after
another. The length of a table is sometimes stored in its first elemcnt - to be
used by parts of a program thst need to
step through all the elements - and
sometimes not - if the program itself
knows how long the table is. Operations on a table can get a word (two
bytes) out of it and put a word into it;
get a single byte out, and put one in;
and move the pointer along to another
element (like CDR in Lisp) or backwards to a previous one (like BACK in
MDL); (Actually; since a pointer to a
table is just a plain address, ordinary
addition and subtraction are used to
move a pointer forward and backward
in a table.)
</p><h2>Thing:</h2>
<p>
    "Things" are probably the most
interesting objects, since they represent the player, rooms, enemies,
weapons, treasures and so on - the
stuff of which a game is made. To avoid
confusion, "Thing" will always be
written with a capital "T" when it refers
to this kind of Z-code object. Since
there are relatively few Things used in
a Zork game, but they are used very
frequently, each Thing is designated
by a one-byte number rather than, say,
its two-byte address in storage. This
design decision limits the number of
possible Things in one game to 255,
with the number zero reserved to mean
"no Thing." (There are also "pseudo-Things", whose names the parser will
recognize as significant but which
have no interesting properties.)
</p><p>
    A Thing's number can be easily
translated into its address in storage
where its parts are found: status bits,
contents, and properties. These parts
are stored sequentially, as in a table, in
a very strict format: four bytes for
status, three bytes for contents, and
two bytes holding the address of the
property table - so ZlP needs to know
only the address of the first Thing in
order to translate a Thing number into
its address.
</p><p>
    Each Thing has 32 status bits,
which can be turned off or on or tested
individually by Z-code operations.
Status bits represent qualities of a
Thing, both permanent (edible, burnable, fightable "room," etc.) and
temporary ("lit," "open," etc.).
</p><pre>&gt;TAKE SACK
Taken.
&gt;LOOK IN SACK
The brown sack is closed.
&gt;OPEN SACK
Opening the brown sack reveals a
lunch, and a clove of garlic.
&gt;TAKE LUNCH OUT
Taken.
&gt;TAKE CLOVER THEN PUT
BOTTLE IN SACK
Taken.
Done.
&gt;LOOK IN SACK
The brown sack contains:
A glass bottle
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
</pre>
<p>
    A Thing's <em>contents</em> part relates it
spatially to other Things in three ways:
as a parent ("container") as a chlld
("containee"), and as a sibling ("inmate").
For example, if the knife and
the bottle are in the kitchen, then the
kitchen's "child" slot would hold the
number of the knife, the knife's "sibling" slot would hold the number of
the bottle, and the knife's (and bottle's)
"parent" slot would hold the number of
the kitchen. (Of course, depending on
how they got there, the knife and the
bottle might be interchanged in this
data structure.) Such a data structure
is commonly called a list: Things can
be added to or removed from a list
simply by moving the appropriate
numbers into the slots. Manipulating
list structures of this kind - the reason
Lisp was invented - is essential in
Zork games, as Things get moved here
and there by the player. For convenience,
"contents" has a more general
meaning in ZIL: for example, the
player's baggage is "contained in" the
player Thing. The operations on
contents are
</p><ul>
<li>"move X into Y,"
</li><li>"remove X from everything" (e.g., if
  it is eaten or otherwise destroyed),
</li><li>"is X in Y?" and "what is X in (if anything)?"
(using X's parent slot),
</li><li>"what is the first Thing (if any) in X?"
  (using X's child slot), and
</li><li>"what is the next Thing (if any) in the
  same Thing that X is in?" (using X's
sibling slot).
</li></ul>
<pre>     This is the attic. The only exit is a
stairwey leading down. On a table is a
nasty-looking knife. A large coil of
rope is lying in the corner.
&gt;TAKE NASTY KNIFE
Taken.
...
Maze
     This is part ot a maze of twisty little
passages, all alike.
     A skeleton, probably the remains
of a luckless adventurer, lies here.
Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
     The deceased adventurers use-
less lantern is here. There is a skeleton
key here. An old leather bag, bulging
with coins, is here.
&gt;TAKE RUSTY KNIFE
     As you pick up the rusty knife,
your sword gives a single pulse of
blinding blue light.
</pre>
<p>
    Finally, each Thing has a table (in
the format described previously) of its
properties, such as name, size, capacity, score value, verbose description,
north neighbor, synonyms, and action
routines; the last can be seen in the
transcript above involving the two
knives. (The name of a Thing identifies
it uniquely to the player throughout the
whole game, e.g., "kitchen," "bottle,"
"thief." There is a special Z-code
operation for printing a Thing's name.)
Since there are a limited number of
properties a Thing can have, and not all
of them require the same smount of
storage, a special format is used to
store them in this table: the first byte of
each property has a five-bit property
number (allowing 32 different properties) and a three-bit count of the
number of immediately following bytes
used to store the property. The
operations on properties are "get
property Y of Thing X," "store Z as
property Y of Thing X," "get the storage
address of property Y of Thing X," and
"get the next property of Thing X following this property."
</p><pre>&gt;SCORE
    Your score would be 10 (total of
375 points), in 9 moves. This score
gives you the rank of Beginner.
</pre>
<h2>Variable:</h2>
<p>
    Variables are used to keep track of
the situation all through the game.
(Parts of Things are used also.) For
example, the player's current score is a
variable, called a "global" variable
because it is the same no matter what
functions have been called. Like
Things, variables are identified by a
one-byte number. A special number is
used to identify the top of the "stack,"
and fifteen more numbers identify
"local" variables used by the function
currently executing. (The stack is
described later.) The remaining 240
numbers identify global variables.
Operations on variables store and
retrieve the current value, increment or
decrement an integer value by one and
optionally test it for crossing a given
threshold, push a value onto the stack,
pop a value of the stack, and print the
value.
</p><h2>Other operations:</h2>
<p>
    The remaining Z-code operations
do not deal directly with objects. These
operations include the null operation,
go-to (jump, branch), call a function,
return a value to the calling function,
and return "true" or "false" or whatever
is on top of the stack to the calling
function. Also there are special operations
to input a line from the player and
find the significant words in it using a
vocabulary table, save the game
situation on a disk or tape, restore a
situation saved previously, quit playing
or start afresh.
</p><h2>Z-code format:</h2>
<p>
    Each Z-code instruction begins
with a byte containing the operation
code, which includes bits describing
how the operands (or arguments) are
addressed. Some operations always
use a certain number of operands, and
some operations use an unpredictable
number of operands, from zero to four.
Each operand that is used can be either
a "small" (8-bit) integer, a "large"
(16-bit) integer, or a variable (8 bits) . (A
string is an operand for only one
operation code, the print routine.)
Following the operation-code byte are
the operands. An operation that
returns a value has another byte
following the operands that tells in
what variable to store the value. A
predicate operation has another byte
or two that tells where to go to, relative
to this current instruction, if the
predicate is true.
</p><p>
    A sub-program is called with a
special "call" operation code, whose
operands are the address of the
sub-program and the (zero to three)
arguments or parameters for this call.
</p><p>
    Z-code uses a single stack to store
both temporary values and return
addresses for pending function calls.
Z-code doesn't distinguish between
addresses and other kinds of data but
- because ZIL is a "structured"
programming language - the ZIL
compiler produces Z-code that uses
the stack in a disciplined way,
"pushing" and "popping" words in the
correct order and not confusing one
datum for another.
</p><h2>Storage management:</h2>
<p>
    The address space of a personal
computer running ZIP is divided into
three parts: impure storage, resident
pure storage, and non-resident pure
storage. "Impure" means that the data
in storage can be modified; impure
storage is where all the Things,
variables, stack, and so on live. To
"save" the game situation just requires
writing this part of storage onto a disk
or tape, and to "restore" is the
opposite; all other parts of the program
are pure and unchanging, so they don't
need to be saved.
</p><p>
    Resident pure storage holds ZIP
itself. "Resident" means that the code
is loaded from disk at the start of
execution and resides in primary
memory throughout the game. Non-resident pure storage is paged
(physical storage divided into page
frames and Z-code program divided
into pages, typically with 256 bytes
each) and swapped (program pages
are kept on disk until needed and then
read in to a suitable page frame for
interpretation). It may be necessary to
swap in a page to read the next
sequential byte (if the next byte lies on
the next page) or during a go-to, call,
return, or print-string Z-code instruction (if the target address lies on
another page). Fortunately. the first
situation is easy to test for, since the
first byte of any page always has zeros
for the least significant bits of the
address; the second situation occurs
infrequently and is easily handled by
the parts of ZIP that interpret those
instructions. ZIP keeps track of which
pages are currently in which frames by
using a page table, which holds the
first virtual address of each page that is
currently swapped in. ZIP must also
translate addresses accordlng to
which frame currently holds which
page.
</p><p>
    All the objects used by a Z-code
program are set up in their proper
locations and formats by the ZIL
compiler. There is no need to create
new objects while the Z-code program
runs, and so there is no need to reclaim
storage used by old objects with a
Lisp-like garbage collector.
</p><p>
    With ZIP needs to know to start
running a game are the first address of
the three parts of the address space;
the first address of Thing storage,
global-variable storage, and the
vocabulary table used by the "input" Z-code instruction (whence it can find
the number and size of vocabulary
entries); and the address of the first
executable instruction in the game.
</p><h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
    We have described how a large
program can be squeezed into a small
machine by using a "virtual-machine"
approach to encoding the program.
Essentially, the designers identified
sub-programs within the large program (and within a whole series of
similar programs) and chose ways to
encode invocations of those sub-programs as compactly as possible.
Then duplicate copies of those sub-programs couid be removed, and the
whole program could be encoded in
the "machine language" of a virtual
Z-machine. This technique follows a
long line of tradition in computer
programming that encourages identifying sub-programs and making them
modular and easy to use.
</p><p>

<p>A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with quantum computers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for “post-quantum cryptography” (PQC). He also believes that NIST has made errors&nbsp;– either accidental or deliberate&nbsp;– in calculations describing the security of the new standards. NIST denies the claims.</p>
<p>“NIST isn’t following procedures designed to stop NSA from weakening PQC,” says Bernstein. “People choosing cryptographic standards should be transparently and verifiably following clear public rules so that we don’t need&nbsp;to worry about their motivations. NIST promised transparency and then claimed it&nbsp;had shown all its work, but that&nbsp;claim simply isn’t true.”</p>
<p>The mathematical problems we use to protect data are practically impossible for even the largest supercomputers to crack today. But when quantum computers become <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2379347-which-quantum-computer-is-the-most-powerful-ever-its-complicated/">reliable and powerful enough</a>, they will be able to break them in moments.</p>

    
<p>Although it is <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2370022-cryptographers-bet-cash-on-when-quantum-computers-will-beat-encryption/">unclear when such computers will emerge</a>, NIST&nbsp;has been running a project <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/Let-s-Get-Ready-to-Rumble-The-NIST-PQC-Competiti/images-media/PQCrypto-April2018_Moody.pdf">since 2012</a> to standardise a new generation of algorithms that <span></span> resist their attacks. Bernstein, who <a href="https://archive.ph/BHGOM">coined the term post-quantum cryptography</a> in 2003 to refer to these kinds of algorithms, says the&nbsp;NSA is actively engaged in putting secret weaknesses into new encryption standards that will allow them to be more easily cracked with the right knowledge. NIST’s standards are used globally, so flaws could have a large impact.</p>
<p>Bernstein alleges that NIST’s calculations for one of the upcoming PQC standards, Kyber512, are “glaringly wrong”, making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high assessment of Kyber512’s robustness to attack.</p>
<p>“We disagree with his analysis,” says <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/dustin-moody">Dustin Moody</a> at NIST. “It’s a&nbsp;question for which there isn’t scientific certainty and intelligent people can have different views. We respect Dan’s opinion, but don’t agree with what he says.”</p>
<p>Moody says that Kyber512 meets NIST’s “level one” security criteria, which makes it at least as hard to&nbsp;break as a commonly used existing algorithm, AES-128. That&nbsp;said, NIST recommends that, in practice, people should use a stronger version, Kyber768, which Moody says was a suggestion from&nbsp;the algorithm’s developers.</p>

    
<p>NIST is currently in a period of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2327054-us-chooses-encryption-tools-to-protect-us-from-quantum-computers/">public consultation</a> and hopes to reveal the final standards for PQC algorithms next year so that organisations can begin to adopt them. The Kyber algorithm seems likely to make the cut as it has already progressed through several layers of selection.</p>
<p>Given its secretive nature, it is difficult to say for sure whether or&nbsp;not the NSA has influenced the&nbsp;PQC standards, but there have&nbsp;long been suggestions and&nbsp;rumours that the agency deliberately weakens encryption algorithms. In 2013, The New York Times reported that the agency <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html">had a budget of $250&nbsp;million for the task</a>, and intelligence agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden in the same year contained references to the NSA deliberately placing a backdoor in&nbsp;a cryptography algorithm, although that algorithm was <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announces-steps-to-restore-confidence-on-encryption-standards/">later dropped from official standards</a>.</p>
<p>Moody denies that NIST would ever agree to deliberately weaken a&nbsp;standard at the behest of the NSA and says that any secret weakness would have had to be inserted without its knowledge. He also says that in the wake of the Snowden revelations, NIST has tightened guidelines to ensure transparency and security and to&nbsp;rebuild confidence with cryptographic experts.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have ever intentionally done anything like&nbsp;that,” says Moody, but he acknowledges the Snowden leaks&nbsp;caused a backlash. “Anytime the NSA gets brought up, there’s a&nbsp;number of cryptographers that are&nbsp;concerned and we’ve tried to be open and transparent about our interactions.”</p>

    
<p>Moody says that the NSA has&nbsp;also – as far as a secretive intelligence agency can – tried to&nbsp;be more open. But the agency declined to comment when approached by <em>New Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>“All we can do is tell people that&nbsp;NIST are the ones in the room&nbsp;making the decisions, but if&nbsp;you don’t believe us, there’s no way you could verify that without being inside NIST,” says Moody.</p>
<p>However, Bernstein alleges that&nbsp;NIST hasn’t been open about the level of input by the NSA, “stonewalling” him when he has&nbsp;asked for information. As a result, he has made freedom of information requests and taken NIST to court, <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20231003-countcorrectly.html">forcing it to reveal details of the NSA’s involvement</a>.</p>
<p>Documents released to Bernstein indicate that a group described as the “Post Quantum Cryptography Team, National Institute of Standards and Technology” included many NSA&nbsp;members and that NIST had met with someone from the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK&nbsp;equivalent of the NSA.</p>

    
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Woodward_(computer_scientist)">Alan Woodward</a> at the University of Surrey, UK, says there are reasons to be wary of encryption algorithms. For example, the GEA-1 code used in mobile phone networks during the 1990s and 2000s was found to have a flaw that made it <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2281423-flaw-in-old-mobile-phone-encryption-code-could-be-used-for-snooping/">millions of times less computationally intensive than it&nbsp;should have been to crack</a>&nbsp;– although a culprit who put it there&nbsp;has never been identified.</p>
<p>But Woodward says that the current PQC candidates have been heavily scrutinised by academics and industry and haven’t yet been&nbsp;found lacking, while other algorithms that featured in earlier stages of the competition have been <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2310369-encryption-meant-to-protect-against-quantum-hackers-is-easily-cracked/">demonstrated to be flawed and were eliminated.</a></p>
<p>“Intelligence agencies have a history of weakening encryption, but there’s been such a lot of security analysis done on these candidates that I would be surprised if Kyber were somehow booby-trapped,” he says.</p>

This is what it has on its website, marketing material that is pretty close to ‘we sell price-fixing conspiracies.’</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png" width="315" height="223" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:223,&quot;width&quot;:315,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74746d83-73ae-4033-83ca-50b20ed847cb_315x223.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>But are there other examples? Yes. One mind-blowing </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent" rel="">story</a><span> from ProPublica that came out in 2022 was about landlord software sold by a firm called RealPage, which essentially told big landlords to raise rents by showing them “data RealPage gathers from clients, including private information on what nearby competitors charge.” There’s a quasi-consulting arrangement here too, as “RealPage discourages bargaining with renters and has even recommended that landlords in some cases accept a lower occupancy rate in order to raise rents and make more money.”</span></p><p><span>RealPage is now facing at least </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/texas/2022/11/22/realpage-could-face-real-trouble-with-antitrust-suits/" rel="">seven private antitrust class action</a><span> suits, as lower output and higher prices are classic signs of monopoly power. What’s fascinating is that here again, an economist would look at these markets and see competition and multiple rivals renting out apartments, but they would miss that there’s a cartel, or rather a set of regional cartels coordinated by a software platform, operating to boost prices and margins.</span></p><p>Sometimes the price-fixing is done through software and data exchange, and sometimes it’s done through signaling in concentrated markets. In its recently filed complaint against Amazon, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission touched on something called Project Nessie, an internal algorithm “to test how much it could raise prices in a way that competitors would follow.” Amazon would raise a price to see if competitors followed, and then keep the price high if they did, or drop it back down if they didn’t. </p><p>Basically, Amazon wasn’t just hiking its own prices, it was signaling to rivals that they should hike their prices as well. I spoke with a former Amazon retail division official, who told me about how much they hated Project Nessie internally, because it was a collusive mechanism imposed upon the retail division which drove up prices to consumers. </p><p>From a legal perspective, it’s interesting the Federal Trade Commission didn’t make a monopolization claim on Project Nessie, but an argument that this kind of algorithmic collusion is what is known as an unfair method of competition, which is a more expansive claim that allows for a looser market definition. In certain areas, like selling expensive cameras, people do comparison-shop. But even though there is competition, Amazon has market power, and Project Nessie is an unfair exploitation of that market power to drive up prices everywhere. It’s a cartel done via algorithm. </p><p><span>I suspect these forms of coordination are far more common than we assume. You might think the restaurant industry is competitive, and it is. But the </span><em>payment </em><span>software for restaurants is much less so, and when consumers are presented with a bill at a restaurant, the screen regularly offers not the traditional 15% tip, but the choice of tipping 20%, 22%, or 25%. Is that collusion? No. But’s a loosely coordinated form of a price hike to allow firms to pay employees less than they would ordinarily have to. And tipping is now being baked into all sorts of firms, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-businesses-cant-stop-asking-cc1aca6c" rel="">from</a><span> juice shops to appliance-repair firms to plant stores to locksmiths. 16% of small businesses now ask customers to leave a tip, up from 6% in 2019. Again, this change is almost certainly a shift in the software firms use to accept payments, and it’s a price hike and form of coordination you won’t see in concentration statistics.</span></p><p>That said, even if you think forms of price fixing are systemic, there’s another important question. Did this kind of coordination increase during the pandemic and drive inflation? And there, the answer is we just don’t know. Project Nessie ended in 2019, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee began investigating Amazon. Agri Stats changed some of its practices in 2019 as well, after there were class action suit filings. I find it hard to believe Amazon and meatpackers aren’t continuing these practices in some form or fashion. Moreover, competition is cumulative, and so is collusion. If a bunch of firms have collectively held back on supply for years, they can’t suddenly build a bunch of factories to expand production. In other words, if an industry is historically concentrated, collusive and genteel, then prices won’t move very much for a while, even if formal agreements stop.</p><p><span>Indeed, Mike Konczal and Niko Lusiani, in a paper titled “</span><a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RI_PricesProfitsPower_202206.pdf" rel="">Prices, Profits, and Power</a><span>,” showed how markups exploded during the pandemic, and that the increases in 2021 were “both the highest level on record and the largest one-year increase—over 2.5 times the increase of the next several largest annual increases.” Was that a function of more single firms operating as monopolies, or more concentrated industries colluding to act as cartels? The answer is likely, yes.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" width="1194" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>More broadly, price-fixing isn’t always about driving prices up, it can also be about driving wages and supplier prices down. Meat processors weren’t just colluding in jacking up prices to consumers, but </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/hormel-other-meat-processors-must-face-workers-wage-antitrust-claims-us-judge-2023-09-28/" rel="">lowering</a><span> wages to workers. And in a non-inflationary environment, prior to 2021, it was easier to reduce prices to suppliers than increase prices on consumers. Indeed, the decade of the 2010s was one in which there was remarkably slow wage growth, which is consistent with a story of heavy concentration on the labor side (which economists have now </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24147" rel="">realized is pervasive</a><span>.)</span></p><p>It was only when there was a broad narrative shift towards inflation that businesses began increasing prices dramatically, and that’s when price-fixing turns from pressing down prices from workers and sellers and towards raising prices on consumers. It isn’t ironclad that profits drove inflation, but these cases do suggest that statistics about concentration are at best incomplete. </p><p>One of the core political dynamics in American politics is that our economic and political elites see the world almost entirely differently than normal people, and there’s no better case study for this than inflation. It’s something I’ve written about extensively - why do Americans think inflation is up and the economy is bad when all the dials and data policymakers use show that these are boom times?</p><p><span>I’ve answered part of this question by showing that the dials themselves </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/strikes-and-bidenomics" rel="">are broken</a><span>, that the cost of interest charges isn’t included in inflation metrics. But I also have a suspicion that the increase of tips and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-to-blame-for-all-those-hidden-fees-we-are-95d42f6" rel="">junk fees</a><span> - which are exploding in usage by businesses - is causing people to say inflation is too high, not just because everything is so costly but because the prices are also </span><em>unfair</em><span>. </span></p><p>Buying a ticket to a game or concert and seeing a crazy fee, or being presented with a tip screen for a locksmith and having to choose between social awkwardness and paying a higher price, feels crappy. Being cheated is not only frustrating, it’s also scary, because it can recur without warning and cause unexpected costs. Being cheated thus imposes a real extra cost beyond the amount someone has to pay, which is to say, increasing uncertainty about future prices.</p><p>So this is another part of the answer about why sentiments on the economy are negative despite evidence of less inflation and more jobs. Pollsters are asking about inflation by framing it in terms that economists understand, which is to say the level or the rate of increase. But ordinary people not only want to pay good prices, they also want to feel like they are being treated fairly. If people feel increasingly cheated, and the only questions they are asked by pollsters are whether the economy is good or whether inflation is up, they will give an answer that reflects their anger and fear of being taken advantage of, and not reflect the ‘objective’ statistics policymakers expect.</p><p>This too is not a new problem. For thousands of years, political philosophers have wrestled with the problem of the ‘just price’ for goods, and every society regulated prices to get close to fairness. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission, and many other areas of government, have statutes that bar “unfair” methods of competition or “unfair” consumer pricing practices, because fairness, not just the level, is something that makes a society function. These kinds of laws seem quaint today, and antitrust lawyers and economists regularly mock the very concept of fairness. But by airbrushing out the human element of commerce, and narrowing the only moral question to efficiency and price level, economists have destroyed the ability of policymakers to see commerce and understand the economy the way the rest of us do.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

I am able to turn off the keyboard light, enable dark mode, yet this fingerprint sensor has a bright light that cannot be turned off. </p><p>I reached out in the forums about this and it seems there should be a way, but it’s not supported on AMD devices as of this writing: https://community.frame.work/t/amd-turn-off-fingerprint-reader-light/37753/4</p><p>If I am on an airplane at night I don’t want to be distracted by light coming from my keyboard area.</p><p>Last thing I tried, was a speed test… Then I realized, this laptop isn’t using the 6ghz band on my router.

Framework support requested that I send them proof and some other stuff, but I honestly wonder if any of them have had a chance to test the 6ghz band in linux.</p><p>Don’t really have time after my exhaustion of all the other issues to send them a detailed report on that just yet, haha.</p><p>Update: Turns out, this was due to having band steering on in my router.</p><p>Pixel devices, iPhone 15’s, etc, all can use 6ghz with this setting on, but not the framework, it seems to… steer itself, to 5ghz haha.</p><p>After turning it off, it likes to go onto 2.4GHZ even when I’m close to the router… very frustrating to have such crappy speeds because the wifi firmware is so bad.</p><p>When band steering is off and you are 1 inch from the router, it will sometimes negotiate a 6ghz connection, even when it manages to, the speeds are absolute crap, for some reason this wifi card really sucks in linux. A small pixel 6a right next to it can do 1gigabit in a speed test while this laptop is lucky to get 300 down.</p><p>Disconnect and reconnect, and sometimes you will get 5 ghz, or 2.4, when every other device I have from this next test location has a -60dbm 5ghz connection. Very weird and I hope AMD is working on it.</p><p>1Password has official support for fingerprint readers in Linux, however it doesn’t work and I am working with them to find out why.</p><p><span>Update: The framework team made a </span><a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/ubuntu-fingerprint-troubleshooting-r1_DA0TMn" rel="">new fingerprint guide</a><span> and at the bottom is a command you must run to enable the fingerprint reader for these other tasks. NOW it works with 1Password!</span></p><p>I have a project running in a VS Code dev container. I noticed that a local app started hanging, loads forever in the browser through the forwarded port.</p><p>This seems to happen after leaving the lid closed for a while and then coming back. Simply re-opening the dev container seems to solve it, and the http requests go through again.</p><p>A known problem in the current kernel, sometimes the system freezes for 1-15s at a time, but it seems to be happening less often the longer you have kept the device on since a restart, and a new kernel is on the way with fixes I hope.</p><p>It can run games, but woah, do the fans spin up. I was able to briefly run Rocket League on windows at the native resolution of the display, it quickly dropped to around 30fps with a lot of drops, so you would definitely want to use AMD FSR compatible games, or drop the render resolution to 1080p or lower.</p><p>Update:</p><p>I found a setting in the bios about game mode on the GPU and enabled it. Starting rocket league again, it’s able to nearly lock 60fps at the screen’s native resolution.</p><p>I also went and connected it via hdmi while on battery to a 1080p display, and it runs games great at this resolution, the fans aren’t even that loud!</p><p>Overall performance seems on par with Apple Silicon. I only have an M1 machine to compare, but the fan stays off most of the time, if I do an intense compile or package installation, it barely spins up. In games at high resolution, it is full blast though.</p><p>The first night as I am writing this, I did some coding work, had it on performance mode, had it sitting with the lid closed during the day, and started out with a 90% charge limit that I set in the BIOS.</p><p>I closed the lid at 16% and in the morning I opened it at….</p><p>8% (after around 10 hours)</p><p>Not bad! I think this is close to Mac level but not quite all the way there.</p><p>Definitely solid enough that you can leave the laptop unplugged and closed during the day between breaks and other things and it is going to save most of the power!</p><p><span>You need to </span><a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/expansion-card-functionality-on-framework-laptop-13-amd-ryzen-7040-series-SkrVx7gAh" rel="">make sure certain ports are not in the rear slots</a><span> for sleep to work well.</span></p><p>As for usage when it’s on:</p><p>Running on ubuntu power saver, it does last longer, but I’ll give you an example of how much performance is being lost.</p><p>I ran a yarn install (packages for an app)</p><p>It took 45s on power saver, and the battery estimates were closer to 10 hours at full.</p><p>Put it back on performance, ran this again,</p><p>15s to run this command.</p><p>Which is the speed I was hoping to get out of a 10 hour battery life, but it is estimating about half that on performance with my workload.</p><p>I feel for people running performance stuff on the older frameworks with the smaller battery!</p><p>I actually like the device, I promise. It just has a lot of issues, some of them are to be expected, but also there’s a bit more than I was expecting, considering how long the wait for this was, and how some small things like a fingerprint light can’t be turned off.</p><p><strong>The repair-ability and durability feel amazing</strong><span> though. You can’t understand just how solid it is until you hold it, and just how easy it is to take it apart to clean or upgrade things.</span></p><p><strong>It’s also very light for how modular it is.</strong></p><p>I just wish the software support for stuff like trackpad gestures could match the Mac one day, it just kills my wrist and fingers to have to do things in a less efficient way than I am used to doing on a Mac.</p><p>One reason I use a Magic Trackpad on the max tracking speed setting, is due to how I can move anywhere on screen, swipe back and forth, with minimal wrist movement.</p><p>I have high hopes for Framework’s future and will be using it as a secondary device on side projects for the time being.</p><p>I also want to be clear, I love being on the bleeding edge and working through problems, it’s how I learn more stuff even though it can be frustrating at times. I will try to help the framework team by testing stuff fast and often as this system matures.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>Scrollbars. Ever heard of them? They’re pretty cool. Click and drag on a scrollbar and you can move content around in a scrollable content pane. I love that shit. Every day I am scrolling on my computer, all day long. But the scrollbars are getting smaller and this is increasingly becoming a problem. I would show you screenshots but they’re so small that even screenshotting them is hard to do. And people keep making them even smaller, hiding them away, its like they don’t want you to scroll! “Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen. And me, a happy scroll-wheeler, even I would like to quickly jump around some time.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Ok so a lot of folks have fine motor control problems. Others use somewhat inaccurate pointing devices like eye-trackers (they’re very impressive, but not good enough for your 8 pixel wide scrollbar!!). And these people, they wanna scroll! When my friend is voice/sound controlling their computer (<a href="https://talonvoice.com/">with Talon Voice which is really good btw you should try it</a>), they don’t wanna say “scroll down” over and over again or start auto scrolling and try to land in the right spot. They wanna just look at the scrollbar and click on the spot they wanna be looking at. You click on the spot and the content goes there! It’s THE GOOD STUFF!!!</p>

<p>I am not the first to notice this. See <a href="https://www.remembertheusers.com/2015/10/0014-gtk3-scroll-bar-widths.html">this post too in <strong>2015</strong> discussing this problem</a>. I’d hate to go back in time only to tell them nothing has improved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple fact that these skinny scroll bars exist are evidence that designers do not sit with non technical users to conduct usability testing. Because if they did that they would immediately discover the problem.</p>

  <p>People with dexterity and hand control challenges have a difficult time with these skinny scroll bars.</p>

  <p>People with eye sight challenges suffer with these skinny scroll bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>

<p>People keep making the bar smaller! Or trying to get rid of it! I’m naming names of software I use day to day, but it’s not just them, people are doing this even outside the world of Linux.</p>

<p>In some of the cases the problem is actually that the bar is precisely the same size it always has been (in pixels), but monitor resolutions are much higher than when that bar width was first chosen, and bars haven’t started scaling to keep up, but in other cases the bars are actually getting smaller. Gods, remember the needle-bar Ubuntu tried to introduce for a bit? lmao.</p>

<p>And while the bars were shrinking, another feature silently disappeared: buttons to click and hold down to scroll left/right in increments. Arrow-keys largely hold this functionality now, but are dependent on what content is in focus. Buttons were not dependent on this. Actually, some of you might not even know what I’m talking about. These:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/barbuttons-fs8.png" alt="OS X screenshot with the scroll buttons highlighted"></p>

<p>I don’t use these! But I added it into this post on request of someone who does, and wants them back.</p>

<p>By and large the trend that persists is, the bars get less usable, and either there are no user-configurable ways to fix them, or the ability to configure the options are buried so deep into the tech stack that no normal user can find them. I’m extremely technical. Many of my friends are not, and it’s their troubles that have driven me to write this post.</p>

<h3 id="gtk">GTK</h3>

<p>In GTK2, you could modify scrollbar widths directly in your gtkrc, and GUI programs existed to do this. In GTK3, this is CSS. Which, OK I guess, but there hasn’t really been a good user-friendly way to set it unless you understand theming. I found <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/13i6l2n/custom_application_to_change_scrollbarslider_width/">this reddit thread</a> with a good script for it, which I’ll reproduce here in the likely event that reddit dies. Put this in a <code>.sh</code> file and run it if you need.</p>

<div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "NEW SCROLLBAR WIDTH(px) OR TYPE 'r' TO RESET"
while true; do
    read uin
    uin=$(echo "$uin" | xargs) # trim
    uin=$(echo "${uin,,}") # lower case

    if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ || "$uin" == "r" ]]; then

        # RESET

</code></pre></div>

<p>Naturally the script has to override flatpak separately because heaven forbid my flatpak applications look the way I themed my system. They’ve also started hiding the scrollbar entirely by default until you hover over where it’s supposed to be, what is that???? You can get it back in GTK 3 if you know the right command line command to type in. (the script above does this too btw)</p>

<div><pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you can find it in the GUI if you know how to navigate the Dconf Editor, I guess. lol. Though in GTK 4, you can’t even set this setting globally. See <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790677#c6">this thread right here</a>, which to the best of my knowledge is still true as of writing.</p>

<div><pre><code>&gt; &gt; Who ever said they were going to "go"? The API to make an application use
&gt; &gt; them is still there. Programs used frequently on tablets or such can take
&gt; &gt; feature requests to have their own options to use non-overlay scrollbars.
&gt; 
&gt; So I just need to file a feature request against every gtk application that I
&gt; use?
&gt; And when I install GNOME I'll need to go into each application and enable it.
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="qt">Qt</h3>

<p>To quote <code>/u/cfeck_kde</code> on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/qmb1kp/how_to_change_scrollbar_width_in_kde_qt_apps/">/r/kde</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The width of Qt scrollbars is determined by the Qt widget style plugin you are using. As far as I know, only the Skulpture style allows configurable sizes. For other styles like Breeze, you would need to change the C++ source and recompile.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one paw, <em>recompile my GUI theme?</em> - but hey I’m a gentoo user I do that every friday anyway, I could just drop a patch in I guess… <strong>RECOMPILE MY GUI THEME??</strong></p>

<p>I repeat,</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/fault-tolerance-crop-crop-fs8.png" alt="One person asks another 'did you just tell me to go fuck myself'? The other person replies 'I believe I did, bob!'"></p>

<p>But on the other paw, because Qt style plugins are <em>real code</em> they do get to have a lot more power here if you find one that lets you change what you want. I use <a href="https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum">Kvantum</a> personally. I can’t seem to find a setting in its configuration to change scrollbar width, but I <em>can</em> disable scrollbar disappearing (which it calls “Transient scrollbars”) so that’s nice.</p>

<p>Anyways, I tried out <a href="https://github.com/atolstoy/skulpture">Skulpture</a> like the reddit person recommended and it seems kinda cool, give it a try! I can’t figure out a way to configure it with a GUI though without using KDE Plasma though. No shade on Plasma, I just don’t have it installed right now to try it out, but maybe if you’re a plasma user it’ll be good for you.</p>

<p>Still, if our only hope is this one theme engine that may or may not keep working as Qt development continues, I can’t help but feel like the war is being lost.</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>

<p>Firefox has also joined the war on scrollbars it seems, with an incredibly tiny scrollbar on the side of my screen. Thankfully, Firefox is at least fixable (for now…), but you have to go into <code>about:config</code> to do it which is never a great sign. HOWEVER, you CAN do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type in <code>about:config</code> in your address bar</li>
  <li>Search for <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override</code></li>
  <li>Edit it to whatever number you want</li>
  <li>You can also edit <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style</code> to change the shape of it, set it to <code>4</code> for a nice chonk rectangle</li>
  <li>Finally, turn on “Always show scrollbars” in the normal settings window <code>about:settings</code> if you want them always on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I set the size to 50. I don’t want it this big myself but by goly am I glad I can make it this big anyway. Behold, scrollbar glory:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/glory-fs8.png" alt="the scrollbar is HUGE"></p>

<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>

<p>Imagine being able to configure anything useful in chrome ever.</p>

<h3 id="electron">Electron</h3>

<p>For that matter, imagine configuring an <strong>Electron app</strong>. Couldn’t be me. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe you can inject some custom CSS into the electron app to fix things up? Honestly if you have solutions for Chrome or Electron please tell me because I have no idea.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-more">THERE ARE MORE</h3>

<p>Look these are just the ones I encounter regularly, but all of these so-called “modern design principles” seem to be in a war against scrollbars and everyone that uses computers slightly different from the people implementing this are suffering as a consequence. Shit sucks yo!</p>

<h2 id="the-best">The Best</h2>

<p>OK you know what rules though? You know what I love, what my friend who uses eye trackers loves, what my friends who use tablet pens love? MINIMAPS</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/minimap-fs8.png" alt="big rectangle with content"></p>

<p>YEAH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I can <em>see the content</em>. I can <em>click the content</em>. I can <em>go to the content</em>. And the hit target is <em>massive</em>. What more could a girl want?</p>

<p>Pricing across all retailers, both online only or offline + online, is instantly available. The only way to compete is on your listed value adds. </p>

<p>They have already trained much of their customer base that they <em>will</em> try to compete on price by having constant sales. </p>

<p>But adding the above benefits costs money and will cut into profit margins that online only stores don't have to deal with. So you have to then compete on volume, by building loyalty via those above means and doing it really well... it seems like they are trying to nickel and dime their way out of providing that level of quality, putting them into a tough spot.</p>

<p>Unions are about giving employees a seat at the table. The absolute only reason companies don't want their employees to organize is because very few will actually stand up for themselves. The ones that do are easily eliminated. It's much more difficult for them to do that to a whole bargaining unit.</p>

<p>Don't let them fool you into believing they can't afford to pay employees better or give them better benefits. They absolutely can. They just want to see those profits increase more and more.</p>

No, no... You will be, just not as much as you want to be. Like, REI literally broke profitability records in 2022. Let's throw a number of like.. 2 million total made for the year. So for 2023, they say "we want to make 3 million this year!" and they only make 2.5 million, suddenly we've fallen "short". I'd love to actually see their numbers. </p>

<p>I'm interested to see how much longer they're going to be willing to give members the whole 10% reward. I give it two or three years <em>max</em> before it gets the chop.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm sure no one on the board was cut, or got any sort of paycuts. If they keep chopping at the roots, their tree is going to topple much faster than they're expecting.</p>

<p>Since I left the full time a while ago the knowledge I have has been underutilized, but the customers who want it, seek me out!</p>

<p>for REI it is a business model. I am curious to see how it ends. </p>

<p>My guess is that they will sell us or we will acquire someone else and we will become them.</p>

<p>Ha ha! I had a man come in with a return of an osprey exos… he had the large/extra large and his torso was a 17… strike one… Then I asked him as I fit him into other packs, (after measuring him) what was his base weight. I was specific and said, no food or water, just the stuff you normally bring. He said 35lbs… strike 2 for the Exos… and lastly he was a large man around. A 46 inch waist and the osprey was never designed for that body type… 5’6” 300 lbs and a 17 inch torso… strike 3. </p>

<p>He said he came in, but when I did the exchange it was an online order… almost all of his purchases were online and he was buying all sorts of stuff not suitable for where he says he had hiked.</p>

<p>by the time he left, we had him sorted out and he kept saying… I should have come in first! (Remember he told me that he had been in and fit for this pack)</p>

<p>my guess is that the return policy will become even stricter and mostly member based. That old timers like me will stick around because we are still conditioned to the old ways and like the customer interaction. And the new people will be less and less knowledgeable and more and more unskilled.</p>

<p>and pay will be flat for a long time, until they can make up for all the concessions that they have given in the past 6-7 years.</p>

<p>I haven’t, only because at REI they have been amazing with my time off requests. They also got me insurance when the ACA almost bankrupted my family… so in many ways… I am thinking I will be there until the current management leaves… or longer depending.
