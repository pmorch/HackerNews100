           <div><b>This article brought to you by LWN subscribers</b><p>Subscribers to LWN.net made this article — and everything that
       surrounds it — possible.  If you appreciate our content, please

           <p>
LWN.net is looking to hire a full-time writer/editor to help us keep the
news flowing and to expand our content in areas of interest to our readers.
We are certain that the person we need is out there somewhere, and are
counting on help from LWN readers to find them.  Read on for details on who
we are looking for and how we see them fitting in here.
</p><p>
LWN has always set an ambitious goal for itself: making what is happening
in the Linux and free-software-development communities clear and
understandable to those who are a part of it in any way — or who would like
to be.  It is a far bigger job than even a larger LWN could do, but we do
the best that we can.  To do better, we need more people with the energy
and desire to pick up part of the load.  Fortunately, we are in a position
where we can bring in such a person full time.
</p><p>
The ideal LWN writer is immersed in the free-software world and has a wide
view of what is happening within it.  They want to be learning constantly
and are interested in going out into the development community.  We are
looking for somebody who is enthusiastic about communicating what they
learn to a wide audience, part of which knows more about the material at
hand regardless of the specific subject matter.  Preferably, they would
like to broaden our coverage in an adjacent area: Rust, Android,
toolchains, distributions, security, or any of a number of other
possibilities.  Ideally, they would want to go beyond just writing and take
an active role in directing LWN's future.
</p><p>
The full job description appears below.
</p><blockquote>
<h4>LWN writer/editor</h4>
<p>
LWN.net is seeking a full-time technical journalist to provide high-quality
coverage of the Linux and free-software communities for our readers.  This
is an opportunity to be a part of a community that has changed the world
and is far from finished.  LWN has been covering this community from within
since 1998.
</p><p>
Responsibilities will include finding and researching topics, writing
articles on a regular schedule, reviewing articles written by others,
interacting with readers, and traveling to and reporting from community
events.  Additionally, we all take part in the tasks of running the
business and making important decisions about where we are trying to go.
</p><p>
Requirements include:
</p><ul>
<li> A university degree in technical writing, engineering, or the sciences,
   or equivalent experience.

</li><li> Excellent English writing and editing skills.

</li><li> The willingness and ability to work remotely full-time.

</li><li> An understanding of free software and the communities that create it.

</li><li> A willingness to take on a wide range of challenges in a small-company
   environment.
</li></ul>
<p>
We would also like to see:
</p><ul>
<li> A demonstrated history of writing for a highly technical audience.

</li><li> Software development experience, especially in the form of contribution
   to one or more free-software projects.

</li><li> Experience with web technologies and web-site design.

</li><li> Python development experience.

</li><li> An interest in traveling to attend conferences and other community
     events. 
</li></ul>
<p>
LWN is located in Colorado, in the US.  For candidates within the US, we
are offering a salary range of $70,000 to $140,000 per year, health
insurance, and a 5% 401(k) match.  We are happy to consider applications
from outside of the US as well; in such a case, salary and benefits will be
dependent on what we are able to arrange in the specific location.
</p><p>
To apply for this position, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editorjob@lwn.net"><tt>editorjob@lwn.net</tt></a> and tell us
about the topic areas you would be most interested in covering.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Finding this person is crucial to the long-term future of LWN; we have been
understaffed for some time, and that is making itself felt.  So we are
asking all LWN readers to think about whose words they would like to read
on these pages.  If you know somebody who might make a good candidate,
please direct their attention this way and encourage them to apply.<br clear="all"></p><hr><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        

        

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I need to vent about the impolite piece of yet-to-become e-waste on wheels that is <strong>my rude-ass car</strong>. You've heard versions of this story before, nothing is particularly novel in the shock department, enshittification is everywhere, etcetera... but I need the catharsis.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>I knew car software was bad, but I only realized how bad it was once I got some first-hand experience. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-want-in-a-car">What I want in a car</h2>
<p>For a car, I want a means to transport kids and their associated heaps of stuff around in a safe and relaxed manner. Some functional wheeled metal cage to participate in the joys of fucking over the climate at 100 km per hour. I don't even want my car to go fast anymore because I'm too sleep deprived to enjoy the experience anyway, and gas is not getting any cheaper.</p>
<p>You turn the key, the car comes alive to help you whatever needs done. Maybe rev that 0.9 liter econobox engine for the hell of it, but then quickly shift it into gear, subdue your hi-torque dreams of smoking rubber for another day, and drive off. Utilitarian, sensible. A functional, trustworthy tool that doesn't get in your way.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-experience">The actual experience</h2>
<p>To my chagrin, the actual experience of driving my recently manufactured car is one of incessant, pointless whining. Operating this machine is like visiting the average news website. At every turn, rude-ass automotive software you didn't ask for clamors for your attention.</p>
<h4 id="unlocking-the-doors">Unlocking the doors</h4>
<p>Use your remote to unlock the doors? Better not be encumbered by groceries, screaming kids or other luggage because if you don't open the doors within 15 seconds of unlocking, they close again. Presumably this is done for my own benefit, as everyone knows that leaving a car unlocked for more than a minute immediately invites thieves to come feast on the crumbs of rice crackers littering the back seat.</p>
<h4 id="closing-the-trunk">Closing the trunk</h4>
<p>Did you put stuff in the trunk? Press a button and it  will attempt to close itself (at a glacial pace). I say 'attempt', because if there is any item placed within 50 cm of the edge of the trunk, it will loudly complain and open again at a significantly brisker pace (so it could move faster when closing, it just won't). What problem is this solving exactly? Me waving my arm up and down to close the trunk? What was a 1 second operation now takes at least 10 seconds, and often a lot of angry beeping.</p>
<h4 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h4>
<p><em>DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!</em></p>
<p>Six obnoxiously loud gong-like sounds reverberate through the interior of your car upon pressing the 'start/stop engine' button. But, only if you put it in neutral first, refrain from even thinking about touching the accelerator pedal, and fully depress the clutch (even though you just put it in fucking neutral)</p>
<h4 id="using-your-turn-signals">Using your turn signals</h4>
<p>Conveniently, the outside mirrors have a little orange dot indicating cars in your blind spot. Less conveniently is the additional auditory feedback that - you guessed it - whines its warnings at you when you use your turn signals to change lanes when there is someone nearby. I get why this exists, I see the utility and I can even force myself to feel unbothered by the ridiculously high sensitivity.</p>
<p>However. If you're at a traffic light, in the rightmost lane with two lanes turning left, of course the demented tamagotchi on wheels thinks you are about to sideswipe the car to your left. Because this pisses me off so badly, I've taken to not using turn signals in such cases, to avoid triggering this "feature".</p>
<h4 id="coming-to-a-full-stop">Coming to a full stop</h4>
<p>There's a lane keeping assistant, which understandably enough wants you to keep touching the steering wheel. If you bring the vehicle to a full stop with the lane keeper on, it will still demand that you wiggle the steering wheel to signal that you aren't suddenly taking a nap or changing someones diaper in the back seat. Traffic jam? Traffic light? Parking your car somewhere? <em>DING! DING! DING!</em></p>
<h4 id="the-goddamn-tires-themselves">The goddamn tires themselves</h4>
<p>This must be a simple mechanical defect with my car but the tire pressure sensors trigger after prolonged (&gt; 1 hr) driving at high speeds (~ 130 km/hr). It complains about low tire pressure, and invariably when I measure them, they're just fine.</p>
<h4 id="getting-out-of-this-physical-incarnation-of-an-aliexpress-storefront">Getting out of this physical incarnation of an AliExpress storefront</h4>
<p>You arrive at your destination, blood pressure off the chart, an angry vein throbbing in your neck. You open the door. <em>DING DING DING!</em> ENGINE STILL RUNNING! <em>DING DING!</em> DID YOU LEAVE ANYTHING IN THE BACK SEAT! <em>DING!</em> DON'T FORGET YOUR PHONE!</p>
<h2 id="can-it-really-be-that-bad">Can it really be that bad?</h2>
<p>Just typing this makes my blood boil. I realize I haven't even touched upon emergency evasive movements. A slow car swerves across lanes, ending up front of you? You want to pull on the steering wheel to avoid a collision? Well fuck you because now you have to fight the lane keeping assistant because how dare you get out of your lane without first signaling your "I have 0.67 seconds to move or else my license plate gets replaced by an entire Renault Twingo" action.  </p>
<h2 id="youre-being-histrionic">You're being histrionic.</h2>
<p>The infotainment unit is surprisingly good. </p>
<p>Save for the fact that in the past year, it has asked me to accept four different, updated versions of the Terms and Conditions. I'd gladly just click the button that means "whatever" because, you know, who has the energy to care about the next adtech grifter selling your butt's temperature profile to 721 interested third parties? But out of sheer spite and loathing, instead I keep hammering the one that says "don't accept for now, but keep nagging me forever until I accidentally click on the other button". At least I'm familiar with <em>this</em> particular enshittified experience from interacting with other, non-automotive appliances.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit: for the record, this is about a Kia Ceed SW, but it's not that important because I'm sure 90% of all 2023 cars run on the CAN bus equivalent of a 10.000 line, 100 cell Jupyter Notebook that was last restarted in the fall of 2018.</p>

This, as app developer Zhenyi Tan <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/youtube-s-anti-adblock-and-ublock-origin?ref=404media.co">wrote in an excellent blog this week</a>, has had the effect of confusing people, who have flooded Reddit, social media, and ad block review sites with differing information, because certain versions of certain ad blockers continue to work for some people, but not others.&nbsp;</p><p>AdGuard cofounder Andrey Meshkov told 404 Media that what YouTube is doing is “technically, nothing too special compared to what we've seen in the past from others. The difference is the scale. YouTube is huge and video ads are especially annoying, this is what makes this case interesting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Generally speaking, they're employing a standard adblock wall tactic: try to detect an ad blocker and if it is detected, show a popup that prompts users to disable their ad blocker,” he added. “There are several versions of these pop-ups, their testing is clearly still in-progress. However, the share of affected users is growing so we can safely assume that eventually they're going to launch it for all YouTube users.”</p>

<p>YouTube’s ever-changing ad block detector scripts, which have become so sensitive as to detect certain pieces of privacy-protecting software that are not actually adblockers, are facing a privacy complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Committee (DPC), <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/privacy_advocate_challenges_youtube/?ref=404media.co">The Register reported last week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>The use of ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service. We’ve launched a global effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14129599?ref=404media.co">allow ads on YouTube</a> or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience,” a YouTube spokesperson told 404 Media. “Ads support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube. We will of course cooperate fully with any questions or queries from the DPC.”</p><p>YouTube added that it has started putting these popups to inform viewers about its terms of service, and said it would only disable playback if users ignore repeated requests to allow ads on YouTube.</p><p>Meanwhile, every major adblocker and its user base has started to talk almost exclusively about YouTube’s escalations, and have been working on mitigations to stay one step ahead. The ad block saga has also become the main topic of conversation on the YouTube subreddit and a popular topic on YouTube itself. The uBlock Origin team has been updating a “filter” that evades detection from YouTube and posting mega threads about the situation on its subreddit every couple days, the latest of which notes that “YouTube changes their detection scripts twice a day, which means that even if you got a filter update earlier today, another one might be required soon. There’s no way around this if you want to remain logged in.”</p><p>Users of uBlock Origin created a website that <a href="https://drhyperion451.github.io/does-uBO-bypass-yt/?ref=404media.co">tracks the state of the adblock war</a>, called “Is uBlock updated to the last Anti-Adblocker YouTube script? YES or NO”</p><div><p>🫥</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about Google's relationship with ad blockers? I would love to hear from you.

The developers of the software also wrote lengthy instructions on how to make sure the software continues to work on YouTube, are troubleshooting for individual users in Reddit comments, and are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17j6ygs/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_october_29_2023_mega/?ref=404media.co">providing detailed information</a> about the steps YouTube has been taking to try to stop their software from working.</p><p>At the moment, uBlock Origin seems to be putting up the strongest fight against Google’s ad blocker detectors, which is particularly notable considering that the software is currently being updated on GitHub by exactly two people (though more people are handling customer service), and Google is one of the largest companies in the world. Even more impressive, uBlock Origin has no funding of any sort and as a rule does not even accept donations from its users. Members of the uBlock Origin team told me that they do not want to speak to the press about “such a sensitive topic,” and that all communication about the issue will be done publicly on its GitHub or on Reddit.</p><p>AdGuard is another major adblocker that <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases?ref=404media.co">updated its software</a> to evade YouTube’s detectors, and said in a blog post that YouTube is waging a “war against ad blockers.”</p><p>“YouTube’s plan to purge ad blocking users from its platform will not go down well with either users or ad blockers, who will undoubtedly push back,” AdGuard wrote <a href="https://adguard.com/en/blog/ad-blockers-youtube-ban.html?ref=404media.co">in a blog post</a>. “As YouTube widens up its crackdown, ad blocker developers won’t sit idly by, but will try to come up with solutions that would allow them to evade YouTube’s detection — a process that might take some time.”</p><blockquote>Google has its hands on quite literally every aspect of this entire saga as a vertically integrated adtech giant. Most adblockers are browser extensions that are most widely used on Chrome, which is a Google product and the most popular browser in the world. They are being used to block ads sold by Google, the largest ad company in the world. And they are specifically being used to block ads on YouTube, a Google-owned website that is also one of the largest websites on Earth.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Meshkov said that AdGuard’s paid, network-level filtering product has not been affected, but its free browser extension has been. “Browser extensions are also capable of mitigating the issue, but YouTube constantly changes their detection algorithm and there still will be a period of time when the users will see that adblock wall pop-up as filters maintainers need time to figure out the new algorithm.”</p><p>Ghostery has <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads?ref=404media.co">also written blog posts about the problem</a>, and how they are addressing it (by working to update their software, basically). Stephen Ray, a mod on the Brave browser forums (but not a Brave employee), told users <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/psa-youtube-adblock-detection/510337?ref=404media.co">in a Brave community note</a>: “Every web browser and adblock is encountering this message. Nobody will be immune. That said, Brave is keeping up and slightly ahead. Switching to Firefox, Vivaldi, or whatever else won’t save you. Neither will using uBlock Origin, AdBlock, Undetectable Adblocker, or any of the bunch of things out there.”</p><p>This brings me, I think, to the elephant in the room, which is the fact that Google has its hands on quite literally every aspect of this entire saga as a vertically integrated adtech giant. Most adblockers are browser extensions that are most widely used on Chrome, which is a Google product and the most popular browser in the world. They are being used to block ads sold by Google, the largest ad company in the world. And they are specifically being used to block ads on YouTube, a Google-owned website that is also one of the largest websites on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Adblock software can be distributed outside of the Chrome Web Store, but the fact remains that Google can and does ban specific extensions and classes of extensions from the Chrome Web Store (cryptomining extensions are banned, for example). There was some protracted worry about something called Manifest V3, which is a framework for how extensions function on Chrome.&nbsp;</p><p>Major adblocking companies and software developers <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/manifest-v3-the-ghostery-perspective?ref=404media.co">said that Manifest V3</a> would make it harder for their extensions to function and would restrict their capabilities, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening?ref=404media.co">Electronic Frontier Foundation called it</a> “another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.” Full rollout of Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1eIaRuy7w&amp;ref=404media.co">has been delayed indefinitely</a>, Google said earlier this month.</p><p>This extreme power over the adtech and online advertising ecosystem is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies?ref=404media.co">one of the subjects of an FTC antitrust</a> suit against Google.&nbsp;</p><p>Google’s influence over the adblocking industry (not just the advertising industry) is <a href="https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/google-undermines-adblock/?ref=404media.co">controversial</a> among ad block developers.&nbsp;</p><p>Google <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-saved-an-estimated-887-million-by-paying-adblock-plus-to-show-its-ads-2013-8?ref=404media.co">famously paid AdBlock Plus</a> to serve ads to its users, and AdBlock Plus has experimented with “<a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/google-ends-partnership-adblock-plus-partner-acceptable-ads-marketplace-173485/?ref=404media.co">acceptable ads</a>” to deliver to its users. AdBlock Plus’s parent company, Eyeo, just <a href="https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/public/-NXuG6IckpLeVt7jyeIm?ref=404media.co">threw the Ad Filtering Dev Summit</a>, a conference about ad blocking. Google was one of the sponsors.&nbsp;</p><p>Adblock Plus, meanwhile, wrote <a href="https://blog.adblockplus.org/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads?ref=404media.co">a blog about the problem</a> and the first words on its <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb/related?ref=404media.co">Chrome Store description</a> is “Block YouTube ads.”&nbsp;</p><p>“YouTube’s walls are particularly distressing to many of our users,” Adblock Plus wrote. “While we don’t have a solution to implement at the moment, our teams are working hard to figure out what we can do in light of these changes. We certainly haven’t given up the fight against anti-ad blocking!”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"Who will win? I don't know. YouTube certainly has the capability and resources for that, but on the other hand we've seen the example of Facebook trying to circumvent ad blocking and they gave up in the end despite also having unlimited resources.”</blockquote><p>An Eyeo spokesperson told 404 Media, however, that for them, it’s less of a fight and more of a negotiation: “Eyeo has currently been witnessing what appears to be a series of tests with different cohorts rather than YouTube making a sweeping change. As always, we are interested in finding a middle ground that's user-centric, where people regain control over their experience, but also allows content creators and publishers to get rewarded for their content. We are talking to all the different parties involved and hope to have updates to share with users soon.”&nbsp;</p><p>So, how does this end up? It depends on how much Google actually cares about this issue. Early indications are that it cares a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>“Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet here,” AdGuard’s Meshkov said. “It all depends on the resources that YouTube is ready to invest. Both YouTube and filters maintainers will try to keep up with each other's pace. We should also not forget that there will be collateral damage (different other extensions like privacy badger, browsers like Brave, etc.) so for the YouTube side minimizing this collateral damage will be rather expensive. Who will win? I don't know. YouTube certainly has the capability and resources for that, but on the other hand we've seen the example of Facebook trying to circumvent ad blocking and they gave up in the end despite also having unlimited resources.”</p>

Cosmopolitan Honeybadger
</p>

<p>
After nearly one year of development, I'm pleased to announce our
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases/tag/3.0.1">version
3.0.1</a> release of the Cosmopolitan library. The project is an
entirely new animal. For starters, Mozilla sponsored our work as part of
their <a href="https://future.mozilla.org/mieco/">MIECO program</a>.
Google also
<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/05/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program-announces-first-group-of-winners-2023.html">awarded
me an open source peer bonus</a> for my work on Cosmopolitan, which is a
rare honor, and it's nice to see our project listed up there among the
greats, e.g. curl, linux, etc. In terms of this release, we're living up
to the great expectations you've all held for this project in a number
of ways. The first is we invented a new linker that lets you build fat
binaries which can run on these platforms:

</p><ul>
  <li>AMD64
    <ul>
      <li>Linux
      </li><li>MacOS
      </li><li>Windows
      </li><li>FreeBSD
      </li><li>OpenBSD
      </li><li>NetBSD
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>ARM64
    <ul>
      <li>Linux
      </li><li>MacOS
      </li><li>Windows (non-native)
    </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
It's called
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/tool/build/apelink.c">apelink.c</a>
and it's a fine piece of poetry that weaves together the Portable
Executable, ELF, Mach-O, and PKZIP file formats into shell scripts that
run on most PCs and servers without needing to be installed. This is an
idea whose time has come; POSIX even changed their rules about binary in
shell scripts specifically to let us do it. So we've been using it to
create a "Fat Linux Distro" which I've named the "Cosmos". In the
Cosmos, every program is statically linked and contains a PKZIP central
directory where its /usr/share dependencies are embedded. You can think
of it as a coalition of individualistic executables, where each program
can be separated from the whole and run on other OSes. So far it
includes programs like Emacs, Vim, CoreUtils, Curl, Git, etc.

This only became possible in the last few months, in part thanks to
Gautham Venkatasubramanian, who spent a few weekends of his PhD studies
<a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2023/07/13/patching-gcc-cosmo/">modifying
the C language</a> so it's possible to build conventional software with
Cosmopolitan. Since then it's been out of the frying pan and into the
fire, testing our library to see if it can support some of the most
complex and mature projects in the open source community. Running the
<code>./configure</code> scripts and <code>make check</code> rules of
projects (e.g. GMP) has done so much to help us fix bugs and battle test
new features.

</p><h2 id="overview">
  <a href="#overview">Build Once Anywhere, Run Anywhere C/C++</a>
</h2>

<p>
One of the things we're most happy with, is that Cosmo's cross platform
support is now good enough to support Cosmo development. We've
traditionally only compiled code on x86 Linux. Devs using Cosmo would
build their programs on Linux, and then copy the binaries to other OSes.
Focusing on Linux-only helped us gain considerable velocity at the start
of the project; the Cosmopolitan monorepo has two million lines of code.
Today was the first day the whole thing compiled on Apple Silicon and
Microsoft Windows systems, and using Cosmo-built tools.

</p><h3>Windows Improvements</h3>

<p>
In order to get programs like GNU Make and Emacs to work on Windows, we
implemented <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/libc/calls/sig.c">new
libraries for POSIX signals emulation</a>. Cosmopolitan is now able to
preempt i/o and deliver asynchronous signals on Windows, using
a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/libc/calls/sig.c#L316-L375"><code>SetThreadContext()</code>
trick</a> I learned from the Go developers. Cosmo does a considerably
better
job <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/libc/calls/ntspawn.c">spawning
processes</a> now too. For example, we wrote
a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/libc/proc/posix_spawn.c">brand
new <code>posix_spawn()</code> function</a> that
goes <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/cygwin-comparison.txt">10x faster</a> than
the <code>posix_spawn()</code> included with Cygwin.
Cosmo's <code>execve()</code> can now reparent
subprocesses, <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/libc/proc/describefds.c">inherit
non-stdio file descriptor</a>, and
our <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/libc/calls/read-nt.c"><code>read()</code>
function now contains a termios driver</a> which, for the first time,
lets us <code>poll()</code> standard input on consoles. Cosmo binaries
cleanly integrate with WIN32, depending pretty much only on KERNEL32,
and your fat binaries won't have to live on a separate partition like
WSL.

</p><h3>MacOS Improvements</h3>

<p>
While MacOS may not be the prodigal child of our support vector, this
release brings improvements to MacOS users that are equally important.
For starters, we now have first-class native ARM64
support. <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/ape/ape-m1.c">APE
Loader</a> also now dynamically links the officially blessed Apple
libraries (e.g. libSystem.dylib) on ARM64, so there's less chance that
Apple will break your binaries. We've also
made <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/third_party/nsync/mu_semaphore_gcd.c">semaphores</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/third_party/nsync/futex.c">futexes</a>
much better on XNU, thanks to Grand Central Dispatch, and ulock on
AMD64.

</p><h3>Portability and Performance (Pick Two)</h3>

<p>
The end result is that if you switch your Linux build process to
use <code>cosmocc</code> instead of <code>cc</code> then the programs
you build, e.g. Bash and Emacs, will just work on the command prompts of
totally different platforms like Windows and MacOS, and when you run
your programs there, it'll <em>feel</em> like you're on Linux. However
portability isn't the only selling point. Cosmo Libc will make your
software faster and use less memory too. For example, when I build Emacs
using the cosmocc toolchain, Emacs thinks it's building for Linux. Then,
when I run it on Windows:

</p><p>
<img width="898" height="558" alt="[fat-emacs.png]" src="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/fat-emacs.png">

</p><p>
It actually goes 2x faster than the native WIN32 port that the Emacs
authors wrote on their own. Cosmo Emacs loads my dotfiles in 1.2 seconds
whereas GNU Emacs on Windows loads them in 2.3 seconds. Many years ago
when I started this project, I had this unproven belief that portability
toil could be abstracted by having a better C library. Now I think this
is all the proof we need that it's not only possible to make software
instantly portable, but actually <em>better</em> too. For example, one
of the things you may be wondering is, "these fat binary files are huge,
wouldn't that waste memory?" The answer is no, because Cosmo only pages
into memory the parts of the executable you need. Take for example one
of Linux's greatest hits: the Debian Almquist shell.

</p><pre>$ ls -hal /usr/bin/dash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root <strong>107K</strong> Nov 21  2022 /usr/bin/dash
$ ls -hal /opt/cosmos/bin/dash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jart jart <strong>983K</strong> Oct 15 19:14 /opt/cosmos/bin/dash
</pre>

<p>
Here we see Cosmo's six OS + two architecture fat binary dash is 30%
bigger than the one that comes with Alpine Linux (which only supports
x86-Linux and dynamically links a separate 600kb Musl library). But if I
run them:

</p><pre>$ rusage /usr/bin/dash -c true
took 231µs wall time
ballooned to <strong>688kb</strong> in size
needed 183us cpu (0% kernel)
caused 34 page faults (100% memcpy)

$ rusage /opt/cosmos/bin/dash -c true
took 217µs wall time
ballooned to <strong>544kb</strong> in size
needed 172us cpu (0% kernel)
caused 36 page faults (100% memcpy)
</pre>

<p>
Here we see Cosmo's fat binary version of dash went faster and used less
memory than an x86-Linux-only binary built for Musl Libc. This is due to
(1) the magic of modern memory management, where CPU MMUs lazily load
4096 byte blocks at a time; and (2) how carefully <code>apelink</code>
plans your executable layout. For example, all that code which is needed
to support Windows (it takes a lot of code to support Windows) gets
linked into its own special section of the binary, far away from what
the MMU will want to page on UNIX systems. The same goes for the
embedded ARM64 build. Since I'm running on AMD64 here, the ARM64 code is
never loaded off disk.

<p>
You no longer need to choose between the amalgamation release or the
cosmo monorepo. We now have a third preferred option, which is our
new <code>cosmocc</code> command. It works pretty much the same as
the <code>cc</code> command you already know. The Cosmopolitan README
file
has <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan#getting-started">getting
started</a> instructions, which basically boil down to this:

</p><pre>sudo mkdir -p /opt
sudo chmod 1777 /opt
git clone https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan /opt/cosmo
export PATH=<span>"/opt/cosmo/bin:/opt/cosmos/bin:$PATH"</span>
echo <span>'PATH="/opt/cosmo/bin:/opt/cosmos/bin:$PATH"'</span> &gt;&gt;~/.profile
ape-install        <span># optionally install a faster systemwide ape loader</span>
cosmocc --update   <span># pull cosmo and rebuild toolchain</span>
</pre>

<p>
If your development environment isn't x86_64 Linux, then you'll need to
download the latest toolchain, rather than using the one that's vendored
inside the cosmo repository.

</p><pre>cd /opt/cosmo
rm -rf o/third_party/gcc
wget https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases/download/3.0.1/cosmocc-0.0.16.zip
unzip cosmocc-0.0.16.zip
</pre>

<p>
If you're on Windows, then you need a shell before you can do any of the
above. If you download the cosmos.zip file at the top of the page, it'll
have a bin/ and libexec/ folder. Just extract those to
your <code>C:\</code> drive. Then
install <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/windows-terminal-preview/9N8G5RFZ9XK3?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">Terminal
Preview</a> from the Microsoft Store, and configure it so that it
launches <code>C:\bin\bash -l</code> as your shell. You'll naturally
need a good unzip program in order to do this: one that supports
symbolic links (a.k.a. reparse points). The cosmos zip includes InfoZIP,
but you can download it directly
here: <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/unzip.exe">unzip.exe</a>.

</p><p>
Now that your cosmo compiler is installed and added to
your <code>$PATH</code>, you can build standard C and C++ programs as
follows:

</p><pre>cosmocc -o foo foo.c
cosmoc++ -o bar bar.cc
</pre>

<p>
If you want to build programs as fat binaries, there's a special
compiler now which can make the process easier than using the
<code>x86_64-unknown-cosmo-cc</code>, <code>aarch64-unknown-cosmo-cc</code>, <code>fixupobj</code>,
and <code>apelink</code> commands directly. This compiler works by
manipulating your compiler flags so that a
concomitant <code>.aarch64/foo.o</code> gets created for
every <code>foo.o</code> you compile. It runs the x86_64 and aarch64
compilers in parallel too, so it doesn't go much slower
than <code>cosmocc</code> at the end of the day.

</p><pre>fatcosmocc -o foo foo.c
fatcosmoc++ -o bar bar.cc
</pre>

<p>
Integrating with GNU Autotools projects is easy as well.

</p><pre><span>export</span> CC=cosmocc
<span>export</span> CXX=cosmoc++
./configure --prefix=/opt/cosmos
make -j
make install
</pre>

  <a href="#web">Production Web Servers</a>
</h2>

<p>
This cosmos release includes the latest version of
the <a href="https://redbean.dev/">redbean web server</a>. This is a fat
single-file forking Lua+SQLite+MbedTLS stack written by the Cosmopolitan
authors originally to showcase the capabilities of the library for
greenfield development. Cosmopolitan is good for more than just building
old GNU code and redbean proves that. It's
the <a href="https://bestofshowhn.com/">third most upvoted</a> hobby
project in Hacker News history. A few weeks ago Berwyn
Hoyt <a href="https://berwyn.hashnode.dev/update-openresty-vs-lua-54-a-benchmark">independently
determined</a> it to be the fastest Lua web server too!

</p><p>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/redbean-benchmark.png"><img width="600" height="359" alt="[redbean-benchmark.png]" src="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/redbean-benchmark.png"></a>

</p><p>
One of the reasons why redbean is a forking web server is because we
didn't develop our own
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/3.0/libc/thread">POSIX
Threads implementation</a> until last year. So we put a lot of thought
into writing an example of how you can build a bare minimal threaded web
server that's <em>even faster</em> than redbean, and it's called
greenbean. There's a prebuilt fat binary for it in the cosmos.zip
distribution above. Greenbean is
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/examples/greenbean.c">400
lines of liberally commented perfection</a>. I still can't believe how
good we got its memory usage, thanks to tricks
like <code>MAP_GROWSDOWN</code>. On Linux, if I ask greenbean to spawn
over 9,000 persistent worker threads:

</p><pre>$ sudo prlimit --pid=$$ --nofile=18000
$ sudo prlimit --pid=$$ --nproc=18000
$ rusage greenbean 9001
listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
listening on http://10.10.10.237:8080
greenbean workers=0 connections=0 messages=0 ^C shutting down...
took 7,959,324µs wall time
ballooned to <strong>40,352kb</strong> in size
needed 929,917us cpu (92% kernel)
caused 10,039 page faults (100% memcpy)
54,689 context switches (99% consensual)
</pre>

<p>
Then it somehow only uses 40mb of peak resident memory, and according to
htop, greenbean's virtual memory usage is 76,652kb. That's for 9,001
threads. Like redbean, greenbean is able to handle hundreds of thousands
of requests per second on my Intel Core i9-9900, except (1) greenbean
has better shared memory support, (2) it sets up and tears down
connections faster, and (3) it lets you experience the joy of using Mike
Burrows' <a href="https://github.com/google/nsync">*NSYNC</a> library,
which is the basis of Cosmopolitan's POSIX synchronization primitives.
If you're not familiar with the man, he's the guy who coded Chubby and
Altavista, a global search engine which was so efficient it only needed
to operate on a single server. But you wouldn't think *NSYNC is as
prolific as it is if you're only going off star count.

</p><p>
My favorite thing about greenbean is how elegantly it reacts to CTRL-C.
When you interrupt greenbean, it'll use the POSIX pthread_cancel() API
to immediately terminate all the worker threads, so that shutdown
happens without delay. Cancelation is one of the trickier concepts for a
C library to get right. It's up there with threads, signals, and fork in
terms of how its ramifications pervade everything. So similar to Musl
Libc, we've put a lot of thought into ensuring that Cosmo does it
correctly. Cosmo avoids cancelation race conditions the same way as Musl
and Cosmo also implements Musl's <code>PTHREAD_CANCEL_MASKED</code>
extension to the POSIX standard, which has seriously got to be one of
Rich Felker's most brilliant ideas. Read the commentary in greenbean.c
if you want to learn more.

</p><p>
Some of you might view greenbean as just a toy example. In that case, if
you want to see something based on greenbean that is actually running in
production, then pay a visit
to <a href="https://ipv4.games/">https://ipv4.games/</a> whose source
code is
in <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/net/turfwar/turfwar.c">net/turfwar/turfwar.c</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/3.0/net/turfwar/.init.lua">net/turfwar/.init.lua</a>.
This is a hybrid redbean + greenbean service, where redbean does the
HTTPS frontend, and greenbean does the HTTP backend. Hackers love to
unleash their botnets on the IPv4 Games, and it honestly isn't that hard
to withstand a DDOS with 49,131,669 IPs when your web server can do a
million requests per second. That's for a service where 99% of the
requests are <em>write requests</em>. If you want to have fun with this
server, then you're also welcome to check out

</h2>

<p>
This cosmos.zip release includes several games you can play which have
been vetted on all our supported platforms. For example you can actually
play Nintendo in the terminal and it'll even work inside the Windows 10
command prompt. Getting poll(stdin) to work in Windows is a messier
problem than even naming or cache invalidation, so it's super sweet that
Cosmopolitan Third Edition is now able to abstract that complexity.
Although in the case of our port of Bisqwit's fabulous NESEMU1 program,
it turned out we didn't need poll() at all! Just calling read() and
letting it be <code>EINTR</code>'d by <code>setitimer()</code> sixty
times a second to pipe audio did the trick. So playing these games
helped battle test our new signals implementation too.

We may not have GUI support yet, but you can use your mouse in the
terminal. On Windows, your mouse cursor will generate the same ANSI
XTERM style control codes as it does on Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc. Try
running the <code>life</code> program that's included in Cosmos. Left
click draws cells. Space runs an iteration of the life game. Right click
can drag the display. You can also ctrl+wheel to zoom the display in and
out. To read the source code to this simple program, check

Boulder startup dylibso just announced a few weeks ago that they've
adopted Cosmopolitan for their new
product <a href="https://dylibso.com/blog/hermit-actually-portable-wasm/">Hermit:
Actually Portable Wasm</a>. Hermit lets you create secure cross-platform
executables for WebAssembly modules. It's worth a try! Cosmopolitan has
a long history of serving the needs of the Wasm community. Our first
major adopter back in early 2021 was actually
the <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">wasm3 project</a> which
provides a similarly great solution to running Wasm outside the browser.
I'm happy to see these projects benefiting from the advantages
Cosmopolitan has to offer. Will you be the next adopter? If so, feel
free to reach out to me personally and I'll see what I can do to help

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Asahi Linux, a project to port Linux to Apple Silicon Macs, has reported a combination of bugs in Apple's macOS that could leave users with hardware in a difficult-to-recover state.</p>
<p>The issues revolve around how recent versions of macOS handle refresh rates, and MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (the 14 and 16-inch versions) are affected. According to the Asahi team, the bugs lurk in the upgrade and boot process and, when combined, can create a condition where a machine always boots to a black screen, and a Device Firmware Update (DFU) recovery is needed.</p>
<p>Asahi Linux's techies have looked into the issue, having first suspected it had something to do with either having an Asahi Linux installation on a Mac and then upgrading to macOS Sonoma or installing Asahi Linux after a Sonoma upgrade. However, the issue appears to be unconnected to the project.</p>

    

<p>The team <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AsahiLinux/comments/17kjqlk/psa_do_not_upgrade_to_sonoma_do_not_install_on/">said</a>: "As far as we can tell, ALL users who upgraded to Sonoma the normal way have an out-of-date or even broken System RecoveryOS, and in particular MacBook Pro 14" and 16" owners are vulnerable to ending up with a completely unbootable system."</p>

        


        

<p>While this might sound alarming, the team <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/macOS-Sonoma-Boot-Failures">was at pains to assure users</a> that data was not at risk and only certain versions of macOS were affected – Sonoma 14.0+ and Ventura 13.6+.</p>
<p>The first bug is related to macOS Sonoma using the previously installed version as System Recovery, which can cause problems when an older RecoveryOS runs into newer firmware.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/26/linux_kernel_report_2023/">Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/fedora_new_installers/">Fedora and Asahi Linux pals revamp installation process</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/07/asahi_linux_partners_with_fedora/">Asahi Linux project hooks up with Fedora: Remix that's not a remix coming soon</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/17/asahi_linux_wayland_only/">Asahi Linux developer warns the one true way is Wayland</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second occurs if a display is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion. According to the Asahi Linux team, the system will no longer be able to boot into old macOS installs or Asahi Linux. "This includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, and also System Recovery at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade."</p>
<p>The Asahi Linux installer has been tweaked to check for the issue and will refuse to install if the refresh rate on affected machines is set to anything other than ProMotion mode. It will also perform an integrity check to verify the status of the System Recovery partition before making any changes.</p>

        

<p>The team noted: "Even users with just 13.6 installed single-boot are affected by this issue (no Asahi Linux needed).</p>
<p>"We do not understand how Apple managed to release an OS update that, when upgraded to normally, leaves machines unbootable if their display refresh rate is not the default. This seems to have been a major QA oversight by Apple."</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> contacted Apple to get its take on the report and will update should the company respond. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine this: You are accused of cheating in your job. But you are categorically NOT cheating. Nevertheless, you are fired. </p><p>This absolute horror scenario is what happened to writer Michael Berben (not his real name). Michael has been a freelancer for the past three years, contributed to many different publications, and written about 200 articles over the course of his career.</p><p>Michael reached out to us, and I’d like to share his story. Because what happened to Michael is probably happening to a lot of creative workers right now. And it will happen to many more in the future: questionable AI detectors are literally destroying people’s livelihoods.</p><h2 id="when-writers-become-collateral-damage">When writers become collateral damage</h2><p>Like many writers, Michael has followed the advent of ChatGPT with curiosity on the one hand, and worry on the other. Curious, because ChatGPT might be help writers create better articles. Worried, because what if ChatGPT could replace writers entirely in the future?</p><p>What he wasn’t worried about: That ChatGPT might be the reason for him to be accused of cheating. That, though, is exactly what happened.</p><p>One day, Michael's main client informed him that they had started to use an AI detector, and the results were supposedly damning for him: his most recent articles flagged a 95% likelihood of being AI generated. His client started to look at all of his previous articles, many written before ChatGPT was even widley available, and Michael was notified that all his articles showed a likelihood of being AI generated of 65-95%. They terminated his contract with immediate effect. A decision solely based on a single number (or range) that the AI detector spit out.</p><p>Michael tried whatever he could to prove his articles were not AI generated. He even gave his client access to the full Google Docs history and showed them his writing process and progress, all edits included. But the seed of doubt that the AI detector had sowed was too strong. Michael lost his main client, and with it most of his income.</p><p>A number of things are problematic with this story. And I’d like to go over them one by one:</p><h2 id="1-the-accuracy-of-general-ai-detectors-is-questionable">1. The accuracy of general AI detectors is questionable</h2><p>General AI detection is flawed. Period. It’s not like the detection works almost all the time and Michael's case is one of the few very unfortunate outliers. No, false positives are the norm when it comes to general AI detection.</p><p>Even OpenAI themselves stopped offering their very own detector for this reason:</p><blockquote><em><strong>"</strong>The<strong> </strong></em>AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy.<em><strong>" </strong>Open AI, creator of ChatGPT, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text">on their detection</a> </em></blockquote><p>Outliers happen because the writing style of a text is very hard to interpret, and it ultimately also does not say anything about whether an AI/LLM wrote the text or not. Sure, ChatGPT uses a certain style, but that can be easily changed with a bit of prompt engineering.</p><p>At the same time, a writer might just coincidentally have a writing style that is similar to ChatGPT, even though they do all the work manually. For those reasons alone, trying to detect AI-written content based on individual pieces is futile.</p><h2 id="2-ai-detectors-are-advertising-with-cherry-picked-numbers">2. AI detectors are advertising with cherry picked numbers</h2><p>Given general AI detection doesn’t work well, you might think that companies offering their services in that area would be cautious. The opposite appears to be the case. Here are various claims found on AI detector websites:</p><blockquote>“99% accuracy”</blockquote><blockquote>“99.1% accuracy”</blockquote><blockquote>“98% accuracy”</blockquote><p>How do they even come up with these numbers? At Authory, <a href="https://authory.com/blog/why-common-ai-detectors-fail-and-how-authorys-human-writer-certificate-is-different">we looked into AI detection ourselves </a>, and we concluded that trying to detect AI written content based on individual pieces does not work. So, how come others are confident to mention things like “99% accuracy”?</p><p>Well, as so often in life, it depends on what you are looking at exactly. If your data set is small enough — say 2,000 articles only — chances are high that it contains data that is very easy to distinguish from AI-written content. That could be due to topic, or due to a very distinct writing style in the dataset. An accuracy that is based on such a small dataset is basically meaningless.</p><p>I am sure you have seen skincare adverts where they claim things such as “83% felt their skin to be smoother.” Sounds great, right? The fine print then usually says something like “based on a sample of 40 respondents.” With such a small sample size, getting one that will tell you how smooth their skin feels after applying your cream is fairly easy. Do this with a sample size of 1,000 respondents (or in the case of AI detectors, with a sample size of 100,000 articles) and you’ll be a lot more credible.</p><h2 id="3-writers-have-no-way-to-defend-themselves-against-the-ai-blackbox">3. Writers have no way to defend themselves against the AI blackbox</h2><p>According to the AI detector his employer was using, Michael’s texts were between 65-95% likely to be AI-generated, depending on the piece. Every seasoned writer will tell you that kind of accusation hurts, and it hurts badly. But how do you prove the AI detector wrong? You can show the research that went into your pieces, you can highlight your writing style, and you can explain your process. Having to go through all of this is pretty painful. But of course, Michael did it.</p><p>Desperate, Michael even reached out to the company providing the AI test. To no avail. They simply told him he should set up an account with them, buy himself some credits, and test his articles again himself. At the end of the day, nothing changed the fact that there was this all-encompassing metric being thrown at him saying: You are cheating.</p><h2 id="the-storys-sad-end">The story's sad end</h2><p>I wish I could say that Michael's story had a happy end after all. But it did not. His client didn’t change their mind. They were terrified of Google downranking any AI-generated content, and because of the apparently clear results from their AI checker, they couldn’t be convinced otherwise. Michael lost his client for good.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2023/10/25/htmx-with-rust">https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2023/10/25/htmx-with-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38099145">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When it comes to Rust, although it's lauded as a language that is memory-safe, blazing fast and efficient, it's also known for having a compiler that will complain at you for everything (hence terms like "compiler-driven development" becoming a thing) and complex trait bounds that can getting it just right take time. In this article, we'll talk about tools that you can use to speed up your workflow: htmx with a templating engine and the web framework Axum (and of course, Shuttle!).</p>
<p>htmx is a JavaScript library designed to help you ship faster by allowing you to call endpoints from HTML elements instead of being required to do it manually which when combined with a HTML templating engine makes prototyping extremely quick - and we don't need to set anything up to do it, only being required as a minimum to use the CDN script (although we can also use it as an npm package). Shuttle allows you to move quickly by declaratively provisioning infrastructure like databases, key-value stores and more as main function parameters using the Shuttle runtime, letting you prototype new projects extremely quickly when used with htmx.</p>
<h2 id="using-shuttle">Using Shuttle</h2>
<p>Shuttle is a service designed to make deployment as easy as possible, by provisioning a runtime that lets you add macros (or "annotations") as function arguments to your entrypoint function. The runtime will then do static code analysis to figure out what needs provisioning and will then spin up the relevant infrastructure required - for example, if you need a Postgres instance, you can just declare it in your <code>fn main</code> arguments, use <code>cargo shuttle run</code> to run locally and then it'll spin up a container for you using Docker without any further input on your part!</p>

<p>Once you're done writing code, all you need to do is use <code>cargo shuttle deploy</code> (with the <code>--allow-dirty</code> flag if on a Git branch with uncommitted changes) and when it's done deploying, you should get a link to see your website! If you need to check your database connection string again, you can also use <code>cargo shuttle resource list</code> to quickly check it.</p>
<h2 id="using-htmx">Using HTMX</h2>
<p>To start off with, we want a <code>base.html</code> file that includes the head - which we'll add htmx to through the CDN.</p>

<p>We are also using Askama, which is a Rust HTML templating crate, with htmx. If you've ever used Python before, you might notice the syntax is quite similar to Jinja2 templates. Jinja2 is a web templating engine that describes itself as a "fast, expressive and extensible web templating engine" that's been around for quite a while and is a well known format given how many copies there are of libraries, inside and outside of Rust, that emulate Jinja2 syntax. Interested in learning more about Askama? Our new recent Shuttle Launchpad issue talks about it <a href="https://www.shuttle.rs/launchpad/issues/2023-10-17-issue-10-Serving-HTML">here.</a></p>
<p>Now let's make our <code>index.html</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- templates/index.html --&gt;</span>

<!-- -->{% endblock %}<!-- -->
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we are extending the <code>base.html</code> file and then declaring a block called <code>content</code> - this is where we put our HTML that we want to add. As a simple example, we've added a form to add a new todo, as well as a placeholder div with an ID of "list".</p>
<p>For the next part, we'll want to have some of our HTML already written, so let's do that now:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- templates/todos.html --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>todos<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>table</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- templates/todo.html --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>tr</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>shuttle-todo-{{ todo.id }}<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<!-- -->    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>td</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>tr</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we've included a button with the <code>todo</code> component that makes a DELETE request to the <code>/todos/:id</code> route, but it targets the whole row and just deletes the row after the API call is done, which saves time having to manually delete the component from the DOM.</p>
<h2 id="making-api-calls">Making API calls</h2>
<p>htmx allows you to make an API call without explicitly writing JavaScript for it, by allowing you use HTML attributes instead. When you make an API call with htmx, the library requires you to return HTML as a response - which is great for us because we can combine it with Askama templating so that we don't have to go through the hassle of trying to create a whole new element through pure JavaScript and then appending it to whatever element we choose. Let's take the form from above as an example:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>add-form<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>placeholder</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Your todo description...<span>"</span></span> <span>required</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span>text</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>description<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span>
        <span>hx-post</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/todos<span>"</span></span>
        <span>hx-trigger</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>click<span>"</span></span>
        <span>hx-target</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>#todos-content<span>"</span></span>
        <span>hx-swap</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>beforeend<span>"</span></span>
    <span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->        Add<!-- -->
<!-- -->    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The button makes a POST request to <code>/todos</code>, triggered by clicking the button, targets the HTML element with an id of "todos-content" and places the resulting HTML as the last element within the target element.</p>
<p>As you can see, this speeds up development speed quite a lot! Not having to set up an opinionated framework and being able to quickly write things with a HTML templating engine makes things a lot quicker.</p>
<h2 id="streams-and-server-sent-events-with-htmx">Streams and Server Sent Events with htmx</h2>
<p>Being able to quickly mock up a CRUD app with htmx is great. However, Server Sent Events (SSE) and Websockets are also important functions for web applications and web services to work. Thankfully, htmx natively supports both. We can look at a basic mockup of receiving SSE with htmx by creating a new channel in our main function, then appending it as an Extension to our main function, as well as creating the necessary structs we need for the messages we're going to send through the channel:</p>

<p>Then in our HTML, we will want to add an element that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- templates/stream.html --&gt;</span>
<!-- -->
<span>&lt;!-- Using hx-swap here will still allow us to swap into the inner element, despite not having any triggers --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>hx-sse</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>connect:/todos/stream swap:message<span>"</span></span> <span>hx-swap</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>beforeend<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When you have the <code>hx-sse</code> HTML element and then add or delete an item from the main page, you will then see a log of what ID the record had and what the action was. The item will get appended to the inner div without any other input from our side!</p>

We're building best-in-class machine learning and LLM-powered scoring for outbound sales teams. Our first product lives in Salesforce, ingests data from a variety of sources (firmographics, intent signals, marketing interactions, and prior engagement, including unstructured call transcripts, email chains, and notes), and combines LLMs with structured models to tell sales reps who they should reach out to each day (and why) to be laser-focused.</p><p>Our paying customers are fast-growing unicorns you've definitely heard of with large outbound sales motions, where the reps use us to target their outbound every day. Our thesis is that scoring (a known/"need to have" part of the stack -- but able to be done 10x better with LLMs because you can incorporate the goldmine of unstructured engagement data) is the right wedge into building the intelligence-driven outbound sales stack of the future that _actually works_ for large companies that need to generate millions of dollars in pipeline each quarter. Unlike most other companies in the space, we are explicitly building for companies of this scale and have them using our product today "in production."</p><p>We started with the vision of bringing AI to every business team, and have since narrowed down to focus on outbound sales teams who have a bunch of attractive properties (there are a _ton_ of them out there, they all use the same stack, the data is consolidated in one place, lift is measurable and directly touches the top line, etc.).</p><p>We're a team of 6 working in-person in NYC with a team from Scale/Waymo/Google/etc. (including some very senior folks) and looking to bring on another engineer as we start scaling our customer base.

I'm Guilherme, currently I work as a back-end developer with a degree in Software Engineering. I have a deep appreciation for seeing a "status 200" after completing an API, but I also enjoy the art of creating a beautiful front-end. My quest for growth extends beyond just programming; I am committed to evolving in areas like leadership and management, as I believe a good software engineer should be versatile and understand the full spectrum of software development. What truly motivates me is problem-solving. I believe it's in challenging situations that we learn and grow the most. I'm looking forward to bringing my passion for programming and my thirst for learning.</span></p></div></td></tr>

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Engineering Manager, Data Pipelines</p><p>* Engineering Manager, DevProd</p><p>* Principal Software Engineers - Experiences</p><p>* Staff Software Engineers - Data Pipelines</p><p>* Staff and Senior Health Data Engineer</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer - Program Development Kit Engine</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer, Production Applications</p><p>* Manager - Health Data Analytics</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

More than 100m people today live in an area without enough primary-care doctors (the problem is particularly bad in rural areas). For mental health things are even worse: half of Americans live in an area with a shortage of mental-health professionals. With less than than three physicians for every 1,000 people, America is behind most other wealthy countries, despite spending vastly more on health care (see chart).</p><p data-component="paragraph">The usual suspects have been blamed. As the baby-boomers age the need for medical care rises and the doctors among them retire. According to the <small>AAMC</small>, more than two out of five practising doctors will be 65 or older within the next decade, leaving even more vacancies. Covid-19 drove doctors away: an analysis by Peterson-<small>KFF</small>, a non-profit group, shows that health-care workers are quitting their jobs at a rate 30% higher than before covid (and about double the rate of all workers today). “A majority of physicians would not encourage our offspring to go into health care,” says Jesse Ehrenfeld, a physician and president of the American Medical Association. “People have lost the joy in the profession.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">Yet there is also a less obvious explanation for the doctor shortage, which has to do with the pipeline into the profession. It takes longer to train a doctor in America than in most rich countries, and many give up along the way. Future physicians must first graduate from university, which typically takes four years. Then they must attend medical school for another four years. (In most other rich countries, doctors need around six years of schooling.) After post-secondary education, American doctors must complete a residency programme, which can last from three to seven years. Further specialist training may follow. In all, it takes 10-15 years after arriving at university to become a doctor in America.</p><p data-component="paragraph">If the expense and length of the training were not off-putting enough, the number of places in the profession has also been artificially held down. In September 1980 the Department of Health and Human Services released a report warning of a troubling surplus of 70,000 physicians by 1990 in most specialities. It recommended reducing the numbers entering medical school and suggested that foreign medical-school graduates be restricted from entering the country. Doctors trained abroad must still sit exams and complete a residency in most states regardless of their years of experience.</p><div><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="608" height="626" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_USC274.png"><figcaption><span>image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph">Medical colleges listened, and matriculation flatlined for 25 years, despite applications rising and the population growing by 70m over the same period (see chart). In 1997 federal funding for residencies was capped, forcing hospitals to either limit programmes or shoulder some of the financial burden of training their doctors. Some spots have been added back, but not nearly enough. Many potential doctors are being left behind. “Not everyone who would be willing to go through that training and could do it successfully is being allowed to,” says Professor Gottlieb, the economist.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In reaction to this artificial doctor shortage, a new type of medical degree gained popularity: <small>DO</small>s (doctors of osteopathic medicine). In 1981, there were only 14 osteopathic medical schools. Today there are 41. In most countries, an osteopath is someone who manipulates middle-aged spines. In America <small>DO</small>s are fully-licensed doctors. They represent about 11% of the physician workforce and 25% of medical-school students. “The American <small>DO</small> looks almost nothing like their international counterparts,” says Robert Orr, a policy wonk. “They basically mainstreamed themselves in response.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">Nurse practitioners and physician assistants have been given responsibilities typically reserved for doctors, such as writing prescriptions. Foreign-trained doctors have filled some of the gap too. Yet the shortage persists. This looks a lot like a labour market that has been rigged in favour of the insiders.<span>■</span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Those descriptions are deeply uniformative because they draw attention to what’s absent rather than what’s present. The same can be said about the phrase ‘cashless society’. It’s an evasive euphemism that refers to the situation in which every transaction in our economy has to be routed via the banking sector using big tech devices. If this Big Finance-Tech Society is going to be called ‘cashless’, we better call cash payments ‘bankless’.</p><p><span>Cash can </span><em>co-exist</em><span> with cards and apps, and when kept in balance, the different forms of payment can complement each other. It’s only when that balance is removed that the dark side of digital payments gets to flourish. Unfortunately, across the world we’re seeing the spread of so-called ‘cashlessness’, a type of contagion in which the option to pay with non-corporate and non-automated money is incrementally taken away from you.</span></p><p>The fight against cashless society, then, is a fight against a state of unbalance. I’ve campaigned on this for eight years now, and in this piece I’ll lay out 10 talking points that you can use to make even the most ardent card-tapper have second thoughts about a totally bank-dominated society.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp" width="945" height="429" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:945,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:40870,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a20a475-41f3-4b83-b81d-5520a77c5fd1_945x429.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Fintech firms have tried for decades to make you think that cash is like an outdated, inefficient and dangerous ‘horse cart of payments’. People who buy into this belief imagine that the digital payment takeover is just a natural upgrade, like getting horse-carts to make way for sports cars on roads that don’t have space to host both. In reality it’s like removing bicycle lanes in a world dominated by Uber. It’s an enclosure that narrows our choices. The core way to defend cash is to show that it maintains a </span><em>balance of power </em><span>in the monetary system, much like bicycles maintain a balance of power in the transport system.

The vast majority of our digital payments rely on a collaborating oligopoly of banks, card companies (e.g. Visa and Mastercard), fintech platforms, tech companies (e.g. Apple and Google), and global financial alliances like SWIFT. When you interact with this complex, you leave detailed data trails about when, where, with who and on what you spend. </span></p><p><span>It’s true that governments can do surveillance of that data, but corporates can too.

While many of the world’s poorest people have historically struggled to </span><em>earn </em><span>high incomes, they do not struggle to </span><em>spend</em><span> their small incomes in the form of cash. As the cash system gets shut down though, they are forced towards digital systems run by private sector banks that often don’t want them as customers (and who often exploit them). There are also many people who struggle to access (reliable) digital infrastructures, and when the option to use cash is removed, they essentially start getting firewalled out of the economy. </span></p><p><span>This issue doesn’t just affect people who </span><em>can’t </em><span>use these systems. It affects everyone who </span><em>doesn’t want to </em><span>use them. This could include people - like me - who are politically opposed to being totally dependent on the platforms, as well as free spirits who don’t want to be constantly tethered to a phone, and people with disabilities who find the tactile nature of cash easier to work with. In places like London, where policy-makers are allowing the cash infrastructure to implode, half the city is now essentially inaccessible to those people unless they are willing and able to turn their lives over to Visa and Mastercard.</span></p><p>Anyone who has ever been financially precarious will know that having no income in a market economy feels like being a fish slowly suffocating on dry land. Having money is what enables you to ‘breathe’ in our system, but in a cashless economy those institutions that control the payments infrastructure have the power to strangle people by blocking their payments.

Those things can bring entire economies to a standstill when there's no cash backup. As the saying goes, '</span><em>cash doesn't crash</em><span>'.</span></p><p><span>I constantly have to face short-sighted economists who moan about the ‘cost of cash’ - the fact that there’s a cost to running the public cash infrastructure - but that’s like a property developer moaning about the cost of providing stairs in a skyscraper. Picture them saying</span><em> “Why not leave the stairs out, and only have elevators. Much more efficient!</em><span> </span><em>Nobody uses stairs anymore! They’re so expensive to build and maintain, and the youth don’t like them!” </em><span>We all know how that ends.</span></p><p>If there’s an emergency in a skyscraper without emergency stairs, it’s only the people in the building who are affected, but in the case of the monetary system it’s our entire society that goes down if we have no payments backup. Money is part of the deep operating system of capitalism, a foundation upon which all other industries are built. Any breakdown in the monetary system causes everything else to break, so it’s the one system you have to promote resilience in above all else. Optimising for short-term efficiency rather than long-term resilience is downright dangerous in this space.</p><p>Even from a narrow business perspective the cashless equation doesn’t add up. Last year I found myself at a UK music festival where the official beer tent refused cash and had to turn thousands of beer-seeking customers away as the mobile networks their payments terminals relied on repeatedly crashed. More generally, digital hype is built on the probably unrealistic belief that we’ll face no resource constraints in future. Not only do we already have major supply chain problems in microchips, but half the world’s rare earth metal comes from a single mining district in China, meaning the resource constraints could easily be amplified by geopolitical tensions.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://brettscott.substack.com/p/10-reasons-to-fight-cashless-society?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://brettscott.substack.com/p/10-reasons-to-fight-cashless-society?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Not only are we physical beings that understand things through touch, but we are also social beings that like face-to-face interaction. Through the eyes of digital accelerationists though, positive texture like this is seen as a negative form of ‘friction’ slowing everything down. In a growth-obsesssed world, this leads to a fixation with promoting ‘frictionless’ technologies that accelerate consumption and production (see </span><a href="https://brettscott.substack.com/p/tech-doesnt-make-our-lives-easier" rel="">Tech doesn’t make our lives easier. It just makes them faster</a><span>). This is one major reason why governments and corporates promote digital payments. In it’s ‘Benefits of Going Cashless’ website, Visa gloats that people spend 25-40% more with cards, a finding that is backed by other academic studies (see this </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Suitpossum/status/1583059021296115712?t=zAvJS2BJZ9gQE5LebHQmKA&amp;s=03" rel="">thread here for a list of 10 studies</a><span>). Accelerating spending via digital payments might be narrowly good for big business, but not good for ordinary humans: millions of people are driven into unsustainable credit card debt to serve this unsustainable growth model.</span><br></p><p>What’s the main difference between walking into a corner store in your local neighborhood to buy Heinz baked beans with cash, and getting the same thing via Amazon with your card? The former only involves one distant mega-corporation - the Kraft Heinz company - whereas the latter might rely on me using a Visa card from Barclays, hosted on an Apple iPhone or Google wallet, docking into Amazon to initiate a payment via Visa’s datacentres to Santander. Nowadays we’re told that becoming permanently plugged into digital corporate oligopolies like this is great progress, and that small local businesses should also become totally dependent on these behemoths. In the resultant cashless economy there really is no such thing as ‘local’. You’re going to have to pay fees to a series of distant corporations thousands of kilometres away to interact with someone standing a metre from you in your local farmer’s market.</p><p><span>Every beep you hear on a contactless card terminal is the sound of the card companies and banking sector getting richer. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis everyone was aware of just how powerful large financial institutions are, and how their '</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail" rel="">too big to fail</a><span>' status held our political systems hostage. Since then they have tried to present themselves as good corporate citizens, sliding into the background while quietly entrenching themselves into our lives via digital finance. A cashless society is one in which we are dependent upon bank accounts for almost everything, but this time the finance sector has characterised this takeover as something driven by the ordinary person. </span></p><p>Gone are the days when the banking sector was made up of family-owned firms. Nowadays they are globe-spanning corporations owned by mega institutional shareholders like BlackRock, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Berkshire Hathaway and hedge funds. The financial sector as a whole has a stake in the cashless bonanza, and the fact that their infrastructures are increasingly the only way we can survive means they can extract enormous political power. This means, rather than fighting to protect and promote the cash system as a strong public alternative, governments try onboard everyone into the banks via financial inclusion initiatives. A cashless society is one in which big finance ceases to be an optional service provider, and becomes a mandatory part of your life at all times. </p><p><span>As Big Finance-Tech entrenches itself as a mandatory backdrop to all our interactions, the </span><em>vibe</em><span> of our economy changes. Older economies have a much greater balance of power between formal and informal spheres of action: in the 1950s you might have gone to work for a big company, but your daughter could still sell lemonade on the side of the road without paying a Mastercard executive. You might have ended up being a yuppie lawyer in the 1980s, but you could still flip a coin to a busker without it depending on your bank. A modern ‘cashless’ economy, by contrast, is an economy where </span><em>everything</em><span> routes via formal instutions, and this means it </span><em>feels</em><span> different.</span></p><p><span>The attack on cash is one element of a broader process of corporate-underpinned gentrification, in which more down-to-earth informal economies are systematically replaced with a shallow layer of choice built on a deep layer of corporate domination. Think about the new breed of cashless ‘independent’ stores that are popping up in big cities - the craft beer place, the high-end cupcake bakery, the hipster coffee grinders. They look small and independent, but in reality they are plugged into a complex of tech and finance firms, and their independence is superficial when compared to the cash-only Jamaican record store in London or the Turkish barber shop in Berlin. This gentrification seems ‘modern’, but deep down it’s driven by a profit impulse that prioritises automation, efficiency and scale, values that eventually make everything feel sterile. Anyone who has lived in London for more than a decade will remember a time when you could go to small underground parties with cash-only bars. Now the values of that world are being hunted down and assassinated by corporate capitalism.</span><br></p><p><span>Sometimes hard-nosed economist types look at me strangely when I pull out my vibe arguments, saying that I’m being ‘romantic’. In that case, I’ll end with a very unromantic point. Even if you do like the endless automation and efficiency drive in our society, and feel at home in the sterile corporate gentrification that it creates, it’s really bad for financial stability. The only reason people trust in cashless digital payments is that they believe those units that they see in their bank account can eventually be redeemed for cash. This becomes especially apparent once you realise that those units are essentially ‘</span><a href="https://brettscott.substack.com/p/casino-chip-cashless-society" rel="">digital casino chips</a><span>’ issued out to you by banks, and a casino chip means jack-shit if it can’t be redeemed. </span></p><p>During crises people always run to the ATM to turn their digital chips back into government cash, like people running for the exit of an unstable casino. When banks shut down ATMs and branches it’s like them shutting down those exits, but while that makes sense to them individually, when they do it collectively they risk undermining the basis of public confidence in their private systems. After all, if I can’t get out of a bank, do I really want to go in in the first place? In the end, the so-called cashless systems are in fact both legally and psychologically tethered to the cash system.</p><p><span>If you want a deeper dive into all of this, check out my 2022 book </span><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/439997/cloudmoney-by-scott-brett/9781529111484" rel="">Cloudmoney: Why the War of Cash Endangers of Freedom</a><span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2023/11/01/cpp23-garbage-collection">https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2023/11/01/cpp23-garbage-collection</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38097984">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If we go through the list of C++23 features, we can stumble upon the notion of garbage collection twice. Once among the language and once among the library features. Both entries refer to the same paper (<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2186r2.html">P2186R2</a>): garbage collection (<em>GC</em> in short) support is getting removed from C++. Just to make it clear, it’s not getting deprecated, but it’s getting completely removed. As it’s an unimplemented and unsupported feature, removing it is a nice act of language cleanup. It also wouldn’t be surprising if you never heard about GC in C++.</p><p>The first surprise this paper might give you is the fact that it talks about Garbage Collection and C++. When I was learning about C++ in comparison with Java a long long time ago, one advantage of C++ was deterministic memory management due to the lack of garbage collection.</p><p>As it turns out, in 2008 a <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2670.htm">minimal support for garbage collection and reachability-based leak detection</a> was added to C++0x. This paper was based on two earlier ones, you’ll find the reference for those in the previously referenced one. Standard-conform garbage collectors should take into account <em>strict pointer safety</em>. In fact, there is no such garbage collectors in major standard libraries.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2670.htm">N2670</a>) introduced the <code>std::pointer_safety</code> enumeration with three enumerators: <code>relaxed</code>, <code>preferred</code>, <code>strict</code>. When <code>std::get_pointer_safety()</code> is called, an implementation will return a value indicating how it treats pointers that are not safely derived (see below).</p><ul><li><code>pointer_safety::relaxed</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated the same as pointers that are safely derived for the duration of the program</li><li><code>pointer_safety::preferred</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated also the same as safely-derived pointers, but at the same time, the implementation is allowed to hint that it’s desirable to avoid dereferencing such pointers</li><li><code>pointer_safety::strict</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers might be treated differently than pointers that are safely derived.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>A pointer value is a <em>safely-derived pointer</em> to a dynamic object only if it has pointer-to-object type and it is:</p><ul><li>the value returned by a call to the C++ standard library implementation of ::operator new(std::size_t); the result of taking the address of a subobject of an lvalue resulting from dereferencing a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of well-defined pointer arithmetic using a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a well-defined pointer conversion of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a reinterpret_cast of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a reinterpret_cast of an integer representation of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the value of an object whose value was copied from a traceable pointer object, where at the time of the copy the source object contained a copy of a safely-derived pointer value.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The standard lets implementations get away with basically any, even no-op implementations of GC and therefore it makes very little sense to have them in the standard. This doesn’t mean though that there haven’t been any successful garbage collectors for C++. The most often use case for GC implemented in C++ is having virtual machines written in C++ for other languages that are garbage collected. Different JavaScript VMs are like that and Lua as well.</p><p>But those garbage collectors also have their own set of requirements which are influenced much more by the language they help as their runtime than the C++ standard.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2186r2.html">P2186R2</a> lists more concerns, I find it important to highlight two of them.</p><p>When you read above about <code>std::pointer_safety</code>, did you understand the difference between <code>relaxed</code> and <code>preferred</code>? If you did, please explain in the comments section. It’s totally unclear what well-behaved programs should do when they are given this information. It only brings confusion with any benefits.</p><p>The other problem is the definition of <em>safely-derived pointers</em>. In order to get a <em>safely-derived pointer</em>, you must use the global <code>::operator new</code> and there are no other implementation-defined ways to get such pointers. This is a problem because people often want to use other <code>new</code>s or want to avoid their usage completely to create objects in local arrays while avoiding heap usage.</p><p>As a consequence, garbage collection has been removed from C++23 with a great majority as well as pointer safety. The following names are removed from <code>std::</code></p><ul><li><code>declare_reachable</code></li><li><code>undeclare_reachable</code></li><li><code>declare_no_pointers</code></li><li><code>undeclare_no_pointers</code></li><li><code>get_pointer_safety</code></li><li><code>pointer_safety</code></li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Garbage collection and related features are being removed from C++23. If you are surprised to learn that the C++ standard had support for GC, you are not alone. It was unimplemented, confusing and pretty useless hence it’s removed. While there are existing garbage collectors, mostly for VMs written in C++ as a runtime for other languages, they are not impacted as they were not relying on the standard, exactly because of the reasons it’s getting removed.</p><p>A bit of simplification to the standard never hurts.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,</li><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a></li><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo"><img data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png"></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The alligator got my attention. Which, of course, was the point. When you hear that a 10-foot alligator is going to be released at a rooftop bar in South Florida, at a party for the people being accused of ruining the internet, you can’t quite stop yourself from being curious. If it was a link — “WATCH: 10-foot Gator Prepares to Maul Digital Marketers” — I would have clicked. But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently<em> </em>called a “<a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/the-internet-is-already-broken">search-optimized hellhole</a>.” So I booked a plane ticket to the Sunshine State.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to understand: what kind of human spends their days exploiting our dumbest impulses for traffic and profit? Who the hell are these people making money off of everyone else’s misery?&nbsp;</p><p>After all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2023/03/ai-future-google-bing-chatbots-tools/673256/">absolutely unusable</a>”; “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/12/23721323/ask-jeeves-remember-when-google-search-worked-ai">garbage</a>”; and “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai?src=longreads">a nightmare</a>” because “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-google-search-isnt-showing-you">a lot of the content doesn’t feel authentic</a>.” Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.&nbsp;</p><p>Doing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled “Sponsored” above organic search results; it’s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear<strong> </strong>for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google’s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voilà: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up “sneaker” in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (“footwear that allows you to just do it!”). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>So who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.</p><p>“This is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,” explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he’s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. “There’s definitely an ego among all of them,” he told me. “You succeed, and now you’re a genius. Now you’ve outdone Google.”</p><div><p>This year,&nbsp;<em>The Verge&nbsp;</em>is exploring how Google Search has reshaped the web into a place for robots —&nbsp;and how the emergence of AI threatens Google itself.</p></div><p>The more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm — which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force — the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn’t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>Because I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait!&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn’t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she’d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn’t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was “five girls and all dudes.” She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>His name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of “modern-day pirate shit” guy I’d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. “The air of manipulation was insane,” Babin told me. “We had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,” he said. “People were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.”&nbsp;</p><p>We were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I’d found Daron Babin.</p><div><p>“It was like I won the lottery, and I didn’t know how long it would last.”</p></div><p>Darren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren “D-Money” Blatt would throw rap star-studded<strong> </strong>internet marketing<em> </em>shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (“We were outranking Pfizer!”). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling.&nbsp;</p><p>As the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron’s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. “I told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,” Darren said.&nbsp;</p><p>Daron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. “I would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,” he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but “it seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>I was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as “a nerd,” and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is “no longer monetizing at the highest payout,” the same “core knowledge of SEO” remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Translation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called “deliverability.”&nbsp;</p><p>As a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life?&nbsp;</p><p>I wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest.</p><p>“They should untape the mouth!” someone shouted. “I’m not even scared.”</p><p>As sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the ’90s, involving fake domain names: “I could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!” What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: “It muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,” he said, “but while it worked, we banked.”</p><p>The situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. “We’re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,” he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up.&nbsp;</p><p>“All the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,” he said, “now they can go and use the free version of GPT.” Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we’d ever seen before.</p><p>“They’re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,” he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. “You can’t stop it!”&nbsp;</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A man in business casual attire, hands in pockets, standing before multiple hands and computer mice in a colorful illustration." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/376x376/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/384x384/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/415x415/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/480x480/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/540x540/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/640x640/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/750x750/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/828x828/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1080x1080/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1200x1200/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1440x1440/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1920x1920/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2048x2048/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2400x2400/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2400x2400/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035104/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_002.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>Once I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, <em>Florida</em>, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: “He was an absolute god in that space.”&nbsp;</p><p>I tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s like the freedom of information!” he remembered thinking. “It’s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. “I had surfed the entire internet. There wasn’t a page I hadn’t seen.”</p><p>And then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change.&nbsp;</p><p>Mapstead started pulling in $25,000–$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. “It was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,” he told me. “It was like I won the lottery, and I didn’t know how long it would last.”&nbsp;</p><p>Around this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Massimo/papers/WWW6/">journal article</a> about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. “Finding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,” he wrote. “A vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,” which “has led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.”&nbsp;</p><p>Enter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries.</p><div><p>“I was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.”</p></div><p>Mapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google’s results rise.</p><p>I came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search’s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat.</p><p>Before our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. <em>TechCrunch</em> published a story called “Why We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,” which argued that “Google has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.” In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin.</p><p>While the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. “They change the rules instantly overnight, and then you’re out of business,” he told me. “Here you’re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they’re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you’ve gotta scramble to pay rent.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But don’t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead’s “core knowledge of SEO” came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. “I was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,” he told me. “And that was supposed to be my hobby!”</p><p>As I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless.&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves “SEOs”? Really. They say things like, “As the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.” This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale.</p><p>“The SEO people are just trying to make money,” said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including <em>SEO for Dummies</em> and <em>Bitcoin for Dummies</em>. “The cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they’re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider’s perspective. For years, he’s been telling people that part of the SEO industry’s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don’t know what they’re doing or don’t really give a damn,” he explained. As a consultant, he’s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. “I would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.”</p><p>When I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“It isn’t because they have a scammer’s heart,” said Bruce Clay. “It’s because they don’t have the real expertise.” Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase “search engine optimization” and is therefore called “the father of SEO.” He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience.</p><div><p>“I don’t know if you can trust anything you read online.”</p></div><p>Though Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (“Make your site interesting and useful”), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site’s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn?</p><p>The algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they’re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. “There’s a great deal of effort that’s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren’t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,” said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. “There are a lot of scammers in every single business. It’s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,” said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag <em>Search Engine Land</em>. Both over the phone with me and in his <a href="https://searchengineland.com/misquoted-and-misunderstood-why-we-the-search-community-dont-believe-the-wsj-about-google-search-325241">work</a>, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: “The search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients’ websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.”</p><p>Several people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google’s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make <em>any</em> attempt to artificially boost a website’s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google’s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher’s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so?</p><p>“I don’t know if you can trust anything you read online,” he told me. “Maybe you ask a friend.”&nbsp;</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="An illustration of a tilted browser window spilling out numerous items including money, keycaps, people, and various search browser icons." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/376x376/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/384x384/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/415x415/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/480x480/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/540x540/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/640x640/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/750x750/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/828x828/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1080x1080/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1200x1200/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1440x1440/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/1920x1920/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2048x2048/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2400x2400/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x2048/2400x2400/filters:focal(1024x1024:1025x1025):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035106/236865_The_people_who_ruined_the_internet_SCestaro_003.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>After hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what’s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company’s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester.</p><p>Forrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google’s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. “I’ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,” he told me. “That is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.” (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.)</p><p>These days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. “And then it became, ‘What else can I know how to do?’”</p><p>By the ’90s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. “The people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don’t know that we felt that way,” he said. “You all kind of knew you were making shit up.”&nbsp;</p><p>After years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as “that vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done?”</p></div><p>For Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing — Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as “a cruise director” on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He’s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as “an infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,” he said. “I’ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I’ve had, ’cause it’s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I’m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone’s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it’s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that’s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.”</p><p>Over the years, he’s seen it all. He remembered “walking into hotel rooms and it’s two o’clock in the morning, there’s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there’s a party going on.” Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. “Somebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.” He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. “She goes, ‘It’s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.’” Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes.</p><p>Once he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company’s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Cutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Several SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would “spill secrets,” as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>“My favorite question to ask an SEO,” Cutts told me, was, “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done?” which prompted responses that felt like “a cross between showing off and a confessional.” So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they’d discovered in Google’s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn’t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>As a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing’s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: “We know what we’re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We’ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don’t really care.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. “One thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there’s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,” he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google’s founders had initially promised, telling <em>Wired</em> at the time, “[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, some blamed him personally for “<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/jason-calacanis-revenge-google-matt-cutts-18794.html">killing</a>” companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google’s offices, he told me, “We’d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.”</p><p>After Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: “Those personalities sometimes were standoffish,” Forrester told me. “Some of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.”&nbsp;</p><p>One of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started <em>Search Engine Land</em>, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as “the closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,” so when he published “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-quality-crisis-272174">A deep look at Google’s biggest-ever search quality crisis</a>” in 2017 and then took a job as Google’s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn’t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,” Forrester told me. “I don’t believe that’s the case,” he went on, but compared to Cutts, “I think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.”</p><div><p>Was all that really Google’s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.</p></div><p>When I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He’s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts’ was: “We have reams of help documents!” he told me. “We have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!”&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan is mad that the public and the media don’t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1681409472999350273">scolding tone</a> online. He’s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google’s algorithm because even “if we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals” and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn’t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>And most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven’t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror.</p><p>“We have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,” he said. “We might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, ‘All my searches aren’t good.’”</p><p>The problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was <em>kids these days</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts’ departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google’s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red.&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s the part where I started to feel the way I’ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader–Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was<em> </em>I<em> </em>the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator?&nbsp;</p><p>I began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google’s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible.&nbsp;</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A vibrant illustration of a person standing before an internet browser window with an open door in its center.

Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose “daddies” were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend — a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today <em>do</em> feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google’s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.</p><p>“E-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,” Ray told me. She’s done <a href="https://lilyray.nyc/e-a-t-expertise-authoritativeness-trustworthiness/">extensive</a> (and fascinating) <a href="https://www.amsive.com/insights/seo/google-august-2023-core-update-winners-losers-analysis/">research</a> around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what’s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately <a href="https://rubymediagroup.com/google-political-bias-quality-raters-guidelines/">affecting</a> right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has <a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/388aa7d18189665e5f5579aef18e181c2d4283fb7b0d4691689dfd1bf92f7ac2ea6816e09c02eb98d5501b8e5705ead65af653cdf94071c47361821e362da55b">described</a> heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.</p><div><p>You can’t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at</p></div><p>This felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.</p><p>The second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO — specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.&nbsp;</p><p>“SEO that goes against Google’s guidelines, it’s not new,” Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called “black hat” SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved “white hat” tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_the_neologism_%22santorum%22">sexual</a> or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/11/25/google.michelle.obama.controversy-2/">racist</a> would come up first.&nbsp;</p><p>Google is harder to game now — it’s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. “It’s exponentially worse,” Ray said. “People can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,” she went on, and “in many cases, Google’s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google’s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience.</p><p>Eventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it’s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. ”They make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,” she said. “It’s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users ‘cause it’s like, ‘This is terrible.’”&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. “I used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn’t hate on anybody personally,” she said. “If people have a problem with Google’s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?” she asked. “Or is this Google behaving differently than it used to?”&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all “spam.” What is spam? “Spam is stuff that search engines don’t like.”&nbsp;</p><p>But the line between strategies that violate Google’s terms of service and strategies that don’t has always been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041">blurry</a> and inconsistently <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/florida-update/">enforced</a>. “I’ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,” Ray told me. “If you’re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn’t work, make it stop working!”</p><p>Ray seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a “thought leader,” and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother’s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that’s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I’d first imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Google had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can’t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at.&nbsp;</p><p>For the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google’s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/1/23/21078343/google-ad-desktop-design-change-favicon-icon-ftc-guidelines">choices</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">priorities</a>. As Google’s founders <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">wrote</a> back in 1997: “we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.”</p><div><p>At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it</p></div><p>There’s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business’s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were so many true believers at Google in the early days,” Cutts told me. “As companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.” He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, “I deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.” He speculated that the company didn’t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness “encourages regulators and makes people realize, ‘Oh, there’s a lot of money here.’”</p><p>There has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can’t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.&nbsp;</p><p>And as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don’t follow Google’s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will “make the internet a better place,” as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business.&nbsp;</p><p>“They want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That’d be neat,” said an SEO named Cade Lee. “But that’s maybe in a world where we don’t have money and greed and things, you know?”&nbsp;</p><p>Lee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was “modern-day pirate shit.” He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google’s guidelines. He’s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google’s terms of service.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was transparent about it, and they approved it,” he said. They even approved “some pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,” he told me, specifically involving what he’d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with <em>her</em> website.</p><p>These days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. “The good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.” For example: “We’re gonna take that old lady’s money to build her a brand new patio. There’s that scam, and then there’s, ‘Hey, let’s take her deposit and run.’” Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn’t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he’s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he’d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s what happened with SEO for me — it was becoming bullshit,” he says. “I was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, ‘I shouldn’t be doing this.’”</p><p><em><strong>Correction: </strong>An earlier version of the piece misstated when Search Engine Land was founded.

<!--more--><p>Hi team, I’m thrilled to announce that HubSpot has signed an agreement to acquire <a href="http://www.clearbit.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Clearbit</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearbit was founded in 2014 and has made it its mission to collect amazingly <em>rich</em> and <em>useful</em> data about millions of companies – and build cutting-edge software to keep it up to date and track buying signals across the web. They think like we do – they Solve For The Customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>HubSpot’s platform combined with Clearbit’s data creates a powerful, winning combination. It takes our customer platform to an unparalleled level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s dig into some details.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How does this acquisition advance our customer platform vision?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision is to give millions of companies the best possible insights about their customers on our platform. Today, we are pretty darn good at it. We pull in data from marketing emails, sales calls, support tickets, website interactions, and more. We unify all that data on a beautiful, simple, customer record. This is arguably the biggest advantage with HubSpot. But there’s more data out there that can make our customers even better at connecting with their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine having data on over 20 million companies right inside the HubSpot platform. Not just the <em>usual data</em>, like company name and employee count, but over 100 rich attributes about those companies including demographic data like who their CIO is and technographic data like which marketing automation products they use.</p>
<p>Imagine the value we could create for our customers if we helped them easily find great-fit prospects across those 20 million companies using data about their <em>existing</em> customers in the HubSpot Smart CRM.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that once prospects’ and customers’ data are in HubSpot, our platform actively <em>monitors</em> those customers for buying <em>intents</em>. Not just based on direct engagements <em>within</em> the HubSpot platform, but also based on customers’ activities <em>outside </em>of HubSpot and around the web. And, when it’s time to reach out, imagine using generative A.I. powered by all of this rich data to create <em>personal</em> messages. That will be possible with Clearbit and HubSpot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we bring A.I., unified customer data, and our customer platform together, we supercharge our customers’ go-to-market. That’s how we help our customers grow better and create deeper connections with their customers.</p>
<p>Exciting, right?&nbsp; It’s the kind of thing that would make our customers and partners jump out of their chairs and say…<em>YES!</em> And give us a virtual high-five.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Clearbit?</strong></p>
<p>Simple - they have world-class data and share our commitment to helping customers grow better. We can build something game changing together.</p>
<p>Clearbit has rich and broad customer data. They have over 100+ firmographic, demographic, and technographic attributes for every company with a website. Clearbit’s data for more than 20M companies and 500M decision makers comes from a <em>lot of </em>sources: 250+ public and private data sources including social profiles, company websites, legal filings and crowdsourcing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearbit has a deep bench of B2B data experts. Clearbit’s CEO and CTO, Matt and Harlow, have a bold mission to leverage AI to power customer insights and are passionate about data. In all our conversations with Clearbit, it was clear that the team will be a great addition to our culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearbit data will provide immediate value for our customers. With some acquisitions, you need to cobble products together, which often creates a disjointed experience for customers. This isn't one of those. We already use Clearbit data in our product. They already have a HubSpot integration. That means customers will start getting value quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, what next?</strong></p>
<p>We just announced that we have signed a deal to acquire Clearbit. We will need to wait for the deal to officially close, which could take up to a few months. Clearbit will remain available as a standalone product once the acquisition is complete. Over time, we will integrate Clearbit into HubSpot's offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an ambitious vision of building a large and enduring business by combining the power of HubSpot's platform with a rich dataset that can help scaling companies reach more customers–and we are in a great position to deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>We can't wait to welcome Clearbit to HubSpot and to build an even better data foundation to help our customers grow better!</p></span></p><p>Originally published Nov 1, 2023 9:10:50 AM, updated November 01 2023</p>

The researchers found, on average, that the amount of deep sleep declined between the two studies, indicating slow wave sleep loss with ageing. Over the next 17 years of follow-up, there were 52 cases of dementia. Even adjusting for age, sex, cohort, genetic factors, smoking status, sleeping medication use, antidepressant use, and anxiolytic use, each percentage decrease in deep sleep each year was associated with a 27 per cent increase in the risk of dementia.</p><p>“Slow-wave sleep, or deep sleep, supports the ageing brain in many ways, and we know that sleep augments the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain, including facilitating the clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease,” Associate Professor Pase said.</p><p>“However, to date we have been unsure of the role of slow-wave sleep in the development of dementia. Our findings suggest that slow wave sleep loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.”</p><p>Associate Professor Pase said that the Framingham Heart Study is a unique community-based cohort with repeated overnight polysomnographic (PSG) sleep studies and uninterrupted surveillance for incident dementia.</p><p>“We used these to examine how slow-wave sleep changed with ageing and whether changes in slow-wave sleep percentage were associated with the risk of later-life dementia up to 17 years later,” he said.</p><p>“We also examined whether genetic risk for Alzheimer’s Disease or brain volumes suggestive of early neurodegeneration were associated with a reduction in slow-wave sleep. We found that a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but not brain volume, was associated with accelerated declines in slow wave sleep.”</p><p>Read the full paper in JAMA Neurology: <em>Association Between Slow-Wave Sleep Loss and Incident Dementia</em>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I’ve been trying to invest more and more of my free time interacting with founders. I genuinely feel we’ve been through a lot with Sentry and I can provide some useful value to others. More so, I believe most people in this industry, most successful people, do others a disservice but not having honest conversations about the hardships and endurance it takes to succeed. As part of that I thought it’d be interesting, or at least therapeutic, to talk about some of the history in written form. I previously wrote about <a href="https://cra.mr/funding-sentry">Sentry’s Seed Funding</a>, but I want to go deeper on some other topics this time around. I’m not entirely sure what future topics I’ll cover, but hopefully you’ll find some value in it.</em></p>
<p>In today’s episode, let’s talk about Sentry’s origin, the early days iteration, and how we eventually started the business. If you have a side project you enjoy hacking on, or maybe you’re in the early stages of product-market-fit, this might be for you.</p>
<p>Sentry starts long before Sentry, with a once known project aptly named <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-db-log"><code>django-db-log</code></a>. Somewhere circa early 2008, on a long since forgotten chat medium called IRC. There was a small group of individuals - passionate individuals like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2008/May/13/djangodblog/">Simon Willison</a> - who used to hang out in a channel called <code>#django-users</code>, and I was one of them. An anonymous user asked a simple question: how would you record errors to a dashboard? I obliged them with some <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-db-log/commit/3c2e87573d3bd16f61cf08fece0638cc47a4fc22">example code</a>, created a repository out of it, and the project was born. It’s not an overly interesting origin story, and its not filled with hardships, but its a very simple beginning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/sentry/django-sentry-details.png" alt="django-sentry"></p>
<p>Over the years I worked on a lot of open source. I <a href="https://cra.mr/work-life-balance">genuinely enjoy building things</a>, and Django was the community that really drew me in. I was fortunate enough that <em>no one cared about open source</em> so I could open source just about anything I worked on, whether it was from my side projects or random utilities I built at work. Over those early years, I open sourced dozens of small projects, many being extensions to the Django web framework: <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-devserver"><code>django-devserver</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-sphinx"><code>django-sphinx</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-uuidfield"><code>django-uuidfield</code></a> for example. Of course <code>django-db-log</code> makes that list, but it focused on a passion I didn’t recognize at the time. That passion was solving my own problems- making my own work less tedious, my own day-to-day less frustrating. That passion, and that yearn for community, that more than anything else is what I contribute to both my personal success, as well as the success of our now business.</p>
<p>Eventually projects like <code>django-db-log</code> led to career opportunities. I have a vivid memory of going into an interview at Disqus (a startup I joined in 2010), watching them install the dependencies, and seeing several with my name on them. I had already interviewed and passed the assessment before I even talked to the team, and that’s a big deal for me given I am self-taught, come from rural America, and generally speaking have not had access to a lot of opportunities outside of ones I’ve created. That moment, and several other similar stories, are why I’ve been such a long believer in the power of Open Source for an individual’s career. As alluded, I joined Disqus, my first experience working at a “real” startup.</p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/disqus-title-slide.png" alt="Disqus"></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">Disqus</a> was an interesting learning ground for me. Going in I was ambitious and productive, but you don’t know what you don’t know, and at that age there was <em>a lot</em> I didn’t know. It’s the era where I learned (and eventually preached) the value of testing. It’s when I met many of my former colleagues who have become lifelong friends, some of whom still work at Sentry. Most importantly, it’s the era that allowed me to significantly expand my career options, both by investing time into projects like <code>django-db-log</code>, as well as speaking at various Python conferences. Disqus was also an enabler to my open source contributions, and importantly they relied on <code>django-db-log</code>. That meant that at various times I had <em>a financially motivated</em> reason to invest more time into it. As an example, in the early days (in fact, this might have been my first week on the job) I took down the entire platform. I don’t recall why, but I do recall it being extra painful due to <code>django-db-log</code>’s inability to scale. It couldn’t handle the huge volume of errors I had just thrown at it, and based on how little email we could receive over the next day, nor could gmail handle the amount of alerts that it generated.</p>
<p>If I had to pick the single most important event for Sentry, it would be this real-world use of the project at my full-time job. It meant investment in the project was based on practicalities, based on what we actually needed it to do at the organization. It meant that investments being made into the project were being made <em>for myself</em> to <em>improve my own day-to-day</em> as well as those of my team. I worked at Disqus from mid 2010 to early 2013, a little under three years. It was in that time that we decided to rename the project (first to <code>django-sentry</code> and eventually to <em>Sentry</em>). It was also at that time that we decided to bootstrap the company.</p>
<p>I don’t recall exactly when we started development on the cloud services for Sentry, but I do recall being thoroughly uninformed about what it’d take to launch a software-as-a-service company. You see, I had been pitched the idea of launching an AddOn on Heroku by one of the at-the-time PMs. It seemed like an easy concept: make Sentry easy to run on Heroku and make a few bucks. The ambitions were high at the time: “beer money” specifically is how I remember thinking about our potential success. When I kicked this off I recruited Chris Jennings (aka ckj) to help me start the company. He had already helped out on the project at Disqus so he was familiar with the project. I recall it being close to the end of the 2012, around Christmas, where things slow down at work. Chris and I decided to use our holiday vacation to get the company off the ground, to launch the Heroku AddOn. We then realized launching an AddOn meant building a cloud service…</p>
<p>Over those two weeks, or at least how I remember it, we had completed multi-organization support in Sentry, added in Stripe billing, and launched the product on top of Heroku. Stripe was a key ingredient that was extremely simple to integrate, especially with our silly naive business model at the time (a story for another post). While I’m sure I’m fudging the numbers a bit, I recall launching Sentry’s cloud service, a paid-only offering, to customers within a few weeks of starting development on it.</p>
<p><strong>We launched it and that same day we had our first paying customer. Seven dollars baby!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/sentry/heroku-addon.png" alt="Heroku AddOn"></p>
<p>Except it wasn’t that easy, and it took a lot of work to get to that point. It was certainly easy to add the billing functionality, and a few small features to the product, but that would not have been possible if not for the hundreds of hours already invested into the project, as well as the countless contributions from others. Let’s step back and talk a little bit about that, about how Sentry had <strong>product-market-fit from day one</strong>.</p>
<p>If you did the Math, you’ll note Sentry existed for about five years before we launched the cloud service. That was half a decade of natural needs-driven growth, either the needs of myself or the company I worked at, or the needs of others, users or contributors, who were running their own copy of Sentry at their own jobs. It’s often hard to understate how valuable this period of time was for Sentry, but I don’t think its as important <em>how much</em> time it was, but the way it was spent and the environment surrounding it. It was a passion for solving our own problems, compounded through peer validation. That validation often came through conversations at conferences, on GitHub, or on IRC. If you opened a ticket on the Sentry project you rarely waited long on triage and frequently new ideas or fixes were implemented the same day. I personally found a lot of satisfaction in that, but more importantly I believe it helped accelerate a product that was already solving real world needs, and build the trust thats so important in developer tools.</p>
<p>This is what I find somewhat difficult to translate to folks. One of the biggest challenges of a company is finding product-market fit, yet we had stumbled into it. So how do you replicate that? I don’t have an answer, but I genuinely believe that you are your own best customer. So when asked, I try to come up with the best advice I can, even if we didn’t directly face the same challenges. The advice I give folks is the best thing you can do is to find customers - yourself or others - that share the same desired outcome that you’re passionate about. In my case it was all about fixing the bugs I continuously created, and with less frustration. We found customers who understood that, and validated our ideas off of them. We did <em>not</em> however, listen to potential customers who wanted something that we disagreed with. I talk a little bit about this in <a href="https://cra.mr/optimizing-for-taste">Optimizing for Taste</a>, but I thoroughly believe the best path you have to building a lasting product is by building something you’re passionate about, and have a strong thesis around.</p>
<p>I actually think this phase of building Sentry the most fulfilling, and the least demanding. Once we spun up the cloud service it meant being on-call (2x the pain when you’re also on call at your day job), having real customers to support, and dealing with all the backoffice involved in generating revenue. That, however, is a story for next time.</p>
<p>If you liked this article, I’d appreciate a share. Feel free to also reach out on (ugh) X, I’m <a href="https://x.com/zeeg">@zeeg</a>. I’d especially be interested if there’s something you found helpful, or something you’d like to hear more about. I’ll probably write about our approach to pricing and packaging next, as its something I’ve become very passionate about over the years, and is particularly interesting due to how few companies there are like us in the IT space.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<i>
<time datetime="2023-11-01">

</time>
</i>
</p>
<p>Bear Blog has a few design constraints for speed, efficiency, and stability. There are many great open-source, privacy-focussed analytics platforms out there, but I wanted to build one native to Bear.</p>
<p><a href="#tldr">tldr;</a></p>
<p>One of my constraints for Bear is to not use client-side javascript. This applies to the analytics system as well. Client-side javascript can be tweaked to determine the authenticity of traffic to a page and determine (partially) whether it is bot traffic or not, which is very useful for analytics. The main downside, however, is that most adblockers block analytics scripts. And not just the bad ones, like Google Analytics. Even Fathom and Plausible analytics struggle with logging activity on adblocked browsers.</p>
<p>There's always the option of just parsing server logs, which gives a rough indication of the kinds of traffic accessing the server. Unfortunately all server traffic is generally seen as equal. Technically bots "should" have a user-agent that identifies them as a bot, but few identify that since they're trying to scrape information as a "person" using a browser. In essence, just using server logs for analytics gives a skewed perspective to traffic since a lot of it are search-engine crawlers and scrapers (and now GPT-based parsers).</p>
<p>So instead of using server logs, I trigger a read with CSS. Here's my slightly boutique analytics system.</p>
<p>When a person accesses the website the page is loaded.
On each page I have the following CSS:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>body</span><span>:</span><span>hover</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>border</span><span>-</span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>"/hit/{{ post.id }}/?ref={{ request.META.HTTP_REFERER }}"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The only info I need to actively re-add to this request is the referrer (yes, HTTP_REFERER is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer" target="_blank">spelt incorrectly</a>).</p>
<p>Now, when a person hovers their cursor over the page (or scrolls on mobile) it triggers <code>body:hover</code> which calls the URL for the post hit. I don't think any bots hover and instead just use JS to interact with the page, so I can, with reasonable certainty, assume that this is a human reader.</p>
<p>I then confirm the user-agent isn't a bot (which isn't perfect, but still something). I also extract the browser and platform from the user-agent string.</p>
<p>My second constraint is to not store any identifying information about the reader either in browser cookies, or on the server. In order to do this I use the IP address of the request to determine the country, then hash the IP address along with the date. All subsequent requests to the page are checked for matching IP address + date hashes and duplicates are discarded.</p>
<p>In this way each IP address per day constitutes one "read" of the page. No IP addresses are stored un-hashed and the IP-with-date-hash creates a convenient built-in expiry time.</p>
<p>Here's the code if you're interested:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>user_agent</span> <span>=</span> <span>httpagentparser</span><span>.</span><span>detect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>META</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HTTP_USER_AGENT'</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>))</span>
<span>if</span> <span>user_agent</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'bot'</span><span>,</span> <span>False</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Bot traffic'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span>

<span>ip_hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>hashlib</span><span>.</span><span>md5</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>client_ip</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>{</span><span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>date</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>))</span><span>.</span><span>hexdigest</span><span>()</span>

<span>if</span> <span>referrer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>referrer</span> <span>=</span> <span>urlparse</span><span>(</span><span>referrer</span><span>)</span>
    <span>referrer</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>{uri.scheme}</span><span>://</span><span>{uri.netloc}</span><span>/'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>=</span><span>referrer</span><span>)</span>

<span>Hit</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get_or_create</span><span>(</span>
    <span>post_id</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>pk</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ip_address</span><span>=</span><span>ip_hash</span><span>,</span>
    <span>referrer</span><span>=</span><span>referrer</span><span>,</span>

    <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>device</span><span>,</span>
    <span>browser</span><span>=</span><span>browser</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The only downside to this method is if there are multiple reads from the same IP address but on separate devices, it will still only be seen as one read. And I'm okay with that since it constitutes such a minor fragment of traffic. This provides an accurate count of reads and I feel is more concise and simpler than many other forms of analytics capture.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tldr;</h2>
<p>I use CSS to trigger a url analytics endpoint on <code>body:hover</code>, determine useful information from the IP address and user-agent, then hash the IP address with the date to create a unique "read" of a page.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Sweet merciful Jesus, I woke up this morning and my inbox was flooded with horrific stories about how employers treat people. I knew things were fucked, but this was <em>so</em> much worse than I imagined, and that's not even getting into the comments on Hackernews. I am going to dig into some of those emails, but first...</p>
<p>I usually don't waste time on the negative comments because <em>usually</em> the person making it has obviously gulped down so much corporate Kool-aid that I am afraid they will projectile vomit Agile terminology all over me, but there was <em>one</em> that was so funny that I had to share it.</p>
<p><a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/">With regards to my post on saving half a million dollars</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a high likelihood that many other people in the org were lightyears ahead of the author. It's even more likely that an engineer or manager in their group was "Banking" the inefficiencies to use during a cost-cutting period - and the author ruined that chance... which will inevitably cause massive suffering and possibly poor performance reviews when there is nothing to trim."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brother in Christ, I have a blog that is largely about corporate dysfunction and the soul-cost it imposes on well-meaning engineers, and you think that <em>I'm the problem because someone else was deliberately wasting money so that they could pretend to save it later</em>? In the words of the late Hitchens, "Do you see what brain rot descends on people?"</p>
<p>Incidentally that wasn't what was happening here, they really just never checked the database defaults. I'm sure someone is out there by 5-dimensional hyper-chess by deliberately going over the budget by a billion percent, but rest assured that this is not the simplest explanation. The whole idea that management must have a reason to do something this stupid is something I toyed with for a while, but it really only applies to the minority of cases.</p>
<h2 id="i-were-just-wasting-like-30-90-of-all-technical-productivity">I. We're Just Wasting Like 30-90% Of All Technical Productivity</h2>
<p>I am near <em>absolutely</em> convinced that the vast majority of our species' ability to produce things of value for the human race is just utterly squandered at large companies. I suspected we were wasting about 50%, but the volume of stories I got, frequently from <em>serious</em> companies, including some of the FAANG places that mere normal engineers like me look up at in awe while we worship at the altar of StackOverflow, just blew my mind. A lot of them involved doing variations of almost exactly what I did in different stacks, and every single time management just buried what happened.</p>
<p>If you recognize yourself in these emails but didn't give me permission to write an email, then it <em>isn't actually you</em>, it turns out these stories are so similar that they really do sound the same.</p>
<p>I received:</p>
<ol>
<li>A few stories about idling EC2 instances, totaling a total of about $4,000,000 saved <em>per month</em>, which management buried to avoid looking bad.</li>
<li>Another guy that discovered the same optimisations I made, with the same result from management.</li>
<li>Some security guys that just... I don't even know what to say about these stories, but <em>quite a few</em> stories were about finding out that a large proportion of a company's servers were infected with malware or mining cryptocurrency, which management, guess what, buried.</li>
<li>A guy, whose story deserves a whole post on its own, involving being told he's "not a team player" because he didn't stop someone else from flooding a server with crypto-bots.</li>
<li>Some people discovering other multi-million dollar optimisations that were ignored because they didn't have admin credentials, so they had to write suggestions which were ignored.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were some others, with a handful <em>genuinely</em> seeming to possibly add up to <em>billions</em> of dollars saved industry-wide, but the largest payout anyone ever received in the emails was $5K. Sampling bias, yadda yadda, listen, I'm pretty sure things are just fucked up.</p>
<p>The best story, which I have verified is true beyond all reasonable doubt, involved <em>literally saving a colleague's life with immense personal effort and in traumatic circumstances</em>, which was rewarded by <em>not</em> getting the rest of the day off and $50.</p>
<p>Like what the fuck is going on out there? I mean, I guess we already <em>know</em> what's going on out there - keeping a large company efficient is actually an unsolvable problem. I suspect that if you want to build a modern GPU, you just have to be able to sustain all that inefficiency or... you don't get to have anything that takes more than 50 people (or something in that range) to make. It's just all so much worse than I thought.</p>
<p>In fact, while a lot of those stories were bad, most of them <em>probably weren't the worst places</em> because most of the readers here are actually super talented engineers, which was evident from their excellent writing skills, open source contributions, and rugged good looks. The worst places <em>wouldn't have any talented engineers</em>. Like, Christ, let that sink in. It's like thinking you're in Hell with a few other people, desperately hanging on, then realizing that just in the next room is Super Hell which consists entirely of demons torturing each other. </p>
<p>Ack, it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. There's a team out there where the main drama isn't one right faction and one wrong faction, there are <em>two factions fighting to the death over how best to use a spreadsheet as a database for a production application</em>. I feel like this has to be stopped but I don't have the strength.</p>
<p>It is fucking <em>awful</em> out there. Maybe we should set up a support group.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-other-side">II. The Other Side</h2>
<p>The other thing I wanted to highlight is that there were <em>three</em> kinds of respondents, both via email and on Hackernews.</p>
<p>The first type, <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/">my favourite commenters</a>, whose grim-faced no-nonsense corporate visages grace standups across the world. Thanks to their fearless leadership and keen business sense, I have it on good authority that all projects are scheduled to move from red status to green status despite all those risks unfortunately materializing, which is no one's fault in particular. Despite the various challenges we have faced over the years and lack of forward progress, I think <em>this</em> retro is the one where things are going to change.</p>
<p>The second type, the vast majority, who read this stuff and immediately suffer flashbacks. My heart goes out to you, my kin. As a few people wrote in, don't let the bastards grind you down.</p>
<p>And the mythical third type, who <em>aren't sure whether my stories are real</em>. Like, they just <em>assume</em> that I must be making stuff up, because how could <em>anyone</em> do their work so ineffectively? God, I wish I was them. I read stories similar to mine and can just tell that they're true. I really, really wish I couldn't - if only I could toggle my brain back to that sweet pre-employment state, where I knew there would be some minor inefficiencies and I'd have a great time tackling them. Before I realized that wasting ten years of someone's career on a task that doesn't need to be done is actually a rounding error for many companies, <em>and</em> that some absolute clowns would spend all their time trying to gaslight their peers into believing the work was accomplishing anything.</p>
<p>Some of the third type are obviously actually also working at really stupid companies, but just accept the social fiction. It's probably good for them. However many of the others <em>actually work somewhere functional</em>, and their experience is so far divorced from the average engineer's that I only have <em>one</em> friend that has worked at both a good and a bad place - and I keep a <em>lot</em> of friends in the tech space between being pretty extroverted and this blog.</p>
<p>There's just some massive unwashed mass of utterly stupid companies where nothing makes any sense, and the only efficiencies exist in the department that generates the money to fund the other stupid stuff, and then a few places doing things <em>halfway</em> right. The places doing things right tend to be characterized by being small, <em>not</em> being obsessed with growth, and having calm, compassionate founders who still keep a hand on the wheel. And the people that work there <em>tend not to know the people that work elsewhere</em>. They're just in some blessed bubble where the dysfunction still exists in serious quantities, but that quantity is like 1/10th the intensity of what it is elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, it's really hard to tell these people apart.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I'm saying is, hold out hope. I'm aiming to keep a few conversations going with people via email that have made the jump, and I'm hoping to write up a guide on how to most effectively follow suit. If I can help even a handful of readers connect with like-minded peers and escape their hellish office settings, that would be enough good to last me a lifetime.</p>
<p><em>Plus</em> then I can probably do some corporate backstabbing and stay karma-positive. Take me to management, baby, I want to buy an expensive hammock.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/68350.html">https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/68350.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38095276">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>"Why does ACPI exist" - - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate, wait no let me start again.</p><p>Why does ACPI exist? In the beforetimes power management on x86 was done by jumping to an opaque BIOS entry point and hoping it would do the right thing. It frequently didn't. We called this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Power_Management">Advanced Power Management</a> (Advanced because before this power management involved custom drivers for every machine and everyone agreed that this was a bad idea), and it involved the firmware having to save and restore the state of every piece of hardware in the system. This meant that assumptions about hardware configuration were baked into the firmware - failed to program your graphics card exactly the way the BIOS expected? Hurrah! It's only saved and restored a subset of the state that you configured and now potential data corruption for you. The developers of ACPI made the reasonable decision that, well, maybe since the OS was the one setting state in the first place, the OS should restore it.</p><p>So far so good. But some state is fundamentally device specific, at a level that the OS generally ignores. How should this state be managed? One way to do that would be to have the OS know about the device specific details. Unfortunately that means you can't ship the computer without having OS support for it, which means having OS support for every device (exactly what we'd got away from with APM). This, uh, was not an option the PC industry seriously considered. The alternative is that you ship something that abstracts the details of the specific hardware and makes that abstraction available to the OS. This is what ACPI does, and it's also what things like Device Tree do. Both provide static information about how the platform is configured, which can then be consumed by the OS and avoid needing device-specific drivers or configuration to be built-in.</p><p>The main distinction between Device Tree and ACPI is that Device Tree is purely a description of the hardware that exists, and so still requires the OS to know what's possible - if you add a new type of power controller, for instance, you need to add a driver for that to the OS before you can express that via Device Tree. ACPI decided to include an interpreted language to allow vendors to expose functionality to the OS without the OS needing to know about the underlying hardware. So, for instance, ACPI allows you to associate a device with a function to power down that device. That function may, when executed, trigger a bunch of register accesses to a piece of hardware otherwise not exposed to the OS, and that hardware may then cut the power rail to the device to power it down entirely. And that can be done without the OS having to know anything about the control hardware.</p><p>How is this better than just calling into the firmware to do it? Because the fact that ACPI declares that it's going to access these registers means the OS can figure out that it shouldn't, because it might otherwise collide with what the firmware is doing. With APM we had no visibility into that - if the OS tried to touch the hardware at the same time APM did, boom, almost impossible to debug failures (This is why various hardware monitoring drivers refuse to load by default on Linux - the firmware declares that it's going to touch those registers itself, so Linux decides not to in order to avoid race conditions and potential hardware damage. In many cases the firmware offers a collaborative interface to obtain the same data, and a driver can be written to get that. <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807#c37">this bug comment</a> discusses this for a specific board)</p><p>Unfortunately ACPI doesn't entirely remove opaque firmware from the equation - ACPI methods can still trigger System Management Mode, which is basically a fancy way to say "Your computer stops running your OS, does something else for a while, and you have no idea what". This has all the same issues that APM did, in that if the hardware isn't in exactly the state the firmware expects, bad things can happen. While historically there were a bunch of ACPI-related issues because the spec didn't define every single possible scenario and also there was no conformance suite (eg, should the interpreter be multi-threaded? Not defined by spec, but influences whether a specific implementation will work or not!), these days overall compatibility is pretty solid and the vast majority of systems work just fine - but we do still have some issues that are largely associated with System Management Mode.</p><p>One example is a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220429030501.1909-3-mario.limonciello@amd.com/">recent Lenovo one</a>, where the firmware appears to try to poke the NVME drive on resume. There's some indication that this is intended to deal with transparently unlocking self-encrypting drives on resume, but it seems to do so without taking IOMMU configuration into account and so things explode. It's kind of understandable why a vendor would implement something like this, but it's also kind of understandable that doing so without OS cooperation may end badly.</p><p>This isn't something that ACPI enabled - in the absence of ACPI firmware vendors would just be doing this unilaterally with even less OS involvement and we'd probably have even more of these issues. Ideally we'd "simply" have hardware that didn't support transitioning back to opaque code, but we don't (ARM has basically the same issue with TrustZone). In the absence of the ideal world, by and large ACPI has been a net improvement in Linux compatibility on x86 systems. It certainly didn't remove the "Everything is Windows" mentality that many vendors have, but it meant we largely only needed to ensure that Linux behaved the same way as Windows in a finite number of ways (ie, the behaviour of the ACPI interpreter) rather than in every single hardware driver, and so the chances that a new machine will work out of the box are much greater than they were in the pre-ACPI period.</p><p>There's an alternative universe where we decided to teach the kernel about every piece of hardware it should run on. Fortunately (or, well, unfortunately) we've seen that in the ARM world. Most device-specific simply never reaches mainline, and most users are stuck running ancient kernels as a result. Imagine every x86 device vendor shipping their own kernel optimised for their hardware, and now imagine how well that works out given the quality of their firmware. Does that really seem better to you?</p><p>It's understandable why ACPI has a poor reputation. But it's also hard to figure out what would work better in the real world. We could have built something similar on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a> instead but the distinction wouldn't be terribly meaningful - we'd just have Forth instead of the ACPI bytecode language. Longing for a non-ACPI world without presenting something that's better and actually stands a reasonable chance of adoption doesn't make the world a better place.</p></div></div>]]></description>

There were several reasons for my decision but it mainly boiled down to me turning 30 this year, having an existential crisis questioning wtf I’m doing with my life and ultimately, realising I wasn’t having fun programming professionally anymore. I concluded that I needed some time away to fall back <em>“in love”</em> with programming, as a hobby with no financial strings attached to it. Obviously, I recognise this is an incredibly privileged thing to do, not working is something that many people can only dream of.</p><p id="9f97">So here I am, in my PJs after waking up at 12pm on a Tuesday, reflecting on my time working as a <em>“professional”</em> programmer, a career I’ve largely fallen into by accident.</p><h2 id="a992">Backstory</h2><p id="5883">I was never one of those kids that got into programming at 10 yrs old. When I was 10 I was at the cage in the estate next to my nan’s house shouting <em>”top bins!”</em> as I did my best Bend it Like Beckham impression (I’m still bitter I could never get the spiky hair going). Throughout my school life my main guiding heuristic was fun, I only ever did things I enjoyed. So when the time came to pick a degree I chose psychology because the syllabus looked cool and I’ve always found humans pretty interesting. Its funny, as I’ve gotten more experience as a developer one of the things that stand out to me the most is that there are a lot more human problems than people realise in any given software project. Problems that cant simply be coded away, so understanding humans has been surprisingly useful.</p><p id="d6f3">I’ve always been an avid reader of blogs and online publications. While at uni I has subscriptions to Scientific American, Wired, Arch Daily and Dezeen (what can I say, I’m a cultured guy). Toward the end of my time at uni there was a lot of buzz around CRISPR and self-driving cars. It was around then that I heard of neural networks for the first time. I think the fact that I understood the underlying analogy of neural nets was really important in helping me get over the subconscious mental barrier that I couldn’t be involved in technology in any other way than as a consumer.</p><p id="d770">Anyways, as I got toward the end of my degree I could no longer ignore the <em>”What are you going to do with psychology?”</em> question. After sitting on the question for some time I (naively) figured the three most important areas in the working world I could have an impact on were: humans, finance and technology. I knew I didn’t want to become a therapist because I had already been unofficially doing that for my friends and family for a while and peoples problems are tiring af. I’d always disliked finance (and still do tbh) so the only option left was technology.</p><p id="239c">I remember the day I wrote my fist line of code, it was 2nd of Jan 2016. I was 2 months away from 23. I started the day full of optimism and tried the python course on CodeAcademy (it was still free back then) and literally everything went over my head. I couldn’t grasp any of it. I remember feeling like an idiot for even thinking I could do this at 23. The failure confirmed the stereotypes I’d seen on TV, that if you didn’t start writing code at 10, then this wasn’t for you. Just as I was about to give up I decided to try CodeAcademy’s HTLM&amp;CSS course. To my surprise, I managed to whizz through it and firmly understood the material. I genuinely think if I hadn’t done that course I might have become an investment banker or something 🤢.</p><p id="49bf">Fast forward two years, an internship at AKQA, a shitty SWE job at a shitty startup, and then I got the offer to join the team I have just left. The best description of our role in the company is probably what AWS is to Amazon, the team manages the company’s internal infrastructure and data centre. Everything from procuring racks and servers; designing and implementing the data centres network topology; configuring servers and all the services that run on top (all the way up to JS for the interface used by other teams); configuring and running a bare metal Kubernetes (k8s) cluster and probably a lot more stuff that currently escapes my mind. It is a real diverse set of things to work on.</p><p id="b3ab">After exactly 5 yrs (to the day) with the team, I decided it was time to pack it all in for a bit. However, while the experiences are still fresh in my mind and I have some breathing space I want to go over the things I’ve learned and discovered in my journey from programmer training wheels to today, where I would describe myself as whatever the programming equivalent of puberty is.</p><h2 id="4ccc">Have an opinion</h2><p id="cca0">After my first year in the team, I remember asking one of our senior engineers for <strong><em>technical</em></strong> feedback. I asked him what I could do to improve. He told me a bunch of stuff but the one that stuck was,<em> ”have an opinion”</em>. Over the years I’ve thought about this a lot and I’ve come to the conclusion that having an opinion on a technical decision forces you to be able to justify that decision and to justify it you need a deeper understanding of that technology or choice.</p><p id="3ddb">I’ve always described SWEs as 15-year-old girls fighting over their favourite boy bands, jumping from one band to the next when something new and hot comes along. Having an opinion grounded in sound technical understanding can help calm that mental storm of feeling like you always need to keep up because you can either disagree with something based on evidence or can find connections between things based on your deeper understanding.</p><p id="51bd">I mean, he could have literally meant<em> ”fuck everyone, just bully your opinion onto people”</em> with no deeper meaning but this is how I’ve interpreted it. I guess you could say its just my opinion, innit.</p><h2 id="9aa0">Debugging is a science</h2><p id="13f7">Fast forward a few years and I was having some problems getting through tickets. Everything felt slow and laboured. I was struggling to get the last 10% of tickets working and over the line. I wasn’t really sure what to do and I guess others in the team picked up on it because our tech lead offered to take me for a coffee and some programmer therapy.</p><p id="bdf3">He asked me,<em> ”whats your approach to writing software?”</em>. At the time I remember thinking <em>”What do you mean bruv? The same as you obviously, I use a text editor.”</em>. I was a little confused by the question because I had never really thought about it. After some discussion we highlighted that my approach to writing code was akin to an artist throwing paint at a blank canvas, I tend to write what <strong><em>feels</em></strong> good. I also came to the realisation I didn’t really know how to debug code efficiently. I was fine debugging my own code but I would struggle to debug systems and components I was unfamiliar with. At the time a lot of my work was combining systems/components rather than writing fresh code myself, I was slightly out of my depth.</p><p id="6337">Debugging is a separate skill from writing code. It requires a different way of working and without deliberate practice, like anything, you won’t improve. Our tech lead told me, <em>”Writing code is creative, its like art. Debugging is like science, you need to formulate a small hypothesis and test it, then keep doing that till you’ve fixed the problem”</em>. That was incredibly eye-opening.</p><p id="29e4">Since that conversation, I’ve come to the conclusion that there are three main pillars of being a good software engineer: writing code, debugging code and reviewing code. We spend a lot of time focusing on and actively trying to improve the code-writing part but not so much on the other two. While I’m not a pair programming fanboy there are definitely times where its well worth sitting down and watching someone more experienced than you solve a problem, then comparing it to how you would do it and using that data to figure out how to improve. I would say that pair debugging and pair code review are just as important. You can speed run your personal development just by seeing what kind of questions the other person asks while reviewing and how they break down their debugging into testable chunks.</p><h2 id="299c">Pragmatic programming</h2><p id="2f56">Unlike my actual politics, I would describe my philosophy to software changes as <strong><em>small C</em></strong> conservative. I feel there needs to be a strong reason to make a drastic change to working code. Fundamentally, I believe giving your customers high-quality, working code trumps everything else. Customers really don’t care about how your team is collectively jerking off to memory-safe, perfectly functional code with no side effects. The end user doesn’t care if your code is readable, DRY, maintainable or spaghetti code. They care that the product works as intended and does so reliably.</p><p id="260c">As SWEs, I think we sometimes forget that. I would describe the team I just left’s approach to software delivery as pragmatic, working code trumps perfect code. It doesn’t matter if your code isn’t abstracted into a perfectly generic DSL, does that refactor need to happen? One of the things about gaining experience is you learn when to break the rules. You learn when its fine to copy and paste working code instead of trying to abstract it away, which then not only risks delaying that new feature or proof of concept but also risks breaking systems that we already know works well.</p><p id="65cd">I believe software gets complicated at the edges, at the points where systems interact with each other. Ensuring that the core of the system is as simple as possible to write, reason about and manage is the most important goal of any software project. I find saying <strong><em>no</em></strong> more often than saying <strong><em>yes</em></strong> makes reaching this target easier for everyone.</p><h2 id="31c9">You’re still a code parent even after you’ve merged and deployed</h2><p id="3b0c">Like everyone else, when the pandemic started we had a bunch of problems (other than the pandemic itself) transitioning from an in-office team to a remote team. During the first lockdown, we found ourselves in the office regularly doing maintenance and fixing fires. We’d always had monitoring but after this experience, we wanted to ramp up the observability of our systems.</p><p id="d79b">To hark back to my earlier point about human problems, throwing new tools at the problem is the easy part, the cultural change required for the tools to be useful is what’s actually hard. So we’ve just added tracing, that’s cool, now what?</p><p id="d3e8">You need to make sure your SWEs understand that they still have responsibilities even after their PR has been merged. They need to feel a sense of ownership over the entire system and lifecycle of a program/feature/change. Jenkins is broken? CI failed? We need to tweak the resources used by a service in our k8s cluster? It shouldn’t matter if a SWE mainly works on the frontend or backend or infrastructure, everyone should be able to jump in and fix the issue. It shouldn’t be any single persons responsibility, it should be <strong><em>our </em></strong>responsibility.</p><p id="f82e">Its this cultural change that necessitates the tooling. When SWEs realise its a pain to be consistently retroactive to fires instead of proactive to prevent the fire in the first place, they start thinking about the best ways to approach the problem. The solution and/or tooling is not important as long as it helps the team achieve their targets, its the collective desire of the team to ensure quality thats important.</p><h2 id="771a">Git — you’re doing it wrong (probably)</h2><p id="79c4">Although I said I’m a <strong><em>small C</em></strong> conservative, there are very few technology hills I’m willing to die on. After a convincing conversation, I’m happy to change my mind on most things, except git. Git is a hill I’m willing to die on.</p><p id="e11b">Every software team in the world has its own culture and ways of doing things, which is all good but when I see teams using git as a glorified <strong><em>`ctrl + s`</em></strong> it really breaks my heart.</p><p id="f524">This should be its own blog post (one I’m planning on writing) but these are some of my general issues with how I see teams use git. I apologise in advance for any hurt feelings but here goes…</p><p id="5c08">If you squash on merge, you’re doing it wrong. If you’ve never used git blame, you’re doing it wrong. If your repo’s history is useless, you’re doing it wrong. If you didn’t add a typo fix or white line change as a separate commit, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re commit message (when raising a PR) only consists of the words<em> ”fixup”</em> or a ticket number or a PR link, you’re doing it wrong. If you have a policy of one commit per PR, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re scared of a merge conflict, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p id="1278">In the time I’ve been working I’ve seen Jira projects change names, I’ve seen repos move from stash (bitbucket predecessor) to GitHub.com and then from GitHub.com to GitHub Enterprise. The only constant has been the <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> branch. As a tech company, as long as you’re in business the <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> branch will exist. Knowing that, it should be the single source of truth for your code base.</p><p id="551a">In my eyes, <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> has two main functions: firstly, it captures a moment in time. It shouldn’t redirect you to a ticket or PR, there is no guarantee either of those will exist. It should be self-encompassing. You shouldn’t try preserve history because I dont care about the journey or what discussions were had, all I care about is the final copy that got merged into <strong><em>`main`</em></strong>.</p><p id="ef4e">Secondly, its a forensic tool. You whip it out when something goes wrong and you need to go into NCIS mode. You should be able to meaningfully bisect <strong><em>`main` </em></strong>(read: without getting rid of whole features), you should be able to use <strong><em>`git blame`</em></strong> and be able to check the history of a line to see its accompanying changes. I dont wanna check the history of some line of code and see a whole heap of changes that have absolutely nothing to do with it because someone decided to fix a typo as part of some other work.</p><p id="1122">Your history should be clean and easily readable. Each commit should contain one logical change and ideally pass CI. If you dont know what that means its something that comes with experience but in a nutshell if you change some bit of code adding/removing/editing docs, comments and tests relevant to that change should all be a part of that commit. Nothing else, no typo fixes, no refactors, renaming another function etc, all of that should be separate commits. Your commit message should have a short title explaining the change and the body should go into as much detail as necessary into <strong><em>why</em></strong> the change took place, I can see the <strong><em>what</em></strong> from looking at the diff.</p><p id="1462">Ok, I’ll stop there before someone spontaneously combusts in flames of rage.</p><h2 id="5075">Hardware still matters</h2><p id="255c">We live in a world of abstractions. Whether its the cloud or the frameworks we use every day, we can sometimes forget that underneath it all everything is still running on physical computers somewhere.</p><p id="6794">Over the last five years, I’ve changed hard drives and SSDs; I added network cards to server chassis; I’ve diagnosed kernel panics on servers without BMC or IPMI interfaces by literally pushing in a trolley with a monitor and keyboard; I’ve installed device drivers for an array of weird devices; I’ve sat in hardware procure meetings; I’ve configured network switches; I’ve written kickstart files and configured `PXE` boots using MAC addresses; I’ve plugged ethernet cables in and out more times than I can count.</p><p id="408f">I may never again work in a team where I have a mental map of all the hardware we own or a team where <strong><em>`ssh`</em></strong> + <strong><em>`dmseg/journalctl`</em></strong> is the starting point of my debugging but the education I’ve had working on those systems will last me a lifetime. I’ve had a crash course in electrical engineering and computer science that I could have never gotten from any university in the world. I firmly believe its easier to go up the stack than it is to go down.</p><p id="0e64">In the outside world, there is a generation of people who only think in EC2s and AWS lambda’s and I dont blame them for that, its the world we live in. I just don’t believe that <strong><em>`ssh`</em></strong>-ing into a machine and digging around the file system using <strong><em>`vi`</em></strong> will ever not be a useful skill to have.</p><h2 id="8d4d">Being dumb is fun</h2><p id="1c7f">As I alluded to at the start of this post I’ve been playing both team and individual sports my whole life. One of the unique properties of sport is that you are viscerally aware of where you sit on the <strong><em>sucks</em></strong> -&gt; <strong><em>excellent</em></strong> spectrum. And if you are not sure someone will definitely let you know, whether its by running rings around you or literally shouting, <em>“Oi you’re fucking shit, go home”</em> across the field (true story, it’s happened to me). Inevitably, even if you’re a candidate with a realistic chance of going pro, at some point you’re going to suck.</p><p id="9d86">There are two ways you can deal with this: 1) actually go home and either leave the team or worse, leave the sport altogether, 2) suck it up and train harder so you can be the one telling people they’re shit. I’ve found that everyone who plays sports long enough is pretty competitive and doesn’t take criticism to heart in a way that people who haven’t sometimes do.</p><p id="c098">What’s this got to do with software engineering? I feel like there is a weird parallel, where there is a certain class of engineer, usually good at what they do and/or in positions of power, who are more than happy to tell you you’re shyte. They’re the type who don’t talk to you, they talk <strong><em>at</em></strong> you. The type who dont ever ask you questions in a conversation outside of <em>“What, you really dont know what X is??”</em>. The type who don’t explain things in an audience-appropriate manner, you either get it on their level or you dont.</p><p id="4323">As a normie, when I first met these types of engineers I didn’t know how to talk or deal with them. I’ve had engineers publically ask me, <em>“Did they not ask you what your favourite Linux distro is before they offered you the job?”</em> in a condescending tone when they discovered I didn’t know much about Linux. I’ve had engineers give me 101 comments on a PR starting with <em>“What the fuck is this…”</em> and ending with me coming in one morning to find the whole thing rewritten.</p><p id="7ac1">Over time I learned that while there are a bunch of them blowing hot smoke out their arses, there are also some who actually know what they’re talking about. The competitor in me always wants to improve so occasionally stroking their egos and making them feel like the smartest person in the room can lead to a lot of valuable and obscure bits of information that might have taken you months or years to discover by yourself. And in all honesty, it’s not that hard to do. It usually just involves you asking them a question and shutting the fuck up because as I said, they dont need more than themselves to carry a conversation.</p><p id="dbf3">I’ve also learnt that in any given team there are a lot more<em> me’s</em> than there are <em>them’s</em>. People who are confused but are too intimidated to ask questions or dont want to look stupid. As a result, I always pitch myself as the dumbest person in the room and ask all the stupid questions I can think of. Its beneficial for not only me but for others in the team too. Not everyone is comfortable playing this role or looking stupid in front of their peers but growing up being berated on a football pitch by your mate’s dad gives you some pretty thick skin.</p><h2 id="f07e">Fin</h2><p id="43d3">So that’s mostly what I can think of for now. It’ll be fun to come back in 7 yrs’ time to see what changed and what stayed the same in terms of my perspective on software engineering (if I’m still doing it), until then and in the wise words of Bill &amp; Ted, <em>“Be excellent to each other!”</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Distil-Whisper is trained on a <em>knowledge distillation</em> objective. Specifically, it is trained to minimise the KL divergence
between the distilled model and the Whisper model, as well as the cross-entropy loss on pseudo-labelled audio data.</p>
<p dir="auto">We train Distil-Whisper on a total of 22k hours of pseudo-labelled audio data, spanning 10 domains with over 18k speakers:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">This diverse audio dataset is paramount to ensuring robustness of Distil-Whisper to different datasets and domains.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, we use a WER filter to discard pseudo-labels where Whisper mis-transcribes or hallucinates. This greatly
improves WER performance of the downstream distilled model.</p>
