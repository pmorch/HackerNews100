<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The collapse of the UK’s social contract is leaving millions of low-income families “surviving not living” and forced to endure unacceptable levels of poverty, according to an independent cross-party report.</p><p>The <a href="https://povertystrategycommission.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Poverty Strategy Commission</a>, which seeks to forge a new national political consensus on reducing poverty, and which includes former ministers from the three main parties, says poverty levels are too high and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/18/uk-poorest-families-fall-in-living-standards" data-link-name="in body link">hardship is becoming more extreme</a>. It warns a “more of the same” approach to poverty in the future will fail.</p><p>It estimates the broad annual cost of significantly reducing poverty in the UK at £36bn – equivalent to £6,000 a year for 6 million families in poverty – a figure reached through a combination of benefits and wage increases, and investment to lower housing and energy costs, and improved health services.</p><p>The interim report of the commission, published on Tuesday, seeks to put poverty reduction back on the party political agenda before the next general election. It is concerned at the lack of urgency from the two main parties over the scale and nature of poverty, and society’s failure to offer adequate protection to its poorest.</p><p>The report says not only have overall relative poverty rates barely budged at between 21% and 24% over the past two decades, but even in areas where some progress was made – such as reducing pensioner and single-parent poverty – they have started to go into reverse.</p><p>It also highlights the rise in the proportion of people in poverty experiencing “deep poverty” – measured as at least 50% below the poverty line. It says nearly a third (31%) of those officially in hardship are in deep poverty and struggling to buy sufficient food, energy and clothes, pay rent and meet other everyday bills.</p><p>While the government often implies there is a “social contract” between state and citizen, the commission says in practice this does not exist, noting that the social security system routinely fails to protect people from poverty even when they are working, are unable to work through disability, or are pensioners.</p><p>Its interim recommendations include a 5% uplift in benefits and wages for people in poverty, outside any inflation increases, although it says poverty cannot be tackled by raising incomes alone, and highlights housing and childcare costs, the additional costs of disability, and energy and travel costs as areas to be addressed.</p><p>The chair of the commission, Lady Philippa Stroud, is a Tory peer and former political adviser to Iain Duncan Smith when he was welfare secretary between 2010 and 2016. She put the commission together to try to forge a new political momentum for tackling poverty, and attempt to engineer broad agreement over how it should be done.</p><p>She said: “Poverty in the UK is too high and the experiences of many people in poverty are now getting worse. Governments of all colours have worked hard to change that picture, but as a society, we have failed to make significant progress.”</p><figure id="cab65f60-5437-4c52-b253-5498a53c9ef9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:10,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/04/more-children-expected-to-arrive-at-uk-schools-with-dirty-clothes-and-hair&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;More children expected to arrive at UK schools with dirty clothes and hair&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;cab65f60-5437-4c52-b253-5498a53c9ef9&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The commission, which has been meeting for 18 months, includes the Conservative MP and former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and coalition minister David Laws, and the Labour MP and former Treasury minister Stephen Timms. Thinktanks from left and right, charities including the Trussell Trust food bank network, and academic experts are also members.</p><div><p>The commission member Miatta Fahnbulleh, the head of the New Economics Foundation, said: “Everyone in 21st-century Britain should be able to afford the basics they need to avoid poverty. It’s shameful that instead millions of families are on the edge of destitution.”</p><p>She added: “In recent years, we’ve made little progress in tackling the causes of poverty: low wages, an inadequate social security system and sky-rocketing housing costs. As the commission shows, the solutions are there to tackle these issues. What we need now is the collective will.”</p></div><p>The final report of the commission is expected to be published at the end of the year.</p><p>Mel Stride, the secretary of state for work and pensions said:<strong> </strong>“We have helped nearly two million people out of absolute poverty after housing costs since 2010, including 400,000 children, and it’s absolutely right we have a joined-up approach to ensure this downward trend continues.</p><p>“Our record financial support - benefits and pensions up by 10.1%, £900 in direct Cost of Living payments to some of the most financially vulnerable, and our boost to the National Living Wage – has cushioned those most in need from the worst of the cost of living pressures and we will continue to support them.</p><p>“I look forward to reading the commission’s full report next year, and continuing with a collaborative approach across government and society to reduce poverty and support the most vulnerable.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a technologist, hardware has always been my final frontier.</p>
<p>Things you can touch, things that create physical outcomes, these can have so much more power than software alone. But the cost of that power is complexity. Electrons don’t care about our ambitions. Circuits can be harder to debug than code. And even if everything works perfectly on the level of logic and voltage, you’re still managing the complexity of physical objects, their wiring, their position in space, and even their heat dissipation.</p>
<p>Building any product is hard, but building a hardware product is a superset of the basics of any product challenge, adding in the iron constraints of the physical world. It’s not enough to imagine how something looks: you have to also find a way to build it in a way that matches your imagination, while simultaneously accommodating all those physical constraints.</p>
<p>It’s work.</p>
<p>But also? It’s never been <em>easier</em> than it is today. I just built <a href="https://github.com/daniloc/ThermTerm" rel="nofollow">complete replacements for my heat pump controllers</a>. I hated those dinky remotes. You couldn’t read them in the dark at all, and programming them was about as bad as anything you remember from the bad old days of VCRs.</p>
<p>I imagined something that would solve their UI problems, <em>and</em> integrate my heat pumps into my home automation system. I’m not an electronics engineer, but my dreams are now real. I’ve got five of these across the house.</p>
<p><img src="https://redeem-tomorrow.com/images/uploads/dsc00023.jpg" alt="A thermostat-like thing, fully-custom made by me"></p>
<p><strong>Using open source code is a skill:</strong> knowing how to navigate repos and someone else’s code, understanding how to troubleshoot and navigate communities to get help, discerning between quality projects and junk… this experience is a hard-won component of being a modern software explorer. It can take you further than you might realize, past mere bits and into the land of electrons and atoms.</p>
<h2 id="of-course-microcontrollers">Of course: microcontrollers</h2>
<p>Arduino was a revolution in developer experience.</p>
<p>Beginners could write simple C code and and have a <em>physical computing experience</em> within the space of five minutes.</p>
<p>But since the advent of Arduino, the landscape of microcontroller boards—components that can be programmed to emit and receive complex electronic signals—has exploded.</p>
<p>Boards of every scale and configuration are available today, from the size of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich all the way down to a postage stamp. Microcontrollers are the foundation of the hardware adventure, allowing infinite iteration of custom logic on inexpensive components. Different designs sport different connectors and accessories. There are also different chip architectures out there, and boards built around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" rel="nofollow">ESP32</a>, or the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5526" rel="nofollow">Pico W</a>, even include WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.</p>
<p>Unifying all of this are software ecosystems. Open source Arduino code exists to solve so many kinds of problems, from networking to button handling. Regardless of your board’s architecture, there’s usually a port of the Arduino environment you can use, opening up all that code for your project. If you prefer Python, the <a href="https://micropython.org/" rel="nofollow">MicroPython</a> and <a href="https://circuitpython.org/" rel="nofollow">CircuitPython</a> projects even offer an alternative to C/C++.</p>
<p>But the ecosystem doesn’t stop at software.</p>
<h2 id="stemmaqt-and-qwiic-an-old-standard-with-new-strategy">StemmaQT and Qwiic: an old standard with new strategy</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" rel="nofollow">I2C</a> is a two wire serial data standard that dates to 1982. In practice, it looks and works a lot like USB: two more wires add power and ground, and you can chain dozens of devices together on a single bus.</p>
<p>For the typical hobbyist hardware tinkerer, the hardest challenge comes down to <em>circuit design</em>. Electronics is arcane, governed by both the laws of physics and decades of component lore. Building circuits means understanding how to use all of these to channel electrons consistently, without letting the magic smoke out. It means understanding how to adjust voltages, manage resistance, <em>and do it all in a way that’s physically sturdy and manageable</em>.</p>
<p>This is a tall order. I’ve never had the time or motivation to learn enough circuit design to build anything more complex than arrays of blinking lights.</p>
<p>But now, I don’t need to.</p>
<p>If you build modern software, you’re well-versed in <em>composition</em>: grab a handful of existing projects—a database here, a UI framework there, an HTTP library to round it all out—and arrange them together. You write your custom logic—the stuff unique to your project—and let other people’s code do work that’s common across all projects.</p>
<p>Thanks to I2C and a convenient cable standard—branded <strong><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt" rel="nofollow">StemmaQT</a></strong> by Adafruit, and <strong><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic" rel="nofollow">Qwiic</a></strong> by Sparkfun, two leading hobbyist component vendors—the same approach to composition is possible in an electronics project. Decide your requirements, and you can probably find a few boards you can quickly wire together—without soldering!—that will address your problem.</p>
<p>In the case of my heat pump controller:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691" rel="nofollow">ESP32-based microcontroller with a built-in screen</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4681" rel="nofollow">Light sensor</a>, so I can automatically dim the bright lights</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4636" rel="nofollow">Temperature and humidity sensor</a>, so I can have real data about the actual temperature in the room</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991" rel="nofollow">Rotary encoder board</a>, to make a dial for setting temperature and toggling power</li></ul>
<p><em>All of that</em> just plugs in via I2C. Each board, like a well-made library, abstracts its gnarly implementation details under the hood. You don’t worry about power management, or the details of how to interpret signals as input from a rotary encoder.</p>
<p><img src="https://redeem-tomorrow.com/images/uploads/264531564-6f04c1c9-9900-47f6-958d-a4b7f66801d4.jpeg" alt="Prototype with various components affixed to cardboard"></p>
<p>Instead, after wiring things together, you look up <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder" rel="nofollow">the example code</a> for each component, and adapt it to your project. In the past, actually using these components could be something of a mystery. But now vendors go to great lengths to maintain supporting libraries and docs—developer experience sells!</p>
<p>Adafruit deserves special mention here: they have hundreds of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018" rel="nofollow">useful, unique boards</a> that support this compositional approach, and their supporting materials are just exhaustive.</p>
<p>Again, if you know how to apply open source code, you can do this.</p>
<h2 id="from-imagination-to-physical-objects">From imagination to physical objects</h2>
<p>Once you create a working circuit, you can take it all a step further: design and manufacture your own custom enclosures.</p>
<p>It’s really kind of nuts: for $500, you can buy an <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/" rel="nofollow">incredible, reliable 3D printer from Prusa</a>. You can’t beat Prusa: the printers come out of the box working perfectly, they’re vertically integrated with Prusa’s excellent cross-platform <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/" rel="nofollow">slicer software</a>, and the user community is among the most active and helpful of anything on the internet. At that price, its build volume isn’t mammoth, but it doesn’t have to be for electronics projects.</p>
<p>Open hardware vendors often provide 3D models of their products you can bring into a CAD program. With these models, it’s possible to design plastic cases with perfect accuracy, allowing you to mount and arrange the various boards in your project.</p>
<p><img src="https://redeem-tomorrow.com/images/uploads/264529970-ef934ef7-89c7-4ac9-8dc7-f238c8ad32e6.jpeg" alt="CAD model of the device's internals"></p>
<p>Best of all, iteration is fast and cheap. Trying a new version of a design takes only a few cents of material and time to print it. You can figure out quickly if your approach is working. Remember heat dissipation? Waste heat from the microcontroller was biasing my temperature sensor. It only took a couple evenings to find an iteration of the case that solved the problem (I moved both sensors to the top side of the enclosure).</p>
<p>There is a learning curve to 3D printing. It might be the steepest factor here, in fact. Like electronics, 3D printing also has constraints to manage: you have to work with both heat and gravity, and design your models with that collaboration in mind. The physics of how layers are deposited impacts the strength and durability of your output, so the orientation at which you print can have consequences. Choice of materials also matters. I found <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/petg-filament-all-you-need-to-know/" rel="nofollow">PETG</a> to be the ideal material for this kind of work: it’s easy to work with and super durable. By contrast, the more common <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/what-is-pla-plastic-material-properties/" rel="nofollow">PLA</a> was too brittle.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to pick up some CAD skills, but this is less painful and more fun than you might imagine. CAD seems to be the fine art of sketching simple flat shapes, pulling and pushing them into 3D objects, and carving away at small details. I couldn’t stand most of the affordable desktop CAD software—it feels icky, like using a poorly-aged Flash app in IE6. Then I found <a href="https://www.shapr3d.com/" rel="nofollow">Shapr3D</a>, for iPad.</p>
<p>This is some futuristic shit. You tap away with your Apple Pencil, on a tablet computer, drawing things out of your imagination. You nudge your sketches into models, which turn into prints. There’s something far more intuitive about this process than using keyboard and mouse. The positive future shock makes me delirious if I dwell on it.</p>
<p>Community is everything to learning emerging skills. Hobbyists are deeply engaged with 3D printing, and you’ll find help for everything from planning your models to debugging thermal drama with your prints.</p>
<h2 id="i-think-you-should-try-it">I think you should try it</h2>
<p>I’ve been dreaming of building my own electronics since I was a kid. I spent so many afternoons at Radio Shack, and even tried my hand at the occasional kit, with limited success. Every few years in adulthood, I’ve given it another try, observing a steady downward trend in difficulty.</p>
<p>I’m telling you: we’re at a special moment here. The labor savings of open source, the composability, the fun: all of it has come to hardware. You can build things that solve real problems for yourself. I first imagined my heat pump devices over a year ago, and I have been frustrated they didn’t exist every day since.</p>
<p>Now my dreams are real, and the largest energy consumer in the house can be automated and remotely controlled.</p>
<p>That’s amazing.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <article>
          <div>
              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>“Howdy Joseph,” the July email I got from Zdravko Krivokapić, who was the Prime Minister of Montenegro until last year, read.</p><p>Obviously, this wasn’t actually Krivokapić emailing me. Instead, it was a hacker who had gained access to what seemed to be Krivokapić’s personal Gmail account. The hackers proceeded to send me a mass of alleged documents from the government of Montenegro, including some related to the country’s Ministry of Finance. Alongside those, the hacker also sent photos of cash, flashy watches, and weapons, which appear to be from the hacker’s own collection and not the former Prime Minister’s.</p><p>Beyond wanting to flex their access to Krivokapić’s account, the hacker said they might use the compromised email to then target other services, using the former Prime Minster’s identity as a cover. It’s unclear how successful that attempt may have been, but the brazenness of emailing a journalist from an official’s email account did highlight something gaining popularity in the digital underground. Hackers are compromising the email accounts of government and law enforcement officials, selling them on the open market, and in some cases using that access to trick social media giants and other legitimate companies to hand over their customers' data. Desired targets include TikTok, Discord, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. The groups where these email accounts are often advertised include criminals who use personal information to target people for harassment, extortion, or physical violence.</p><p>The hacker’s initial email to me ended with “LOL.”</p><div><p>💡</p><p><strong>Do you know anything else about fraudulent use of EDRs? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></p></div><p>Cybercriminals sell access to these compromised government accounts across a variety of forums and groups chats, especially on the messaging app Telegram. One person who is a reputable seller of personal information on Telegram also claims to be selling such email accounts. One screenshot they shared on Telegram shows an inbox allegedly belonging to a Brazilian municipality; the seller said they are offering accounts for $400 each. In another post and accompanying screenshot, they claimed to have access to an FBI email account.</p><p>A second apparent seller wrote in one popular Telegram group they are “SELLING INDIAN GOV MAILS, $100 A PIECE, CAN ACCESS FB LAW PANEL/EDR IG/FB ACCS.” The post adds they are selling “other third world gov mails” for $50 each.</p><p>Other messages viewed by 404 Media advertise emails belonging to the governments of Thailand, the UK, Germany, Bangladesh, and Nepal.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Many of the adverts explicitly say that buyers can use these email accounts to then make Emergency Data Requests, or EDRs. EDRs are a common mechanism across social media or tech companies designed to provide user data to law enforcement in high stakes situations. This, for example, might include a child kidnapping, where authorities may need data quickly in an attempt to apprehend a suspect or locate a victim.</p><p>One Telegram group where government emails are being explicitly advertised as a way to gain access to sensitive user data <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-secret-weapon-hackers-can-use-to-dox-nearly-anyone-in-america-for-15-tlo-usinfosearch-transunion/">is focused on physical violence against targets</a>. Here, members can hire one another to perform shootings, stabbings, robberies, and more. </p><p>Companies each have their own way for handling EDRs, be that a locked-off web portal or a dedicated department to contact. But they typically require anyone requesting data to contact the company from an official government or law enforcement agency email address.</p><p>That’s why these compromised accounts are so valuable to criminals. They allow hackers to tap into a stream of data that is usually off limits, simply by pretending to be a law enforcement officer. In March last year <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/?ref=404media.co">cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs reported</a> on the rise of fraudulent EDR requests among cybercriminals and pointed to a specific case involving Discord. A day later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/apple-meta-gave-user-data-to-hackers-who-forged-legal-requests?ref=404media.co#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple and Meta had given up user data in response to such demands.</p><p>In more recent Telegram messages, 404 Media has seen criminals specifically discuss the ability to make fraudulent EDRs with TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and GoDaddy. Others have shown interest in targeting Discord and Snapchat.</p><p>Meta told 404 Media it blocks known compromised accounts from making requests to its dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT).</p><p>TikTok confirmed to 404 Media it more commonly sees fraudulent requests from people impersonating law enforcement agencies in foreign countries. TikTok said it has successfully blocked some fraudulent requests, but declined to say whether any have managed to get through. TikTok added it has additional safeguards in place to vet EDRs and tools to protect those requests.</p><p>A Discord spokesperson told 404 Media in a statement that “Like any company, we are obligated to comply with law enforcement requests. To ensure the legitimacy of requests from law enforcement, we follow thorough guidelines to carefully evaluate them and ensure they come from a genuine source and that they are not overly broad or vague.”</p><p>Snapchat and GoDaddy did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Krivokapić, the former Prime Minister of Montenegro who a hacker appeared to have targeted, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>Update: this piece has been updated with a statement from Discord.</em></p>

This project is incomplete and in active development.<br>
Feel free to help out by filing issues and creating PRs!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project uses <strong><a href="https://nodejs.org/en" rel="nofollow">Node 16+</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">NPM</a></strong> for compilation and testing.</p>

<p dir="auto">Clone the repository and install dependencies with:</p>

<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Wat2Wasm Directly ( Recommended )</h2>
<p dir="auto">For syntax highlighting and up-to-date builds, you can <strong>optionally</strong> use the official <strong><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">WebAssembly Binary Toolkit</a></strong> which will provide you with a <code>wat2wasm</code> CLI tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">If it is found on your path as <code>wat2wasm</code>, it will be used instead of <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt" rel="nofollow">NPM WABT</a></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>While it is strictly optional, it can help with debugging.</em></p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recommended Editor</h2>
<p dir="auto">We recommend using <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VSCode</a></strong> with the <strong><a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/wati">WATI</a></strong> extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">This should provide syntax highlighting, intellisense, and other helpful features as you work through the exercises.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivations</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've found just diving in to be the best way to build experience with programming.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href="https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings">Ziglings</a></strong> have both had tremendous returns to my journeys with both languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">WebAssembly (and by extension WAT) has a more sparse educational landscape than most and I was hoping to fill some of the gaps by building a project with the same sort of structure.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pedagogical Philosophy</h2>
<p dir="auto">Outlined here are some thoughts on what makes a good teaching experience.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Typing Over Reading</h3>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to learn by doing. Comments on each file outline a task and some background. However, a lot about a language can be gleaned by its syntax alone. We should be adding <strong>as little</strong> explanation as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Occasional gaps in knowledge can be filled by consistent exposure to the syntax within different contexts. Certain things can therefore be learned without any mention.</p>
<p dir="auto">Introduction text is superfluous. Words add visual noise, so we should be careful with our count. Coding itself should supplement ambiguities in the text.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find a text confusing or too verbose, <strong>please create a discussion post</strong>!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create Struggle</h3>
<p dir="auto">Studies have shown that one cannot learn effectively without effort. This applies to practically every domain of knowledge. These projects should be educational, not easy.</p>
<p dir="auto">This does not mean we should make the education itself elusive. We should not make learning more difficult, but instead more intentional.</p>
<p dir="auto">When introducing a lot of new syntax, keep the problem scope small, but force the user to read a bit. If the syntax is not new, increase the problem scope. Maybe many variations of the same task.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>30. 08. 2023</p><p><strong>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.uochb.cz/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IOCB of the CAS</a>, the <a href="https://www.fzu.cz/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Physics of the CAS</a> and <a href="https://www.upol.cz/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palacký University Olomouc</a> have made a groundbreaking discovery – using an advanced method of scanning electron microscopy, they’ve managed to image not only the inside of a molecule, but also the structure of the electron shell of the atom. Their experiment was the first in the world to confirm the non-uniform distribution of electron density in aromatic molecules and the existence of the so-called π-hole. </strong><strong>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. </strong><strong>The study was published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40593-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications</a></em>.</strong></p><div>
			<p>The scientists focused their experiments on aromatic hydrocarbons. Anthracene, benzene, naphthalene, and other aromatic molecules have so-called pi electrons located above and below the carbon skeleton. “However, if we replace the peripheral hydrogens with more electronegative atoms or groups of atoms that pull electrons away, the originally negatively charged clouds turn into positively charged electron holes – π-holes [pi-holes],” explains Pavel Hobza from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS (IOCB Prague), who contributed significantly to the research in question.</p>
<p>The researcher likens the aromatic molecule to a volcano. When the volcano erupts, a huge crater appears underneath, and we can imagine this as the π-hole. Pavel Hobza explains more in the following video (English subtitles available):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="/system/modules/cz.osw.opencms.types/elements/cookies/content_is_blocked.html" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tgiob7vePk?si=F9Od0r45OJS6myIN" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. In fact, black holes were theorized for decades as well before experiments proved and confirmed their existence. The same research team involved in the discovery of the π-hole had already achieved great success with their previous study, which was published in <em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science</a></em> in 2021, in which they proved the existence of so-called sigma-holes (σ-holes).</p>
<p>“The confirmation of the existence of the π-hole, as well as the σ-hole before it, fully demonstrates the quality of the theoretical predictions of quantum chemistry, which have accounted for both phenomena for decades. It shows that they can be relied upon even in the absence of available experiments,” Hobza explains.</p>

<p><strong>Unique microscopes<br></strong>The above-mentioned discoveries have been made thanks to the unique scanning electron microscopy available at the Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute (CATRIN). “Thanks to our previous experience with the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) technique, we have been able to refine our measurements and acquire very complete data sets that have helped us to deepen our understanding not only of how the charge is distributed in the molecules but also of what observables are obtained with the technique,” says Bruno de la Torre, head of the research group at CATRIN.</p>
<p>A better knowledge of the distribution of the electron charge will help scientists understand a number of chemical and biological processes. In practice, this will translate into the ability to build new supramolecules and subsequently develop advanced nanomaterials with improved properties.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone, I’m FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington, and I’m here to discuss security updates for IoT devices and how you can make a difference by filing comments with the FCC.</p><p>As you know, serious vulnerabilities are common in IoT, and it often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user devices—if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update, and if the device was even designed to receive them. Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.</p><p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.</p><p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].</p><p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.</p><p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.</p><p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.</p><p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   
I’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well. Thank you!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-security-updates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-secur...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices/simington-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[4] If your comments are purely in response to arguments made in other comments, you have an extra 15 days, until October 10, 2023.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm i @measured/puck --save"><pre><code>npm i @measured/puck --save
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or generate a puck application using a recipe</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx create-puck-app my-app"><pre>npx create-puck-app my-app</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recipes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck is a React component that can be easily integrated into your existing application. We also provide helpful recipes for common use cases:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/recipes/next"><strong>next</strong></a>: Next.js app example</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck can be configured to work with plugins. Plugins can extend the functionality to support novel functionality.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Official plugins</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer"><code>heading-analyzer</code></a>: Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessiblity standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing a plugin</h3>
<p dir="auto">The plugin API follows a React paradigm. Each plugin passed to the Puck editor can provide three functions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>renderRoot</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root node of the preview content</li>
<li><code>renderRootFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root fields</li>
<li><code>renderFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the fields for the currently selected component</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each render function receives the <code>children</code> prop, which you must render, and the <code>data</code> prop, which can be used to read the data model.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">Here's a basic plugin that renders a "My plugin" heading in the root field area:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myPlugin = {
  renderRootFields: (props) => (
    <div>
      {props.children}

      <h2>My plugin</h2>
    </div>
  ),
};"><pre><span>const</span> <span>myPlugin</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>renderRootFields</span>: <span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>}</span>

      <span>&lt;</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span>My plugin<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>

<p><strong>TEXAS</strong> - Today, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced the upcoming sale of the Federal Helium System assets, currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as directed by Congress under the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013. In accordance with that law, BLM is required to sunset its management of the system and report any excess helium and helium assets to GSA to follow the statutory disposal process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sale process, planned to start July 12, 2023, will include the Cliffside Gas Plant, Federally owned Plant Equipment, Mineral Rights, Helium Storage Reservoir, Natural Gas Wells, and Federal Helium Pipeline. GSA expects the sales process will take between 8 and 9 months, and will engage with industry and stakeholders throughout to ensure an orderly and efficient transfer of assets.</p>

<p>The Cliffside Gas Plant, located at 13301 Brickplant Road, Amarillo, TX, is situated on two leased parcels of land totaling 8.108 acres near Amarillo, Texas. The property encompasses a range of primary and support buildings, including offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, laboratories, and storage areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Helium System is also comprised of plant equipment, including a booster compressor, natural gas chiller skid, metering equipment, spare parts, emergency generators, storage tanks, and other machinery critical to the helium enrichment process. Some of the plant equipment is privately owned, with the BLM maintaining operational and minor maintenance responsibilities through a lease agreement.</p>

<div><p>In addition to the facilities, the sale encompasses Mineral Rights acquired by the Federal Government from 1930 to 1942. These subsurface ownership interests cover approximately 38,000 acres of gas and approximately 60 acres of oil resources, providing an opportunity for future exploration and development.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The Helium Storage Reservoir, known as the Bush Dome, is a natural geologic formation located approximately 3,000 feet below the surface. The reservoir has historically held up to 44 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of helium, which includes both federally owned stored helium and native helium commingled with natural gas. At the time of disposal, it is estimated that the storage reservoir will contain approximately 4 plus Bcf of proven and prospective federally owned helium (native and reserve), approximately 2 Bcf of privately owned helium, along with approximately 60 Bcf of federally owned natural gas (<a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/helium/helium-statistical-reports">according to BLM Helium Operations Statistical Report Issued June 2022</a>).</p><p>
&nbsp;
The Federal Helium System further encompasses a network of 23 natural gas wells some of which serve as high-pressure injection wells. These wells have been instrumental in supplying natural gas to the system, and they offer potential opportunities for ongoing production and utilization.</p><p>
&nbsp;
Crucial to the system's operation is the Federal Helium Pipeline, which spans approximately 423.24 miles, connecting the Cliffside Field to privately owned helium refineries across Northern Texas, the Oklahoma panhandle, and Southern Kansas. The pipeline facilitates the production, transmission, storage, and delivery of crude helium to refineries. The Federal Helium Pipeline works in conjunction with privately owned refineries and BLM and typically delivers more than 2 million cubic feet (MMcf) of crude helium per day to the refiners. It has been a reliable conduit, delivering millions of cubic feet of crude helium daily.</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Android was <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html">initially announced</a> in 2007 by the Open Handset Alliance (headed by Google) their flagship project was billed as an "open platform", "providing developers a new level of openness", and giving them "complete access to handset capabilities and tools".</p>
<p>We've come a long way since then, steadily retreating from openness &amp; user control of devices, and shifting towards a far more locked-down vendor-controlled world.</p>
<p>The next step of Android's evolution is Android 14 (API v34, codename Upside-Down Cake) and it takes more steps down that path. In this new release, the restrictions around certificate authority (CA) certificates become significantly tighter, and appear to make it impossible to modify the set of trusted certificates at all, even on fully rooted devices.</p>
<p>If you're an Android developer, tester, reverse engineer, or anybody else interested in directly controlling who your device trusts, this is going to create some new challenges.</p>
<p>Before we get into the finer details, first I want to talk a little about the context around Android CA management and how we got here, but if you want to jump to the latest details you can go straight to the <a href="#enter-android-14">Enter Android 14</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem"><a href="#open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem" aria-label="open software open device open ecosystem permalink"></a>"Open Software, Open Device, Open Ecosystem"</h2>
<p>While the initial principles of Android were very much focused on open software, controllable by users and developers, over more recent years Android has increasingly limited the control of users, developers &amp; researchers over their own devices.</p>
<p>The key turning point in this process was Android 7 (Nougat, released in 2016) in which the certificate authorities (CAs) on the device that were previously fully modifiable by the owner of the phone were <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html">split in two</a>: one fixed list of CAs provided by the OS vendor and used by default by every app on your phone, and another set of user-modifiable CAs that users could control, but which was used only for apps that specifically opted in (i.e. almost none).</p>
<p>The set of CAs on a device is a small configuration setting with big consequences, as your device's trusted CAs are the organizations guaranteeing the security of your encrypted network traffic. A CA can issue TLS certificates (as used in HTTPS to secure all communication on the web) for any domain name they like, and anybody who trusts that CA will trust those certificates as evidence of a secure &amp; legitimate connection to that domain.</p>
<p>That also means though that if you create your own CA and trust it then you can intercept your own HTTPS or other TLS traffic, to see exactly what your phone is sending &amp; receiving, and potentially modify or block it. Being able to configure your device's CAs is key to this.</p>
<p>That is a lot of power. Making this difficult to modify accidentally for non-technical users and impossible to modify without user knowledge is certainly reasonable. At the same time however, being able to control this is critical for privacy &amp; security research, reverse engineering, app debugging &amp; testing, for assorted enterprise internal network configurations, for anybody who doesn't trust one of the standard CAs provided by their vendor, and many other cases.</p>
<p>With that one change in Android Nougat in 2016, each of those use cases became significantly more challenging. It became impossible for users on normal devices to control who was trusted to secure the communication of apps on their own devices, and a substantial hurdle was created that directly transferred power from users to vendors &amp; third-party app developers.</p>
<h2 id="rooting-around-the-nougat-problem"><a href="#rooting-around-the-nougat-problem" aria-label="rooting around the nougat problem permalink"></a>Rooting around the Nougat problem</h2>
<p>Although this is very inconvenient, fortunately it's long been possible to root Android devices, allowing full administrative access over the device, and making it possible to work around these kinds of restrictions. This isn't officially encouraged by Google, but it's been sufficient as a workaround to allow researchers, developers &amp; reverse engineers to take control of their own devices for these advanced use cases.</p>
<p>By doing so, it was possible to deal with Android Nougat's restrictions on rooted devices, manually adding the trusted certificate to the system store via the filesystem, injecting them into the <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts/</code> directory.</p>
<p>This is a bit harder than it sounds, because <code>/system</code> is generally read-only, even on rooted devices. There are two main ways to solve that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make <code>/system</code> directory writable (requires a little reconfiguration &amp; a device reboot) and then manually modify the real system certificates directory.</li>
<li>Mount a temporary read-write filesystem over the top of the read-only directory, copy the existing CA certs into there, and then add your own additions on top too.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case there are a few other steps required to ensure that the certificates have the appropriate naming, permissions, and SELinux labels to be accepted by the system (for more low-level details and discussion see <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/intercepting-android-https/">this post</a>), but it's relatively simple and HTTP Toolkit has long automated the temporary mount-based process (see <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server/blob/aa453e9df98491c549aa4b97b90618f1cf808e17/src/interceptors/android/adb-commands.ts#L256-L308">the certificate injection script here</a>). In practice, this means it's possible to provide one-click automated interception setup for any rooted Android device or emulator.</p>
<p>These approaches have been effective not only on custom rooted devices and specialized Android distributions, but even in most of Google's own official emulator images (everything except the full 'Google Play' edition images, which are locked down to match a normal OEM device) not to mention other emulators from Genymotion to Bluestacks.</p>
<p>Easy &amp; effective CA setup has powered myriad tools that let you see what apps on your phone are sending &amp; receiving: helping developers to debug their networking issues, keeping app developers honest about the data they share, and shining a light on security vulnerabilities in both apps &amp; their APIs.</p>
<p>These techniques are used by HTTP Toolkit's automatic setup, but also referenced in the setup guides for similar tools like <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/#3-insert-certificate-into-system-certificate-store">mitmproxy</a>, in <a href="https://awakened1712.github.io/hacking/hacking-install-ca-android/">endless</a> <a href="https://binary-manu.github.io/binary-is-better/android/add-certificates-to-android-ca-store">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/configuring-burp-suite-with-android-nougat#install-burp-ca-as-a-system-level-trusted-ca">posts</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46569793/68051">StackOverflow answers</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tutorial-how-to-install-custom-ssl-certificates-root-etc-on-bluestacks-4-5.4513773/">forum threads</a>, widely used in tools including <a href="https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts">popular Magisk packages</a> and by organizations like the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/ImportRootCert#CAcert_system_trusted_certificates_.28without_lockscreen.29">community-run CA cacert.org</a>.</p>
<p>These are widespread techniques that have worked for many years. Although the required root access has become more a little challenging more recently (due to first SafetyNet and later 'Play Integrity' using attestation to allow apps to block users who use rooted devices) this solution has generally been quite manageable, and a just-about-acceptable balance between "inconvenient enough to disuade users unaware of the implications" and "accessible to power users who know what they're doing".</p>
<h2 id="enter-android-14"><a href="#enter-android-14" aria-label="enter android 14 permalink"></a>Enter Android 14</h2>
<p>Right now, Android 14 is currently in its final stages of beta testing, slated for imminent release within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>One of its headline new security features is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-root-certificates-updatable/">remotely updatable CA certificates</a>, which extracts management of CA certificates from the core OS image entirely, and moves it into a separately updateable component, delivered &amp; updated via Google Play. This allows for faster CA updates for Google, allowing them to revoke trust of problematic or failing CAs on all Android 14+ devices with just a Google Play System Update, without waiting for each phone vendor to release an OTA update for the whole operating system.</p>
<p>Although I'm sure you can see what's coming, let me caveat first: at a very high level, the goal here is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>CAs trusted by default like this are in a powerful position, and there needs to be serious oversight &amp; consequences to ensure they stick to their responsibilities and continue to justify that trust. When they fail to do so, it's important that this power is taken away quickly, before it can be abused.</p>
<p>In the most notable recent case, in January 2023 TrustCor was untrusted as a CA by effectively everybody (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/sustaining-digital-certificate-security_13.html">including Google</a>), after close ties to a malware-distributing organization and associated US defence/intelligence contractor were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/02/mozilla_microsoft_trustcor/">discovered</a>.</p>
<p>In the other direction, the inability to widely distribute &amp; trust new CA certificates has caused issues for new CAs on the block such as Let's Encrypt, who have had to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html">repeatedly delay the rollout</a> of improvements to their signing chain, because old Android devices missing recent CA root certificates would not have trusted them, and would thereby have been locked out of significant parts of the web.</p>
<p>Mechanisms to improve the responsiveness of this system are valuable. In addition to just speeding up removals &amp; additions, this should also widen access to those updates, since even devices for which vendors no longer offer official OS updates can continue to receive system component updates like this via Google Play for significantly longer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, despite those sensible goals, the reality of the implementation has serious consequences: system CA certificates are no longer loaded from <code>/system</code>, and when using root access to either directly modify or mount over the new location on disk, all changes are ignored by all apps on the device. Uh oh.</p>
<h2 id="the-mechanics"><a href="#the-mechanics" aria-label="the mechanics permalink"></a>The mechanics</h2>
<p>The key change to enable this is <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933">here</a>. Instead of reading from the venerable <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts</code> directory, this new approach reads certificates from <code>/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts</code>, when it exists.</p>
<p>That root <code>/apex</code> path is where Android Pony EXpress (APEX) containers are mounted. These APEX modules are independently updatable system components, delivered as signed &amp; immutable containers. In this case, the certificates form part of Android's <code>com.android.conscrypt</code> module - its core TLS/SSL library delivered as an independently updatable system module.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind APEX are challenging to fully understand, as many low-level details seem undocumented, and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/apex/+/master/docs/howto.md">what documentation there is</a> includes links to key details only available within Google's internal sites. Tessting the resulting behaviour though, it seems that this is using some kinds of containerization primitives to expose the mounted content directly to individual processes, resulting in surprising behaviour when trying to modify these files elsewhere. As a result, delivering content through an APEX module makes it much harder (seemingly impossible) to manually modify, even with full administrative control.</p>
<p>It's easy to test this for yourself, using the latest Android 14 beta official emulators. Both the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and 'Play Services' images have always allowed root access (unlike the 'Google Play' images) and by creating an emulator using those you can easily open a root shell.</p>
<p>Follow either of the two existing techniques though, and the expected updates do nothing. Let's walk through a demo.</p>
<p>First, set up your device. You'll need the Android SDK installed, and you probably want <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>, since it makes this much easier, although you can use the CLI directly if you like.</p>
<p>First, create an emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the Android Studio UI, select any device model, and the API 34 'Google APIs' image for your architecture.</li>
<li>Or, using the Android SDK tools on the CLI, run <code>avdmanager create avd -n TestAVD -k 'system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64'</code> (your architecture may vary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's try messing with temporary mounts and see what we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your emulator, via the UI or <code>emulator -avd TestAVD</code></li>
<li>Open a root shell via <code>adb shell</code>, then <code>su</code></li>
<li>
<p>Try mounting an empty temporary filesystem over the various <code>cacerts</code> directories now present:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts_google
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt@340818022/cacerts
<span># N.b. that last @id may vary in future updates</span></code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the emulator, open Settings -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; More -&gt; Encryption -&gt; Trusted Credentials</p>
<p>Under the 'System' tab, all the certificates you've just hidden from view on disk are there!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, where's this coming from?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can try searching the entire filesystem to find the source of this data. For example, the top certificate shown is from 'ACCV'. You can also find that in Android's sources <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/refs/heads/main/files/3c9a4d3b.0">here</a>, and it's present both there and in unmodified Android CA cert folders as <code>3c9a4d3b.0</code>. We can search for this with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>find</span> <span>.</span> -name 3c9a4d3b.0 <span>2</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span>/dev/null</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>It doesn't exist!</li>
</ul>
<p>But in fact, it does: remove your 4 mounts again (<code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code>), retry that <code>find</code> command, and you'll see that this is indeed present in the original <code>cacerts</code> directories.</p>
<p>Try the exact same steps with an Android 13 image, and you'll find that this modifies the certs just fine, and the Settings certificates list appears entirely empty, as expected:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/54003/android-empty-system-certs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="An Android device showing an empty 'Trusted Credentials' list" title="An Android device showing an empty 'Trusted Credentials' list" src="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/54003/android-empty-system-certs.png" srcset="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/0a77b/android-empty-system-certs.png 256w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Let's try another route and see if we can rewrite the system image filesystem directly to modify this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stop your emulator, and restart it from the CLI with a writable system partition:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code>emulator -avd TestAVD -writable-system</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make everything writable:</p>
<div data-language="text">
      <pre><code>adb root
adb remount
adb shell avbctl disable-verification
adb reboot
adb root
adb remount</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can delete all the normal certificates now (fair warning: this may create problems when using this emulator in future!) with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
<span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts_google/*</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>You'll find that you can't delete the certs from <code>/apex</code> though! Despite the remount, it's read-only, and <code>mount -o remount,rw ...</code> commands to do so manually will all fail.</li>
<li>The closest you can do, so far as I can tell, is to unmount the certificates entirely with <code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code> so that they don't appear in the output of <code>mount</code> at all.</li>
<li>Doesn't matter though: no matter how aggressive you get, seemingly no matter how much of the emulator's relevant internals you delete, AFAICT there's nothing you can do to stop these certs all happily loading up in the 'Trusted' list in the Settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>As in with the other method, those same steps will work just fine on every other version of Android, up until now.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't just a detail about the Settings app, where these are cached or stored elsewhere. The certificates as shown here are reloaded each time, and they're representative of every app's view of the certificate store.</p>
<p>No matter what you modify on the filesystem, every app will continue to see Google's list of CA certificates regardless. I've been playing with this for a while, and as far as I can tell there's no working method to modify the certs anybody sees.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-on-here"><a href="#what-is-going-on-here" aria-label="what is going on here permalink"></a>What is going on here?</h2>
<p>It's hard to tell precisely, so I'm guessing &amp; inferring here (but if anybody does have more information, I'd love to hear it! Get in touch <a href="https://toot.cafe/@pimterry">on Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pimterry">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/contact/">directly</a>).</p>
<p>I think the most likely case is that as part of the wider modularization of Android, these system files and components are now exposed to apps through an entirely different mechanism. It looks clear from the Android internals that they're still being <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933/core/java/android/security/net/config/DirectoryCertificateSource.java#64">read from disk</a> and the code to do so hasn't changed in many years, so this implies not everybody is seeing the same filesystem. This is similar to how Docker and friends use chroot, overlay filesystems and mounts to run containers with an isolated view of system files and other devices.</p>
<p>Clearly, this has some serious consequences.</p>
<p>As touched on above: if you're configuring your own system CA certificates on Android right now for debugging, reverse engineering, testing or research, that option is going away in Android 14, and presumably all future versions too.</p>
<p>For now anybody interested in these use cases will just have to avoid updating, or use custom OS releases that don't use the APEX module to manage their CA certs. As time goes by though, this will likely become increasingly impractical, since it means either diverging strongly from Android mainline on a key internal component or running outdated software indefinitely.</p>
<p>Concerningly though, this also implies that APEX system modules are going to be a wider problem. If, as it appears, content within APEX modules is unmodifiable to users even with root access to the device, then every future system component that's moved into the remit of APEX is another part of Android that becomes completely removed from user control.</p>
<p>More investigation is required and it's hard to know the full implications of that now, but for the many forks of Android like GrapheneOS &amp; LineageOS, and for advanced device configuration tools like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk#readme">Magisk</a> and its many modules, it probably spells trouble.</p>
<p>Personally, for now I'm investigating some other promising alternative solutions to allow interception of your own network traffic on Android, and I'll share details here as soon as I have something working, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to debug your own HTTPS traffic, you'll need to stick to Android 13.</p>

<p>When a customer asked Pedro Júnior to bring the food he was delivering up to their apartment, he’d weigh his options: Take his bulky (and often heavy) bag up with him, or leave it behind and risk it being stolen? Júnior, who works for a food delivery app, has had his bag stolen twice already on the streets of Rio de Janeiro. One night, he told <em>Rest of World</em>, someone tried to steal his motorbike. “I came back to see someone had tampered with the chain with which I lock up my baby,” he said, using the pet name he has for his bike. That was the last straw. From then on, Júnior pledged that customers would either come down to get their food — or they’d go without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers pushed back, often reacting rudely when Júnior told them they’d need to come down to collect their order. So he turned to TikTok, and a trend was born: Júnior posts videos of himself arguing with customers over the intercom, while eating the unretrieved meals and singing a song he’s made up. “Se não descer, eu como mesmo,” it goes. (“If you don’t come down, I’ll eat it”). In one video, Júnior dances to the song with a group of other delivery drivers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lgdastart/video/7220429469759098117">song’s debut went viral</a>, with 7.6 million views on TikTok and thousands of expressions of solidarity from customers and also workers who faced the same issue. Soon, other delivery drivers followed Júnior’s lead and began creating their own videos.</p>



<p>The social media trend showed how customers’ insistence on doorstep delivery is a common problem for Brazil’s almost 386,000 delivery app workers. It has since escalated into motorbike protests, with drivers honking and loudly revving up their bikes in front of apartment buildings. They have also taken their demands to local lawmakers. In two state capitals, Fortaleza and Porto Velho, delivery drivers have won the right to refuse requests to deliver inside apartment buildings.</p>



<p>According to Rappi and iFood, which control over 90% of Brazil’s app delivery market, drivers do not need to make doorstep deliveries. On paper, representatives from both companies told <em>Rest of World</em>, their rules already require delivery workers to only go as far as a street-level point of contact, from which customers are asked to collect their meals.</p>



<p>A common worry among drivers is that their cycles, motorbikes, or bags might be stolen if left unattended. Most buildings don’t allow them to park inside, workers told <em>Rest of World</em>, forcing them to leave their vehicles and delivery bags on the street. The bags frequently contain two or three orders as the apps assign them multiple deliveries along the same route. To avoid having the other orders stolen, the bags must also go up with the drivers.</p>

<p>But drivers also want to save time, as the process of getting through Brazil’s heavily guarded buildings can be time-consuming. It often involves checking in with a concierge and handing over an ID. Sometimes, biometric photo-registration may be required. The minutes spent delivering an order to the customer’s doorstep is time they could be using to complete other potential orders. “The more orders we deliver, the more money we make,” Júnior said.</p>



<p>When a customer refuses to come down, many now follow Júnior’s lead. They refuse, in turn, to deliver the order.&nbsp;Júnior said he tries to return undelivered meals when possible, but some restaurants, like McDonald’s — a frequent order in his videos — don’t accept returns and advise him to throw the food away. “When they tell me to toss [a meal], my understanding is that I’m free to do whatever I want with it,” he said. “I’m not going to throw it out, so either I give it to a homeless person, eat it myself, or take it home to my son.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond TikTok, delivery workers also vent to colleagues in Telegram groups. Videos on gig worker chat groups and on social media often show drivers being verbally assaulted by customers for refusing to carry an order upstairs. Recently, a popular delivery driver-turned-YouTuber made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23bYAUEZpLI">video</a> reacting to the humiliation of fellow drivers by customers. In one scene, a customer walks away with the food and ignores the driver’s plea for the delivery code — which confirms to the app that an order has been completed — hampering his ability to take other orders.</p>



<p>Arguments with customers have often escalated and <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">led to violence</a>. In December 2022, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2022/12/12/entregadores-fazem-mais-um-protesto-no-df-apos-nova-briga-entre-motoboy-e-cliente-veja-video.ghtml">media reports </a>highlighted altercations between app users and delivery workers across Brasília — a few of which <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">got physical</a>.</p>



<p>Given how often customers react aggressively, many drivers end up agreeing to take orders upstairs. “If we don’t, we risk getting a bad review from the client or even having our accounts reported,” Wellington Lopes, a delivery worker in Rio de Janeiro, told <em>Rest of World.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As episodes of violence piled up in Brasília and surrounding cities, the Federal District Association for App Workers and Motorcyclists (ATAM-DF), an app workers’ organization, took legal action. They reached out to Fábio Félix, a local legislator from Brasília, who has been following app workers’ demands since 2019.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no, it really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Abel Santos, vice president of the association, told <em>Rest of World</em> the workers created a draft bill and sent it over to Felix’s legal team for consideration. The draft, which establishes that workers should not be obligated to deliver within apartment buildings, is now being discussed in Brasília’s local legislature. Like Fortaleza’s existing doorstep delivery law, the Brasília draft provides exemptions for customers with reduced mobility or special needs.</p>



<p>According to Danilo Lopes, a councilman from Fortaleza, the widespread support for his city’s doorstep delivery law can also be attributed to its benefits for customers. “On the side of residents, there’s a fear of insecurity, as thieves have been passing themselves off as delivery drivers to gain access to apartments and commit robberies,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Projects aiming to grant workers the right to refuse doorstep delivery have so far been approved in three Brazilian cities: Valadares, Porto Velho, and Fortaleza. At least two others — Brasília and Manaus — are currently considering implementing similar legislation, with Rio de Janeiro considering a statewide law.</p>



<p>In Brasília, workers haven’t been waiting idly by as lawmakers discuss their petitions. They’ve been organizing on messaging apps, and protesting in front of the buildings where violence between workers and customers has taken place, across the city’s many upper-class neighborhoods. The local delivery workers’ association has not publicly endorsed the protests because its members are already involved with the draft bill and in legal proceedings helping some workers.</p>



<p>Júnior claimed his iFood account was blocked without explanation after he began posting videos; he doesn’t dismiss the possibility of a connection between the two. He’s now looking to get back into deliveries. “I’ll keep making videos,” he said, but added that he’d stop recording himself eating orders to minimize the risk of being blocked again. “IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no,” said Júnior. “It really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs">https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37390184">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">This is a currently maintained fork of SSHFS</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS (original repo: <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs</a>) has been declared to be unmaintained and it breaks our heart. So me and some friends have decided to fork it and give it some love.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's a rust fork in progress by Greg Shuflin (<a href="https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust">https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust</a>). Rust is a modern and memory safe programming language, and in the long term, it's not a bad decision to port it to rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are some downsides to Rust, such as it being still a young language, unstable API changes, it not having a standard specification yet, and long and compute-intensive compilation process etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">So from a maintenance perspective, we are just here to fix issues, merge PRs, and give this project some love until the rust fork is ready (maybe even backport changes/features from there for a period of time).</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone is welcome to create issues or PRs, please do contribute!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SSHFS</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH
servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is
very simple to use - there's nothing to do on the server-side.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present SSHFS does not have any active, regular contributors, and
there are a number of known issues (see the <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/issues">bugtracker</a>).  The current
maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once sshfs is installed (see next section) running it is very simple:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint"><pre><code>sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended to run SSHFS as regular user (not as root).  For
this to work the mountpoint must be owned by the user.  If username is
omitted SSHFS will use the local username. If the directory is
omitted, SSHFS will mount the (remote) home directory.  If you need to
enter a password sshfs will ask for it (actually it just runs ssh
which asks for the password if needed).</p>
<p dir="auto">Also many ssh options can be specified (see the manual pages for
<em>sftp(1)</em> and <em>ssh_config(5)</em>), including the remote port number
(<code>-oport=PORT</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">To unmount the filesystem:</p>

<p dir="auto">On BSD and macOS, to unmount the filesystem:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, download the latest SSHFS release from
<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases</a>. You also need <a href="http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a> 3.1.0 or newer (or a
similar library that provides a libfuse3 compatible interface for your operating
system). Finally, you need the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/" rel="nofollow">Glib</a> library with development headers (which should be
available from your operating system's package manager).</p>
<p dir="auto">To build and install, we recommend to use <a href="http://mesonbuild.com/" rel="nofollow">Meson</a> (version 0.38 or
newer) and <a href="https://ninja-build.org/" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>.  After extracting the sshfs tarball, create a
(temporary) build directory and run Meson:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson .."><pre><code>$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson ..
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you
nevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the <em>mesonconf</em>
command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option"><pre><code>$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To build, test and install SSHFS, you then use Ninja (running the
tests requires the <a href="http://www.pytest.org/" rel="nofollow">py.test</a> Python module):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install"><pre><code>$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">If you need help, please ask on the <a href="mailto:fuse-sshfs@lists.sourceforge.net">fuse-sshfs@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
mailing list (subscribe at
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-sshfs" rel="nofollow">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-sshfs</a>).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>F</span></span>ather’s Day is dangerous for Robert Nurden. Childless not through choice but, as he puts it, “complacency, bad luck, bad judgment”, he tries to stay indoors and ignore the family celebrations outside.</p><p>But one year, he went for a walk. “I met family after family. There were children everywhere,” he remembered. “It was terrible. Just so painful. So many ambushes and triggers for my anguish.”</p><p>There is very little research into men who have not had children, although that is beginning to change. Research by <a href="https://www.robinhadley.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Dr Robin Hadley</a> has found that 25% of men over 42 do not have children – 5% more than women of the same age group.</p><p>Half of the men who are not fathers but wanted to be describe a huge grief and isolation from society. Almost 40% have experienced depression and a quarter feel a deep anger.</p><p>Now 72, Nurden had a sheltered upbringing. Reaching adulthood, there was a lot he wanted to experience. “Having children was a very low priority. I was complacent: I just assumed it would happen,” he said.</p><p>It was not until he was in his early 40s that Nurden started to get broody. But by that point, he discovered, women of a similar age had already had children, if they were able or wanted to.</p><p>“I went into this 15-year period of not going into relationships or ending relationships quickly because I knew that person wasn’t going to want or be able to have a child with me – or that the relationship wasn’t going to be strong enough to last if we did have a child,” said Nurden.</p><p>He said high-profile older fathers breed complacency in ordinary men. “If I’m honest, even when I was in my 50s I believed that it might happen for me. But in real life, the Mick Jagger and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/18/jon-snow-channel-4-late-fatherhood" data-link-name="in body link">Jon Snow-age fathers</a> are actually very rare – and in any case, it’s medically not wise, as regards sperm quality.”</p><p>What compounded Nurden’s pain was that there was no public or private discussion about how men feel when circumstance leaves them unable to become fathers.</p><p>“There’s lots of publicity, quite rightly, about women and childlessness but men are very mute about this. Married men don’t want to hear it either: I’ve had men with children react with anger, as though they feel threatened, when I’ve tried to talk about my pain,” he said.</p><p>“I was mute too until recently, because as I aged, I found the regret grew into a great pain,” he added. “Unlike many other forms of grief, this compounds itself as it gets older: I wasn’t a father but now I’m not a grandfather. When I’m even older, I might find myself entirely alone.”</p><p>Nurden has published a book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195698230-i-always-wanted-to-be-a-dad" data-link-name="in body link">I Always Wanted to be a Dad: Men Without Children</a>, about his story and that of some other men. “It turns out that there is a lot of pain, regret and sadness out there,” he said.</p><p>Hadley, the researcher, is childless because although his wife had wanted children, by the time she and Hadley met, her age meant the risk of having one was too great. “I chose love but that doesn’t make the pain of not having children any less,” he said. “When a close colleague had his first child, I was so jealous that I couldn’t be in the same room as him.”</p><p>Being a father is a marker of status in many countries, said Hadley, but not in the west. “While there has recently been a lot more public discussion about how to be a good father, we still don’t have any narrative or celebration about how important it is for men to become a father in the first place,” he said.</p><p>Paul Goulden, the chair of <a href="https://www.awwoc.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Ageing Without Children,</a> said that, along with the lack of public dialogue about becoming a father, he was “not convinced that there’s this Game of Thrones genetic push felt by men to have children”.</p><p>Instead, he said: “There’s this mistaken belief that men are fertile across their lifespan, so there’s no imperative to get on with it.”</p><p>That complacency persists because men without children historically have not spoken about their grief. But, Goulden said: “I hope Robert’s book will trigger a change in public dialogue around this issue. I think there’s an overwhelming sense of loneliness and fear out there about who is going to be there for these men, when they’re old and all alone.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you ever get a chance to look through the classic Amiga OS source-code still floating around some murky corners of the internet, it is a thing of beauty and astonishing capabilities. It’s an inspirational piece of computing history with unmatched capabilities for the time. Remember, this was all originally on a computer released in the 1980s with 512Kb memory, a 7Mhz 68000 16-bit CPU, and a single floppy drive with 880Kb storage. On these limited specs, AmigaOS provided a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system, a full set of GUI primatives and built-in “Workbench” interface, expansion card auto-configuration and a fully-featured filesystem with some unique and powerful capabilities. Although to be fair, the AmigaDOS parts do literally come from a different time (and possibly planet) - but more on that later.</p>

<p>Oh and of course, there was that amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set">chipset</a> that meant even that humble base can do things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wpXOsEm7M0" target="_blank">this</a> - while PCs of the time were basically  office boxes that occasionally bleeped and home computers still loaded games from cassette tape. There’s understandably a lot of on-line interest in those parts of the Amiga as they’re the most impressive in an obvious “wow!” way. But while that was what drew me to the Amiga when I was a kid (and the demo/cracking/bbs scene heavily influenced me) I’ve always been more of a systems geek at heart.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved building tools and platforms, and have long been fascinated with the world of operating systems. Apart from reading through the source code (where that’s legally available, of course…) I think there’s no better way to explore and understand a system - and the mindset that produced it - than to develop for it.</p>

<p>What follows is a brain-dump of what I’ve learned about developing for the AmigaOS, both on classic 68k-powered hardware to modern PowerPC systems like the <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2018/10/10/new-amiga-x5000/">X5000</a>. I’ll cover development environments, modern workflows like CI builds on containerised infrastructure, distribution of packages and even a look back in time before <code>C</code> existed, thanks to AmigaDOS’s odd heritage.</p>

There’s plenty of guides and videos on setting up an old-school game or demo-coding environment, but all of what follows is in the context of developing a systems tool in <code>C</code> as that’s the language of AmigaOS. I started a real-life <a href="https://www.markround.com/projects/#setcmd">project</a> partly to solve a small problem I had (switching between different versions of commands/tools at the Amiga CLI) but mainly to explore and dig deeper into the OS that influenced me so much as a teenager. <code>SetCmd</code> was the result, and is a very simple AmigaOS 4 PowerPC <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/setcmd">package</a>. I’m working (very slowly) on porting it to run on classic AmigaOS and variants but it has to be said this is my first time writing C in any meaningful capacity beyond wrestling with pointers at University. The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd">GitHub</a> if you want to take a look but bear in mind despite having owned Amigas since they were released, I’m a total newbie at most of this! I wrote it to have fun, explore the AmigaOS, set up build environments and figure out how to package it up for re-distribution. I have <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/categories/#amiga">written</a> a bit about my development setup in the past, but things have changed a fair bit since then - so without further ado, here’s my development environment and thoughts in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="sdk-updates">SDK Updates</h2>
<p>Whilst things do move at a glacial pace in the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS_4">AmigaOS 4/PPC</a>, there have been a few big updates. A-EON’s <a href="http://wiki.amiga.org/index.php?title=Enhancer_Software" target="_blank">Enhancer Software</a> has had several releases, each adding new applications and developer APIs. As well as shipping their own versions of key Amiga OS applications and utilities, they also now are installing several core AmigaDOS command replacements. I tend to skip the installation of these as I’ve encountered a few edge cases where they don’t <em>quite</em> behave like the original OS 4 commands, but from recent discussions online it appears as if they are preparing for their own “clean-room” re-implementation and modernisation of Amiga OS 4. Presumably in order to free themselves from the eternal legal shenanigans with Hyperion et al. I’m not going to get into that raging dumpster fire here, but it’ll be interesting to see what comes of this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/sdk-03.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-200-579a9e856.webp 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-300.0-579a9e856.webp 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-400-579a9e856.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-200-a5839a0e7.png 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-300.0-a5839a0e7.png 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-400-a5839a0e7.png 2.0x" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-250-a5839a0e7.png"></picture></a> 
On the Hyperion side, they released a big <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/component/content/article/300-new-amigaos-41-sdk-5334-available-now" target="_blank">SDK Update</a> for OS 4 including updated GCC toolchains, cross-compilers, profilers and loads of updated SDKs. Bearing in mind the ancient GCC 4.x toolchain that had been in place for years it was great to have a more modern environment. On the classic Amiga front, Hyperion have also been pushing ahead with their updated AmigaOS 3.x OS for 68k-powered Amigas. Now on version 3.2.2.1 (I’ve got my boxed set of CD and <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/12/30/back-to-the-floppy/">floppy disks</a>) there have also been several NDK (“Native Developer Kit”) <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/component/content/article/297-native-developer-kit-for-amigaos-32-ndk-32-release-3-available-for-immediate-download" target="_blank">Updates</a> providing updated APIs and tools. AmiKit also released a great “all-in-one” environment called <a href="https://www.amikit.amiga.sk/devpack">DevPack</a> which includes a huge range of languages (C, Assembly, Amos, Lua, Basic…) and NDKs all configured and ready to go. As a quick and easy way of setting up a development environment on classic Amigas, it’s hard to beat and saves a lot of manual downloading, configuring and glue-ing everything together.</p>

<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/08/06/my-os4-development-environment/">last update</a> 3 years ago, I’d more or-less settled on using a GUI VIM derivative. While I’m still a die-hard VIM user at $DAYJOB, I really appreciate the modern comforts of e.g. VSCode. Thanks to the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/walkero-gr/">George Sokianos</a>, there is now a OS 4 <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=showfile&amp;file=utility/text/edit/litexl.lha">package</a> of the awesome <a href="https://lite-xl.com/en/">Lite-XL</a> editor along with a comprehensive set of plugins. Here’s what a hacking session on my X5000 looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/setcmd.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-200-5dadd9ab5.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-400-5dadd9ab5.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-5dadd9ab5.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-1600-5dadd9ab5.webp 1600w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-200-9cc0c6e47.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-400-9cc0c6e47.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-9cc0c6e47.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-1600-9cc0c6e47.png 1600w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-9cc0c6e47.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>In that session you can see alongside LiteXL two terminal windows: I’m compiling <em>and</em> running the PowerPC and classic 68k versions of <code>setcmd</code> thanks to the cross-compilers and native “Petunia” JIT 68k emulation built into OS 4. More on that later, but while we’re talking about classic Amigas…</p>

<h2 id="native-hardware">Native hardware</h2>
<p>Emulation is fine, but nothing beats running on the actual hardware! In the <a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/amigaland.jpg">lead image</a> to this article you can see my treasured <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/03/18/two-worlds-meet/">Amiga 1200</a> (with older 8-bit friend in the background running my <a href="https://tnfs.markround.com/">TNFS site</a>) expanded with an <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2020/07/21/apollo-vampire-amiga-1200-review/">Apollo Vampire</a> accelerator. An Ethernet or Wifi adapter is more or less essential though when it comes to transferring data around and fortunately the Vampire card is capable of network connectivity, high-resolution display and other niceities but can easily be switched back to a more “stock” environment. I do still occasionally use my licensed copy of <a href="https://www.softwareandcircuits.com/division/amiga/products/cubic/screenshots.html">CubicIDE</a> but due to the age of this architecture, I tend to keep my tools light and have settled on the simple <a href="http://aminet.net/package/text/edit/JanoEditor">Jano</a> editor or sometimes <a href="http://www.cygnused.de/index-en.php">CygnusEd</a> for old time’s sake.</p>

<p>My build toolchain is provided by Devpack and it’s included <a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc/">VBCC</a> compiler. I use the <code>vbcc_target_m68k-amigaos</code> target with this <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/src.68k/makefile">makefile</a> to build:</p>

<h2 id="modern-development">Modern development</h2>
<p>I’m (sadly) not always in front of my Amigas, but these days a modern laptop and cloud-native tools offer a lot of flexibility particularly with the advanced state of emulation. I use VSCode as my editor, and a containerised cross-compiler toolchain built by - again! - George Sokianos to target both 68k and PPC platforms. I can build my project on any system capable of running OCI containers, e.g.</p>

<div><pre><code>docker run <span>\</span>
  <span>--user</span> <span>$UID</span>:<span>$GID</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>-v</span> ./:/opt/code <span>\</span>
  walkero/docker4amigavbcc:latest-m68k-amd64 <span>\</span>
  make <span>-f</span> makefile.docker
</code></pre></div>

<p>Testing and running the code is made easy by the very advanced state of emulators. On Windows, <a href="https://www.winuae.net/">WinUAE</a> is the gold standard and can emulate everything from an original 1985-vintage A1000 up to modern systems with PowerPC accelerators, graphics cards and other devices. I have it multi-booting into clean Hyperion and Commodore/classic OS environments, with my source code directory shared as a virtual hard-drive:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/laptop.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-200-f0e9958be.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-400-f0e9958be.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-800-f0e9958be.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-1600-f0e9958be.webp 1600w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-200-7b38685a9.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-400-7b38685a9.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-800-7b38685a9.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-1600-7b38685a9.png 1600w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/laptop-800-7b38685a9.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>I can compile in seconds with Docker, and then straight away test the resulting binary in my emulated Amiga. Source-code is kept up to date between systems using Git; on the Amiga X5000 I use the port of SimpleGit, which is now bundled with the latest Hyperion SDK under <code>SDK:c/sgit</code>. I haven’t yet found a suitable Git solution for the classic Amigas, so on those I use a makeshift AmigaDOS shell script that uses <a href="http://www.onyxsoft.se/backup.html">Backup</a> to copy files over to a network mount in an <code>rsync</code> -like fashion.</p>

<p>I also keep meaning to test running AmigaOS 4.1 under <a href="https://www.amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2023-03-00113-EN.html">QEMU</a> as support for this has greatly improved and looks a lot simpler than the currently convoluted process of getting “classic OS 4” running on an emulated 68k Amiga with PPC accelerator configured. But for now, the WinUAE approach is working pretty well.</p>

<p>Another advantage of having a containerised build-chain is that combined with Git and <a href="https://drone.io/">Drone</a> running on my personal Kubernetes clusters, I can build and package my code with a simple <code>git push</code> wherever I am:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/drone.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-200-c8bffc6c3.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-400-c8bffc6c3.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-800-c8bffc6c3.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-1600-c8bffc6c3.webp 1600w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-200-a1132c150.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-400-a1132c150.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-800-a1132c150.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-1600-a1132c150.png 1600w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/drone-800-a1132c150.png"></picture></a></p>

<h2 id="amigados-is-weird">AmigaDOS is weird</h2>
<p>Although AmigaOS is frequently lauded for it’s sophistication and elegance, there is a notable “oddness” about the AmigaDOS components which handle storage I/O, devices and filesystems. The original developers of the Amiga had an ambitious DOS system planned, but in the end Commodore had to purchase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPOS">Tripos</a> operating system and port parts of it to the Amiga due to deadline challenges. This mismatch is all the more pronounced as Tripos was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL">BCPL</a> - which in turn, influenced the <code>B</code> programming language which begat the <code>C</code> we all know and… well, tolerate, in my case. So it really is looking back into computing history and remnants of this still remain even in the “modern” AmigaOS 4.x and other derivatives.</p>

<p>Once you start diving into AmigaDOS code, you end up face-to-face with this legacy and need to convert back and forth with BCPL and C data-types. For example, BCPL strings are not <code>NULL</code>-terminated, instead they have a length in the first byte and then the characters follow. And pointers are similarly alien. This is why my code has stuff like this littered through it:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>// Convert the new node to a BPTR</span>
    <span>new_node_bptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>MKBADDR</span><span>(</span><span>new_node</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Set the new path</span>
    <span>cli</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cli_CommandDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>new_node_bptr</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the NDK include file <code>dos.h</code> explains: “All BCPL data must be long word aligned.  BCPL pointers are the long word address (i.e byte address divided by 4 (»2))”. It also includes helper functions like <code>MKBADDR</code> to help with the conversion as most DOS system calls use BCPL pointers in arguments:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>/* Convert BPTR to typical C pointer */</span>
<span>#define BADDR(x)	((APTR)((ULONG)(x) &lt;&lt; 2))
</span><span>/* Convert address into a BPTR */</span>
<span>#define MKBADDR(x)	(((LONG)(x)) &gt;&gt; 2)
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>All in all, a fascinating look back into an obscure branch of computing history, but it hasn’t furthered my appreciation of pointers any!</p>

<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/dist.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-200-87c52ef2f.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-400-87c52ef2f.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-87c52ef2f.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-1308-87c52ef2f.webp 1308w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-200-b29548dae.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-400-b29548dae.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-b29548dae.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-1308-b29548dae.png 1308w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-b29548dae.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>If you want to distribute your project to a wider audience, there’s a few Amiga-specific things you can do that makes life much easier for people running AmigaOS. These all make use of some pretty cool bits of Amiga technology and have been widely adopted by native software since their introduction in the early 1990s.</p>

<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>
<p>Just use LHA format archives. It’s the standard compression tool on Amigas and even though there are modern (and technically better) alternatives, <code>.lha</code> files are as ubiquitous as e.g. <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> packages on other systems and can also be handled by low-spec machines. There are ports of CLI tools and GUIs available on all platforms to handle these archives and while the syntax can be a little different, it’s quite easy to use. See my <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/packaging/make_lha">AmigaDOS script</a> that builds the SetCmd release artifact for a practical example.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Along with a basic README.txt, it’s a great practice to distribute more detailed documentation in <a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/AmigaGuide_101">AmigaGuide</a> format. Another area the Amiga was way ahead of it’s time - AmigaGuide is a hyper-text format commonly used for application manuals although people have even used it to publish <a href="http://www.whatiff.info/">disk magazines</a>! Introduced in 1992, the bundled tools on any AmigaOS (or clone/derivative) can read and use AmigaGuide as standard so you can include formatting, links and other content in your documentation. You can see the AmigaGuide docs I include with SetCmd in the screenshot above, or view the <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/SetCmd.guide">source</a> to see what the syntax looks like.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to write and is much like any other markdown or formatting code. You can set basic parameters:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>@Width 72
@wordwrap
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Documents have “Nodes” which can be linked to, e.g.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>@Node About "About SetCMD" 
@{"About" Link About}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>And formatting is much like HTML with opening and closing tags:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">@{b}@{u} Bold and Underlined! @{uu}@{ub}</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="installer">Installer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-200-7c58ead12.webp 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-300.0-7c58ead12.webp 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-400-7c58ead12.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-200-ca320d46f.png 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-300.0-ca320d46f.png 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-400-ca320d46f.png 2.0x" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-250-ca320d46f.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>A fantastic addition to AmigaOS, the system installer utility reads a developer-provided script which handles copying files, comparing versions, modifying system scripts and so on, in a standardized fashion. You can pass useful information and configuration which controls the Installer tool through standard Amiga tooltypes, and it uses a sort of LISP-ey syntax which again runs on all Amigas and derivatives. The syntax does some getting used to, but the best source of documentation is the AmigaGuide documentation found in the <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/misc/Installer-43_3">Installer dev package</a>. As an example, here’s an excerpt of the block of code which copies the <code>setcmd</code> program file over to a previously created directory:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>copyfiles</span>
  <span>(</span><span>source</span> <span>"setcmd"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>dest</span> <span>#</span><span>dname</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>prompt</span> <span>(</span><span>"Copy SetCmd program file?"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>confirm</span> <span>"expert"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>all</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>help</span> <span>@copyfiles-help</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>And for running commands, you can use the <code>run</code> command, along with <code>cat</code> (short for “concatenate”) to build up the command string :</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>run</span> <span>(</span><span>cat</span> <span>"C:MakeLink FROM "</span> <span>#</span><span>dname</span> <span>"/cmds/setcmd/release TO SETCMD:setcmd SOFT"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I found the best approach was to examine other Installer scripts to get a feel for common practices and idioms. Here’s my simplistic <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/Install_SetCmd">Install_SetCmd</a> script, and if you want to see something more complex, there’s always the AmigaOS installation scripts, or the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtamigaosnative/files/release/">Qt installer</a> for OS 4 which taught me a lot.</p>

<h3 id="file-sites">File Sites</h3>
<p>The Amiga doesn’t have a universal package manager, so files are usually downloaded manually and installed from the <code>.lha</code> archives. The go-to place for Amiga software for all systems is <a href="https://aminet.net/">AmiNet</a>. It’s the biggest repository of Amiga packages on the internet (and, at one point in the mid-90s was actually the largest software repository of any platform) and now also supports hosting packages for Amiga OS 4, MorphOS and AROS alongside classic 68k fare. There are also smaller, platform-focused sites for each platform e.g. <a href="http://os4depot.net/">os4depot.net</a> for OS 4, <a href="https://www.morphos-storage.net/">morphos-storage.net</a> for MorphOS and so on.</p>

<p>Getting your package uploaded and accepted into the repository is broadly the same for all these: You FTP your package up according to the naming standards, and supply a <code>Readme</code> file which provides the <a href="http://wiki.aminet.net/index.php/The_Readme_file">required metadata</a> like this excerpt in AmiNet format:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>There are some Amiga-native GUI tools that assist with creating these files, but the specs e.g. for <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=ftpinfo">os4depot.net</a> are pretty straight forward. And here’s the end result - My package available on <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=showfile&amp;file=utility/shell/setcmd.lha">os4depot.net</a> and <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/setcmd">aminet</a>.</p>

When trying to learn or re-learn everything from C to AmigaDOS scripting, I found a few great resources. However, as with most things in Amiga-land, there’s an extraordinarily high “bus factor” for many websites and my biggest recommendation is to use native tools or save local copies of anything you find! With that said, here’s my essential Amiga bookmarks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Autodocs references. There’s lots of websites where you can browse the auto-generated docs from the SDK header files, like <a href="http://amigadev.elowar.com/">this</a> with clickable links to jump between things. If I’m actually at an Amiga though, there are some useful native tools I prefer that can index and search through the local headers. The screenshot above shows the standard “AutoDoc Reader” freeware tool viewing the equivalent of a <code>man</code> page for the AmigaDOS library, alongside the AmigaGuide Installer language reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pjhutchison.org/tutorial/amiga_c.html">http://www.pjhutchison.org/tutorial/amiga_c.html</a> - amazing site. This is what inspired me to pick up a compiler again and get to work. There’s a great refresher on the C language itself, and then it dives into Amiga-specific coding with everything from low-level library access, sound and GUI programming and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/DeveloperDoc:Main">Amiga OS Dev wiki</a> is a goldmine, although it can take a little searching to find what you’re after. It’s mostly OS 4-focused but because all Amiga systems share a common ancestor it’s usually pretty applicable to all platforms. Specific articles that I found useful include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Migration_Guide">OS 4 Migration Guide</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Programming_in_the_Amiga_Environment">Programming in the Amiga Environment</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Fundamental_Types">Fundamental Types</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And lastly, there are great threads I constantly found on <a href="https://www.amigans.net/">amigans.net</a> which is where a lot of OS 4/”Next Gen” technical discussion happens. For classic systems, I found the Coders discussions on the <a href="https://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=116">English Amiga Board</a> an invaluable resource.</li>

<p>When I started this project, it was really a way to get acquainted with my new X5000. Since then, I’ve decided to port my codebase back to the classic Amiga, as well as explore porting over to other Amiga-like systems such as <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AROS_Research_Operating_System">AROS</a>. This leads to some choices: From a packaging and distribution point of view, a 68k binary is pretty much the universal standard in Amiga land. It can run natively on classic Amigas, and modern systems like AmigaOS 4.x and MorphOS can run 68k binaries through translation. In a method similar to how Apple has handled the transition between processors in the Mac, it’s a pretty seamless experience and I run a lot of classic 68k software on my X5000. As long as you aren’t “banging on the metal” it works really well and <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2018/10/30/classic-amiga-emulation-on-the-x5000/#classic-68k-binaries">integrates smoothly</a> with the rest of the system.</p>

<p>The original 68k AmigaOS from Commodore is also pretty much the standard for source-code compatibility; code targetting this release can be built on most of the derivatives and later systems with very little (if any) modification. On AmigaOS 4 for example, you can simply add <code>-D__USE_INLINE__</code> to your makefiles and in theory build from a common codebase. If you start the other way as I did and write initially targetting AmigaOS 4, it’s harder to port to other systems.</p>

<p>For example, I originally followed the AmigaOS 4 programming style which favours prefixing library calls with interface names. This isn’t compatible with any other system, so the easiest way to port this to more Amiga-like platforms is to refactor this code back to the classic style of calling system functions. I do plan on building platform-specific binaries using <code>#defines</code> so I can for example use functions like <code>dos.library/AddCmdPathNode</code> on OS 4 that I otherwise have to manually implement, and while a lot of higher-level layers (like e.g. MUI for building graphical applications) are shared across platforms this is probably the best bet for adding specific features from one platform that aren’t available on others.</p>

<p>Honestly though, at this point if you want to just get started I’d have to suggest you target classic AmigaOS compatibility and build a 68k binary. I’d personally target AmigaOS 3.x or 2.1 if you want to support a wider range of truly vintage systems; 1.x is facinating from a retro-geek perspective but lacks a lot of the nice features that came with later systems. Everything else like the installer, archive format, documentation format and so on is cross-platform anyway and supported from OS 2.1 and up.</p>

<p>MorphOS, AROS and OS 4 are really fun systems to explore, and I highly recommend checking them out if this article has whetted your appetite (and you can find a system to run them on!) but classic is the easiest way to get your code out to the wider world and ironically provides a better code-base for future porting and native binaries than my “working backwards” approach.</p>

So that’s about the sum total of what I’ve picked up over the last few years, anyway! I still enjoy working on my Amigas when I get some “hacking on code in the evening” time, and in particular I find AmigaOS 4 on my X5000 a refreshing blend of retro appeal and just about enough modern convenience to use it for development tasks, or even for writing this article itself. My A1200 continues to impress me with how much utility there is in such a small box and is a wonderful distraction from the modern era of bloated systems and applications. It is perhaps an evolutionary dead-end, but it’s still a lot of fun and is one of the rare occasions these days where I feel actually in control of <em>my</em> computer. Working backwards in time from OS 4.1 to my classic Amigas has also really given me a greater insight and appreciation for what the Amiga engineers managed to pull off back then. If you’re in any way interested in computer history - or simply want to give something truly different a try - you should definitely check out AmigaOS. I hope this quick <code>type BRAIN: &gt; WEB:</code> dump provides you with some good starting points, and maybe gets you coding too!</p>

        <p>In the six months that have passed after the last USB-C article has been released, I have thought up a bunch of ways that these articles could have been improved. It’s, of course, normal to have such a feeling — expected, even. I now believe that there’s a few gaps that I could bridge. For instance, I have not provided enough example circuits, and sometimes one schematic can convey things better than a thousand words.</p>
<p>Let’s fix that! I’ll give you schematics for the kinds of USB-C devices you’re actually likely to want to build. I’ll also share a bunch of IC part numbers in this article, but I don’t have an exhaustive collection, of course – if you find more cool ICs that work for USB-C purposes and aren’t mentioned here, please do let us all know in the comments!</p>

<p>We’ve seen the first example circuit <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/12/06/usb-c-introduction-for-hackers/">in the first article</a> – a device-side (“upstream-facing”) USB-C port that supports USB 2.0 and 5 V of power. You must have the 5.1 K resistors, one resistor per pin, and remember to join both of the data pins — use vias if necessary. If you want to determine the amount of current available to you, you can also connect ADCs or comparators to both of the CC pins together, though most often, your device is low-power enough that there’s no reason to bother.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to make a device with a USB-C plug, the wiring is the same. The only difference is that you only need to populate one of the CC pull-downs, and wire up one pair of D+/D- pins instead of both pairs. Nothing bad is likely to happen in practice if you wire up the second pair of USB 2.0 pins, it’s just uncouth by the standard; it used to conflict with a certain kind of ports and cables (the VirtualLink ones) that are no longer being sold.</p>
<p>However, if you wire up 5.1 K pull-downs to both CC pins, you’ll accidentally make a hacker accessory: a debug mode adapter, something that will help you get extra signals out of some USB-C ports. For instance, on the Framework laptop, a USB-C-plug-equipped board with both pull-downs will switch a USB-C port into a debug mode, and expose the EC UART connection on the SBU pins. Unless you are making such a debug accessory, you should only populate one of the pull-downs, and wire up the USB 2.0 data pins accordingly.</p>
<h2>The Flipside Just As Easy</h2>
<p>What if you wanted to make a host port? From one side, it’s easier, because you don’t necessarily have to do any ADC measurements. Instead, you add pull-ups, different value for different amounts of available current. Not all devices check the pull-up presence, but phones do, so if you’re making a makeshift USB-C charger, a phone or a laptop might not recognize it as a valid way to charge if you don’t have the pull-ups. It doesn’t cost much to add them, either!</p>

<p>More importantly, you might want to control VBUS, only switching it on after you’ll have detected a pull-down on one of the CC pins. You won’t necessarily have a problem if you don’t, but it does cover some important edge cases, like someone plugging a USB-A to USB-C cable into your port!</p>
<p>I’ve never done this circuit, but the way I see it, it should be enough to use two FETs, one per CC pin, both put in parallel. This circuit might have edge cases — improvements welcome! On the other side, I’ve used pull-down-equipped USB-C port breakouts as host ports a few times, so it’s definitely not a hard requirement, and you don’t always need to break out your FET collection.</p>
<p>In total, there’s two things that you want to do if you’re building a host port, and neither of the two are quite required. Also, if you’d like to get more complex on the circuitry, or perhaps even do a dual-role port, there are ICs that help you with this part of USB-C!</p>
<p>For instance, take<a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/span-style-background-color-ff0-USB-span-ICs_WILLSEMI-Will-Semicon-WUSB3801Q-12-TR_C2931342.html" target="_blank"> the WUSB3801</a>. It takes care of both source and sink detection, has all the needed pulld-owns and pull-ups inside, and can even do dual-role ports, which lets you build any kind of 5 V power port. It can output the port status with a few GPIOs, or you can connect it to your microcontroller over I2C, and it even has an ID pin so that you can use it to fully replace a MicroUSB port with a USB-C one! The WUSB3801 is small enough, solderable enough, and versatile enough too. For instance, <a href="http://hackaday.com/discord">over on the Hackaday Discord server</a>, someone has built a WUSB3801 circuit which limits a Li-ion charger’s current based on whether the USB-C port connected can provide 3 amps or not.</p>
<p>Whether you want to build a source port, a sink port, or even a port that can do both, the WUSB301 (or any of the many similar ICs like TUSB320), will be your solution of the day. One complaint I have towards the WUSB3801, is that it doesn’t provide a GPIO for determining the currently-plugged-in port polarity — you have to use the I2C interface for that. Now, why would you need to know the port polarity? High-speed interfaces are the reason, and the USB 3.0 interface is definitely a USB-C mainstay, if only because of how easy it is to implement.</p>
<h2>High-Speed, Low-Price</h2>
<p>Building a USB 3.0 device with a USB-C plug is as easy as building a USB 2.0 device with a USB-C plug. USB 3.0 has two high-speed diffpairs added to it, and a USB-C connector has spots for four diffpairs. With the plug, you wire up your USB 3.0 SSRX to USB-C RX1, USB 3.0 SSTX to USB-C TX1, pop a pull-down on the CC1, and you’re done. There are no extra components apart from any series capacitors that your USB 3.0 link might need, and these won’t be different from a regular implementation.</p>
<p>Now, this is why you will see a lot of USB flashdrives adopt a USB-C plug — it’s this easy to add one, you don’t need to figure out the CC pins, add any extra components or alike. You <em>do</em> need to add extra components if you aim to add a USB-C socket with USB 3.0 support, however. Imagine plugging your USB 3.0 USB-C flashdrive into a USB-C socket, depending on which way you rotate it, the pins are going to end up in one of the two positions. You don’t want to join TX/RX pins of the socket together, that would be a major signal integrity problem, so if you’re adding a USB-C socket with USB 3.0 support, you need a mux to handle high-speed signal rotation.</p>

<p>These are, by now, a tried and true kind of USB-C chip – you will find these from at least a dozen different manufacturers; if you find a few ICs that have the same pinout, it’ll be hard for you to get chip shortage’d. Some muxes will have a POL input, for manually switching your USB 3.0 signal into two possible positions — these are meant to be used together with your own PD controller, which is to say, a chip that handles CC pins. Many muxes, you will find, also contain CC logic, and will basically give you a complete solution for 5 V and USB 3.0 capable USB-C. If you’re building a host, you might only need to add VBUS handling, and if you’re building a device with a USB-C socket, you don’t need anything else!</p>
<p>Such a mux is how a lot of cheap USB-C ports on laptops work – they only provide USB 2.0, nothing else, and given how easy it is to implement, it makes sense that a lot of cheap laptop manufacturers have stuck to this. What’s more, you could even omit the mux if you wanted if you have a USB 3.0 port to spare. We’ve seen this done on desktop motherboards, and funnily enough, this is <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/pocket-reform/-/tree/main/pocket-reform-motherboard" target="_blank">how both of the USB-C ports are wired on the MNT Pocket Reform,</a> too! It makes sense, the onboard USB 3.0 hub of the Pocket Reform board has four free ports, but there’s only two USB-C ports you can expose USB 3.0 on. It works well enough, and if someone wants to get at these two extra USB 3.0 ports, you only need to design a passive adapter!</p>
<p>One of these two USB-C ports on the Pocket Reform is special,it doesn’t just wire up the 5 V rail to VBUS like the first port does. Instead, it has a power switch IC wired up to VBUS, and a FUSB302B wired up to the CC pins.

Higher voltages are supported too, of course. You just need to speak PD, or perhaps, let a friendly chip speak for you.</p>
<p>These friendly chips, as you might guess, are PD trigger ICs. You wire them up to the CC pins, and they negotiate a power profile on your behalf. They have a few inputs that let you set the desired voltage, and optionally a FET driver output to disconnect VBUS if the PSU can’t provide the voltage you need, making sure that you don’t get the default 5 V on a power rail where you require 20 V.</p>
<p>We could talk a lot about the trigger chips, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/07/02/dual-power-supply-in-a-pinch/">many other people do</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/01/09/all-about-usb-c-power-delivery/">and I sure have too</a>. In fact, it’s the option that people overwhelmingly pick when they need a high voltage out of a USB-C port. They are perfect for the majority of use cases, and chances are, you want to reach for one. However, mind you, their behavior is inflexible: they won’t let you make a dual-role port, and they won’t let you distinguish between a 30 W USB-C PSU and a 100 W one, which helps when you’re driving a resistive load. You also can’t combine them with USB 3.0 or DisplayPort either as they don’t have a polarity output, and they don’t let you send custom messages.</p>

Whether you use an external PD controller like the FUSB302B or maybe a PD controller built into your MCU, it will let you make your own PD communication decisions. It’s got all the resistors you might want, and you’re likely to find example code for whatever task you need to accomplish. We’ve gone through custom PD message building already, both for power and DisplayPort sink operation. At some point we’ll even build our own USB-C PSU with a FUSB302B, so stay tuned! When it comes to MCUs, there are some well-known STM32 and Cypress microcontrollers with PD peripherals, and recently, <a href="https://github.com/openwch/ch32x035" target="_blank">the CH32X035</a> has entered the scene.</p>
<p>Your own PD controller will also let you send out DisplayPort messages — extracting a DisplayPort output from any compatible ports, or perhaps offering DisplayPort on your own. Use a USB-C plug and you will not need a mux, or use a socket and add a DisplayPort-compatible mux – it will let you extract two-lane DisplayPort and USB 3.0 simultaneously, or four-lane DisplayPort, whichever you might want. Or, you can use a DisplayPort socket, omit the mux, and only have your port work in one orientation – this <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/hdmi-controller-board-for-display-panel/17513/88?u=arya" target="_blank">Chinese eDP breakout seller</a> can confirm!</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll go through the inner workings of a USB-C PSU, then convert a 20 V PSU into a USB-C source with 20 V support; we will only need the FUSB302, a few FETs, and a spare 5 V regulator. It won’t require much of us, you’ll be able to convert your old power supplies to USB-C laptop power duty, and you’ll get some insights into how a USB-C PSU operates, too!</p>

<p>As mentioned on previous posts, I have spent the past few weeks dealing with a ZFS crash on my FreeNAS install. Because of that, not only was I forced to learn how to troubleshoot ZFS, but I also had to learn how to setup new volumes and come up with new backup strategies (between a few other things).</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about ZFS (because I new ‘nada’ to start with). And I’m happy to share some of the knowledge that I gathered with you on this post.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I don’t consider myself an expert on ZFS (not even close), but I will try to make things simple and easy to understand for someone, who like me, is just getting started with ZFS.</p>
<h2 id="about-zfs">About ZFS<a href="#about-zfs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="what-is-zfs-and-its-history">What is ZFS and It’s History<a href="#what-is-zfs-and-its-history" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>ZFS is a local filesystem (i.e.: ext4, NTFS, exfat) and logical volume manager (i.e.: LVM on Linux) created by Sun Microsystems. ZFS was published under an open source license until Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and closed source the license. Because the source code was already in the open and ported to different OSs, eventually a project called ‘OpenZFS’ was created, and that is the core code that is used on most Unix like systems today (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="zfs-components">ZFS Components<a href="#zfs-components" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/zfs-components.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/zfs-components.png"></a></p>
<h4 id="vdev">vdev<a href="#vdev" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A vdev is composed of one or more physical drives (can also be of things other than hard drive, like files). They can be combined together in mirrors or RAIDZs.</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/vdev.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/vdev.png"></a></p>
<p>💡 <em><strong>TIP:</strong> There are 7 different types of vdevs, and some of them (like host spare, L2ARC and ZIL) are very important.</em></p>
<h4 id="pool">Pool<a href="#pool" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A pool is composed of one or more vdevs and they usually contain a volume or a dataset (which you create after creating the pool). You create/define your vdevs when you create a pool (with the <code>zpool</code> command which we’ll see later). This allows you to mix vdev types together to achieve other RAIDZ levels (see example below):</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/raid10.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/raid10.png"></a></p>
<h4 id="datasets">Datasets<a href="#datasets" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Dataset is the filesystem part of ZFS (so far we’ve seen the LVM components). Here you can define user access, quotas, compression, snapshots, etc…</p>
<h4 id="volume">Volume<a href="#volume" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Volume is the brother of datasets but in a block device representation. It provides some of the features that datasets have, but not all. Volumes can be useful to run other filesystems on top of ZFS, or to export iSCSI extents.</p>
<h3 id="raidz-types">RAIDZ Types<a href="#raidz-types" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic/Simple Stripe (RAID0) - Distributes data without parity. Loosing a device means loosing all data</li>
<li>MIRROR (RAID1) - Mirrored drives. Used with 2 to 4 disks (or more)</li>
<li>RAIDZ-1 (RAID5) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose one physical drive before a raid failure. RAIDZ requires at least 3 disks</li>
<li>RAIDZ-2 (RAID6) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 2 physical drives. RAIDZ-2 requires at least 4 disks</li>
<li>RAIDZ-3 - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 3 physical drives. RAIDZ-3 requires at least 4, but should be used with no less than 5 disks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="commands">Commands<a href="#commands" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the most common commands for handling ZFS pools and filesystem. We’ll use <code>/dev/sdx</code> to refer to device names, but keep in mind that using the device UUID is preferred in order to avoid boot issues due to device name changes.</p>
<h3 id="1zfs-pool-commands">1.ZFS Pool Commands<a href="#1zfs-pool-commands" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>These are the commands related to creating vdevs and pools. We will be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zpool create</code> - Create a pool (and vdevs)</li>
<li><code>zpool status</code> - Displays pool status</li>
<li><code>zpool list</code> - List pool and it’s details</li>
<li><code>zpool history</code> - Shows history of commands for zpool</li>
<li><code>zpool import</code>- Imports and mounts pool</li>
<li><code>zpool export</code> - Exports and unmounts pool</li>
<li><code>zpool destroy</code> - Destroy pool and all filesystems</li>
<li><code>zpool scrub</code> - Starts scrub of pool</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11creating-a-pool-and-vdevs">1.1.Creating a Pool (and vdevs)<a href="#11creating-a-pool-and-vdevs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>To create a new pool we use the <code>zpool create</code> command. We specify the pool name and the device we want to use.</p>
<p>It’s basic usage is:</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create [pool] [devices]
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s look at different examples for this command.</p>
<h5 id="create-a-pool-on-a-single-disk"><strong>Create a pool on a single disk</strong><a href="#create-a-pool-on-a-single-disk" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>The command below creates a pool on a single disk.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-1-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create tank /dev/sdb  
</span></code></pre></div>
<h5 id="create-a-dynamic-stripe-pool-on-3-disks"><strong>Create a dynamic stripe pool on 3 disks</strong><a href="#create-a-dynamic-stripe-pool-on-3-disks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>Remember that dynamic stripe is the same as RAID0 and that it has no parity.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-2-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create tank /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can view the new pool with <code>zpool status</code></p>

<h4 id="25-creating-snapshots">2.5. Creating Snapshots<a href="#25-creating-snapshots" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Snapshots allow you to save the state of a filesystem to a current point in time, without duplicating storage (files are not copied). It flags existing data as «read-only» while allowing new data to be added to the filesystem without affecting the existing data blocks that are protected by the snapshot (the whole process is a bit more complicated than this).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the image below as an example. You have a filesystem with existing data (Data A) and you take a snapshot (snapshot 1). Then you make some changes, add new files (Data B) and take another snapshot (snapthot 2). After that you make even more changes (Data C).</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.1.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.1.png"></a></p>
<p>Snapshot 1 protects the original data (Data A), while snapshot 2 protects Data Changes (B) as well as the original data (Data A). So you can delete snapshot 1 and data (A) will still be protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.2.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.2.png"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The amount of data used for the snapshots is very small because we are not copying the files, but instead the filesystem top-level metadata block indicating the they belong to a snapshot.</em></p>
<p>And here are a few scenarios of what happens when you delete files and snapshots:</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.3.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.3.png"></a></p>
<p>Snapshots are great for testing software development, or creating a failsafe before an upgrade. But by no means they should be considered (by itself) as a backup or DR solution.</p>
