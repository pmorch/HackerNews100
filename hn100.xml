    <hr>

    <p>
      A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old 
      son on his "kid-safe" Gabb phone. The man got my son's number through a 
      children's book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I 
      discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but 
      still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our 
      family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting 
      my son: "What did you get? Send pictures."
    </p>

    <p>
      How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait . . . hadn't we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the 
      "kid-safe" phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/app-guide/">Gabb "approved apps" list</a>, which, 
      as I understand it, offers "no social media or high-risk options." We 
      did the safe things, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe not. Turns out Gabb's own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/blog/dangerous-chat-features/">seven apps with 
        dangerous chat features</a>, describing it as an app that "opens the 
        door to potential dangers." We were apparently supposed to find that 
        warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb's 572 blog posts:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE 'https://gabb\.com/blog/[^&lt;]+' \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo "{} blog posts as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      But if GroupMe "opens the door" to danger, why did Gabb put it on their "approved 
      apps" list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath 
      GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with 
      my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: "Allows contact and communication with 
      people the child may not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      So it allows communication with strangers, but it's not "high-risk?" The 
      approved list isn't looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a 
      catalog of risks I'm supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps 
      and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s "https://gabb.com/app-guide/" \
    | grep -o "${cat} = \[.*\]" \
    | head -1 \
    | sed "s/${cat} = \[//" \
    | sed "s/\]//" \
    | tr ',' '\n' \
    | sed "s/'//g" \
    | sed 's/^ *//' \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d ' ')
  echo "$count $cat"
done &amp;&amp; echo "...as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

586 existing_apps
60 unapproved_apps
170 unmet_criteria_apps
22 music_apps
...as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don't feel in control.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Gabb isn't alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies 
      selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver 
      complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.
    </p>


    <p>
      Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To 
      set it up, I had to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Connect the console to the internet</li>
      <li>Download the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app to my phone</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for myself</li>
      <li>Link my credit card and be charged $0.50 to verify parental consent</li>
      <li>Set up parental controls from the app on my phone</li>
      <li>Sync the parental controls app to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Set up a security PIN on the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for my son</li>
      <li>Sync my son's Nintendo Account to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Discover that half the controls live in the phone app and the other 
        half live on Nintendo's website, because of course they do</li>
      <li>Log into Nintendo's website to finish the job . . . </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Only to discover that there's no clear option to block internet access, 
      no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy 
      way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a 
      kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that's just nostalgia talking. 
      Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler 
      on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:
    </p>

    <ol start="12">
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for myself</li>
      <li>Create an email address for my son</li>
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for my son</li>
      <li>Set up a gamertag for my son on account.xbox.com</li>
      <li>Configure parental controls in Microsoft Family Safety</li>
      <li>Configure more parental controls on xbox.com</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone
      includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, 
      friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I finally—<em>finally</em>—tried to test online play, Minecraft 
      told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say 
      which) <em>and</em> create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a 
      <em>membership</em>) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to 
      the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit 
      to zero, sure. But I can't block free downloads. So to let my son play 
      online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content 
      I can't possibly evaluate. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a 
      conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and 
      cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a "customer 
      journey." And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You're 
      supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just 
      cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental 
      controls you don't really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. 
      You become the ideal customer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I didn't cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, 
      I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite 
      vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down
      over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED
      display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering
      across the floor. My son's face. My wife's face. The stunned silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not break the Switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I did was announce, in a voice louder than 
      necessary, that <em>nobody</em> was to ask me about anything 
      Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My 
      son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, 
      developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn't appear to 
      involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says "this 
      child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or 
      download anything without my explicit permission." Instead I get a 
      maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I'm at fault for a
      tooltip I didn't hover over, a blog post I didn't read, a submenu I didn't 
      find. Maybe that's by design. Maybe it's neglect. I don't know.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his
      friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those 
      two things, I'm supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental 
      control schemes of Gabb, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Xbox, while a stranger's 
      Christmas morning texts sit in my son's phone history.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Parental controls shouldn't be this hard.
    </p>

<p>FracturedJson is a family of utilities that format <a href="https://json.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON data</a> in a way that's easy for humans to read, but fairly compact.  Arrays and objects are written on single lines, as long as they're neither too long nor too complex.  When several such lines are similar in structure, they're written with fields aligned like a table.  Long arrays are written with multiple items per line across multiple lines.</p>
<p>There are lots of settings available to control the output, but usually you can ignore most of them.  FracturedJson produces nice-looking output from any set of JSON data automatically.</p>
<p>You can try it out with the <a href="https://j-brooke.github.io/FracturedJson/" rel="nofollow">browser formatter page</a>.  It's also available as a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/.NET-Library">.NET library</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonJs">JavaScript/Typescript package</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonVSC">Visual Studio Code extension</a>.  See here for <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Python">Python options</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of output using default settings.  See the <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options">Options page</a> for examples of what you different settings do.</p>

<p>Optionally, comments can be preserved.  Comments aren't allowed by the official JSON standard, but they're ubiquitous, so it's nice to have the option.  FracturedJson tries to keep the comments together with whatever elements they seem to relate to.</p>

<p>Most JSON libraries give you a choice between two formatting options.  Minified JSON is very efficient, but difficult for a person to read.</p>

<p>FracturedJson tries to format data like a person would.  Containers are kept to single lines as long as they're not too complex and not too long.  If several successive inline arrays or objects are similar enough, they will be formatted as a table.</p>

<p><h2>How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p>FracturedJson uses four types of formatting: <strong>inlined</strong>, <strong>compact multiline array</strong>, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>expanded</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/refs/heads/main/src-assets/fj-layout-types.png" alt="Layout Types"></p>
<p><h3>Inlined</h3><a id="user-content-inlined" aria-label="Permalink: Inlined" href="#inlined"></a></p>
<p>When possible, sections of the document are written inlined, as long as that doesn't make them too long or too complex (as determined by the settings).  "Complexity" refers to how deeply nested an array or object's contents are.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{ &quot;UnitType&quot;: &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;: [41, 7] }"><pre>{ <span>"UnitType"</span>: <span><span>"</span>Archer<span>"</span></span>, <span>"Position"</span>: [<span>41</span>, <span>7</span>] }</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxinlinecomplexity">MaxInlineComplexity</a> to control how much nesting is allowed on one line.</p>
<p><h3>Compact Multiline Array</h3><a id="user-content-compact-multiline-array" aria-label="Permalink: Compact Multiline Array" href="#compact-multiline-array"></a></p>
<p>The next option, for arrays, is to write them with multiple items per line, across multiple lines.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    [19,  2], [ 3,  8], [14,  0], [ 9,  9], [ 9,  9], [ 0,  3], [10,  1],
    [ 9,  1], [ 9,  2], [ 6, 13], [18,  5], [ 4, 11], [12,  2]
]"><pre>[
    [<span>19</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>3</span>,  <span>8</span>], [<span>14</span>,  <span>0</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>0</span>,  <span>3</span>], [<span>10</span>,  <span>1</span>],
    [ <span>9</span>,  <span>1</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>6</span>, <span>13</span>], [<span>18</span>,  <span>5</span>], [ <span>4</span>, <span>11</span>], [<span>12</span>,  <span>2</span>]
]</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxcompactarraycomplexity">MaxCompactArrayComplexity</a> to control how deeply nested items can be when arranged this way, or use <code>-1</code> to disable this feature.</p>
<p><h3>Table</h3><a id="user-content-table" aria-label="Permalink: Table" href="#table"></a></p>
<p>If an array or object contains inlineable items of the same type, they can be formatted in a tabular format.  With enough room, all fields at any depth are lined up (and reordered if necessary).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
    &quot;Rect&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: -44, &quot;y&quot;:  3.4         }, &quot;color&quot;: [0, 255, 255] },
    &quot;Point&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: {          &quot;y&quot;: 22   , &quot;z&quot;: 3}                         },
    &quot;Oval&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: 140, &quot;y&quot;:  0.04        }, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;#7f3e96&quot;     },
    &quot;Plane&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: null,                           &quot;color&quot;: [0, 64, 64]   }
}"><pre>{
    <span>"Rect"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>-44</span>, <span>"y"</span>:  <span>3.4</span>         }, <span>"color"</span>: [<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>255</span>] },
    <span>"Point"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: {          <span>"y"</span>: <span>22</span>   , <span>"z"</span>: <span>3</span>}                         },
    <span>"Oval"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>140</span>, <span>"y"</span>:  <span>0.04</span>        }, <span>"color"</span>: <span><span>"</span>#7f3e96<span>"</span></span>     },

}</pre></div>
<p>If the table wouldn't fit with all of the elements and subelements aligned, the inner-most containers are collapsed while keeping the outer ones still aligned.</p>

<article>
    <p>January 2026 will mark 10 years since I started storing my personal finances in plain
text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I've taken out about 30-45 minutes every
single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount
ledger.</p>
<p>There's a lot to talk about here, but let's start with some fun numbers!</p>
<h2 id="the-10-year-old-beancount-ledger">The 10 year old Beancount ledger</h2>
<p>10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over
45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored
in a <code>finances</code> directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here's a snapshot:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find . -name </span><span>"*.beancount" </span><span>| </span><span>xargs wc -l
</span><span>    4037 ./includes/2020.beancount
</span><span>    3887 ./includes/2018.beancount
</span><span>      27 ./includes/cash.beancount
</span><span>    4398 ./includes/2021.beancount
</span><span>    5531 ./includes/2019.beancount
</span><span>    5267 ./includes/2022.beancount
</span><span>    3287 ./includes/2017.beancount
</span><span>    5506 ./includes/2024.beancount
</span><span>    5606 ./includes/2023.beancount
</span><span>    1454 ./includes/2016.beancount
</span><span>    1089 ./includes/open/04-expenses.beancount
</span><span>      66 ./includes/open/03-income.beancount
</span><span>      11 ./includes/open/05-liabilities.beancount
</span><span>      37 ./includes/open/02-assets.beancount
</span><span>       1 ./includes/open/01-equity.beancount
</span><span>    4807 ./main.beancount
</span><span>   45011 total
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running <code>bean-query</code> on <code>main.beancount</code> tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ uv run bean-query main.beancount
</span><span>Input file: </span><span>"Goel"
</span><span>Ready with 12466 directives (19743 postings in 9895 transactions)</span><span>.
</span><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are 1086 accounts in total.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select count(</span><span>*</span><span>) from (select distinct(account))</span><span>;
</span><span>coun
</span><span>----
</span><span>1086
</span></code></pre>
<p>... which does not mean that there are 1086 <strong>bank</strong> accounts. Accounts in Beancount are
virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing
supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription,
and so on.</p>
<p>Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find documents/ -name </span><span>"*.pdf" </span><span>| </span><span>wc -l
</span><span>     507
</span></code></pre>
<p>Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that
makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax
returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right
there next to the relevant transaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023
was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select year(date), count(</span><span>*</span><span>) where year(date) </span><span>&lt; </span><span>2025 </span><span>group by year(date)</span><span>;
</span><span>year  coun
</span><span>----  ----
</span><span>2016   715
</span><span>2017  1422
</span><span>2018  1605
</span><span>2019  2437
</span><span>2020  1582
</span><span>2021  2022
</span><span>2022  2435
</span><span>2023  2651
</span><span>2024  2602
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-monthly-ritual">The Monthly Ritual</h2>
<p>I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial
transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much
more detailed <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/how-you-can-track-your-personal-finances-using-python/">blog post</a> about it a few years ago, but here's a gist.</p>
<p>It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s)
in CSV (CSV because it's much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run
these CSV files through what's called an "importer", that converts this CSV data into
data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries
into my current <code>.beancount</code> file (which is the main file containing <strong>all</strong> my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it's balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction's description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.</p>
<p>Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a
<code>&lt;year&gt;.beancount</code> file and add an <code>include &lt;year.beancount&gt;</code> in the active
<code>main.beancount</code>file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.</p>
<p>With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are
contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.</p>
<h2 id="building-beancount-importers-for-german-banks">Building Beancount Importers for German Banks</h2>
<p>Beancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge
of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes
in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV
export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work
with.</p>
<p>I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few
importers for a few different banks, specifically <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-dkb">beancount-dkb</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-ing">beancount-ing</a>,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-n26">beancount-n26</a>, and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-commerzbank">beancount-commerzbank</a>. I closed out my Commerzbank account a
while ago, so I don't maintain that integration anymore, but the first three
libraries are actively maintained (and used)!</p>

<p>My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but
as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some
trial and error to figure things out and have that "aha" moment.</p>
<p>I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it's tricky for others as well. So I wrote
a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you're
interested, here's a link: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/">https://personalfinancespython.com</a>.</p>
<p>The feedback on the book has been super positive. It got mentioned on Beancount's
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/external_contributions.html">external contributions</a> page, and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/#testimonials">reader reviews</a> have all been very encouraging!</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels
invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on <strong>my own
machine</strong>, not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that
I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem
gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext
accounting is so powerful.</p>

<p><span>BACKGROUND</span></p><p>Danish women vaccinated with the 4-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV types: 6/11/16/18) at age 14 in 2008 reached screening age in 2017, allowing assessment of long-term effects on prevalence, persistence and incidence of HPV infections.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>AIM</span></p><p>To examine the HPV status of cervical samples over time among women vaccinated as girls.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>METHODS</span></p><p>Between February 2017 and February 2024, residual material from cytology-analysed samples collected through the ‘Trial23’ study, part of the national screening programme, was tested for HPV16/18 and non-vaccine high-risk (HR) HPV types. Prevalence in first, second and third samples, and persistence and incidence between samples were calculated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>RESULTS</span></p><p>Over 7 years, 8,659 women provided at least one sample, 5,835 at least two and 2,461 at least three. In 7,800 vaccinated women, HPV16/18 prevalence was 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2–0.5), 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1–0.4) and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0–0.4) in three consecutive samples. Prevalence of non-vaccine HR HPV was 32% (95% CI: 31–33), 28% (95% CI: 27–29) and 31% (95% CI: 29–33). Persistence of HPV16/18 and non-vaccine HPV among vaccinated women was 40% and 53%. In adjusted analyses comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated women, incidence was significantly lower for HPV16/18 (adjusted relative risk (aRR) &lt; 0.10) while incidence of non-vaccine HR HPV types was higher (aRR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.12–2.45). No significant difference was observed for persistence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>CONCLUSION</span></p><p>Our study provides real-world evidence of stable protection against HPV16/18 infections in women vaccinated as girls. Less intensive screening seems reasonable until women vaccinated with the 9-valent vaccine reach screening age, when screening should be reconsidered.</p>

		<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
		<p>Around the world, people celebrate Public Domain Day on January 1, the day in which copyright expires on some older works and they enter the public domain in many different countries.</p>
		<p>In the U.S. Constitution, copyright terms were meant to be very limited in order to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” The first copyright act, written in 1790 by the founding fathers themselves, set the term to be up to twenty-eight years.</p>
		<p>But since then, powerful corporations have repeatedly extended the length of copyright to promote not the progress of society, but their profit. The result is that today in the U.S., work only enters the public domain ninety-five years after publication—locking our culture away for <em>nearly a century</em>.</p>
		<p>2019 was the year in which new works were finally scheduled to enter the public domain, ending this long, corporate-dictated cultural winter. And as that year drew closer, it became clear that these corporations <em>wouldn’t</em> try to extend copyright yet again—making it the first year in almost a hundred years in which a significant amount of art and literature once again entered the U.S. public domain, free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, share, remix, build upon, and enjoy.</p>
		<p>Ever since then, January 1 has been celebrated as Public Domain Day, the day in which the next year’s crop of books, movies, music, and artwork graduates into the public domain. At Standard Ebooks, we’ve prepared some of the year’s biggest literary hits for you to read this January 1.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>On January 1, 2026, books published in 1930 enter the U.S. public domain.</strong></p>
		<p>This includes legendary books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/franz-kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/langston-hughes">Langston Hughes</a>. In addition, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/the-maltese-falcon">The Maltese Falcon</a></i>, perhaps the best-known noir book—and film—of all time, and books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/evelyn-waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-l-sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>, and more, enter the U.S. public domain, becoming free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, and re-use.</p>
		<p>Our friends at the Public Domain Review have written about some <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/">other things that enter the public domain this year, too</a>.</p>
		<p>These past few months at Standard Ebooks, our volunteers have been working hard to prepare a selection of the books published in 1930 in advance of Public Domain Day. We’re excited to finally be able to share these <strong>20 new free ebooks</strong> with you!</p>

														<p>Sam Spade is a hard-boiled detective who looks out only for himself. When a stunning femme fatale arrives at his office, Sam hesitantly takes up her case—only for his partner to be murdered during a stakeout that very night. With the police eyeing him as a suspect, Sam soon finds himeself dragged into a web of greed and lies as he hunts for a mysterious artifact rumored to be worth a fortune.</p><p><i>The Maltese Falcon</i> is one of the most famous noir detective novels ever written. Sam Spade, like the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/continental-op">Continental Op</a>, is the prototypical noir gumshoe—hard-drinking, cruel, but compelled to deliver justice. It was later adapted as the legendary 1941 movie starring Humphrey Bogart, which went on to become one of the most famous film noirs ever produced.</p>							<p>

														<p>Mystery writer Harriet Vane is on trial for the murder of her lover, a man with unconventional opinions on anarchy and free love. The result is a hung jury, so the judge orders a retrial—the perfect opportunity for <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/lord-peter-wimsey">Lord Peter Wimsey</a> to unravel the case.</p><p>This mystery is the first appearance of the recurring character of Harriet Vane, who is said to be modeled after <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-l-sayers">Sayers</a> herself. Indeed, the novel incorporates many aspects of own life—including her famously rocky affair with a proponent of free love, John Cournos.</p>							<p>

														<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/evelyn-waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> returns in this, his second novel, to deliver another scathing, comic satire of high society. This time his targets are the “bright young things” of post-World-War-I England. Waugh deftly skewers their raunchy, raucus, Jazz-age lifestyle, as well as the middle class public, who can’t seem to get enough of their gossip.</p><p>As a testament to the novel’s staying power, David Bowie used <i>Vile Bodies</i> as the primary inspiration for his song “Aladdin Sane.”</p>							<p>

														<p><i>Years of Grace</i> follows the life of Jane Ward, a rather unsophisticated young girl who comes of age in 1890s Chicago. Her family is upper middle class, and Jane finds her traditional, homebody nature being pulled by the various forces of ambition, culture, and progress that swirl around her during the effervescent decades at the turn of the century. We see her into late middle age, where the world has been ripped apart by war, and with change accelerating faster and faster as another war looms on the horizon.</p>							<p>

														<p>Miss Mole is a middle-age housekeeper who has recently left the employ of a wealthy matron to work for the young family of a minister. The mother has recently passed, leaving the family struggling to manage the household—but luckily for them, Miss Mole is exactly the kind of capable, witty, and assertive leader they need.</p><p>As they work on ordering the household, a shadowy figure from Miss Mole’s past weaves in and out of the narrative. But whatever happened in Miss Mole’s history can’t seem to put a damper on her bright, clever, and funny outlook.</p>							<p>

														<p><i>The Faraway Bride</i> concerns the Malinin family, shopowners in 1920s Manchuria who are struck by misfortune when their store is raided by Red Army thugs. Their father recalls that a friend owes him a debt of money that could save the family’s finances—but the friend lives in Seoul, which lies at a grueling three week’s walk across the Korean mountains. The difficulty of the journey doesn’t faze the two Malinin children, who excitedly embark on a quest to save the family.</p><p>The novel is based on the story of Tobit from the Apocrypha, but its setting, and the resulting mish-mash of languages and cultures, make for a decidedly unique read.</p>							<p>

														<p>How will humankind, and the world, end? <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/geoffrey-dennis">Geoffrey Dennis</a> aims to answer that question in this singular work of semi-fiction. He explores how prophecies and predictions can twist the fate of humankind, and how the progress of science and technology can simultaneously lift humans up, while making them susceptible to control by societal and political interests. Dennis’s conclusions blend religion, science, and history to create a unique book that straddles the line between fact and fiction.</p>							<p>

														<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-ransome">Arthur Ransome</a>, a journalist in Manchester, was inspired to write this children’s story of gentle adventure while spending a summer teaching a friend’s children to sail in the Lake District.</p><p>In it, the children of two families on rural vacations meet in the wilderness; one side sails the dinghy named the <i>Swallow</i>, and the other the dinghy <i>Amazon</i>. They soon join forces against the dastardly “Captain Flint,” who in reality is just a cranky old man trying to quietly write his memoirs in his houseboat. Their adventures are a charming tale that, by staying firmly grounded in reality, completely eschews the tropes typical of today’s children’s books.</p>							<p>

														<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-s-eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> wrote “Ash Wednesday” during his conversion to Anglicanism. It explores themes of searching for the divine. His previous poetry, like “<a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-s-eliot/poetry/text/poetry#the-waste-land">The Waste Land</a>,” suggests that meaning could only be found in high art; in this poem, the speaker, weary of the search for meaning in the secular world, turns to God. Like most of Eliot’s poetry, “Ash Wednesday” is in a modernist style dense with allusion.</p>							<p>

														<p><i>Cimarron</i> was the best-selling novel of 1930. Set in the lands of Oklahoma during the land rushes of 1889 and 1893, it follows a young family trying to make a life for themselves in a land beset by scrabbling settlers and outraged natives. The family’s trajectory rises as the charismatic patriarch founds a newspaper and settles local disputes, while the matriarch transforms from a faint-hearted Southern belle into a hard-eyed frontierswoman and politician.</p><p>Though later seen as a paean to feminism, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edna-ferber">Ferber</a> originally intended the story to be a satire of American womanhood. Its popularity led it to being published as an Armed Services Edition and sent to soldiers on the front—the same fortuitous fate that graced <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/the-great-gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i>—cementing its fame in the minds of a generation.</p>							<p>

														<p><i>Giant’s Bread</i> is the first novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie</a> wrote under a pen name, because it differed so much from her usual mystery fare that she wanted it to stand up to public scrutiny under its own merits and not on her reputation. And stand up it did, as reviewers received it with glowing praise.</p><p>The book follows Vernon Deyre, a young Englishman and brilliant musician, from infancy to adulthood before and during the Great War. It explores themes of love, sacrifice, art, and ultimately, redemption.</p>							<p>

      <p>
      I’m posting this from a library Wi-Fi on a burner laptop because I am technically under a massive NDA. I don’t care anymore. I put in my two weeks yesterday and honestly, I hope they sue me. I’ve been sitting on this for about eight months, just watching the code getting pushed to production, and I can’t sleep at night knowing I helped build this machine.
    </p><p>
      You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories. I’m a backend engineer. I sit in the weekly sprint planning meetings where Product Managers (PMs) discuss how to squeeze another 0.4% margin out of "human assets" (that’s literally what they call drivers in the database schemas). They talk about these people like they are resource nodes in a video game, not fathers and mothers trying to pay rent.
    </p><p>
      First off, the "Priority Delivery" is a total scam. It was pitched to us as a "psychological value add." Like I said in the title, when you pay that extra $2.99, it changes a boolean flag in the order JSON, but the dispatch logic literally ignores it. It does nothing to speed you up.
    </p><p>
      We actually ran an A/B test last year where we didn't speed up the priority orders, we just purposefully delayed non-priority orders by 5 to 10 minutes to make the Priority ones "feel" faster by comparison. Management loved the results. We generated millions in pure profit just by making the standard service worse, not by making the premium service better.
    </p><p>
      But the thing that actually makes me sick—and the main reason I’m quitting—is the "Desperation Score." We have a hidden metric for drivers that tracks how desperate they are for cash based on their acceptance behavior.
    </p><p>
      If a driver usually logs on at 10 PM and accepts every garbage $3 order instantly without hesitation, the algo tags them as "High Desperation." Once they are tagged, the system then deliberately stops showing them high-paying orders. The logic is: "Why pay this guy $15 for a run when we know he’s desperate enough to do it for $6?" We save the good tips for the "casual" drivers to hook them in and gamify their experience, while the full-timers get grinded into dust.
    </p><p>
      Then there is the "Benefit Fee." You’ve probably seen that $1.50 "Regulatory Response Fee" or "Driver Benefits Fee" that appeared on your bill after the recent labor laws passed. The wording is designed to make you feel like you're helping the worker.
    </p><p>
      In reality, that money goes straight to a corporate slush fund used to lobby against driver unions. We have a specific internal cost center for "Policy Defense," and that fee feeds directly into it. You are literally paying for the high-end lawyers that are fighting to keep your delivery guy homeless.
    </p><p>
      And regarding tips, we're essentially doing Tip Theft 2.0. We don't "steal" them legally anymore because we got sued for that. Instead, we use predictive modeling to dynamically lower the base pay.
    </p><p>
      If the algo predicts you are a "high tipper" and you’ll likely drop $10, it offers the driver a measly $2 base pay. If you tip $0, it offers them $8 base pay just to get the food moved. The result is that your generosity isn't rewarding the driver; it’s subsidizing us. You’re paying their wage so we don't have to.
    </p><p>
      I'm drunk and I'm angry. Ask me anything before this gets taken down.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Marmot v2 uses a fundamentally different architecture from other SQLite replication solutions:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>vs. rqlite/dqlite/LiteFS:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>❌ They require a primary node for all writes</li>
<li>✅ Marmot allows writes on <strong>any node</strong></li>
<li>❌ They use leader election (Raft)</li>
<li>✅ Marmot uses <strong>gossip protocol</strong> (no leader)</li>
<li>❌ They require proxy layer or page-level interception</li>
<li>✅ Marmot uses <strong>MySQL protocol</strong> for direct database access</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Write Coordination</strong>: 2PC (Two-Phase Commit) with configurable consistency (ONE, QUORUM, ALL)</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong>: Last-Write-Wins (LWW) with HLC timestamps</li>
<li><strong>Cluster Membership</strong>: SWIM-style gossip with failure detection</li>
<li><strong>Data Replication</strong>: Full database replication - all nodes receive all data</li>
<li><strong>DDL Replication</strong>: Cluster-wide schema changes with automatic idempotency</li>

<li><strong>Row-Level Capture</strong>: Instead of replicating SQL statements, Marmot captures the actual row data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)</li>
<li><strong>Binary Data Format</strong>: Row data is serialized as CDC messages with column values, ensuring consistent replication regardless of SQL dialect</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Same row data applied everywhere, no SQL parsing differences</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Anti-Entropy Background Process:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Marmot v2 includes an automatic anti-entropy system that continuously monitors and repairs replication lag across the cluster:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Lag Detection</strong>: Every 60 seconds (configurable), each node queries peers for their replication state</li>
<li><strong>Smart Recovery Decision</strong>:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Delta Sync</strong> if lag &lt; 10,000 transactions AND &lt; 1 hour: Streams missed transactions incrementally</li>
<li><strong>Snapshot Transfer</strong> if lag exceeds thresholds: Full database file transfer for efficiency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gap Detection</strong>: Detects when transaction logs have been GC'd and automatically falls back to snapshot</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Database Support</strong>: Tracks and syncs each database independently</li>
<li><strong>GC Coordination</strong>: Garbage collection respects peer replication state - logs aren't deleted until all peers have applied them</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Delta Sync Process:</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Lagging node queries <code>last_applied_txn_id</code> for each peer/database</li>
<li>Requests transactions since that ID via <code>StreamChanges</code> RPC</li>
<li><strong>Gap Detection</strong>: Checks if first received txn_id has a large gap from requested ID
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If gap &gt; delta_sync_threshold_txns, indicates missing (GC'd) transactions</li>
<li>Automatically falls back to snapshot transfer to prevent data loss</li>

<li>Applies changes using LWW conflict resolution</li>
<li>Updates replication state tracking (per-database)</li>
<li>Progress logged every 100 transactions</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>GC Coordination with Anti-Entropy:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Transaction logs are retained with a two-tier policy:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Min retention</strong> (2 hours): Must be &gt;= delta sync threshold, respects peer lag</li>
<li><strong>Max retention</strong> (24 hours): Force delete after this time to prevent unbounded growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Config validation enforces: <code>gc_min &gt;= delta_threshold</code> and <code>gc_max &gt;= 2x delta_threshold</code></li>
<li>Each database tracks replication progress per peer</li>
<li>GC queries minimum applied txn_id across all peers before cleanup</li>
<li><strong>Gap detection</strong> prevents data loss if GC runs while nodes are offline</li>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT: Marmot automatically converts <code>INT AUTO_INCREMENT</code> to <code>BIGINT</code></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a <strong>breaking change</strong> from standard MySQL/SQLite behavior. Marmot does not respect 32-bit <code>INT</code> for auto-increment columns - they are automatically promoted to <code>BIGINT</code> to support distributed ID generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In a distributed, leaderless system, each node must generate unique IDs independently without coordination. Marmot uses HLC-based (Hybrid Logical Clock) 64-bit IDs to ensure:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Global Uniqueness</strong>: IDs are unique across all nodes without central coordination</li>
<li><strong>Monotonicity</strong>: IDs increase over time (within each node)</li>
<li><strong>No Collisions</strong>: Unlike auto-increment sequences, HLC IDs cannot collide between nodes</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DDL Transformation</strong>: When you create a table with <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="CREATE TABLE users (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100))
-- Becomes internally:
CREATE TABLE users (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)"><pre><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>users</span> (id <span>INT</span> AUTO_INCREMENT <span>PRIMARY KEY</span>, name <span>VARCHAR</span>(<span>100</span>))
<span><span>--</span> Becomes internally:</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>users</span> (id <span>BIGINT</span> <span>PRIMARY KEY</span>, name <span>TEXT</span>)</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DML ID Injection</strong>: When inserting with <code>0</code> or <code>NULL</code> for an auto-increment column:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (0, 'alice')
-- Becomes internally:
INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (7318624812345678901, 'alice')"><pre><span>INSERT INTO</span> users (id, name) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>0</span>, <span><span>'</span>alice<span>'</span></span>)

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Explicit IDs Preserved</strong>: If you provide an explicit non-zero ID, it is used as-is:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Schema-Based Detection:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Marmot automatically detects auto-increment columns by querying SQLite schema directly. A column is considered auto-increment if:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It is a single-column <code>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</code> (SQLite rowid alias), or</li>
<li>It is a single-column <code>BIGINT PRIMARY KEY</code> (Marmot's transformed columns)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This means:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>No registration required</strong> - columns are detected from schema at runtime</li>
<li><strong>Works across restarts</strong> - no need to re-execute DDL statements</li>
<li><strong>Works with existing databases</strong> - tables created directly on SQLite work too</li>

The title is derived from William Marris’s 1925 translation of Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>, referring to the similar themes of both works.</p><p>The novel traces the story of the death of Addie Bundren and her poor, rural family’s quest to honor her wish to be buried in her hometown of Jefferson, Mississippi, as well as the motives—noble or selfish—they show on the journey. It uses a stream-of-consciousness writing technique and varying chapter lengths, and is narrated by 15 different characters over 59 chapters.</p><p>Faulkner said that he wrote the novel from midnight to 4:00 a.m. over the course of six weeks and that he did not change a word of it. He spent the first eight hours of his twelve-hour shift at the University of Mississippi Power House shoveling coal or directing other works and the remaining four hours handwriting his manuscript on unlined onionskin paper. <i>As I Lay Dying</i> represents a progenitor of the Southern Renaissance, reflecting on being, existence, and other existential metaphysics of everyday life, and helped to solidify Faulkner’s reputation as a pioneer, like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, of stream of consciousness.

It is the first book in the <i>Swallows and Amazons</i> series, followed by <i>Swallowdale</i>.</p><p>Set in the summer of 1929 in England’s Lake District, the book relates the outdoor adventures and play of two families of children. These involve sailing, camping, fishing, exploration and piracy. The Walker children (John, Susan, Titty and Roger) are staying at a farm near a lake in the Lake District of England, during the school holidays. They sail a borrowed dinghy named <i>Swallow</i> and meet the Blackett children (Nancy and Peggy), who sail a dinghy named <i>Amazon</i>. When the children meet, they agree to join forces against a common enemy – the Blacketts’ uncle Jim Turner whom they call “Captain Flint” (after the parrot in <i>Treasure Island</i>).</p><p>The book was inspired by a summer spent by Ransome teaching the children of his friends, the Altounyans, to sail. At the time, Ransome had been working as a journalist with the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, but decided to become a full-time author rather than go abroad as a foreign correspondent. Three of the Altounyan children’s names are adopted directly for the Walker family. However, later in life Ransome tried to downplay the Altounyan connections, changing the initial dedication of <i>Swallows and Amazons</i> and writing a new foreword which gave other sources.

In telling the story of Sandy Rogers, a young African American boy in small-town Kansas, and of his family—his mother, Annjee, a housekeeper for a wealthy white family; his irresponsible father, Jimboy, who plays the guitar and travels the country in search of employment; his strong-willed grandmother Hager, who clings to her faith; his Aunt Tempy, who marries a rich man; and his Aunt Harriet, who struggles to make it as a blues singer—Hughes gives the longings and lineaments of Black life in the early twentieth century an important place in the history of racially divided America.</p><p>Hughes said that *Not Without Laughter* is semi-autobiographical, and that a good portion of the characters and setting included in the novel are based on his memories of growing up in Lawrence, Kansas. A review in *The New York Times* said that the novel is “very slow, even tedious, reading in its early chapters, but once it gains its momentum it moves as swiftly as a jazz rhythm”.

At its publication, it was considered Hesse’s literary triumph.</p><p>The novel is the story of a young man, Goldmund (German for “Gold mouth”), who wanders aimlessly throughout Medieval Germany after leaving a Catholic monastery school in search of what could be described as “the meaning of life”. With the help of Narcissus, a gifted young teacher, and following an epiphanic experience with a beautiful Gypsy woman, Goldmund leaves the monastery and embarks on a wandering existence. He has numerous love affairs, studies art, and encounters human existence at its ugliest when the Black Death devastates the region. Eventually, he is reunited with his friend Narcissus, now an abbot.</p><p>Like most of Hesse’s works, the main theme of this book is the wanderer’s struggle to find himself, as well as the Jungian union of polar opposites (<i>Mysterium Coniunctionis</i>). Goldmund represents nature and the “feminine conscious mind” (but also <i>anima</i>, a man’s unconscious), while Narcissus represents science and logic and God and the “masculine conscious mind” (but also <i>animus</i>, a woman’s unconscious).</p><p>A film adaptation, directed by the Austrian Oscar-winning director Stefan Ruzowitzky, was released in 2020.

Directed by Lewis Milestone, it stars Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, John Wray, Slim Summerville, and William Bakewell.</p><p>The movie follows a group of German students moved to enlist in the army as part of the new 2nd Company. Their romantic delusions are quickly shattered during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Sergeant Himmelstoss. After being sent to the Western Front, their idealism is destroyed by the harsh realities of combat.</p><p>Considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in World War I, the film opened to wide acclaim in the United States and made the American Film Institute’s first <i>100 Years... 100 Movies</i> list in 1997.

It satirises London’s post–First World War “bright young things” — a group of Bohemian young aristocrats and socialites in London — and the press coverage around them. Waugh originally considered the title <i>Bright Young Things</i> but changed it; the published title echoes a narrator’s remark on crowds and parties: “Those vile bodies”.</p><p>The novel follows a vivid assortment of characters, among them the struggling writer Adam Fenwick-Symes and the glamorous, aristocratic Nina Blount, who hunt fast and furiously for ever greater sensations and the hedonistic fulfillment of their desires. Waugh’s acidly funny satire reveals the darkness and vulnerability beneath the sparkling surface of the high life.</p><p>The book shifts in tone from light-hearted romp to bleak desolation (Waugh himself later attributed it to the breakdown of his first marriage halfway through the book’s composition). Critics have noted the novel’s fragmented scenes, jump-cuts, and telephone dialogue, often linking its method to cinema and to modernist effects. Some have defended the novel’s downbeat ending as a poetically just reversal of the conventions of comic romance.</p><p>David Bowie cited the novel as the primary influence in writing his song “Aladdin Sane”, and a film adaptation, written and directed by Stephen Fry, was released in 2003.

It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1931.</p><p>The story, beginning in the 1890s and continuing into the 1930s, chronicles the life of Jane Ward Carver from her teens to age 54. This novel follows many of the same themes as Barnes’s other works. Centering on the social manners of upper middle class society, her female protagonists are often traditionalists, struggling to uphold conventional morality in the face of changing social climates. Barnes’s alma mater Bryn Mawr College, along with the characters of college presidents M. Carey Thomas and Marion Park, figure prominently in this work.</p><p><i>The New York Times</i> commented that “this story of the death of an old order and the birth of a new one, of the perpetually renewed conflict between succeeding generations... holds the reader’s attention to the end.” Despite the success of <i>Years of Grace</i>, it is not Barnes’s best-known work; that honor belongs to <i>Dishonored Lady</i>, a play she co-wrote with Edward Sheldon, which was adapted twice into film.

A self-taught husband-and-wife team with a shared religious mission, they produced at least three silent films for African American church audiences, touring them across the United States. Shown alongside sermons, these works used cinema as a vehicle for evangelism. In <i>Hell-Bound Train</i> — which Eloyce is said to have rewritten, re-edited, and partly refilmed after James’s initial version — the viewer passes from carriage to carriage as the filmmakers stage various “Jazz Age” sins, including dancing, drinking, and gambling, all overseen by a mischievous devil conductor. Though <i>Hell-Bound Train</i> has gained some renewed attention via Kino Lorber’s <i>Pioneers of African-American Cinema</i> box set and a brief run on the Criterion Channel, this film — one of the few surviving silent works by an African American woman — is still often absent from retrospectives on early women filmmakers, perhaps because of its modest production values and overtly moralizing tone.

The plot often veers into allegorical digressions on a wide range of existential themes concerning humanity and feelings. It has a particular concern with the values of truth and opinion and how society organizes ideas about life and society. The book is well over a thousand pages long in its entirety, and no one single theme dominates.</p><p>The story takes place in 1913 in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary, which Musil refers to by the playful term Kakanien. Part I, titled <i>A Sort of Introduction</i>, is an introduction to the protagonist, a mathematician named Ulrich whose ambivalence towards morals and indifference to life make him “a man without qualities”. In Part II, <i>Pseudoreality Prevails</i>, Ulrich joins preparations for a celebration in honor of 70 years of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph’s reign. Part III, entitled <i>Into the Millennium (The Criminals)</i>, is about Ulrich’s sister Agathe. They experience a mystically incestuous stirring upon meeting after their father’s death.</p><p>Musil worked on the novel for more than twenty years: his detailed portrait of a decaying <i>fin de siècle</i> world has strong autobiographical features. Musil’s almost daily preoccupation with writing left his family in dire financial straits.

S. Eliot – <i>Ash Wednesday</i></h3><div><p><i>Ash Wednesday</i> is a long poem written by T. S. Eliot during his 1927 conversion to Anglicanism. Published in 1930, the poem deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith in the past strives to move towards God.</p><p>Sometimes referred to as Eliot’s “conversion poem”, <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, with a base of Dante’s <i>Purgatorio</i>, is richly but ambiguously allusive and deals with the move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human salvation. The style is different from his poetry which predates his conversion. <i>Ash Wednesday</i> and the poems that followed had a more casual, melodic, and contemplative method.</p><p>The poem’s title comes from the Western Christian fast day that marks the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter. It is a poem about the difficulty of religious belief, and concerned with personal salvation in an age of uncertainty. In it, Eliot’s poetic persona, one who has lacked faith in the past, has somehow found the courage, through spiritual exhaustion, to seek faith.</p><p>The initial reception of <i>Ash Wednesday</i> was largely positive, though many of the more secular literati found its groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfiting. Edwin Muir maintained that “‘Ash Wednesday’ is one of the most moving poems he [Eliot] has written, and perhaps the most perfect”.

In it a protagonist known only as “K.” arrives in a village and struggles to gain access to the mysterious authorities who govern it from a castle supposedly owned by Count Westwest. Kafka died before he could finish the work, but suggested it would end with K. dying in the village, the castle notifying him on his death bed that his “legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was permitted to live and work there.” Dark and at times surreal, *The Castle* is often understood to be about alienation, unresponsive bureaucracy, the frustration of trying to conduct business with non-transparent, seemingly arbitrary controlling systems, and the futile pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

It was written in 1929 and first published in German in 1930 as <i>Das Unbehagen in der Kultur</i> (“The Uneasiness in Civilization”).<p>Exploring what Freud saw as a clash between the desire for individuality and the expectations of society, the book is considered one of Freud’s most important and widely read works, and was described in 1989 by historian Peter Gay as one of the most influential and studied books in the field of modern psychology.</p><p>The book espouses a theory grounded in the notion that humans have certain characteristic instincts that are immutable. The primary tension originates from an individual attempting to find instinctive freedom, and civilization’s contrary demand for conformity and repression of instincts. Freud states that when any situation that is desired by the pleasure principle is prolonged, it creates a feeling of mild resentment as it clashes with the reality principle.</p><p>Primitive instincts—for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification—are harmful to the collective wellbeing of a human community. The historical development of laws that prohibit violence, murder, rape, and adultery, he argued, is an inherent quality of civilization that gives rise to perpetual feelings of discontent among individuals.

It was published in the United States first in 1930 and as <i>Tobit Transplanted</i> in Britain in 1931. It won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize for English writers in 1932.</p><p>The novel deals with a family of Russian émigrés in Manchuria. Its characters are the old, grumbling and tearfully sentimental Russian intellectual, Malinin; his disheveled, kind-hearted and unbearable wife, Anna; and Seryozha, their resourceful 19-year-old son. Spending their time in laziness, indulging in exaggerated Russian disorder and comical quarrels growing out of every trifle, they are incongruously happy. The humorous and adventurous action of the novel starts when Seryozha sets out, on foot, on a business trip to the Korean city of Seoul (where he must recover 200 yens); it is there that he finds his “far-away bride” — a charming and whimsical Russian girl who has already broken seven hearts and whose heart he finally conquers.</p><p>Benson described the novel as an “accurate modernization” of the <i>Book of Tobit</i>, a work of Second Temple Jewish literature dating to the 3rd or early 2nd century BC; <i>The New York Times</i> described <i>The Far-Away Bride</i>, rather, as a “spirited parody of it.” Benson’s novel, writes the reviewer, is “a truly felicitous comedy of the human personality”.

Sirin in the Russian émigré quarterly <i>Sovremennye zapiski</i> and was thereafter published by the émigré publishing house Slovo as <i>The Luzhin Defense</i> in Berlin.</p><p>The novel tells the story of Luzhin. As a young boy, unattractive, withdrawn, sullen, he takes up chess as a refuge from the anxiety of his everyday life. His talent is prodigious and he rises to the rank of grandmaster, but at a cost: in Luzhin’s obsessive mind, the game of chess gradually supplants the world of reality. His own world falls apart during a crucial championship match, when the intricate defense he has devised withers under his opponent’s unexpected and unpredictable lines of assault.</p><p>The character of Luzhin is based on Curt von Bardeleben, a chess master Nabokov knew personally, and Nabokov links the events in the central chapters to moves as encountered in chess problems.

The novel has been adapted several times for the cinema and is considered part of the hardboiled genre, which Hammett played a major part in popularizing.</p><p>The novel follows Sam Spade, a private detective in San Francisco, in partnership with Miles Archer.

Archer takes the first stint but is found shot dead that night. “Miss Wonderley” is soon revealed to be an acquisitive adventuress named Brigid O’Shaughnessy, who is involved in the search for a black statuette of unknown but substantial value.

Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which arises from special relativity, has been called “the world’s most famous equation”. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for “his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”.</p><p>In 1905, sometimes described as his *annus mirabilis* (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. In 1917, Einstein introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which helped lay the groundwork for later developments in physics such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.

He was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, educated at Harvard and then New York Law School, and spent most of his life working as an executive for an insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut.</p><p>Stevens’s first period begins with the publication of <i>Harmonium</i> (1923), followed by a slightly revised and amended second edition in 1930. It features, among other poems, “The Emperor of Ice-Cream”, “Sunday Morning”, “The Snow Man”, and “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird”. His second period commenced with <i>Ideas of Order</i> (1933), included in <i>Transport to Summer</i> (1947). His third and final period began with the publication of <i>The Auroras of Autumn</i> (1950), followed by <i>The Necessary Angel: Essays On Reality and the Imagination</i> (1951).</p><p>Many of Stevens’s poems deal with the making of art and poetry in particular. His <i>Collected Poems</i> (1954) won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1955 and Stevens is a rare example of a poet whose main output came largely only as he approached 40 years of age. His first major publication (four poems from a sequence titled “Phases” in the November 1914 edition of <i>Poetry</i>) was written at age 35, although as an undergraduate at Harvard, Stevens had written poetry and exchanged sonnets with Santayana. Many of his canonical works were written well after he turned 50. According to the literary scholar Harold Bloom, no Western writer since Sophocles has had such a late flowering of artistic genius.

Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. He was a virtuoso and introduced revolutionary rhythmic and harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Parker primarily played the alto saxophone.</p><p>Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.</p><p>His style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include “Ornithology” (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard “How High the Moon” and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and “Moose The Mooche”. The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material. Parker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which triplets and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones.</p><p>Miles Davis once said, “You can tell the history of jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong.

His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Arthur Schopenhauer.</p><p>Mann was a member of the hanseatic Mann family and portrayed his family and class in his first novel, <i>Buddenbrooks</i> (1901).

His mainstream scientific achievements include his palaeontological research in China, taking part in the discovery of the significant Peking Man fossils from the Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. His more speculative ideas, sometimes criticized as pseudoscientific, have included a vitalist conception of the Omega Point. Along with Vladimir Vernadsky, he contributed to the development of the concept of the noosphere.</p><p>In 1962, the Holy Office issued a warning regarding Teilhard’s works, alleging ambiguities and doctrinal errors without specifying them. Some eminent Catholic figures, including Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, have made positive comments on some of his ideas since. The response to his writings by scientists has been divided. His work was controversial to some scientists and religious leaders because Teilhard combined theology and metaphysics with science.</p><p>Teilhard served in World War I as a stretcher-bearer. He received several citations, and was awarded the Médaille militaire and the Legion of Honor, the highest French order of merit, both military and civil.

He was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica. By 1951, he had won ten first prizes in West Indian literary competitions. His integral role in the development of political and cultural nationalism is evidenced in his being awarded the high honour of the Order of Jamaica in 1978.</p><p>He worked at various times as a photographer, insurance salesman, and journalist, launching his journalistic career as a contributor to the weekly newspaper <i>Public Opinion</i> from 1939 to 1952. Mais published more than a hundred short stories, most appearing in <i>Public Opinion</i> and <i>Focus</i>, with others collected in <i>Face and Other Stories</i> and <i>And Most of All Man</i>. He wrote more than thirty stage and radio plays, as well as three novels: <i>The Hills Were Joyful Together</i> (1953), <i>Brother Man</i> (1954), and <i>Black Lightning</i> (1955).</p><p>Mais’ topics most frequently were the social injustice and inequality suffered by black, poor Jamaicans. Accused of sedition for writing the article “Now We Know,” a 1944 denunciation of the British Empire, the Jamaican novelist was tried, convicted and imprisoned for six months. His political activism, anti-colonial writing, and imprisonment helped galvanize Jamaican nationalism.

He is best known for his stories about the partition of India, which he opposed, immediately following independence in 1947. Manto’s most notable work has been archived by Rekhta.</p><p>Manto was tried six times for alleged obscenity in his writings; thrice before 1947 in British India, and thrice after independence in 1947 in Pakistan, but was never convicted. He started his literary career translating the works of Victor Hugo, Oscar Wilde and Russian writers such as Chekhov and Gorky. His first story was “Tamasha”, based on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre at Amritsar. His final works, which grew from the social climate and his own financial struggles, reflected an innate sense of human impotency towards darkness and contained satire that verged on dark comedy, as seen in his last story, “Toba Tek Singh”.

Along with artists such as Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo, Hepworth was a leading figure in the colony of artists who resided in St Ives during the Second World War. Born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, Hepworth studied at Leeds School of Art and the Royal College of Art in the 1920s. She married the sculptor John Skeaping in 1925. In 1931 she fell in love with the painter Ben Nicholson, and in 1933 divorced Skeaping. At this time she was part of a circle of modern artists centred on Hampstead, London, and was one of the founders of the art movement Unit One. At the beginning of the Second World War Hepworth and Nicholson moved to St Ives, Cornwall, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Best known as a sculptor, Hepworth also produced drawings – including a series of sketches of operating rooms following the hospitalisation of her daughter in 1944 – and lithographs. She died in a fire at her studio in 1975.

She was one of the most influential political theorists of the twentieth century.</p><p>Her works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of wealth, power, fame, and evil, as well as politics, direct democracy, authority, tradition, and totalitarianism. She is also remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of Adolf Eichmann, for her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered by some an apologia, and for the phrase “the banality of evil”.</p><p>In 1933, Arendt was briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo for performing illegal research into antisemitism. On release, she fled Germany, settling in Paris. There she worked for Youth Aliyah, assisting young Jews to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. When Germany invaded France she was detained as an alien, but she escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941. She became a writer and editor and worked for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the publication of <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established, and a series of works followed. These included the books <i>The Human Condition</i> in 1958, as well as <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i> and <i>On Revolution</i> in 1963. She taught at many American universities while declining tenure-track appointments. She died suddenly of a heart attack in 1975, leaving her last work, <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, unfinished.

He said that his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that are “literate, authoritative, transcendent”.</p><p>Many of his works are in the permanent collections of museums and have been the subject of retrospectives at such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the George Eastman Museum.</p><p>Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Evans took up photography in 1928 around the time he was living in Ossining, New York. The Great Depression years of 1935–36 were a period of remarkable productivity and accomplishment for Evans. In 1936, employed by the National Recovery Administration, he photographed three impoverished sharecropper families in Hale County, Alabama. The photographs became iconic and were praised for effectively capturing the negative effects of the Great Depression in the American South. Between 1940 and 1959, Evans was awarded three Guggenheim Fellowships in Photography to continue his work of making record photographs of contemporary American subjects.

His creations include the feather-brained Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr. Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.<p>Born in Guildford, his early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction. Most of Wodehouse’s fiction is set in his native United Kingdom, although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. Wodehouse was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. Early in his career Wodehouse would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared to comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>At RailsWorld earlier this year, I got nerd sniped by someone.
They asked “why can’t Bundler be as fast as uv?”
Immediately my inner voice said “YA, WHY CAN’T IT BE AS FAST AS UV????”</p>
<p>My inner voice likes to shout at me, especially when someone asks a question so obvious I should have thought of it myself.
Since then I’ve been thinking about and investigating this problem, going so far as to <a href="https://www.xoruby.com/event/portland/">give a presentation at XO Ruby Portland about Bundler performance</a>.
I firmly believe the answer is “Bundler <em>can</em> be as fast as uv” (where “as fast” has a margin of error lol).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Andrew Nesbitt recently wrote a post called <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html">“How uv got so fast”</a>, and I thought I would take this opportunity to review some of the highlights of the post and how techniques applied in uv can (or can’t) be applied to Bundler / RubyGems.
I’d also like to discuss some of the existing bottlenecks in Bundler and what we can do to fix them.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read Andrew’s post, I <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html">highly recommend giving it a read</a>.
I’m going to quote some parts of the post and try to reframe them with RubyGems / Bundler in mind.</p>
<h2 id="rewrite-in-rust">Rewrite in Rust?</h2>
<p>Andrew opens the post talking about rewriting in Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv installs packages faster than pip by an order of magnitude. The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is such a good quote.
I’m going to address “rewrite in Rust” a bit later in the post.
But suffice to say, I think if we eliminate bottlenecks in Bundler such that the only viable option for performance improvements is to “rewrite in Rust”, then I’ll call it a success.
I think rewrites give developers the freedom to “think outside the box”, and try techniques they might not have tried.
In the case of <code>uv</code>, I think it gave the developers a good way to say “if we don’t have to worry about backwards compatibility, what could we achieve?”.</p>
<p>I suspect it would be possible to write a uv in Python (PyUv?) that approaches the speeds of uv, and in fact much of the blog post goes on to talk about performance improvements that <em>aren’t</em> related to Rust.</p>
<h2 id="installing-code-without-evaling">Installing code without eval’ing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>pip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t know this about Python packages, and it doesn’t really apply to Ruby Gems so I’m mostly going to skip this section.</p>
<p>Ruby Gems are tar files, and one of the files in the tar file is a YAML representation of the GemSpec.
This YAML file declares all dependencies for the Gem, so RubyGems can know, without evaling anything, what dependencies it needs to install before it can install any particular Gem.
Additionally, RubyGems.org provides an API for asking about dependency information, which is actually the normal way of getting dependency info (again, no <code>eval</code> required).</p>
<p>There’s only one other thing from this section I’d like to quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PEP 658 (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately RubyGems.org already provides the same information about gems.</p>
<p>Reading through the number of PEPs required as well as the amount of time it took to get the standards in place was very eye opening for me.
I can’t help but applaud folks in the Python community for doing this.
It seems like a mountain of work, and they should really be proud of themselves.</p>
<h2 id="what-uv-drops">What uv drops</h2>
<p>I’m mostly going to skip this section except for one point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring requires-python upper bounds. When a package says it requires python&lt;4.0, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare python&lt;4.0 because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is very very interesting.
I don’t know how much time Bundler spends on doing “required Ruby version” bounds checking, but it feels like if uv can do it, so can we.</p>
<h2 id="optimizations-that-dont-need-rust">Optimizations that don’t need Rust</h2>
<p>I really love that Andrew pointed out optimizations that could be made that don’t involve Rust.
There are three points in this section that I want to pull out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel downloads. pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. Any language can do this.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely true, and is a place where Bundler could improve.
Bundler currently has a problem when it comes to parallel downloads, and needs a small architectural change as a fix.</p>
<p>The first problem is that Bundler tightly couples <em>installing</em> a gem with <em>downloading</em> the gem.
You can read <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/blob/c00ca53960d21d0680df4ea7dde8ddf1bedaa774/bundler/lib/bundler/source/rubygems.rb#L165">the installation code here</a>, but I’ll summarize the method in question below:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span><span><span>def</span> <span>install</span>
</span></span><span><span>  path <span>=</span> fetch_gem_if_not_cached
</span></span><span><span>  <span>Bundler</span><span>::</span><span>RubyGemsGemInstaller</span><span>.</span>install path, dest
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The problem with this method is that it inextricably links <em>downloading</em> the gem with <em>installing</em> it.
This is a problem because we could be downloading gems while installing other gems, but we’re forced to wait because the installation method couples the two operations.
Downloading gems can trivially be done in parallel since the <code>.gem</code> files are just archives that can be fetched independently.</p>
<p>The second problem is the queuing system in the installation code.
After gem resolution is complete, and Bundler knows what gems need to be installed, it queues them up for installation.
You can find <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/blob/c00ca53960d21d0680df4ea7dde8ddf1bedaa774/bundler/lib/bundler/installer/parallel_installer.rb#L188-L201">the queueing code here</a>.
The code takes some effort to understand. Basically it allows gems to be installed in parallel, but only gems that have already had their dependencies installed.</p>
<p>So for example, if you have a dependency tree like “gem <code>a</code> depends on gem <code>b</code> which depends on gem <code>c</code>” (<code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code>), then no gems will be installed (or downloaded) in parallel.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this problem in an easy-to-understand way, I built a <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove/slow-gemserver">slow Gem server</a>.
It generates a dependency tree of <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> (<code>a</code> depends on <code>b</code>, <code>b</code> depends on <code>c</code>), then starts a Gem server.
The Gem server takes 3 seconds to return any Gem, so if we point Bundler at this Gem server and then profile Bundler, we can see the impact of the queueing system and download scheme.</p>
<p>In my test app, I have the following Gemfile:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span><span>source <span>"http://localhost:9292"</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>gem <span>"a"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we profile Bundle install with Vernier, we can see the following swim lanes in the marker chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/12/29/can-bundler-be-as-fast-as-uv/images/serial.png" alt="gem install swim lanes (serial)">
</p>
<p>The above chart is showing that we get no parallelism during installation.
We spend 3 seconds downloading the <code>c</code> gem, then we install it.
Then we spend 3 seconds downloading the <code>b</code> gem, then we install it.
Finally we spend 3 seconds downloading the <code>a</code> gem, and we install it.</p>
<p>Timing the <code>bundle install</code> process shows we take over 9 seconds to install (3 seconds per gem):</p>

</code></pre><p>We were able to install the same number of gems in a fraction of the time.
This is because Bundler is able to download <em>siblings</em> in the dependency tree in parallel, but unable to handle other relationships.</p>
<p>There is actually a good reason that Bundler insists dependencies are installed before the gems themselves: native extensions.
When installing native extensions, the installation process <em>must</em> run Ruby code (the <code>extconf.rb</code> file).
Since the <code>extconf.rb</code> could require dependencies be installed in order to run, we must install dependencies first.
For example <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri"><code>nokogiri</code> depends on <code>mini_portile2</code></a>, but <code>mini_portile2</code> is only used during the installation process, so it needs to be installed before <code>nokogiri</code> can be compiled and installed.</p>
<p>However, if we were to <em>decouple downloading from installation</em> it would be possible for us to maintain the “dependencies are installed first” business requirement but speed up installation.
In the <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> case, we <em>could have been</em> downloading gems <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> at the same time as gem <code>c</code> (or even while waiting on <code>c</code> to be installed).</p>
<p>Additionally, pure Ruby gems don’t need to execute any code on installation.
If we knew that we were installing a pure Ruby gem, it would be possible to relax the “dependencies are installed first” business requirement and get even more performance increases.
The above <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> case <em>could</em> install all three gems in parallel since none of them execute Ruby code during installation.</p>
<p>I would propose we split installation in to 4 discrete steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the gem</li>
<li>Unpack the gem</li>
<li>Compile the gem</li>
<li>Install the gem</li>
</ol>
<p>Downloading and unpacking can be done trivially in parallel.
We should unpack the gem to a temporary folder so that if the process crashes or the machine loses power, the user isn’t stuck with a half-installed gem.
After we unpack the gem, we can discover whether the gem is a native extension or not.
If it’s not a native extension, we “install” the gem simply by moving the temporary folder to the “correct” location.
This step could even be a “hard link” step as discussed in the next point.</p>
<p>If we discover that the gem is a native extension, then we can “pause” installation of that gem until its dependencies are installed, then resume (by compiling) at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>Side note: <a href="https://github.com/gel-rb/gel"><code>gel</code>, a Bundler alternative</a>, works mostly in this manner today.
Here is a timing of the <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> case from above:</p>

</code></pre><p>Lets move on to the next point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global cache with hardlinks. pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses hardlinks</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great idea, but I’d actually like to split the idea in two.
First, RubyGems and Bundler should have a combined, global cache, full stop.
I think that global cache should be in <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code>, and we should store <code>.gem</code> files there when they are downloaded.</p>
<p>Currently, both Bundler and RubyGems will use a Ruby version specific cache folder.
In other words, if you do <code>gem install rails</code> on two different versions of Ruby, you get two copies of Rails and all its dependencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/issues/7249">there is an open ticket to implement this</a>, it just needs to be done.</p>
<p>The second point is hardlinking on installation.
The idea here is that rather than unpacking the gem multiple times, once per Ruby version, we simply unpack once and then hard link per Ruby version.
I like this idea, but I think it should be implemented after some technical debt is paid: namely implementing a global cache and unifying Bundler / RubyGems code paths.</p>
<p>On to the next point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PubGrub resolver</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually Bundler already uses a Ruby implementation of the PubGrub resolver.
You can see it <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/tree/569c5c7450137839ff7c536f160b06a43ea3dfe4/bundler/lib/bundler/vendor/pub_grub">here</a>.
Unfortunately, RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/tree/569c5c7450137839ff7c536f160b06a43ea3dfe4/lib/rubygems/vendor/molinillo">still uses the molinillo resolver</a>.</p>
<p>In other words you use a different resolver depending on whether you do <code>gem install</code> or <code>bundle install</code>.
I don’t really think this is a big deal since the vast majority of users will be doing <code>bundle install</code> most of time.
However, I do think this discrepancy is some technical debt that should be addressed, and I think this should be addressed via unification of RubyGems and Bundler codebases (today they both live in the same repository, but the code isn’t necessarily combined).</p>
<p>Lets move on to the next section of Andrew’s post:</p>
<h2 id="where-rust-actually-matters">Where Rust actually matters</h2>
<p>Andrew first mentions “Zero-copy deserialization”.
This is of course an important technique, but I’m not 100% sure where we would utilize it in RubyGems / Bundler.
I think that today we parse the YAML spec on installation, and that could be a target.
But I also think we could install most gems without looking at the YAML gemspec at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thread-level parallelism. Python’s GIL forces parallel work into separate processes, with IPC overhead and data copying.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting point.
I’m not sure what work pip needed to do in separate processes.
Installing a pure Ruby, Ruby Gem is mostly an IO bound task, with some ZLIB mixed in.
Both of these things (IO and ZLIB processing) release Ruby’s GVL, so it’s possible for us to do things truly in parallel.
I imagine this is similar for Python / pip, but I really have no idea.</p>
<p>Given the stated challenges with Python’s GIL, you might wonder whether Ruby’s GVL presents similar parallelism problems for Bundler.
I don’t think so, and in fact I think Ruby’s GVL gets kind of a bad rap.
It prevents us from running CPU bound Ruby code in parallel.
Ractors address this, and Bundler could possibly leverage them in the future, but since installing Gems is mostly an IO bound task I’m not sure what the advantage would be (possibly the version solver, but I’m not sure what can be parallelized in there).
The GVL does allow us to run IO bound work in parallel with CPU bound Ruby code.
CPU bound native extensions are allowed to <em>release the GVL</em>, allowing Ruby code to run in parallel with the native extension’s CPU bound code.</p>
<p>In other words, Ruby’s GVL allows us to <em>safely</em> run work in parallel.
That said, the GVL can work against us because releasing and acquiring the GVL <em>takes time</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a system call that is very fast, releasing and acquiring the GVL could end up being a large percentage of that call.
For example, if you do <code>File.binwrite(file, buffer)</code>, and the buffer is very small, you could encounter a situation where GVL book keeping is the majority of the time.
A bummer is that Ruby Gem packages usually contain lots of very small files, so this problem <em>could</em> be impacting us.
The good news is that this problem can be solved in Ruby itself, and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/15529">indeed some work is being done on it today</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No interpreter startup. Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously Ruby has this same problem.
That said, we only start Ruby subprocesses when installing native extensions.
I think native extensions make up the minority of gems installed, and even when installing a native extension, it isn’t Ruby startup that is the bottleneck.
Usually the bottleneck is compilation / linking time (as we’ll see in the next post).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compact version representation. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a cool optimization, but I don’t think it’s actually Rust specific.
Comparing integers is <em>much</em> faster than comparing version objects.
The idea is that you take a version number, say <code>1.0.0</code>, and then pack each part of the version in to a single integer.
For example, we could represent <code>1.0.0</code> as <code>0x0001_0000_0000_0000</code> and <code>1.1.0</code> as <code>0x0001_0001_0000_0000</code>, etc.</p>
<p>It should be possible to use this trick in Ruby and encode versions to integer immediates, which would unlock performance in the resolver.
Rust has an advantage here - compiled native code comparing u64s will always be faster than Ruby, even with immediates.
However, I would bet that with the YJIT or ZJIT in play, this gap could be closed enough that no end user would notice the difference between a Rust or Ruby implementation of Bundler.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/pull/9085">started refactoring the <code>Gem::Version</code> object</a> so that we might start doing this, but we ended up reverting it because of backwards compatibility (I am jealous of <code>uv</code> in that regard).
I think the right way to do this is to refactor the solver entry point and ensure all version requirements are encoded as integer immediates before entering the solver.
We could keep the <code>Gem::Version</code> API as “user facing” and design a more internal API that the solver uses.
I am very interested in reading the version encoding scheme in uv.
My intuition is that minor numbers tend to get larger than major numbers, so would minor numbers have more dedicated bits?
Would it even matter with 64 bits?</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-this-up">Wrapping this up</h2>
<p>I’m going to quote Andrew’s last 2 paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.</p>
<p>pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think these are very good points.
The difference is that in RubyGems and Bundler, we already have the infrastructure in place for writing a “fast as uv” package manager.
The difficult part is dealing with backwards compatibility, and navigating two legacy codebases.
I think this is the real advantage the uv developers had.
That said, I am very optimistic that we could “repair the plane mid-flight” so to speak, and have the best of both worlds: backwards compatibility <em>and</em> speed.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top of the post I would address “rewrite it in Rust”, and I think Andrew’s own quote mostly does that for me.
I think we could have 99% of the performance improvements while still maintaining a Ruby codebase.
Of course if we rewrote it in Rust, you could squeeze an extra 1% out, but would it be worthwhile?  I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I have a lot more to say about this topic, and I feel like this post is getting kind of long, so I’m going to end it here.
Please look out for part 2, which I’m tentatively calling “What makes Bundler / RubyGems slow?”
This post was very “can we make RubyGems / Bundler do what uv does?” (the answer is “yes”).
In part 2 I want to get more hands-on by discussing how to profile Bundler and RubyGems, what specifically makes them slow in the real world, and what we can do about it.</p>
<p>I want to end this post by saying “thank you” to Andrew for writing such a great post about <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html">how uv got so fast</a>.</p>

                <p>Well, the Internet mostly feels bad these days.</p>
<p>We were given this vast, holy realm of self-discovery and joy and philosophy and community; a thousand thousand acres of digital landscape, on which to grow our forests and grasslands of imagination, plant our gardens of learning, explore the caves of our making. We were given the chance to know anything about anything, to be our own Prometheus, to make wishes and to grant them.</p>
<p>But that’s not what we use the Internet for anymore. These days, instead of using it to make ourselves, most of us are using it to waste ourselves: we’re doom-scrolling brain-rot on the attention-farm, we’re getting slop from the feed.</p>
<p>Instead of turning freely in the HTTP meadows we grow for each other, we go to work: we break our backs at the foundry of algorithmic content as this earnest, naïve, human endeavoring to connect our lives with others is corrupted. Our powerful drive to learn about ourselves, each other, and our world, is broken into scant remnants — hollow, clutching phantasms of Content Creation, speed-cut vertical video, listicle thought-leadership, ragebait and the thread emoji.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>It used to feel way better to Go Online, and some of us will remember.</p>
<p>We used to be able to learn about our hobbies and interests from hundreds of experts on a wealth of websites whose only shared motivation was their passion. Some of those venerable old educational blogs, forums, and wikis still stand, though most have been bulldozed.</p>
<p>Now, Learning On The Internet often means fighting ads and endless assaults on one’s attention — it means watching part-1-part-2-part-3 short-form video clips, taped together by action movie psychology hacks, narrated gracelessly by TTS AI voices. We’re down from a thousand and one websites to three, and each of those remaining monolith websites is just a soullessly-regurgitated, compression-down-scaled, AI-up-scaled version of the next.</p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>We used to make lasting friendships with folks all over the world on shared interest and good humor.</p>
<p>But now those social networks, once hand-built and hand-tended, vibrant and organic, are unceremoniously swallowed by social <em>media</em> networks, pens built for trapping us and our little piggy attentions, turning us all into clout-chasers &amp; content-creators, and removing us from what meaningful intimacy &amp; community felt like.</p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>Even coding for the web used to be different: One could Learn To Code™ to express oneself creatively, imbue one’s online presence with passion and meaning, and for some of us, build a real career.</p>
<p>These days, however, we write increasing amounts of complicated, unsecure code to express less and less meaning, in order to infinitely generate shareholder value. We don’t think about the art of our craft and the discipline of its application, we think about throughput and scale.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>To be very clear: I’m not trying to <em>Good Old Days</em> the internet. None of this is meant to make you feel nostalgic — the Internet used to be slow and less populated and less diverse, and its access was limited to those of a certain class. The Web For All is a marked improvement, widespread global internet access is a marked improvement, and what I’m asking you to consider is what it used to feel like to use these tools, and what we’ve lost in the Big Tech, Web 2.0 and web3 devouring of the ’Net.</p>

<p>In American cities, for example: though at first the automobile enabled humans to travel further distances, it now <em>demanded</em> that humans travel those distances, and <em>demanded</em> infrastructure be created &amp; maintained to enable it.<a href="#footnote-2">2</a> Many now <em>must</em> use an automobile to get everything done in their town in a day, and must pay &amp; take time for that automobile’s fueling &amp; maintenance.<a href="#footnote-3">3</a></p>
<p>Further than that, the automobile asks all of us to chip in tax revenue to protect its infrastructure, but only certain classes can afford an automobile with which to use that infrastructure, and those classes who can’t afford to do so are relegated to underfunded public transit systems.<a href="#footnote-4">4</a></p>

In his book <em>Tools For Conviviality</em>, technology philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich identifies these two critical moments, the optimistic arrival &amp; the deadening industrialization, as watersheds of technological advent. Tools are first created to enhance our capacities to spend our energy more freely and in turn spend our days more freely, but as their industrialization increases, their manipulation &amp; usurpation of society increases in tow<a href="#footnote-5">5</a>.</p>
<p>Illich also describes the concept of <em>radical monopoly</em>, which is that point where a technological tool is so dominant that people are excluded from society unless they become its users. We saw this with the automobile, we saw it with the internet, and we even see it with social media.</p>
<p><del>No longer a tool to serve our societies, our societies now serve the automobile.</del> <ins>Instead of designing and using tools to build a society, our society changes to adapt to the demands of our tools.</ins></p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>Illich’s thesis allows us to reframe our adoption and use of the technologies in our life. We can map fairly directly most technological developments in the last 100 (or even 200) years to this framework: a net lift, followed by a push to extract value and subsequent insistence upon the technology’s ubiquity:</p>

<p>The preferred imagery used to mythologize the Industrial Revolution is the woodetchings of textile manufacturers, transformed in the early 19th century by the arrival of automated fabric machinery. Its proponents laud the shift of an agricultural society to a technological one, creating new sectors for labor, and raising up the middle class (we will say nothing of this period’s <em>new</em> punishing conditions for labor in this essay<a href="#footnote-6">6</a>). But the ultimate ecological and human costs engendered by the increasing availability of cheap fabric production are well-documented: In 2022, the fashion and textile industries employed around 60 million factory workers worldwide<a href="#footnote-7">7</a>, and less than 2% of those workers earn a living wage. Those workers also endure the full suite of labor exploitation practices, including gender-based harassment, wage theft, and unsafe conditions. On the material side, the induced consumption resulting from ever-cheaper products means the world consumed 400% more textile products globally as 20 years ago<a href="#footnote-8">8</a>, and bins most of it (the average American generates 82 pounds of textile waste each year).</p>

Illich poses <em>convivial</em> tools as directly opposed to this industrialized, radically-monopolized set of social systems. Similar to E.F. Schumacher’s concept of “intermediate technology” introduced in his 1973 book <em>Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered</em>, convivial tools are sustainable, energy-efficient (though often labor intensive), local-first, and designed primarily to enhance the autonomy and creativity of their users.<a href="#footnote-13">13</a> Illich cites specifically hand tools, bicycles, and telephones as examples, but with its enormous capacity for interoperability and extensibility, the Internet is the perfect workshed in which to design our own Tools For Conviviality.</p>

            <div>
                <p>let’s reconsider</p>
                <p>the markers of a decaying 'Net I mentioned before, with convivial tooling in mind:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Teaching &amp; learning on the Web</h3>
                <div>
                <p>Monolithic platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Medium, and Substack draw a ton of creators and educators because of the promise of monetization and large audiences, but they’ve shown time and time again how the lack of ownership creates a problem. When those platforms fail, when they change their rules, when they demand creators move or create a particular way to maintain their access to those audiences, they pit creators or their audiences against the loss of the other. Without adhering to the algorithm’s requirements, writers may not write an impactful document, and without bypassing a paywall, readers can’t read it.</p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>When those promises of exorbitant wealth and a life of decadence through per-click monetization ultimately dry up (or come with a steep moral or creative cost), creators and learners must look for new solutions for how educational content is shared on the Internet. The most self-evident, <em>convivial</em> answer is an old one: blogs. HTML is free to access by default, <a href="https://indieweb.org/RSS">RSS</a> has worked for about 130 years<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, and combined with <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a>, it’s never been easier to read new ideas, experiment with ideas, and build upon &amp; grow those ideas with other strong thinkers on the web, <em>owning</em> that content all along.<a href="#footnote-14">14</a></p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Connecting with friends on the Web</h3>
                <div>
                <p>Social media apps have imprisoned us all in this weird content prison — in order to connect with friends we’re sort of forced to create or be vanished by capricious black box algorithms, and all that we <em>do</em> create is, as we’ve already alluded to, subsequently owned by whatever platform we’ve created it on. If Instagram goes away overnight, or decides to pivot catastrophically, your stories and your network of friends goes with it.</p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>The advent and development of tools &amp; methodologies like <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> (<em>Publish On your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</em>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>, <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats</a>, and <a href="https://atproto.com/">ATProto</a>, it’s becoming quite achievable to generate your own social network, interoperable with other networks like Bluesky or Mastodon. That network, designed for ownership and decentralization, is durable, designed around storytelling instead of engagement, and free of the whims of weird tech billionaires.</p>
<p>With some basic HTML knowledge and getting-stuff-online knowledge, a handful of scrappy protocols, and a free afternoon or two, one can build their own home to post bangers for the tight homies, make friends, and snipe those new friends with those hits of dopamine they so fiendishly rely on.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Coding for the web</h3>
                <div>
                <p>Lastly, consider the discipline of web engineering:</p>
<p>We have been asked to build the same B2B SaaS website with the same featureset n^∞ times, and our answers for the optimal way to do that are increasingly limited. We’ve penned all of our markup into JavaScript templates just in case a product manager needs the wrapper component to post JSON somewhere down the line, and we’ve whittled away at style code until it’s just a mechanism for deploying one of two border-radius-drop-shadow combos to divs. It’s an industrial, production-minded way of approaching a discipline that has all the hallmarks of being a great craft, and that’s understandably uninspiring to many of us.</p>
<p>¶</p>
<p>Yet our young React shepherds have no need to fear: there are countless more colors than blurple out there, and countless more fonts than Inter. HTML and CSS are better and more generative technologies than they’ve ever been: Thanks to the tireless work of the CSS working groups and browser implementers, etc, there is an unbelievable amount of creative expression possible with basic web tools in a text editor. Even JavaScript is more progressively-ehanceable than ever, and enables interfacing with a rapidly-growing number of exciting browser APIs <em>(still <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2012/04/04/javascript-inventor-gave-1000-to-support-californias-gay-marriage-ban/">fuck Brendan Eich</a> though)</em>. <a href="https://henry.codes/writing/i-know-about-the-date-in-the-footer/"><code>${new Date.getCurrentYear()}</code></a> is a veritable renaissance of web code, and it asks of authors only curiosity and a drive to experiment.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Illich’s thesis is that technology and its derived tools should serve people in a way that enhances their freedom, creativity, independence, and will.</p>
<p>The distillation of those principles on the web through manual code, hand-built social networks, and blogs, points luminously to one answer to the question of how the Internet can best serve humans:</p>

            </div>
            <h3>it’s personal websites.</h3>
            <p>Hand-coded, syndicated, and above all <em>personal</em> websites are exemplary: They let users of the internet to be autonomous, experiment, have ownership, learn, share, find god, find love, find purpose. Bespoke, endlessly tweaked, eternally redesigned, built-in-public, surprising UI and delightful UX. The personal website is a staunch undying answer to everything the corporate and industrial web has taken from us.</p>
            <div>
                <p>And how might one claim this ultimate toolchain of conviviality, and build a place on the web that enhances their autonomy and creativity?</p>
<p><em>How might one build a personal website?</em></p>

<p>Let yourself start small, have fun trying shit that doesn’t work, document your growth, publish failed ideas &amp; successful ones. Some of the best websites in the world are just HTML, and they belong to their authors. Make friends, let yourself be inspired by others, send friendly emails asking to learn new things, and do not demand of yourself masterpieces.</p>

<p>Get the resistance to ship out of your way. Don’t get caught up in tooling and frameworks, just write HTML and get something online. If you’re an engineer, delight that you’re not beholden to the same standards of quality and rigorous testing that you are at work — draft some ideas, hit the <code>h1</code> to <code>p</code> tag combo, and publish. Update and update again; let your ideas grow like gardens, the way they do in your mind. The mutability of the web, often its great weakness, is also one of its great strengths.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about design unless that’s the part that brings you joy. Make friends with designers and trade your work for theirs, or trade tips, trade advice. Get comfortable with being joyfully bad at something — from that soil of humility grows a million questions for those who have learned and are excited to share. Iterate until you’ve something you’re proud of, or iterate so much you’ve ruined it and have to go back to bald.</p>

                <p>You’re not crazy. The internet <em>does</em> feel genuinely so awful right now, and for about a thousand and one reasons. But the path back to feeling like you have some control is to un-spin yourself from the Five Apps of the Apocalypse and reclaim the Internet as a set of tools you use to build something you can own &amp; be proud of — or in most of our cases, be deeply ashamed of. <em>Godspeed and good luck</em>.</p>

Sure. HDR's still a crapshoot (plus ça change) and, as you've no doubt heard, a lot of live-service games have anticheat software that won't play with Linux. But I think both of these issues are gradually ticking toward their solutions, particularly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">Valve making its own push into the living room</a>.</p><p>So I say make 2026 the year you give Linux a try, if you haven't already. At the very least, you can stick it on a separate boot drive and have a noodle about with it.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/dells-version-dgx-spark-fixes-pain-points">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/dells-version-dgx-spark-fixes-pain-points</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457027">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dell sent me two of their GB10 mini workstations to test:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/dell-pro-max-gb10-two.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-91c249ce-34c4-4690-9afb-7b2dbf8552e7" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;91c249ce-34c4-4690-9afb-7b2dbf8552e7&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10"></p>

<p>In this blog post, I'll cover the base system, just one of the two nodes. Cluster testing is ongoing, and I'll cover things like AI model training and networking more in depth next year, likely with comparisons to the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">Framework Desktop cluster</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5">Mac Studio cluster</a> I've also been testing.</p>

<p>But many of the same caveats of the DGX Spark (namely, price to performance is not great if you just want to run LLMs on a small desktop) apply to Dell's GB10 box as well.</p>

<p>It costs a little <em>more</em> than the DGX Spark, but does solve a couple pain points people experienced on the DGX Spark:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has a power LED (seriously, why does the DGX Spark <em>not</em> have one?!)</li>
<li>The included power supply is 280W instead of 240W for a little more headroom</li>
<li>The thermal design (front-to-back airflow) seems less restricted, so is quieter and capable of keeping the GB10 'AI Superchip' from thermal throttling</li>
</ul>

<p>But if this isn't a mini PC to compete with a Mac mini, nor a good value for huge LLMs like a Mac Studio, or AMD's Ryzen AI Max+ 395 machines, what is it and who is it for?</p>

<p>Well, it's a $4,000+ box built specifically for developers in Nvidia's ecosystem, deploying code to Nvidia servers that cost <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-blackwell-dgx-b200-price-half-a-million-dollars-top-of-the-line-ai-hardware/">half a million dollars</a> <em>each</em>. A major part of the selling point are these built-in 200 gigabit QSFP ports, which would cost $1,500 or so to add on to another system, assuming you have the available PCIe bandwidth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/dell-pro-max-gb10-qsfp-200gbps.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-9914275f-3916-4ac0-a4de-0c22aca075c8" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9914275f-3916-4ac0-a4de-0c22aca075c8&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 Cluster - QSFP cables"></p>

<p>Those ports can't achieve 400 Gbps, but they <em>do</em> hit over 200 Gbps in the right conditions, configured for Infiniband / RDMA. And they hit over 100 Gbps for Ethernet (though only when running multiple TCP streams).</p>

<p>So it may seem a little bit of an odd duck for me, since I'm not an 'Nvidia developer' and I don't deploy code to Nvidia's 'AI factories'.</p>

<p>If I'm being honest, I'm <em>more</em> interested in the 'Grace' part of the GB10 (or 'Grace Blackwell 10') 'AI Superchip. It's a big.LITTLE Arm CPU co-designed by Mediatek, with 10 Cortex-X925 cores and 10 Cortex-A725 cores.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/grace-blackwell-gb10-ai-superchip-nvidia.jpg" width="700" height="436" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-fc7a15f1-de59-4034-a0f3-37fb075bf485" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;fc7a15f1-de59-4034-a0f3-37fb075bf485&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Nvidia GB10 Grace CPU diagram 20 cores"></p>

<p>The chip is united to the Blackwell GPU, and shares the same 128 GB pool of LPDDR5X memory. And it's a pretty snappy Arm CPU—just stuck in a $4,000+ system.</p>

<p>But like I said, Dell sent me these boxes to test. They aren't paying for this blog post and have no control over what I say.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the main things they said was "this is isn't a gaming machine, so don't focus on that."</p>

<p>But that got me thinking. What if... I <em>did</em>.</p>

<h2>Gaming on Arm Linux</h2>

<p>Valve just announced the Steam Frame, and it <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/virtual-reality/valve-announce-steam-frame-snapdragon-xr-headset-steam-os-arm-support">runs on Arm</a>.</p>

<p>Steam Frame will use <a href="https://fex-emu.com/">FEX</a> for its x86-Arm translation layer, and <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2025/11/6/twist-our-arm64-heres-the-latest-crossover-preview">CodeWeavers' Crossover Preview for Arm64</a> was just released, so I thought I'd give that a try on DGX OS (Nvidia's Linux OS, currently based on Ubuntu 24.04).</p>

<p>I was able to quickly install Steam, and through that, games like Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, and Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator II.</p>

<p>I'll leave the full experience and test results for you to see in this video:</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjRKvKC4ntw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>But bottom line, the Windows games I typically test on Arm systems through Steam/Proton played very well here, with no stuttering, and decent frame rates (100 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with low settings).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/dell-pro-max-gb10-gaming-doom-eternal.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-063e7f60-d443-4905-aa50-596163130fc9" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;063e7f60-d443-4905-aa50-596163130fc9&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Doom Eternal 200 fps Dell Pro Max GB10"></p>

<p>But no, I agree with Dell, this box should <em>not</em> be evaluated as a gaming machine. While it performs admirably for an Arm linux box, you could do a lot better with half the budget if you just wanted to build a dedicated gaming rig. Even with RAM prices as they are today.</p>

<h2>General Purpose Arm Workstation (with tons of VRAM)</h2>

<p>This machine is built for AI development, but it just so happens to have a very good Arm CPU and tons of RAM, so I wanted to test it for both running LLMs, and as a general Arm Linux workstation.</p>

<p>The video above has more depth, and you can find <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/92">all my benchmark data here</a>, but I wanted to focus on a few things in particular.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Before we get to benchmarks, I wanted to mention Nvidia's <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark/dgx-os.html#release-cadence">DGX OS</a>. Based on Ubuntu Linux, it's the only supported Linux distribution for GB10 systems. Regular Ubuntu LTS versions are supported for 5 years, with optional Pro support extending that out to 10 or even 15 years. But <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark/dgx-os.html#release-cadence">DGX OS only guarantees updates for two years</a>, though Nvidia doesn't really offer guarantees for its hardware support.</p>

<p>Their track record for ongoing support for their hardware is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-archive">decidedly mixed</a>, and in the absence of any guarantees, I wouldn't expect them to continue supporting the Spark or other GB10 systems beyond a few years.</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/has-anyone-tried-an-alternative-linux-distro/349124">Some people have had luck getting other distros running</a>, but they're still running <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NV-Kernels">Nvidia's kernel</a>. So if you buy one of these, know there's no guarantees for ongoing support.</p>

<p>Running things on DGX OS, I've found most server/headless software runs great, but there are still desktop tools that are more of a hassle. Like Blender doesn't have a stable release that uses GPU acceleration on Arm. But if you <a href="https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/blender-arm64/">compile it from source</a>like GitHub user CoconutMacaroon did, you can get full acceleration.</p>

<p>Just using this box as a little workstation, it is plenty fast for all the things I do, from coding, to browsing the web, to media editing. (Though media workflows are still rough on Linux in general, even on x86.)</p>

<h2>CPU benchmarks</h2>

<p>The Grace CPU is a 20-core Arm chip <a href="https://www.mediatek.com/press-room/newly-launched-nvidia-dgx-spark-features-gb10-superchip-co-designed-by-mediatek">co-designed by Mediatek</a>, fused together with the Blackwell GPU.</p>

<p>There must be some inefficiency there, though, because the system's idle power draw is a bit higher than I'm used to for Arm, coming in around 30 watts. A lot higher than Apple's M3 Ultra with 512GB of RAM, or even AMD's Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (these names just roll right off the tongue, don't they?).</p>

<p>In my testing, it seems the CPU itself maxes out around 140 watts, leaving another 140 watts of headroom for the GPU, network, and USB-C ports with PD.</p>

<p>Geekbench 6 was a little unstable, which was weird, but when I did get it to run, it was about on par with the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 system I tested earlier this year, the Framework Desktop.</p>

<p>Apple's 2-generation-old M3 Ultra Mac studio beats both, but it does cost quite a bit more, so that's to be expected.</p>

<p>And testing with High Performance Linpack, the Dell Pro Max gets about 675 Gflops:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gb10-benchmark-hpl.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-639ede2a-de04-4ad0-b703-8c2d776bb676" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;639ede2a-de04-4ad0-b703-8c2d776bb676&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 - HPL comparison"></p>

<p>NVIDIA's marketing said the GB10 <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-puts-grace-blackwell-on-every-desk-and-at-every-ai-developers-fingertips">"offers a petaflop of AI computing performance"</a>—a <em>thousand</em> teraflops! This thing can't even hit <em>one</em>...</p>

<p>But in the fine print, NVIDIA says it's a petaflop at <em>FP4 precision</em>. HPL tests FP64, aka double precision, which is more used in scientific computing. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fclc.bsky.social/post/3lc4qpte3ys2o">A FLOP is not always a FLOP</a>, and even the 'petaflop' claim seems disputed, at least if I'm reading <a href="https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1982831774850748825">John Carmack's tweets correctly</a>.</p>

<p>But at least for FP64 on the CPU, the GB10 is fairly efficient, at least compared to x86 systems I've tested:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gb10-benchmark-hpl-efficiency.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-479f4c08-0b47-4303-b90d-317d04312f80" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;479f4c08-0b47-4303-b90d-317d04312f80&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 - HPL efficiency comparison"></p>

<h2>Networking Performance</h2>

<p>A huge part of the value is the built-in ConnectX-7 networking. I tested that, and it's fast. But also a bit odd. Here's the maximum TCP performance I was able to get through the fastest interface on each of the three systems I've been comparing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gb10-benchmark-network.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ce70cde6-7dfe-4ef8-adc3-27d566ad6079" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ce70cde6-7dfe-4ef8-adc3-27d566ad6079&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 - Ethernet bandwidth"></p>

<p>But 106 Gigabits isn't 200, is NVIDIA lying?</p>

<p>Well, no... it's a little complicated. For full details, I'll refer you to the ServeTheHome article <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-nvidia-gb10-connectx-7-200gbe-networking-is-really-different/">The NVIDIA GB10 ConnectX-7 200GbE Networking is Really Different</a>.</p>

<p>Because the ports are each connected to a x4 PCIe Gen 5 link—which isn't enough bandwidth for 200 Gbps per port. To get a full 200 Gbps, you have to use Infiniband/RDMA and carefully configure the network topology. You won't get more than about 206 Gbps, maximum, in real world throughput, no matter how you set it up.</p>

<p>That's still honestly pretty good, but it's not the same as getting 400 Gbps of networking for AI clustering, like I think some of us expected reading the initial press releases in early 2025...</p>

<p>From the perspective of someone replicating NVIDIA's networking stack locally, though, having ConnectX ports built in is a boon. If you want replicate this kind of developer setup on AMD, you'd have to spend around the same amount of money, for the Max+ 395 plus a Connect-X 7 card.</p>

<p>Many people don't care about clustering use cases, or RDMA or Infiniband, but that doesn't mean it's not extremely useful for the people who <em>do</em>. This stuff's expensive, but to some people, it's not a bad value.</p>

<h2>AI Performance</h2>

<p>For now I'm just running two models, both of them with llama.cpp, optimized for each architecture.</p>

<p>And for a small model that requires a decent amount of CPU to keep up with the GPU, the GB10 does pretty well, almost hitting 100 tokens/s for inference, which is second to the M3 Ultra:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gb10-benchmark-ai-llama32-3b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-0b422ea5-d743-4a99-b3df-1fa67a9698af" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;0b422ea5-d743-4a99-b3df-1fa67a9698af&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 - AI llama small"></p>

<p>But for prompt processing, which is important for how quickly you start seeing a response from AI models, the GB10 chip is the winner, despite costing less than half the M3 Ultra.</p>

<p>And it's a similar story for a huge 'dense' model, Llama 3.1 70B, except here, it gets beat just a little by AMD's Strix Halo in the Framework Desktop:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gb10-benchmark-ai-llama31-70b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-c19de866-eb76-4092-a0af-e080da4c8f24" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c19de866-eb76-4092-a0af-e080da4c8f24&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10 - AI llama large"></p>

<p>Prompt processing is a strong selling point for these boxes. That's the reason Exo teased <a href="https://blog.exolabs.net/nvidia-dgx-spark/">running a DGX Spark as the compute node</a> for a Mac Studio cluster.</p>

<p>You can have the Spark, or one of these Dell's, handle the thing <em>it's</em> best at, prompt processing, while the Mac Studios handle the thing <em>they're</em> best at, memory bandwidth for token generation.</p>

<p>Anyway, these are just two quick AI benchmarks, and I have <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/ai-benchmarks/issues/34">a lot more in the Dell Pro Max with GB10 issue in my ai-benchmarks repository</a>. I'm doing a lot more testing, including model training and how I clustered two of these things in a tiny mini rack, but you'll have to wait until next year for that.</p>

    <p>December 7, 2020</p>
    <p>Pictures have always been a meaningful part of the human experience. From the first cave drawings, to sketches and paintings, to modern photography, we’ve mastered the art of recording what we see.</p>
<p>Cameras and the lenses inside them may seem a little mystifying. In this blog post I’d like to explain not only how they work, but also how adjusting a few tunable parameters can produce fairly different results:</p>




<p>Over the course of this article we’ll build a simple camera from first principles. Our first steps will be very modest – we’ll simply try to take any picture. To do that we need to have a sensor capable of detecting and measuring light that shines onto it.</p>
<h2 id="recording-light">Recording Light<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#recording-light" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Before the dawn of the digital era, photographs were taken on a piece of film covered in crystals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_halide">silver halide</a>. Those compounds are light-sensitive and when exposed to light they form a speck of metallic silver that can later be developed with further chemical processes.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, I’m not going to discuss analog devices – these days most cameras are digital. Before we continue the discussion relating to light we’ll use the classic trick of turning the illumination off. Don’t worry though, we’re not going to stay in darkness for too long.</p>

<div>
        
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor">image sensor</a> of a digital camera consists of a grid of photodetectors. A&nbsp;photodetector converts photons into electric current that can be measured – the more photons hitting the detector the higher the signal.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below you can observe how photons fall onto the arrangement of detectors represented by small squares. After some processing, the value read by each detector is converted to the brightness of the resulting image pixels which you can see on the right side. I’m also symbolically showing which <em>photosite</em> was hit with a short highlight. The slider below controls the flow of time:</p>


<p>The longer the time of collection of photons the more of them are hitting the detectors and the brighter the resulting pixels in the image. When we don’t gather enough photons the image is <a href="#" onclick="lens_under_exp();return false;">underexposed</a>, but if we allow the photon collection to run for too long the image will be <a href="#" onclick="lens_over_exp();return false;">overexposed</a>.</p>
<p>While the photons have the “color” of their <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/color-spaces/#and-there-was-light">wavelength</a>, the photodetectors don’t see that hue – they only measure the total intensity which results in a black and white image. To record the color information we need to separate the incoming photons into distinct groups. We can put tiny color filters on top of the detectors so that they will only accept, more or less, red, green, or blue light:</p>


<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_filter_array">color filter array</a> can be arranged in many different formations. One of the simplest is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer filter</a> which uses one red, one blue, and <em>two</em> green filters arranged in a 2x2 grid:</p>

<p>A Bayer filter uses two green filters because light in green part of the spectrum heavily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function">correlates</a> with perceived brightness. If we now repeat this pattern across the entire sensor we’re able to collect color information. For the next demo we will also double the resolution to an astonishing 1 kilopixel arranged in a 32x32 grid:</p>


<p>Note that the individual sensors themselves still only see the intensity, and not the color, but knowing the arrangement of the filters we can recreate the colored intensity of each sensor, as shown on the right side of the simulation.</p>
<p>The final step of obtaining a normal image is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing"><em>demosaicing</em></a>. During demosaicing we want to reconstruct the full color information by filling in the gaps in the captured RGB values. One of the simplest way to do it is to just linearly interpolate the values between the existing neighbors. I’m not going to focus on the details of many other available demosaicing algorithms and I’ll just present the resulting image created by the process:</p>


<p>Notice that yet again the overall brightness of the image depends on the length of time for which we let the photons through. That duration is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed"><em>shutter speed</em></a> or exposure time. For most of this presentation I will ignore the time component and we will simply assume that the shutter speed has been set <em>just right</em> so that the image is well exposed.</p>
<p>The examples we’ve discussed so far were very convenient – we were surrounded by complete darkness with the photons neatly hitting the pixels to form a coherent image. Unfortunately, we can’t count on the photon paths to be as favorable in real environments, so let’s see how the sensor performs in more realistic scenarios.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the course of this article we will be taking pictures of this simple scene. The almost white background of this website is also a part of the scenery – it represents a bright overcast sky. You can drag around the demo to see it from other directions:</p>

<p>Let’s try to see what sort of picture would be taken by a sensor that is placed near the objects without any enclosure. I’ll also significantly increase the sensor’s resolution to make the pixels of the final image align with the pixels of your display. In the demonstration below the left side represents a view of the scene with the small greenish sensor present, while the right one shows the taken picture:</p>

<p>This is not a mistake. As you can see, the obtained image doesn’t really resemble anything. To understand why this happens let’s first look at the light radiated from the scene.</p>
<p>If you had a chance to explore how <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/#reflections">surfaces reflect light</a>, you may recall that most matte surfaces scatter the incoming light in every direction. While I’m only showing a few examples, <em>every</em> point on every surface of this scene reflects the photons it receives from the whiteish background light source all around itself:</p>

<p>The red sphere ends up radiating red light, the green sphere radiates green light, and the gray checkerboard floor reflects white light of lesser intensity. Most importantly, however, the light emitted from the background is <em>also</em> visible to the sensor.</p>
<p>The problem with our current approach to taking pictures is that every pixel of the sensor is exposed to the <em>entire</em> environment. Light radiated from every point of the scene and the white background hits every point of the sensor. In the simulation below you can witness how light from different directions hits one point on the surface of the sensor:</p>

<p>Clearly, to obtain a discernible image we have to limit the range of directions that affect a given pixel on the sensor. With that in mind, let’s put the sensor in a box that has a small hole in it. The first slider controls the <span>diameter</span> of the hole, while the second one controls the <span>distance</span> between the opening and the sensor:</p>



<p>While not shown here, the inner sides of the walls are all black so that no light is reflected inside the box. I also put the sensor on the back wall so that the light from the hole shines onto it. We’ve just built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera"><em>pinhole camera</em></a>, let’s see how it performs. Observe what happens to the taken image as we tweak the <span>diameter</span> of the hole with the first slider, or change the <span>distance</span> between the opening and the sensor with the second one:</p>



<p>There are so many interesting things happening here! The most pronounced effect is that the image is inverted. To understand why this happens let’s look at the schematic view of the scene that shows the light rays radiated from the objects, going through the hole, and hitting the sensor:</p>

<p>As you can see the rays cross over in the hole and the formed image is a horizontal and a vertical reflection of the actual scene. Those two flips end up forming a 180° rotation. Since rotated images aren’t convenient to look at, all cameras automatically rotate the image for presentation and for the rest of this article I will do so as well.</p>
<p>When we change the <span>distance</span> between the hole and the sensor the viewing angle changes drastically. If we trace the rays falling on the corner pixels of the sensor we can see that they define the extent of the visible section of the scene:</p>


<p>Rays of light coming from outside of that shape still go through the pinhole, but they land outside of the sensor and aren’t recorded. As the hole moves further away from the sensor, the angle, and thus the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view">field of view</a> visible to the sensor gets smaller. We can see this in a top-down view of the camera:</p>


<p>Coincidentally, this diagram also helps us explain two other effects. Firstly, in the photograph the red sphere looks almost as big as the green one, even though the scene view shows the latter is much larger. However, both spheres end up occupying roughly <a href="#" onclick="lens_field_0();return false;">the same span</a> on the sensor and their size in the picture is similar. It’s also worth noting that the spheres seem to grow when the field of view gets narrower because their light covers larger part of the sensor.</p>
<p>Secondly, notice that different pixels of the sensor have different distance and relative orientation to the hole. The pixels right in the center of the sensor see the pinhole straight on, but pixels positioned at an angle to the main axis see a distorted pinhole that is further away. The ellipse in the bottom right corner of the demonstration below shows how a pixel positioned at the blue point sees the pinhole:</p>


<p>This change in the visible area of the hole causes the darkening we see in the corners of the photograph. The value of the <em>cosine</em> of the angle I’ve marked with a <span>yellow color</span> is quite important as it contributes to the reduction of visible light in four different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cosine factors from the increased distance to the hole, it’s essentially the <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/#inverse_square">inverse square law</a></li>
<li>A cosine factor from the side squeeze of the circular hole seen at an angle</li>
<li>A cosine factor from the relative <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/#cosine_factor">tilt of the receptor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These four factors conspire together to reduce the illumination by a factor of <strong>cos<sup>4</sup>(α)</strong> in what is known as <em>cosine-fourth-power law</em>, also described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting#Natural_vignetting">natural vignetting</a>.</p>
<p>Since we know the relative geometry of the camera and the opening we can correct for this effect by simply dividing by the falloff factor and from this point on I will make sure that the images don’t have darkened corners.</p>
<p>The final effect we can observe is that when the hole gets smaller the image gets sharper. Let’s see how the light radiated from two points of the scene ends up going through the camera depending on the <span>diameter</span> of the pinhole:</p>


<p>We can already see that larger hole size ends up creating a bigger spread on the sensor. Let’s see this situation up close on a simple grid of detecting cells. Notice what happens to the size of the final circle hitting the sensor as that <span>diameter</span> of the hole changes:</p>


<p>When the hole is <a href="#" onclick="lens_sharp_0();return false;">small enough</a> rays from the source only manage to hit one pixel on the sensor. However, at <a href="#" onclick="lens_sharp_1();return false;">larger radii</a> the light spreads onto other pixels and a tiny point in the scene is no longer represented by a single pixel causing the image to no longer be sharp.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that sharpness is ultimately arbitrary – it depends on the size at which the final image is seen, viewing conditions, and visual acuity of the observer. The same photograph that looks sharp on a postage stamp may in fact be very blurry when seen on a big display.</p>
<p>By reducing the size of the cone of light we can make sure that the source light affects a limited number of pixels. Here, however, lays the problem. The sensor we’ve been using so far has been an idealized detector capable of flawless adjustment of its sensitivity to the lighting conditions. If we instead were to fix the sensor sensitivity adjustment, the captured image would look more like this:</p>



<p>As the relative size of the hole visible to the pixels of the sensor gets smaller, be it due to reduced <span>diameter</span> or increased <span>distance</span>, fewer photons hit the surface and the image gets dimmer.</p>
<p>To increase the number of photons we capture we could extend the duration of collection, but increasing the exposure time comes with its own problems – if the photographed object moves or the camera isn’t held steady we risk introducing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur">motion blur</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could increase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed">sensitivity</a> of the sensor which is described using the ISO rating. However, boosting the ISO may introduce a higher level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise">noise</a>. Even with these problems solved an actual image obtained by smaller and smaller holes would actually start getting blurry again due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction">diffraction</a> effects of light.</p>
<p>If you recall how diffuse surfaces reflect light you may also realize how incredibly inefficient a pinhole camera is. A single point on the surface of an object radiates light into its surrounding hemisphere, however, the pinhole captures only a tiny portion of that light.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, a pinhole camera gives us minimal artistic control over <em>which</em> parts of the picture are blurry. In the demonstration below you can witness how changing which object is in focus heavily affects what is the primary target of attention of the photograph:</p>


<p>Let’s try to build an optical device that would solve both of these problems: we want to find a way to harness a bigger part of the energy radiated by the objects and also control what is blurry and <em>how</em> blurry it is. For the objects in the scene that are supposed to be sharp we want to collect a big chunk of their light and make it converge to the smallest possible point. In essence, we’re looking for an instrument that will do something like this:</p>

<p>We could then put the sensor at the focus point and obtain a sharp image. Naturally, the contraption we’ll try to create has to be transparent so that the light can pass through it and get to the sensor, so let’s begin the investigation by looking at a piece of glass.</p>
<h2 id="glass">Glass<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#glass" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>In the demonstration below I put a red stick behind a pane of glass. You can adjust the thickness of this pane with the <span>gray slider</span> below:</p>


<p>When you look at the stick through the surface of a thick glass <a href="#" onclick="lens_glass_0();return false;">straight on</a>, everything looks normal. However, as your viewing direction <a href="#" onclick="lens_glass_1();return false;">changes</a> the stick seen through the glass seems out of place. The thicker the glass and the steeper the viewing angle the bigger the offset.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on one point on the surface of the stick and see how the rays of light radiated from its surface propagate through the subsection of the glass. The <span>red slider</span> controls the position of the source and the <span>gray slider</span> controls the thickness.  You can drag the demo around to see it from different viewpoints:</p>



<p>For some reason the rays passing through glass at an angle are <a href="#" onclick="lens_glass_rays_0();return false;">deflected off their paths</a>. The change of direction happens whenever the ray enters or leaves the glass.</p>
<p>To understand <em>why</em> the light changes direction we have to peek under the covers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism">classical electromagnetism</a> and talk a bit more about waves.</p>
<h2 id="waves">Waves<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#waves" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>It’s impossible to talk about wave propagation without involving the time component, so the simulations in this section are animated – you can play and pause them by <span>clicking</span><span>tapping</span> on the button in their bottom left corner.</p>
<p>By default all animations are <span id="global_animate_on">enabled, but if you find them distracting, or if you want to save power, you can <a href="#" onclick="global_animate(false);return false;">globally pause</a> all the following demonstrations.</span><span id="global_animate_off">disabled, but if you’d prefer to have things moving as you read you can <a href="#" onclick="global_animate(true);return false;">globally unpause</a> them and see all the waves oscillating.</span></p>
<p>Let’s begin by introducing the simplest sinusoidal wave:</p>



<p>A wave like this can be characterized by two components. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength">Wavelength</a> <strong>λ</strong> is the distance over which the shape of the wave repeats. Period <strong>T</strong> defines how much time a full cycle takes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency">Frequency</a> <strong>f</strong>, is just a reciprocal of period and it’s more commonly used – it defines how many waves per second have passed over some fixed point. Wavelength and frequency define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity">phase velocity</a> <strong>v<sub>p</sub></strong> which describes how quickly a point on a wave, e.g. a peak, moves:</p>
<p><span>v<sub>p</sub></span> = <span>λ</span> · <span>f</span> 
</p>
<p>The sinusoidal wave is the building block of a polarized electromagnetic plane wave. As the name implies electromagnetic radiation is an interplay of oscillations of electric field <strong>E</strong> and magnetic field <strong>B</strong>:</p>

<p>In an electromagnetic wave the magnetic field is tied to the electric field so I’m going to hide the former and just visualize the latter. Observe what happens to the electric component of the field as it passes through a block of glass. I need to note that dimensions of wavelengths are <em>not</em> to scale:</p>

<p>Notice that the wave remains continuous at the boundary and inside the glass the frequency of the passing wave remains constant, However, the wavelength and thus the phase velocity are reduced – you can see it clearly <a href="#" onclick="lens_wave_glass_0();return false;">from the side</a>.</p>
<p>The microscopic reason for the phase velocity change is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald%E2%80%93Oseen_extinction_theorem">quite complicated</a>, but it can be quantified using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index"><em>index of refraction</em></a> <strong>n</strong>, which is the ratio of the speed of light <strong>c</strong> to the phase velocity <strong>v<sub>p</sub></strong> of lightwave in that medium:</p>
<p><span>n</span> = <span><span>c</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>v<sub>p</sub></span>
</span>
</p>
<p>The higher the index of refraction the <em>slower</em> light propagates through the medium. In the table below I’ve presented a few different indices of refraction for some materials:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>vacuum</td><td>1.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>air</td><td>1.0003</td></tr>
<tr><td>water</td><td>1.33</td></tr>
<tr><td>glass</td><td>1.53</td></tr>
<tr><td>diamond</td><td>2.43</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Light traveling through air barely slows down, but in a diamond it’s over twice as slow. Now that we understand how <span>index of refraction</span> affects the wavelength in the glass, let’s see what happens when we change the <span>direction</span> of the incoming wave:</p>



<p>The wave in the glass has a shorter wavelength, but it still has to match the positions of its peaks and valleys across the boundary. As such, the direction of propagation <a href="#" onclick="lens_wave_glass_2();return false;">must change</a> to ensure that continuity.</p>
<p>I need to note that the previous two demonstrations presented a two dimensional wave since that allowed me to show the sinusoidal component oscillating into the third dimension. In real world the lightwaves are three dimensional and I can’t really visualize the sinusoidal component without using the fourth dimension which has <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/tesseract/">its own set of complications</a>.</p>
<p>The alternative way of presenting waves is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"><em>wavefronts</em></a>. Wavefronts connect the points of the same phase of the wave, e.g. all the peaks or valleys. In two dimensions wavefronts are represented by lines:</p>

<p>In three dimensions the wavefronts are represented by <em>surfaces</em>. In the demonstration below a single source emits a spherical wave, points of the same phase in the wave are represented by the moving shells:</p>

<p>By drawing lines that are perpendicular to the surface of the wavefront we create the familiar rays. In this interpretation rays simply show the local direction of wave propagation which can be seen in this example of a section of a spherical 3D wave:</p>

<p>I will continue to use the ray analogy to quantify the change in direction of light passing through materials. The relation between the angle of incidence <strong>θ<sub>1</sub></strong> and angle of refraction <strong>θ<sub>2</sub></strong> can be formalized with the equation known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law">Snell’s law</a>:</p>
<p><span>n<sub>1</sub></span> · sin(θ<sub>1</sub>) = <span>n<sub>2</sub></span> · sin(θ<sub>2</sub>)
</p>
<p>It describes how a ray of light changes direction relative to the surface normal on the border between two different media. Let’s see it in action:</p>




<p>When traveling from a less to more refractive material the ray bends <a href="#" onclick="lens_snell_0();return false;"><em>towards</em> the normal</a>, but when the ray exits the object with higher index of refraction it bends <a href="#" onclick="lens_snell_1();return false;"><em>away</em> from the normal</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that in <a href="#" onclick="lens_snell_2();return false;">some configurations</a> the refracted ray completely disappears, however, this doesn’t paint a full picture because we’re currently completely ignoring reflections.</p>
<p>All transparent objects reflect some amount of light. You may have noticed that reflection on a surface of a calm lake or even on the other side of the glass demonstration at the beginning of the <a href="#glass">previous section</a>. The intensity of that reflection depends on the index of refraction of the material and the angle of the incident ray. Here’s a more realistic demonstration of how light would get refracted <em>and</em> reflected between two media:</p>




<p>The relation between <em>transmittance</em> and <em>reflectance</em> is determined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">Fresnel equations</a>. Observe that the curious case of missing light that we saw previously <a href="#" onclick="lens_snell_3();return false;">no longer occurs</a> – that light is actually reflected. The transition from partial reflection and refraction to the complete reflection is continuous, but near the end it’s very rapid and at some point the refraction <a href="#" onclick="lens_snell_4();return false;">completely disappears</a> in the effect known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection">total internal reflection</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection#Critical_angle"><em>critical angle</em></a> at which the total internal reflection starts to happen depends on the indices of refraction of the boundary materials. Since that coefficient is low for air, but very high for diamond a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(diamond_cut)">proper cut</a> of the faces <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/43361/why-do-diamonds-shine/43373#43373">makes diamonds</a> very shiny.</p>
<p>While interesting on its own, reflection in glass isn’t very relevant to our discussion and for the rest of this article we’re not going to pay much attention to it. Instead, we’ll simply assume that the materials we’re using are covered with high quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-reflective_coating">anti-reflective coating</a>.</p>
<h2 id="manipulating-rays">Manipulating Rays<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#manipulating-rays" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Let’s go back to the example that started the discussion of light and glass. When both sides of a piece of glass are parallel, the ray is shifted, but it still travels in the same direction. Observe what happens to the ray when we change the relative angle of the surfaces of the glass.</p>


<p>When we make two surfaces of the glass <em>not</em> parallel we gain the ability to change the direction of the rays. Recall, that we’re trying to make the rays hitting the optical device <em>converge</em> at a certain point. To do that we have to bend the rays in the upper part down and, conversely, bend the rays in the lower part up.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens if we shape the glass to have different angles between its walls at different height. In the demonstration below you can control how many distinct segments a piece of glass is shaped to:</p>

<p>As the number of segments <a href="#" onclick="lens_subdiv_0();return false;">approaches infinity</a> we end up with a continuous surface without any edges. If we look at the crossover point <a href="#" onclick="lens_subdiv_1();return false;">from the side</a> you may notice that we’ve managed to converge the rays across one axis, but the top-down view <a href="#" onclick="lens_subdiv_2();return false;">reveals</a> that we’re not done yet. To focus all the rays we need to replicate that smooth shape across <em>all</em> possible directions – we need rotational symmetry:</p>

<p>We’ve created a <em>convex</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_lens">thin lens</a>. This lens is idealized, in the later part of the article we’ll discuss how real lenses aren’t as perfect, but for now it will serve us very well. Let’s see what happens to the focus point when we change the position of the <span>red</span> source:</p>


<p>When the source is positioned <a href="#" onclick="lens_inf();return false;">very far away</a> the incoming rays become parallel and after passing through lens they converge at a certain distance away from the center. That distance is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length"><em>focal length</em></a>.</p>
<p>The previous demonstration also shows two more general distances: <strong>s<sub>o</sub></strong> which is the distance between the <strong>o</strong>bject, or source, and the lens, as well as <strong>s<sub>i</sub></strong> which is the distance between the <strong>i</strong>mage and the lens. These two values and the focal length <strong>f</strong> are related by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_lens#Image_formation"><em>thin lens equation</em></a>:</p>
<p><span><span>1</span>

</span>
=
<span><span>1</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>f</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Focal length of a lens depends on both the <span>index of refraction</span> of the material from which the lens is made and its <span>shape</span>:</p>



<p>Now that we understand how a simple convex lens works we’re ready to mount it into the hole of our camera. We will still control the <span>distance</span>  between the sensor and the lens, but instead of controlling the diameter of the lens we’ll instead control its <span>focal length</span>:</p>



<p>When you look at the lens <a href="#" onclick="lens_camera_lens();return false;">from the side</a> you may observe how the <span>focal length</span> change is tied to the shape of the lens. Let’s see how this new camera works in action:</p>



<p>Once again, a lot of things are going on here! Firstly, let’s try to understand how the image is formed in the first place. The demonstration below shows paths of rays from two separate points in the scene. After going through the lens they end up hitting the sensor:</p>



<p>Naturally, this process happens for <em>every</em> single point in the scene which creates the final image. Similarly to a pinhole a convex lens creates an inverted picture – I’m still correcting for this by showing you a rotated photograph.</p>
<p>Secondly, notice that the distance between the lens and the sensor still controls the field of view. As a reminder, the focal length of a lens simply defines the distance from the lens at which the rays coming from infinity converge. To achieve a sharp image, the sensor has to be placed at the location where the rays focus and <em>that’s</em> what’s causing the field of view to change.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below I’ve visualized how rays from a very far object focus through a lens of adjustable <span>focal length</span>, notice that to obtain a sharp image we must change the <span>distance</span> between the lens and the sensor which in turn causes the field of view to change:</p>



<p>If we want to change the object on which a camera with a lens of a fixed focal length is focused, we have to move the image plane closer or further away from the lens which affects the angle of view. This effect is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_(lens)">focus breathing</a>:</p>


<p>A lens with a fixed focal length like the one above is often called a <em>prime</em> lens, while lenses with adjustable focal length are called <em>zoom</em> lenses. While the lenses in our eyes do dynamically adjust their focal lengths by changing their shape, rigid glass can’t do that so zoom lenses use a system of multiple glass elements that change their relative position to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>In the simulation above notice the difference in sharpness between the red and green spheres. To understand why this happens let’s analyze the rays emitted from two points on the surface of the spheres. In the demonstration below the right side shows the light seen by the sensor <em>just</em> from the two marked points on the spheres:</p>


<p>The light from the point in focus converges to a point, while the light from an out-of-focus point spreads onto a circle. For larger objects the multitude of overlapping out-of-focus circles creates a smooth blur called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"><em>bokeh</em></a>. With tiny and bright light sources that circle itself is often visible, you may have seen effects like the one in the demonstration below in some photographs captured in darker environments:</p>



<p>Notice that the circular shape is visible for lights both in front of and behind the focused distance. As the object is positioned closer or further away from the lens the image plane “slices” the cone of light at different location:</p>


<p>That circular spot is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion"><em>circle of confusion</em></a>. While in many circumstances the blurriness of the background or the foreground looks very appealing, it would be very useful to control how much blur there is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have total freedom here – we still want the primary photographed object to remain in focus so its light has to converge to a point. We just want to change the size of the circle of out-of-focus objects without moving the central point. We can accomplish that by changing the <em>angle</em> of the cone of light:</p>


<p>There are two methods we can use to modify that angle. Firstly, we can change the focal length of the lens – you may recall that with longer focal lengths the cone of light also gets longer. However, changing the focal length and keeping the primary object in focus requires moving the image plane which in turn changes how the picture is framed.</p>
<p>The alternative way of reducing the angle of the cone of light is to simply ignore some of the “outer” rays. We can achieve that by introducing a stop with a hole in the path of light:</p>


<p>This hole is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"><em>aperture</em></a>. In fact, even the hole in which the lens is mounted is an aperture of some sort, but what we’re introducing is an <em>adjustable</em> aperture:</p>



<p>Let’s try to see how an aperture affects the photographs taken with our camera:</p>



<p>In real camera lenses an adjustable aperture is often constructed from a set of overlapping blades that constitute an <em>iris</em>. The movement of those blades changes the size of the aperture:</p>


<p>The shape of the aperture also defines the shape of bokeh. This is the reason why bokeh sometimes has a polygonal shape – it’s simply the shape of the “cone” of light after passing through the blades of the aperture. Next time you watch a movie pay a close attention to the shape of out-of-focus highlights, they’re often polygonal:</p>


<p>As the aperture diameter decreases, larger and larger areas of the photographed scene remain sharp. The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field"><em>depth of field</em></a> is used to define the length of the region over which the objects are acceptably sharp. When describing the depth of field we’re trying to conceptually demark those two boundary planes and see how far apart they are from each other.</p>
<p>Let’s see the depth of field in action. The <span>black slider</span> controls the aperture, the <span>blue slider</span> controls the focal length, and the <span>red slider</span> changes the position of the object relative to the camera. The <span><strong>green dot</strong></span> shows the place of perfect focus, while the <span><strong>dark blue dots</strong></span> show the limits, or the depth, of positions between which the image of the red light source will be reasonably sharp, as shown by a single outlined pixel on the sensor:</p>




<p>Notice that <a href="#" onclick="lens_dof_0();return false;">the larger</a> the <span>diameter of aperture</span> and <a href="#" onclick="lens_dof_1();return false;">the shorter</a> the <span>focal length</span> the shorter the distance between the <span><strong>dark blue dots</strong></span> and thus the <em>shallower</em> the depth of field becomes. If you recall our discussion of sharpness this demonstration should make it easier to understand why reducing the angle of the cone <em>increases</em> the depth of field.</p>
<p>If you don’t have perfect vision you may have noticed that squinting your eyes make you see things a little better. Your eyelids covering some part of your iris simply act as an aperture that decreases the angle of the cone of light falling into your eyes making things sightly less blurry on your retina.</p>
<p>An interesting observation is that aperture defines the diameter of the base of the captured cone of light that is emitted from the object. Twice as large aperture diameter captures roughly <em>four</em> times more light due to increased <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/#solid-angles">solid angle</a>. In practice, the actual size of the aperture as seen from the point of view of the scene, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrance_pupil"><em>entrance pupil</em></a>, depends on all the lenses in front of it as the shaped glass may scale the perceived size of the aperture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a lens is focused correctly, the focal length defines how large a source object is in the picture. By doubling the focal length we double the width <em>and</em> the height of the object on the sensor thus increasing the area by the factor of four. The light from the source is more spread out and each individual pixel receives less light.</p>
<p>The total amount of light hitting each pixel is proportional to the <em>ratio</em> between the focal length <strong>f</strong> and the diameter of the entrance pupil <strong>D</strong>. This ratio is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number"><em>f-number</em></a>:</p>
<p><span>N</span> = <span><span>f</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>D</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>A lens with a focal length of 50 mm and the entrance pupil of 25 mm would have <strong>N</strong> equal to 2 and the <em>f</em>-number would be known as <em>f</em>/2. Since the amount of light getting to each pixel of the sensor increases with the diameter of the aperture and decreases with the focal length, the <em>f</em>-number controls the brightness of the projected image.</p>
<p>The <em>f</em>-number with which commercial lenses are marked usually defines the maximum aperture a lens can achieve and the smaller the <em>f</em>-number the more light the lens passes through. Bigger amount of incoming light allows reduction of exposure time, so the smaller the <em>f</em>-number the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_speed"><em>faster</em></a> the lens is. By reducing the size of the aperture we can modify the <em>f</em>-number with which a picture is taken.</p>
<p>The <em>f</em>-numbers are often multiples of 1.4 which is an approximation of <span>2</span>. Scaling the diameter of an adjustable aperture by <span>2</span> scales its <em>area</em> by 2 which is a convenient factor to use. Increasing the <em>f</em>-number by a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number#Stops,_f-stop_conventions,_and_exposure"><em>stop</em></a> halves the amount of received light. The demonstration below shows the relatives sizes of the aperture through which light is being seen:</p>

<div>
        


<p>To maintain the overall brightness of the image when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_down">stopping down</a> we’d have to either increase the exposure time or the sensitivity of the sensor.</p>
</div>

<p>While aperture settings let us easily control the depth of field, that change comes at a cost. When the <em>f</em>-number increases and the aperture diameter gets smaller we effectively start approaching a pinhole camera with all its related complications.</p>
<p>In the final part of this article we will discuss the entire spectrum of another class of problems that we’ve been conveniently avoiding all this time.</p>
<h2 id="aberrations">Aberrations<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#aberrations" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>In our examples so far we’ve been using a perfect idealized lens that did exactly what we want and in all the demonstrations I’ve relied on a certain simplification known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraxial_approximation">paraxial approximation</a>. However, the physical world is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>The most common types of lenses are <em>spherical</em> lenses – their curved surfaces are sections of spheres of different radii. These types of lenses are easier to manufacture, however, they actually don’t perfectly converge the rays of incoming light. In the demonstration below you can observe how fuzzy the focus point is for various lens radii:</p>


<p>This imperfection is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"><em>spherical aberration</em></a>. This specific flaw can be corrected with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"><em>aspheric lenses</em></a>, but unfortunately there are other types of problems that may not be easily solved by a single lens. In general, for monochromatic light there are five primary types of aberrations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration">spherical aberration</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(optics)">coma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(optical_systems)">astigmatism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petzval_field_curvature">field curvature</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics)">distortion</a>.</p>
<p>We’re still not out of the woods even if we manage to minimize these problems. In normal environments light is very <em>non</em>-monochromatic and nature sets another hurdle into optical system design. Let’s quickly go back to the dark environment as we’ll be discussing a single beam of white light.</p>

<div>
        
<p>Observe what happens to that beam when it hits a piece of glass. You can make the sides non-parallel by using the slider:</p>


<p>What we perceive as white light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths. In fact, the index of refraction of materials <em>depends</em> on the wavelength of the light. This phenomena called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"><em>dispersion</em></a> splits what seems to be a uniform beam of white light into a fan of color bands. The very same mechanism that we see here is also responsible for a rainbow.</p>
<p>In a lens this causes different wavelengths of light to focus at different offsets – the effect known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration"><em>chromatic aberration</em></a>. We can easily visualize the <em>axial</em> chromatic aberration even on a lens with spherical aberration fixed. I’ll only use red, green, and blue dispersed rays to make things less crowded, but remember that other colors of the spectrum are present in between. Using the slider you can control the amount of dispersion the lens material introduces:</p>


<p>Chromatic aberration may be corrected with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lens">achromatic lens</a>, usually in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(lens)">doublet</a> with two different types of glass fused together.</p>
<br>

    </div>


<p>To minimize the impact of the aberrations, camera lenses use more than one optical element on their pathways. In this article I’ve only shown you simple lens systems, but a high-end camera lens may consist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Objective_Zeiss_Cut.jpg">a lot of elements</a> that were carefully designed to balance the optical performance, weight, and cost.</p>
<p>While we, in our world of computer simulations on this website, can maintain the illusion of simple and perfect systems devoid of aberrations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting">vignetting</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_flare">lens flares</a>, real cameras and lenses have to deal with all these problems to make the final pictures look good.</p>

<p>Over on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFAYalJ2Q7Tm_WmLgetmeg">Filmmaker IQ channel</a> has a lot of great content related to lenses and movie making. Two videos especially fitting here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YIvvXxsR5Y">The History and Science of Lenses</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lte9pa3RtUk">Focusing on Depth of Field and Lens Equivalents</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1n2DR6H7mk">What Makes Cinema Lenses So Special!?</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJe8uQhM2G4jJFRWiM89Wg">Potato Jet channel</a> is a great interview with Art Adams from <a href="https://www.arri.com/en/">ARRI</a>. The video goes over many interesting details of high-end cinema lens design, for example, how the lenses <a href="https://youtu.be/q1n2DR6H7mk?t=370">compensate for focus breathing</a>, or how much attention is paid to the <a href="https://youtu.be/q1n2DR6H7mk?t=899">quality of bokeh</a>.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive on bokeh itself Jakub Trávník’s <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/bokeh/index.html">On Bokeh</a> is a great article on the subject. The author explains how aberrations may cause bokeh of non uniform intensity and shows many photographs of real cameras and lenses.</p>
<p>In this article I’ve mostly been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics">geometrical optics</a> with some soft touches of electromagnetism. For a more modern look at the nature of light and its interaction with matter I recommend Richard Feynman’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter">QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</a>. The book is written in a very approachable style suited for general audience, but it still lets Feynman’s wits and brilliance shine right through.</p>

<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of optics and camera lens design, but even the most complex systems end up serving the same purpose: to tell light where to go. In some sense optical engineering is all about taming the nature of light.</p>
<p>The simple act of pressing the shutter button in a camera app on a smartphone or on the body of a high-end DSLR is effortless, but it’s at this moment when, through carefully guided rays hitting an array of photodetectors, we immortalize reality by painting with light.</p>

<p id="1de52338-63f3-4f30-ab8e-b2f1027cd57e">The PlayStation 5’s ROM keys have allegedly been leaked, meaning anyone who can get their hands on the hex strings now has the hardware code that will allow jailbreakers to try decrypting and analyzing the console’s bootloader. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" data-url="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">The Cybersec Guru</a>, this is an unpatchable problem for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>, because these keys cannot be changed and are burned directly in the APU. The only way that the company can invalidate the leaked codes is to replace the chips on yet-to-be-manufactured units, meaning consoles that are already in the wild could possibly take advantage of future jailbreaks stemming from the use of these leaked codes.</p><p>When you turn on the PS5, its CPU runs the BootROM code that’s baked in the chip and uses the ROM keys to ensure that Bootloader is valid. Now that the ROM keys have been leaked (and assuming they are valid), a hacker could then decrypt and study the official bootloader and potentially use that as a starting point to understand how the PS5’s boot system works. Since the issue is at a hardware level, Sony would not be able to release an update that will stop consoles with the compromised chip from loading kernel-level exploits in the future, should one become available.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Sony has had to deal with a security crisis with the popular PlayStation family. The PlayStation 3 was previously hit with a vulnerability when the company made a mistake with their cryptography on the console, allowing users to install homebrew software and allow piracy and cheating on popular titles. We also saw this with the Nintendo Switch, when a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tegra-vulnerability-affects-every-nintendo-switch,36942.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tegra-vulnerability-affects-every-nintendo-switch,36942.html">flaw in the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip that it used let tinkerers run Linux on the handheld</a>.</p><p>Sony has yet to release a statement regarding the hack, but the company could release revised hardware in the near future to rectify the situation. Another solution is to issue a recall for all existing PlayStation 5 consoles on the market and replace their motherboard to change the hardware codes, but this is unlikely to happen as it’s either going to be too costly for the company or gamers would be unwilling to pay extra for a mistake that was ultimately not theirs.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="d2c9db27-6a47-4468-85a2-fb7349e49791" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">
