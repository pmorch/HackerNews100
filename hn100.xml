            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dynomight.net/theanine/">https://dynomight.net/theanine/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43305803">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>The internet <em>loves</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">theanine</a>. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.</p>

<p><em>Many</em> people try theanine and report <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/15kpfl9/ltheanine_wow/"><em>wow</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ekbrgl/anyone_have_good_experiences_with_ltheanine/lgke7ys/"><em>great for ADHD</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/o7smk5/l_theanine_cured_my_social_anxiety_im_blown_away/"><em>cured my (social) anxiety</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ethltn/ltheanine_is_changing_my_life/"><em>changing my life</em></a>. And it’s not just the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nootropics/">placebo enthusiast</a> community. This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41765607">hacker news thread</a> is full of positive reports, and <a href="https://gwern.net/nootropic/nootropics#defaults">gwern</a> uses it regularly.</p>

<p>But does it really work?</p>

<p>Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)">glutamate</a> (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine#In_vitro">complicated</a> effects on glutamate receptors.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of supplements that <em>could</em> act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier">thin layer of cells</a> that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.615"><em>can</em></a> get through these cells and into the brain.</p>

<p>So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on <a href="https://dynomight.net/aspartame/#the-european-food-safety-authority-efsa">these kinds of issues</a>, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2238">assessment</a> in 2011 and found:</p>

      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Improvement of cognitive function</td>

      <td>cause and effect relationship has not been established</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/">Examine</a> is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found <em>low quality evidence</em> for <em>near zero effect</em>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00771-5">2020 review</a> of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine <em>might</em> help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam">alprazolam</a> (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s <em>impossible</em>, and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.</p>

<p>After 2020, the only major trial I could find was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2020.4803">this 2021 study</a> that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-did-this">Why I did this</h2>

<p>I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I <em>do</em> find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)</p>

<p>Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?</p>

<p>Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees theanine is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/182086/download">safe</a>. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t <em>disproven</em> one either. Given the vast <em>anecdotal</em> evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>

<p>First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?</p>

<p>So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:</p>

  <li>Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.</li>
  <li>Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.</li>
  <li>Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are almost but not <em>quite</em> the same color.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.</li>
  <li>The capsules themselves aren’t made from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin">skin and bones and connective tissues of dead animals</a> (personal preference).</li>
</ol>

<p>After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules:</p>

<p><strong>Capsule A:</strong> 200 mg L-Theanine</p>

<p><strong>Capsule B:</strong> 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin D</p>

<p>These are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and <em>very</em> close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are <em>slightly</em> more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re <em>acute</em>, that you’d feel them within an hour.</p>

<p>For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.</p>

<p>Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.</p>

<p>Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.</p>

<p>Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/capsules.jpg" alt="capsules"></p>

<p>This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.</p>

<p>For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.112.166371">enough</a> to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.</p>

<p>After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had <em>too</em> much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-results">What are the results?</h2>

<p>Bad.</p>

<p>Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Alternatively, here’s the <em>difference</em> in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/diff.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/diff.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress_beforeafter.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress_beforeafter.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/probs.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/probs.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ooof.</p>

<p>My stress level <em>did</em> usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was <em>terrible</em> at guessing what I’d taken.</p>

<p>Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.</p>

<p>So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but I was unlucky.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.</li>
  <li>Theanine works on some people, but not me.</li>
  <li>Theanine doesn’t work.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I <em>really</em> tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect <em>any</em> sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that <em>this</em> time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>So, cards on the table, here are my <a href="https://dynomight.net/bayes/">made-up probabilities</a> for each of the possible explanations:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Explanation</th>
      <th>belief</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Fake theanine</td>
      <td>3%</td>
    </tr>

      <td>D equally good</td>
      <td>1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Doesn’t work</td>
      <td>55%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other <em>good</em> self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by <a href="https://niplav.site/nootropics#LTheanine">Niplav</a>, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.</p>

<p>What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:</p>

</table>

<p>Stimulants work! But for everything else…</p>

<p>I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.</p>

<p>I’ve seen <em>many</em> other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I liked to them. People often mention that <em>hypothetically</em> this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.</p>

<p>So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.</p>

<p>I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-ok-fine-lets-argue-about-statistics">Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statistics</h2>

<p>Do you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?</p>

<p>I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a <em>little</em> statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a <em>lot</em> of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.</p>

<p>If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.</p>

<p>While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t <em>independent</em> or <em>identically distributed</em>. If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.</p>

<p>But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Substance</th>
      <th>Mean</th>
      <th>95% C.I.</th>
      <th>p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>start stress</td>
      <td>theanine</td>
      <td>2.480</td>
      <td>(2.361, 2.599)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>end stress</td>
      <td>theanine</td>
      <td>2.181</td>
      <td>(2.104, 2.258)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Δ stress</td>
      <td>theanine</td>
      <td>-0.299</td>
      <td>(-0.392, -0.205)</td>
      <td>2.00×10⁻⁸</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Predicted T</td>
      <td>theanine</td>
      <td>68.4%</td>
      <td>(66.2%, 70.5%)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Stress went down, p &lt; .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Substance</th>
      <th>Mean</th>
      <th>95% C.I.</th>
      <th>p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>start stress</td>
      <td>vitamin D</td>
      <td>2.350</td>
      <td>(2.173, 2.526)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>end stress</td>
      <td>vitamin D</td>
      <td>2.025</td>
      <td>(1.936, 2.114)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Δ stress</td>
      <td>vitamin D</td>
      <td>-0.325</td>
      <td>(-0.453, -0.197)</td>
      <td>2.44×10⁻⁵</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Predicted T</td>
      <td>vitamin D</td>
      <td>72.9%</td>
      <td>(69.7%, 76.1%)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Stress <em>also</em> went down.</p>

<p>Finally, here’s the difference between theanine and vitamin D, computed with a <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.weightstats.CompareMeans.ttest_ind.html#statsmodels.stats.weightstats.CompareMeans.ttest_ind">two-sided t-test with unequal variance</a>:</p>

<table>

      <th>95% C.I.</th>
      <th>p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>start stress</td>
      <td>theanine - D</td>
      <td>0.130</td>
      <td>(-0.095, 0.354)</td>
      <td>0.254</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>end stress</td>
      <td>theanine - D</td>
      <td>0.156</td>
      <td>(0.0165, 0.296)</td>
      <td>0.029</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Δ stress</td>
      <td>theanine - D</td>
      <td>-0.026</td>
      <td>(-0.201, 0.148)</td>
      <td>0.764</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Predicted T</td>
      <td>theanine - D</td>
      <td>-4.5%</td>
      <td>(-8.5%, -0.5%)</td>
      <td>0.029</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly <em>higher</em> with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly <em>higher</em> probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.</p>

How it simplifies AI integrations compared to APIs" title="What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)? How it simplifies AI integrations compared to APIs"></p>
<p><strong>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong> is a new open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<p>Think of MCP like a USB-C port but for AI agents: it offers a uniform method for connecting AI systems to various tools and data sources.</p>
<p>This post breaks down MCP, clearly explaining its value, architecture, and how it differs from traditional APIs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mcp">What is MCP?<a href="#what-is-mcp" aria-label="Direct link to What is MCP?" title="Direct link to What is MCP?">​</a></h2>
<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sources. Imagine it as a USB-C port - but for AI applications.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="What is MCP?" src="https://norahsakal.com/assets/images/mcp_overview-641a298352ff835488af36be3d8eee52.png" title="What is MCP?" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sources</p>
<p>Just as USB-C simplifies how you connect different devices to your computer, MCP simplifies how AI models interact with your data, tools, and services.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-mcp-instead-of-traditional-apis">Why use MCP instead of traditional APIs?<a href="#why-use-mcp-instead-of-traditional-apis" aria-label="Direct link to Why use MCP instead of traditional APIs?" title="Direct link to Why use MCP instead of traditional APIs?">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, connecting an AI system to external tools involves integrating multiple APIs. Each API integration means separate code, documentation, authentication methods, error handling, and maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="why-traditional-apis-are-like-having-separate-keys-for-every-door">Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door<a href="#why-traditional-apis-are-like-having-separate-keys-for-every-door" aria-label="Direct link to Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door" title="Direct link to Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Metaphorically Speaking:</strong> APIs are like individual doors - each door has its own key and rules:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Why use MCP instead of traditional APIs?" src="https://norahsakal.com/assets/images/api_overview-0d9335920826e30bba0897997f599829.png" title="Why use MCP instead of traditional APIs?" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>Traditional APIs require developers to write custom integrations for each service or data source</p>

<p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) started as a project by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic ↗</a> to make it easier for AI models - like Claude - to interact with tools and data sources.</p>
<p>But it's not just an Anthropic thing anymore. MCP is open, and more companies and developers are jumping on board.</p>
<p>It's starting to look a lot like a new standard for AI-tool interactions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single protocol:</strong> MCP acts as a standardized "connector," so integrating one MCP means potential access to multiple tools and services, not just one</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic discovery:</strong> MCP allows AI models to dynamically discover and interact with available tools without hard-coded knowledge of each integration</li>
<li><strong>Two-way communication:</strong> MCP supports persistent, real-time two-way communication - similar to WebSockets. The AI model can both retrieve information and trigger actions dynamically</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>MCP Hosts:</strong> These are applications (like Claude Desktop or AI-driven IDEs) needing access to external data or tools</li>
<li><strong>MCP Clients:</strong> They maintain dedicated, one-to-one connections with MCP servers</li>
<li><strong>MCP Servers:</strong> Lightweight servers exposing specific functionalities via MCP, connecting to local or remote data sources</li>
<li><strong>Local Data Sources:</strong> Files, databases, or services securely accessed by MCP servers</li>
<li><strong>Remote Services:</strong> External internet-based APIs or services accessed by MCP servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visualizing MCP as a bridge makes it clear:</strong> MCP doesn't handle heavy logic itself; it simply coordinates the flow of data and instructions between AI models and tools.</p>

<p>In practice, an MCP client (e.g., a Python script in <code>client.py</code>) communicates with MCP servers that manage interactions with specific tools like <strong>Gmail, Slack, or calendar apps</strong>.</p>
<p>This standardization removes complexity, letting developers quickly enable sophisticated interactions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/">https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43302132">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>
We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
</p>
<p>We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.</p>
<p>Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.</p>
<p>Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.</p>
<p>Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.</p>
<p>The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak">They know</a> that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.</p>
<p>With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.</p>
<p>We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.</p>
<p>Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this <a href="https://youtu.be/QEJpZjg8GuA">algorithmic complacency</a>, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-power-back">Take the Power Back</h2>
<p>It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.</p>
<p>We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.</p>
<p>So what can we do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.</li>
<li>Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.</li>
<li>Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-rss-feeds/">RSS feeds</a></li>
<li>Be mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.</li>
<li>Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

When the DOJ argued for its sale last year, it <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/department-of-justice-confirms-that-it-wants-google-to-sell-off-chrome-094929822.html" data-ylk="slk:said that selling Chrome;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">said that selling Chrome</a> "will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet."</p><p>The Justice Department also kept a Biden-era proposal that seeks to ban Google from paying companies like Apple, other smartphone manufacturers and Mozilla to make its search engine the default on their phones and browsers. It did remove a previous proposal that would compel Google to sell its stakes in AI startups, however, after Anthropic told the government that it needs the company's money to continue operating. Instead of banning AI investments altogether, the government wants to require the company to notify federal and state officials before making investments in artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the <em>Financial Times </em><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-investing-another-billion-dollars-in-anthropic-145548826.html" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> that Google was investing another billion dollars in Anthropic.</p><p>Google is expected to file its own proposal for its final set of alternative remedies.

Google suggested allowing it continue paying partners like Apple and Mozilla to offer Google Search, but also to allow them to form agreements with other partners across different platforms. Apple could, for instance, offer different default search engines for iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, browser companies could change default search engines every 12 months.</p><p>As <em>The Post</em> notes, the Justice Department's filing could be an indicator of how the Trump administration will handle antitrust cases involving tech companies. It could be strict on big tech like the Biden administration was despite tech leaders supporting the new President and his policies. Google donated to the Trump campaign when he ran last year and just recently <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-reportedly-changing-course-on-its-diversity-initiatives-too-223644402.html" data-ylk="slk:halted efforts;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">halted efforts</a> to hire employees from diverse backgrounds.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p><strong>Kagi, the company behind a paid, private search engine</strong><sup data-fn="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05"><a id="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05-link" href="#85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05">1</a></sup><strong> of the same name, has announced it’s bringing its Webkit-based <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Orion</em> web browser</a> to Linux.</strong></p>



<p>In a post on BlueSky, Kagi said: <em>“We’re thrilled to announce that development of the Orion Browser for Linux has officially started!”</em>. </p>



<p><em>Orion</em> is currently only available on macOS and iOS but was built to be better than Apple’s own Safari, and best Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and other browsers in many areas.</p>



<p>Orion is a zero-telemetry browser; has built-in ad and tracking blocking; and reportedly offers lower memory usage, faster page speeds, and greater battery efficiency on Apple devices than other browsers. It also supports both Chrome and Firefox extensions.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="840" height="441" src="https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1-840x441.jpg" alt="Orion web browser" srcset="https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1-840x441.jpg 840w , https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1-300x158.jpg 300w , https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1-768x403.jpg 768w , https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w , https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kargi-Orion-on-macOS-1.jpg 1920w " sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a><figcaption>Orion Browser <span>on macOS</span> supports Chrome <em>and</em> Firefox Add-ons</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Whether all of those USPs can be carried over to Linux—a less defined ‘platform’ than macOS if targeting things like power efficiency—remains to be seen. Kagi is hopeful; they say the Orion Linux build will have feature-parity with the macOS version by next year.</p>







<p>Obviously, Orion’s (current) closed-source nature will not endear it to everyone. Plenty of Linux users simply can’t countenance using <em>Steam</em>, <em>Spotify</em>, <em>Vivaldi</em>, <em>Slack</em>, <em>Discord</em>, <em>Google Chrome</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> or other non-free apps, tools, or services.</p>



<p>—That’s fair; we’re free to choose the software that works for us on whatever level that matters, be it utility, integration, or indeed license model.</p>



<p>Yet, the idea of being able to run a fast, user-friendly, and flexible WebKit-based web browser on Linux is a promising development for choice, if nothing else. GNOME Web/Epiphany shows the promise WebKit offers – Orion may bring the polish.</p>



<p>Kagi has started work on open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/OrionBrowser">many components</a>&nbsp;used in Orion and plans to open source more — the small team is the bottleneck; forking WebKit, porting hundreds of APIs, and building a browser from scratch takes resources.</p>



<p><em>“Properly maintaining an open-source project takes time and resources we’re short on at the moment, so if you want to contribute at this time, please consider becoming active on&nbsp;orionfeedback.org,” they add. </em></p>



<p>If you’re interested in learning more about Orion (for macOS) check out the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/">Orion landing page</a> on the Kagi website, or read through a <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comprehensive FAQ</a>.  To sign-up for news on the upcoming Linux version, plug in an e-mail in the sign-up form.</p>



<p>The saying goes “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” —<em>unless open-source</em>, I tend to add if I hear someone say it! Alas, Mozilla’s recent faux-pas suggests that even noble projects aren’t immune to the shiny glint of <em>ick</em>.</p>



<p><em>Thanks Sambot!</em></p>

              <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with disgraced crypto CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which was distributed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sbf-suggests-dems-didnt-save-him-because-he-gave-money-to-republicans-too-2000572852">online Thursday,</a> appeared to be a transparent ploy to get media attention with the goal of ultimately scoring a pardon from President Donald Trump. But it sounds like SBF is now paying a price for the interview. The former billionaire has reportedly been tossed into solitary confinement because the interview wasn’t approved by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, according to a new report from the New York Times.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/technology/sam-bankman-fried-pardon-trump.html">the Times</a>, the Bureau of Prisons has strict rules about how interviews are conducted with inmates, and the federal agency confirmed to the newspaper that it did not give permission for the interview with Carlson to go forward. We don’t know when the interview actually took place, though clues suggest it was Wednesday, the day before it was published online to social media platforms like Rumble and X. SBF is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.</p> <p>It’s also not clear what kind of equipment was used to allow SBF and Carlson to communicate. It’s entirely possible SBF simply used a smuggled smartphone to talk with Carlson, and while that does seem like the most straightforward way to accomplish an interview like this, that’s purely speculative.&nbsp; SBF suggested in his chat with Carlson that he was really missing having high-tech devices at his disposal, though the topic only came up when the former Fox News host asked if the crypto executive was previously on stimulants before he entered prison. SBF blamed his erratic appearance in old interviews on being distracted by tech devices. Carlson took the opportunity to say that tech wasn’t healthy.</p> <p>The new report from the New York Times seems to confirm what anyone with a little bit of common sense assumed when Carlson’s interview dropped: SBF, who’s currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud after his crypto company FTX collapsed in 2022, is angling for a pardon from President Trump.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are two law professors at Stanford and are reportedly consulting with Kory Langhofer, an Arizona lawyer who previously worked on Trump’s presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020, according to the Times. Langhofer would presumably have deep connections in Trump World, but the newspaper reports they haven’t had direct contact with Trump. At least, not yet.</p>

 <p>But it seems like it could be an uphill climb for SBF and his family to get a pardon from Trump. The Times says the effort “does not appear to have gained traction,” and it’s easy to guess that SBF’s old associations with high-profile Democrats may be hurting his chances. However, SBF himself admitted once he was in jail that he was also secretly donating to Republicans before the implosion of FTX.</p> <p>SBF said in the Thursday episode of Carlson’s show that he doesn’t believe Democrats “saved” him while being prosecuted during the Joe Biden years because they knew he was giving to Republicans as well. Carlson kept acting throughout the interview as though it’s just normal and reasonable for wealthy people who donate to politicians to expect corrupt favors from those same people in their time of need. But SBF didn’t really take the bait, saying that it would have been “inappropriate” to ask for help.</p>

 <p>Trump recently <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-pardons-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-2000553405">pardoned Ross Ulbricht</a>, the Silk Road founder convicted in 2015 who was serving a 40-year sentence for money laundering, among a host of other charges related to the darknet site. Ulbricht’s pardon was actually a campaign promise made by Trump in the lead up to the election, largely seen as a favor to the crypto community, which considers Ulbricht a hero.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried never explicitly asked for a pardon from Trump during his interview either, and it seems pretty clear at this point that no matter how desperate he is to get out of prison, he’s going to let things happen behind the scenes rather than go begging. But who knows what might happen in the future. SBF turned 33 on Thursday and has only served a couple of years of a 25-year sentence.</p>

            <guid>43301432</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 16:39:23 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.viblo.se/posts/no-need-redis/">https://www.viblo.se/posts/no-need-redis/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43301432">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is arguably the most well regarded tech
  of all. My impression is that not even PostgreSQL has the same kind of
  positive aura around it. And of all tech available Redis is at the top of
  things you "need" to have in your tech stack. Maybe this will change with
  their latest
  <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">licencing change</a>, but that remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
  It's not difficult to see why, Redis is after all a very well architected and
  impressive piece of technology and this post is not arguing against any
  technical merits of Redis. What I will argue is that despite no technical flaw
  in Redis itself you still might not need it!
</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>
  In the last 3 places I worked (10+ years) I have seen the same pattern. A
  problem comes up, Redis is seen as a great fit and here we go.
</p>
<p>
  However, when looking closer at the actual use case it turns out that Redis
  didn't improve things, or did not fix the underlying problem. It just added
  complexity for complexity's sake.
</p>

<h2>First time, at Tantan</h2>
<p>
  First time Redis was proposed was at
  <a href="https://tantanapp.com/">Tantan</a>, the second largest dating app in
  China and a sort of Chinese Tinder. At the time we had 50-100 very powerful
  database servers running PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
  To not make this post too long I will simplify the architecture a bit: Each
  server stored a subset of the users 'swipes', sharded by the UserId so that a
  specific user only had data on one server. To add new swipes, the code would
  locate the server belonging to the user, and then run an insert SQL statement.
  If you are curious I have held a couple of talk of Tantan's DB architecture,
  see <a href="https://www.viblo.se/talks/">here</a> for a more in depth overview.
</p>
<p>
  The need arose to keep track of a little piece of additional data, namely the
  count of swipes. Basically a single integer value for each user, with two
  important properties: The value would be updated very often since 'swipe'
  where the most common action of a user, and the value would often be read, to
  always show the correct value.
</p>
<p>
  Our first thought (mine as well), where to put this data in Redis. A small
  amount of data, frequently updated and often requested felt like a perfect
  match for Redis. A single beefy Redis (many cores, lots of RAM type of
  machine) should be able to handle the load, so we would only need a couple
  (for redundancy). We bought (no cloud!) and installed the machines and started
  to configure Redis. While doing this a question rose in my mind - 'Why can't
  we just store this data on the shards in PostgreSQL, next to the swipes?'. The
  data itself would be microscopic in comparison and the additional load would
  also be microscopic in comparison to what these servers were already doing.
  After discussions in the team, they agreed! It would just add complexity to
  our relatively simple stack to add Redis!
</p>
<p>
  Guess what, after deployment the added load couldn't barely be seen on the db
  servers. Success!
</p>
<p>
  This is one of my favorite architecture moments. Something I think back to
  whenever someone proposes adding new tech, but the reasoning behind is not
  thought through all the way.
</p>

<h2>Second time, at Bannerflow</h2>
<p>
  After I left Tantan I joined a ad tech company called
  <a href="https://www.bannerflow.com/">Bannerflow</a>. There we built a "CMP",
  a web-platform for our enterprise users to create and publish ads online.
</p>
<p>
  At Bannerflow, one team were building a new set of microservices to configure
  and publish ads to social networks like Facebook. While there are certainly
  complexities in regard to how format the ads to fit the various social
  network's API contracts, get access etc., this was not a high load scenario
  like at Tantan.
</p>
<p>
  The team decided to add a Redis instance, for some cache of sorts. Note that
  this was for a system with a load not even 0.1% of Tantan's.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I will not be able to explain why Redis was (thought to be)
  needed in this post, because I don't know the reasoning either. After the
  initial developer left, no-one in the team could explain it to me when we
  discussed it! Looking at the code, or the number of calls or any other metric
  I could not see any reason, and we could agree that given a bit of spare time
  the best would be to remove it. (Now, running a managed Redis in Azure is not
  a lot of work, so I could not justify rearchitect it just for simplicity, but
  the long term plan was clear)
</p>
<p>
  I have to take this on me for not staying close enough to the team while they
  were designing and building the new feature, and despite skilled developers we
  had a (in this case) useless Redis sneaked in there. Lesson learned!
</p>

<h2>Third time, at MAJORITY</h2>
<p>
  And finally, as of 2024 I now work at the fintech company
  <a href="https://www.majority.com/">MAJORITY</a>. And surprise, surprise, they
  had just introduced Redis in the months before I joined!
</p>
<p>
  The first usage was to cache the result of an external API call to lookup
  geolocation of users, so that the service in question could process location
  requests quicker, and also run cheaper. What I think is interesting here is
  that it is very reasonable to want to cache this data, no objection here.
</p>
<p>
  What is less clear is what Redis added. By chance this specific service did
  two things for the lookup, one DB call (to a Azure SQL Database), and one
  Redis call. This made it very easy to compare and evaluate.
</p>
<p>
  The service in question had its own DB, sharing a DB cluster with other
  services. This specific DB had so low amount of load that it did not even show
  up when looking at the cluster load in Azure. Moving the Redis usage over to
  the DB would result in ~2x that load, which is a big
  <em>relative</em> increase, but in <em>absolute</em> numbers a very minor
  increased load on the DB when the original load was more or less 0!
</p>
<p>
  Of course, when a new tech is introduced into a tech stack, more and more
  parts will start using it. Same here. Soon the need arose to have locks shared
  between several instances of the same microservice. Since Redis was already in
  use, it was natural to use it for this as well.
</p>
<p>
  But, looking closer it was easy to see that these locks could just as well use
  the locking mechanism inside the main DB (Azure SQL). Some mentioned
  performance and to not put more load on the DB, but just as before it was not
  a high performance use case, actually not anywhere near even 1 lock per
  second.
</p>
<p>
  Just like in Bannerflow, the implementation were already done by the time I
  really understood it. And same as in Bannerflow, we decided to try and move
  away from Redis.
</p>

<h2>Ending</h2>
<p>
  Each of the three cases were unique, with different tech stacks, different
  domains and different load. But somehow they were still unified by the desire
  to use Redis!
</p>
<p>
  If you nod in agreement, or are at least open for more on the same topic,
  there's this quite well known talk by Dan McKinley I recommend to check out:
  <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">Choose Boring Technology</a> By pure
  coincidence it's also about Redis...

<p><img alt="ESP32" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/03/07/esp32.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains an undocumented backdoor that could be leveraged for attacks.</p>

<p>The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices, unauthorized data access, pivoting to other devices on the network, and potentially establishing long-term persistence.</p>

<p>This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security, who <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25554812-2025-rootedcon-bluetoothtools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">presented</a> their findings yesterday at <a href="https://reg.rootedcon.com/cfp/schedule/talk/5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">RootedCON</a> in Madrid.</p>

<p>The researchers warned that ESP32 is one of the world's most widely used chips for Wi-Fi + Bluetooth connectivity in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, so the risk of any backdoor in them is significant.</p>

<div>

<h2>Discovering a backdoor in ESP32</h2>

<p>In their RootedCON presentation, the Tarlogic researchers explained that interest in Bluetooth security research has waned but not because the protocol or its implementation has become more secure.</p>

<p>Instead, most attacks presented last year didn't have working tools, didn't work with generic hardware, and used outdated/unmaintained tools largely incompatible with modern systems.</p>

<p>Tarlogic developed a new C-based USB Bluetooth driver that is hardware-independent and cross-platform, allowing direct access to the hardware without relying on OS-specific APIs.</p>

<p>Armed with this new tool, which enables raw access to Bluetooth traffic, Targolic discovered hidden vendor-specific commands (Opcode 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware that allow low-level control over Bluetooth functions.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="ESP32 memory map" height="534" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/diagram.jpg" width="751"><figcaption><strong>ESP32 memory map</strong><br><em>Source: Tarlogic</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>In total, they found 29 undocumented commands, collectively characterized as a "backdoor," that could be used for memory manipulation (read/write RAM and Flash), MAC address spoofing (device impersonation), and LMP/LLCP packet injection.</p>

<p>Espressif has not publicly documented these commands, so either they weren't meant to be accessible, or they were left in by mistake.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="Script that issues HCI commands" height="408" width="821" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/demo.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/demo.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Script that issues HCI commands</strong><br><em>Source: Tarlogic</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The risks arising from these commands include&nbsp;malicious implementations on the OEM level and supply chain attacks.</p>

<p>Depending on how Bluetooth stacks handle HCI commands on the device, remote exploitation of the backdoor might be possible via malicious firmware or rogue Bluetooth connections.</p>

<p>This is especially the case if an attacker already has root access, planted malware, or pushed a malicious update on the device that opens up low-level access.</p>

<p>In general, though, physical access to the device's USB or UART interface would be far riskier and a more realistic attack scenario.</p>

<p>"In a context where you can compromise an IOT device with as ESP32 you will be able to hide an APT inside the ESP memory and perform Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi) attacks against other devices, while controlling the device over Wi-Fi/Bluetooth," explained the researchers to BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>"Our findings would allow to fully take control over the ESP32 chips and to gain persistence in the chip via commands that allow for RAM and Flash modification."</p>

<p>"Also, with persistence in the chip, it may be possible to spread to other devices because the ESP32 allows for the execution of advanced Bluetooth attacks."</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Espressif for a statement on the researchers' findings, but a comment wasn't immediately available.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>As Donald Knuth <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news.html">has just published</a> Volume 4, Fascicle 7 of <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> (TAOCP), on constraint satisfaction, I would like to provide more information about the errors I discovered in 2019 in other volumes, for which I received two <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">Knuth reward checks</a>. To date, my account balance on his “bank”, the Bank of San Serriffe, <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">is still 0x$2.40</a> (hexadecimal dollars). 0x$2.00 for two errors, and 0x$0.40 for two “valuable suggestions.”</p>
<p>His response to my errors reports was faster than I expected: I emailed him four times to report different errors from December 18, 2019, to January 1, 2020 (although Knuth does not typically use email, <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">there is an email address reserved for reporting TAOCP errors</a>, which his assistant prints). He updated the errata on January 1 and responded with a postal mail on January 9, 2020.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449823270/f986b0e9-3965-4064-b940-e5806c8011d5.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>The envelope contained my printed emails with his handwritten notes in pencil and two checks (dated December 24, 2019, and January 1, 2020).</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450804963/8e01e6e3-791c-4c2a-be48-d0627d634795.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>

<p>Some reward recipients have shared their letters online, here and there; however, I will paraphrase Knuth’s responses instead of reproducing them verbatim, as they are part of private correspondence (this can change in the future—per express authorization, for instance—; in that case, I will update this article to share a full scan of the letters). A notable exception is an excerpt of a letter containing generic information and a good anecdote: Knuth wished me a “<em>Joyeux Noël</em>” (French for “Happy Christmas”) because, probably without realizing it, I sent him an email on December 25.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449873242/48a85378-ad42-4f28-9766-ce34ffae92f3.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<hr>

<p>I was familiar with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">Algorithm X</a> before reviewing Volume 4 Pre-Fascicule 5c (published as Volume 4, Fascicule 5)—because <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover">exact cover problems</a> are fantastic! I did not expect to find fundamental errors, as Algorithm X has probably been one of the sections most thoroughly reviewed by its creator.</p>
<p>At that time, I kept track of Algorithm X’s states manually (I was on a flight without a computer). I maintained a record of the memory state with pen and paper, an experience that allowed me to focus on the essential details and discover small errors and imprecisions that led to minor corrections.</p>
<h2 id="heading-reported-errors">Reported Errors</h2>
<h3 id="heading-local-variables-not-declared">Local Variables Not Declared</h3>
<p>While the local variables of the first algorithmic step, <code>cover(i)</code>, are identified as such, the variables of the subsequent steps are not.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449975708/c6b68b0b-ed08-4be1-be8a-afd124182b52.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449985590/bcbb0bd1-4cc6-4bfb-be27-077b6a69c5b9.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Though this is not particularly problematic (this is trivially inferable from the context), Knuth recognized that it would have been beneficial to state this characteristic for each step explicitly. However, <strong>he decided against breaking up Algorithm X between different pages due to space constraints and, therefore, could not add clarifications for each step</strong>; he then appropriately quoted Voltaire: “<em>The secret of being a bore is to tell everything.</em>” Nevertheless, Knuth ultimately found an elegant solution (see below).</p>
<p><em>Reward: 32¢ (0x20¢)</em></p>
<h3 id="heading-unused-memory-fields">Unused Memory Fields</h3>
<p>When it was time to simulate the impact of the algorithm on the memory state, I was confused by this:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450032507/cc4b9308-f844-4892-9f6e-6c97923c89b7.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>My interpretation was that a program attempting to access one of these unused fields would fail, as I assimilated them as being in an uninitialized state. And indeed, my pen-and-paper program failed when reaching the hide step for the last spacer. Using the memory dump table as an example, covering one of the last nodes after some iterations leads to set <code>q</code> to 30 and, therefore, to <code>d ← DLINK(30)</code>. If an unused field means an uninitialized memory location, then the algorithm's execution should prematurely stop as, in this example, <code>DLINK(30) = —</code>. However, <strong>Knuth clarified that he did not explicitly state the variable was <em>uninitialized</em>; instead, it must be assumed to be initialized, but its value has no impact on the algorithm.</strong></p>
<p><em>Reward: 32¢ (0x20¢)</em></p>
<h3 id="heading-unused-variables">Unused Variables</h3>
<p>Finally, <code>N</code> and <code>Z</code> were set during the algorithm initialization step, but I did not need to utilize them when manually tracking the memory state.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450118831/c747ea0f-b896-422a-9adf-d38b8bb79a86.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>According to Knuth, they were, in fact, used in the exercises, notably exercise 83.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450128565/b1d90f0a-2a9a-49a4-aeb3-b07d1e0f8172.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>To ensure this was the case, he reviewed it and noticed an error: <code>N</code> should be <code>N₁</code>.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450237068/cc7b2f39-264a-417a-8adf-e23710e8ed1b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>He graciously rewarded me for helping him discover this error. (I transitively found this error, so to say.)</p>
<p><em>Reward: $2.56 (0x$1.00)</em></p>
<h2 id="heading-corrections">Corrections</h2>
<p>Corrections arising from my emails, all dated back to January 1, 2020, can be found in the <em>Errata for Volume 4 Fascicle 5, long-form</em> (available <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">here</a>). Specifically, they are listed on pages 5 and 13 of the downloadable compressed PostScript file.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450294503/f4408f9d-58fe-4061-958f-74b803127c9b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450300109/59a51bd1-fe77-477b-914c-8481f5283cc7.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>It appears that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knuth clarified what “unused” field means by implicitly stating that they are implicitly but necessarily initialized but "<em>can contain anything</em>".</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of listing all local variables, he refers to <code>p</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>r</code> as being part of a <em>non-exhaustive</em> list of local variables (“<em>Undeclared variables like p, l, r are local</em>”).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Last, in his answer 83, he replaced <code>N</code> with <code>N₁</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heading-small-aside-using-a-heartbeat-arrow-as-delimiter">Small Aside: Using a “HeartBeat-Arrow” as Delimiter</h3>
<p>Notice how Knuth uses a bespoke symbol (a “heartbeat-arrow”) to indicate the transition from the error to its correction:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450382338/8d04fd5a-8624-4bf4-80a7-73617f926bad.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>This is because he, as his corrections are inline/embedded (no table), he needed a symbol that is necessarily not already present in his books; otherwise, it could have been confused with a corrected symbol (typically, a simple right-pointing arrow, →, would have most probably been confused with a corrected material implication, and so forth). I believe this is an illustration of a <em>delimiter</em>, a special marker that cannot use the same symbols or structure as the regular text (<a target="_blank" href="https://glthr.com/first-order-second-order-expressions-and-delimiters-in-languages">in my previous blog post</a>, I develop this general idea).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="heading-erroneous-reference-to-an-obscure-article">Erroneous Reference to an Obscure Article</h2>
<h2 id="heading-reported-error">Reported Error</h2>
<p>When reading the section on Hamiltonian paths in antiquity from Volume 4, pre-fascicule 8a, I stumbled upon the reference to a French article about icosahedral objects inscribed with Greek letters: P. Perdrizet, in <em>Bulletin de l’Institut français du Caire</em> 30 (1930), 1-16. I did not find this article in the journal, but instead <a target="_blank" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53180372w">located it</a> in <em>Bulletin de l’Institut français d’archéologie orientale</em>.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the error, <strong>Knuth took the time to review some articles in this journal and strongly recommended a volume about Egyptian poetry:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf" target="_blank">ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf</a></strong>. Although he did not specify an article, I believe he referred to Vikentiev, V. (n.d.). The metrical scheme of the « Shipwrecked Sailor ». B<em>ulletin de l’Institut français d’archéologie orientale</em>, 35(1), 1–40. It is indeed remarkable for that time (see notably Planche 1, page 18 of the PDF).</p>
<p><em>Reward: $2.56 (0x$1.00)</em></p>

<p>There is no erratum, as it is a pre-fascicule that is directly edited.</p>

<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This event has left me with an immense sense of respect for Donald Knuth’s dedication to accuracy and attention to detail. It was an honor to contribute to the improvement of his work, even if it was just a small (to be honest: minuscule) part. I look forward to continuing my exploration of the latest published TAOCP volume, and discovering more errors to correct.</p>

<p>There are many things about this which are nice.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's just a single file - easy to backup and version control.</li>
<li>It's composable - I can easily write code to answer unexpected questions (eg how much did I spend on currency conversions this year) or use the computed data in other calculations (eg runway projections).</li>
<li>It's easy - I just pretty-printed the data-structures I was already using instead of having to build a UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the workflow isn't always great. When I run the code above, I see:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>&gt; clj accounts.clj
</span><span>[[</span><span>:untagged
</span><span>  [{</span><span>:date #inst "2022-05-10T10:33:04.011-00:00"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:amount -20.0</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:text </span><span>"e-Transfer to: John Smith"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:tag nil</span><span>}]]
</span><span> [</span><span>:total-per-tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>:eating-out -3.3</span><span>, </span><span>:things -72.79</span><span>, </span><span>:medical -90.0</span><span>, </span><span>nil -20.0</span><span>}]]
</span></code></pre>
<p>That transfer to John Smith isn't covered by any of the tagging rules. So I select the date, switch to the editor window and paste the date into the date-&gt;tag definition:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>(def </span><span>date-&gt;tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>#inst "2022-05-12T00:01:03.264-00:00" :things
</span><span>   </span><span>#inst "2022-05-10T10:33:04.011-00:00" :eating-out</span><span>})
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now I see:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>&gt; clj accounts.clj
</span><span>[[</span><span>:untagged </span><span>[]]
</span><span> [</span><span>:total-per-tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>:eating-out -23.3</span><span>, </span><span>:things -72.79</span><span>, </span><span>:medical -90.0</span><span>}]]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Multiply this by a thousand transactions and it becomes tedious.</p>
<p>Pretty-printing also makes it difficult to decide the amount of detail I should print. Sometimes I want to see which transactions contribute to each tag total. But if I always print them all then it's hard to see the totals themselves without a lot of scrolling.</p>
<p>It's also hard to share this workflow with someone non-technical. I have to setup and maintain the correct environment on their machine, teach them how to use a text editor to change the tagging rules, how to interpret syntax errors, how to use git to share changes etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could solve these kinds of problems by writing a web app and storing <code>txs</code>, <code>date-&gt;tag</code> and <code>text-&gt;tag</code> in a database.</p>
<p>Then I could put controls on the transaction itself that allow changing the tag in place. And I could add an expandable section next to each total, so that it's easy to see the transactions for that tag when I want to but they don't take up space by default.</p>
<p>Plus sharing becomes trivial - everyone has a web browser.</p>
<p>But this is a big leap in effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database introduces a different data model - I have to translate between database data-types and my programming languages native data-types.</li>
<li>A database introduces a different language, or at least a new api that differs from the way I access native data-structures.</li>
<li>Rather than using a familiar text editor to read and change data, I can only access it via some query language or api.</li>
<li>I have to shuffle data back and forth between database and program at the correct times.</li>
<li>It isn't easy to version control the contents of the database.</li>
<li>Before I can add interactive elements, I have to map my existing data-structures to gui elements (eg to html and css) instead of just printing them.</li>
<li>I have to add an extra layer of state management to manage the state of the gui itself.</li>
<li>All of this work has to be repeated whenever I have a new question I want to answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is insurmountable, but it's definitely much more work than the original script.</p>
<p>So a simple script is low-effort but produces a low-quality experience. And a custom app can produce a high-quality experience but is high-effort.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I made a thing.</p>
<p>It is very hacky and easy to break. But it will hang together just long enough to convey the idea.</p>
<p>It's kind of like a notebook. There are cells where you can write code and the resulting values will be nicely rendered:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>;; converted from statement.csv
</span><span>(def txs
</span><span>  [{:date #inst "2022-05-13T11:01:56.532-00:00"

</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defs date-&gt;tag
</span><span>  {#inst "2022-05-12T00:01:03.264-00:00" :things})
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defs keyword-&gt;tag
</span><span>  {"Coffee" :eating-out
</span><span>   "Range Physio" :medical})
</span></code></pre>
<p>Funtions render a little differently.</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defn text-&gt;tag [text]
</span><span>  (first
</span><span>    (for [[keyword tag] keyword-&gt;tag
</span><span>          :when (clojure.string/includes? text keyword)]
</span><span>      tag)))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you type <code>"Joe's Coffee Hut"</code> (including the <code>"</code>!) into the textbox above and hit the <code>text-&gt;tag</code> button, you'll see the result of running the <code>text-&gt;tag</code> function on that input.</p>
<p>Functions aren't limited to just returning values though. They can modify the values stored in other cells:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def txs-with-tags
</span><span>  (vec 
</span><span>    (for [tx txs]
</span><span>      (assoc tx 
</span><span>        :tag (or
</span><span>               (date-&gt;tag (:date tx))
</span><span>               (text-&gt;tag (:text tx)))
</span><span>        :actions [(fn ignore []
</span><span>                    (edit! 'date-&gt;tag assoc (:date tx) :ignore))
</span><span>                  (fn tag [tag] 
</span><span>                    (edit! 'date-&gt;tag assoc (:date tx) tag))]))))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you type <code>:eating-out</code> into the one of the textboxes above and then hit the <code>tag</code> button, it will change the <code>date-&gt;tag</code> cell to contain an entry for the date of that transaction with the tag <code>:eating-out</code>.</p>
<p>And then any downstream cells will update, so you'll see the tag for that transaction change to <code>:eating-out</code>.</p>
<p>These actions are just values so they can be passed around like any other value. For example, if I make a list of untagged transactions then I'll still have access to the same actions:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def untagged
</span><span>  (vec
</span><span>    (for [tx txs-with-tags
</span><span>         :when (nil? (:tag tx))]
</span><span>      tx)))
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can also attach metadata to values to control how they render:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def hidden-vec
</span><span>  (with-meta
</span><span>    [1 2 3]
</span><span>    {:preimp/hidden true}))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you click on the <code>+</code> above it will reveal the contents of the vec. This is useful for controlling the default level of detail.</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defn hidden [v]
</span><span>  (with-meta v {:preimp/hidden true}))
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def total-per-tag
</span><span>  (reduce 
</span><span>    (fn [totals tx]
</span><span>      (if (= :ignore (:tag tx))
</span><span>        totals
</span><span>        (update-in totals [(:tag tx)] 
</span><span>          (fn [total+txs]
</span><span>            (let [[total txs] (or total+txs [0 (hidden [])])]
</span><span>              [(+ total (:amount tx))
</span><span>               (conj txs (update-in tx [:actions] hidden))])))))
</span><span>    {}
</span><span>    txs-with-tags))
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can click on a <code>+</code> above to reveal the transactions for that tag.</p>
<hr>
<p>The demo on this page is ephemeral - you could do something similar in many notebook environments using mutable data-structures.</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://github.com/jamii/preimp">preimp repo</a> contains a server which persists the entire history of the notebook to disk, and also syncs changes between different clients to allow (coarse-grained) collaborative editing.</p>

<p>This tiny extension to the notebook model allows writing simple ugly crud apps with very little effort. You simply provide the logic and preimp gives you storage, sharing and UI for free. But the result is not an opaque image, nor is it tied to the preimp environment - you can export everything into a regular script and run it in the repl.</p>
<p>TODO rest of this section</p>
<p>required:
rich data model, which can be roundtripped through text
some way of attaching metadata to values, to control their rendering without interfering with execution in the repl</p>
<p>needed:
no declaration order
no mutable environment
no side-effects (other than edit!)
integrity constraints
perf (compiler latency) (thoughput only needs to be better than spreadsheet)</p>
<p>extensions:
much more ui options
selection (+ actions on the side)
dropdowns
understand types / destructuring
render values as copyable text (cf ?)
undo/vc (have whole history in db)
live repl, sandboxing
distribution - single binary, single-file db, optional server (like fossil)</p>
<p>research:
finer-grained collaboration (what data model?)
bidirectional editing / provenance</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/">https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43299886">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The US Department of Justice wants <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/google">Google</a> to sell off its <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/chrome">Chrome browser</a> as part of its final remedy proposal in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-search-antitrust-monopoly-ruling/">landmark antitrust case</a>.</p><p>The proposal, filed Friday afternoon, says that Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.” It also would require Google to stop paying partners for preferential treatment of its search engine.</p><p>The DOJ also demands that Google provide prior notification of any new joint venture, collaboration, or partnership with any company that competes with Google in search or in search text ads. However, the company no longer has to divest its artificial intelligence investments, which was part of an initial set of recommendations issued by the plaintiffs last November. The company would still be required to give prior notification of future AI investments.</p><p>“Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.”</p><p>The DOJ formally brought its case against Google back in 2020, the most significant tech antitrust case since the DOJ’s years-long battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google has used anticompetitive tactics to protect its search dominance and forge contracts that ensure it’s the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones. Because of its hold on search, the lawsuit claimed, Google can adjust the auction system through which it sells ads and increase prices for advertisers, and rake in more revenue from that.</p><p>Google has argued that its overwhelming success in search—it has a nearly 90 percent share in the US market—stems from the company offering the best search technology. It also says consumers are easily able to change their default search engine, and that Google does face competition from Microsoft and others.</p><p>“DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security,” said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels in an emailed statement.</p><p>The case <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-googles-search-engine-smart-or-sneaky-a-trial-court-judge-will-decide/">went to trial in 2023</a>, and in August 2024 the US district judge for the District of Columbia, Amit Mehta, ruled that Google <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-search-antitrust-monopoly-ruling/">has maintained an illegal monopoly</a>, both in general search and general search text ads.</p><p>Much of the ruling centered on the contracts Google has with device makers and browser partners, which use Google as their default search technology. According to Mehta’s ruling, around 70 percent of search queries in the US happen through portals in which Google is the default search engine. Google then shares revenues with those partners, paying out billions of dollars to them, which disincentivizes smaller search rivals who can’t compete with those contracts, Mehta said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This past November, government attorneys <a data-offer-url="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.1_1.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.1_1.pdf&quot;}" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.1_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">submitted a detailed plan</a> to Mehta that included a spate of recommendations for how to best loosen Google’s stronghold on the US search market. These recommendations included that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doj-google-chrome-antitrust/">Google promptly divest Chrome</a>, its popular web browser; possibly divest Android; end its search partnership with Apple, in which Apple receives billions of dollars each year for its Safari browser to default to Google search; and give competitors access to Google’s data, for both search and ads, “that would otherwise provide Google an ongoing advantage from its exclusionary conduct.”</p><p>Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and its chief legal officer, called the November proposal a “<a data-offer-url="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/&quot;}" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">radical interventionist agenda</a>” that would “endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans” and stifle innovation. Walker said it would also “chill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role.” Google has increasingly featured AI-powered results at the top of its search pages, despite sometimes uneven results.</p><p>In a <a data-offer-url="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/&quot;}" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">counter-proposal filed by Google</a> in December, the company said it would structure its contracts to allow for multiple default search agreements across different devices, so that Apple’s iPhones and iPads might have different default search engines; change the length of its search revenue deals with hardware manufacturers to one year rather than locking them into long-term agreements; and allow more flexibility around search and Chrome for Android phone makers. It emphasized that its revenue partners, like Apple and Mozilla, “have the freedom to do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users.”</p><p>Essentially, Google has suggested that the company is willing to reevaluate its contracts with partners, but has argued—citing earlier antitrust cases as precedent—that it shouldn’t have to divest parts of its business, share its secret sauce with competitors, or restrict its investments in search and AI, all of which, it argues, would dampen innovation.</p><p>Today’s official remedy is notable in that it reinforces calls for a breakup of part of Google’s core business. For Google, it’s an opening salvo to what will likely be a years-long appeal process. Google has already said it plans to appeal whatever remedy is issued; arguments for the two proposals are scheduled for April in Mehta’s court.</p><p>The remedy will also mark the first major outcome of a US antitrust case under the new Trump administration. Paul Swanson, a litigation partner at Holland &amp; Hart LLP in Denver, Colorado, who focuses on technology and antitrust, says the government’s remedies may be part of a “maximalist opening position that they can then negotiate from.”</p><p>“The one through-line here is that this administration wants to be perceived as being tough on tech, but also not slow the growth of America’s tech industries,” Swanson says. “So they may signal more action than what they ultimately want.”</p><p><em>Update 3/7/25 and 6:44pm ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Google.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>The </span><a href="https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/contraptions-book-club" rel="">Contraptions Book club</a><span> March pick is </span><strong>Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition by Frances Yates</strong><span>. </span><a href="https://open.substack.com/chat/posts/09f4609d-7910-455b-b6b8-fb55a7bb80ee" rel="">Chat thread</a><span> here. We will discuss this the week of March 24th.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I’ll be co-hosting an online salon </span><strong><a href="https://lu.ma/5qh4qac2" rel="">Silicon Archipelago: A Salon On Open Distributed Southeast Asian Tech Futures</a><span> </span></strong><span>on Friday, March 14 (Southeast Asia time). This is a prequel for an in-person workshop on the same themes in Bangkok in late April (</span><a href="https://www.cmkl.ac.th/event/khlongs-and-subaks-open-distributed-ai-x-blockchain-protocols-in-southeast-asia" rel="">apply here</a><span> if interested — free but limited capacity, with some regional travel support available). I would appreciate any forwards to interesting techies, tech policy people, and tech culture people from the region.</span></em></p><p><em>The Lord of the Rings </em><span>is a great story, but I have to say, I’ve never understood the strange hold it seems to have on the imagination of a particular breed of technologists. </span></p><p><span>As a </span><em>story</em><span> it’s great. It is pure fantasy of course (in the </span><a href="https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/strange-new-rules" rel="">Chiang’s Law</a><span> sense of being about special people rather than strange rules), full of Chosen Ones doing Great Man (or Great Hobbit) things. As an extended allegory for society and technology it absolutely sucks and is also ludicrously wrong-headed. Humorless Chosen people presiding grimly over a world in terminal decline, fighting Dark Lords, playing out decline-and-fall scripts to which there is no alternative, no Plan B. </span></p><p>This is no way for a high-agency technological species to live, and thankfully it doesn’t have to be.</p><p><span>I mean, I get why politicians and economists might identify with the story. They enjoy little to no direct technological agency, harbor ridiculous Chosen One conceits, and operate in domains — political narratives and the dismal pseudoscience of economics —  that are natural intellectual monopolies or oligopolies. Domains that allow fantasies to be memed into existence (the technical term is </span><a href="https://www.full-stop.net/2020/10/21/features/essays/macon-holt/hyperstitional-theory-fiction/" rel="">hyperstitional theory-fictions</a><span>) for a while before they come crashing down to earth in flames, demonstrating yet again that no, you do not in fact get to create your own reality; that “reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, does not go away.”</span></p><p><span>There is a contrarian reading of </span><em>The Lord of the Rings </em><span>that argues that Sauron and Mordor are in fact the good guys, and represent technological progress, etc. But this is throwing good </span><s>money</s><span> narrativium after bad. Flipping the valence of a Chosen One story doesn’t make it any better. It’s still a Chosen One story with reversed roles. </span></p><p>No, you have to tell different sorts of stories altogether.</p><p><span>Such stories have, in fact, been told. They are Terry Pratchett’s </span><em>Discworld </em><span>stories. This post is an extended argument that as a lens for thinking about the world, </span><em>The</em><span> </span><em>Lord of the Rings, </em><span>is a work that you should “not set aside lightly, but throw across the room with great force,” and that in place of Middle Earth, you should install Terry Pratchett’s Discworld.</span></p><p><span>I won’t get into whether Discworld is better or worse as a fictional universe than Middle Earth. That is a matter of taste and which elements of craft you admire. But </span><em>as an allegory for technology and society, </em><span>Discworld is so radically, vastly superior, and LOTR is so terminally bad, it is not even a contest.</span></p><p><span>If you’re an actual, serious technologist, </span><em>Discworld </em><span>is where you should look for clues about how the world works, how it evolves in response to technological forces, and how humans should engage with those forces. It is catnip for actual technological curiosity, as opposed to validation of incuriously instrumental approaches to technology. If on the other hand, you’re really just a fantasist larping Chosen One stories bolstered by specious Straussian conceits, trying to meme your hyperstitional theory fictions into existence for a while, looting the commons with private-equity extraction engines until you get your Girardian comeuppance — by all means go for it. Though Margaret Thatcher and Neoliberalism are both dead, There Is No Alternative (TINA) — for </span><em>you. </em></p><p>The rest of humanity, thankfully, has more imaginative and generative models of reality to draw on. </p><p><span>Now, for those of you who haven’t read the </span><em>Discworld</em><span> series, it is basically the anti-</span><em>LOTR. </em><span>For starters, even though it is set in a pseudo-historical time rather than the future, and features all the common tropes of  fantasy, all that is in purely ironic mode.  </span><em>Discworld </em><span>is in fact the hardest of hard science fiction universes you can find. Entirely about strange rules rather than special people. </span></p><p>You just have to learn to look past the wizards, dragons, elves, and such. There is even a “Science of Discworld” meta-series to help with that.</p><p>The irony is not subtle. It’s in-your-face. For instance, the core world-building premise is that of a literal “flat earth” disc-shaped planet, resting on the back of four elephants that stand on the back of a giant turtle swimming through space. But this parody of the cosmologies of antiquity is put through its paces with deadpan faux-scientific earnestness. There’s an entire novel about how there was once a fifth elephant, whose fossilized remains are the basis of the fossil fuel industry of Discworld.</p><p>And it only gets sillier from there.</p><p><span>And the sillier it gets, the </span><em>better </em><span>it seems to model our own world (known as </span><em>Roundworld </em><span>in the Discworld cosmogony, a place Discworlders can and do travel to, generally causing mayhem). The wilder a Discworld plot, the more you learn about how technology, society, and progress in Roundworld actually work. </span></p><p>I have a rule-of-thumb: The more seriously you take Discworld, the smarter you get about Roundworld.</p><p>The silliness is a feature, not a bug. Our universe is a vast, crazy place, and we haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of the endless weirdness it harbors. As Douglas Adams noted, “If life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.” </p><p>Discworld is about curing yourself of the allure of a “sense of proportion.” There is no surer of way of becoming detached from reality and addicted to some notion of manufactured normalcy.</p><p><span>It is notable that one of the favorite rhetorical tricks of self-styled Special People is to point to something in incredulity and pretend to be aghast at how weird it is; how against “common sense” and “reasonable” and “first principles” understandings of the world. Those words and phrases are always suspicious, and </span><em>extra</em><span> suspicious — suspicious-squared as Pratchett might have said — when used by Chosen One types.</span></p><p><span>The </span><em>Lord of the Rings </em><span>on the other hand — the more seriously you take Middle Earth, the dumber you get about Roundworld. </span></p><p>Revealingly, Roundworld isn’t even modeled in the Middle Earth cosmology, except via vaguely racist and lazy allusions (In Middle Earth, I’m presumably one of those turbaned men-from-the-east riding an Oliphaunt and uncritically allied with Sauron). </p><p>If you double down on the LOTR brainrot, and add things like Ayn Rand and Rene Girard to the soup, you get a profoundly stupid vision of the world that it takes real genius to buy into. Which is what, as it happens, a lot of real geniuses (and I don’t mean this snarkily — Peter Thiel is a legit genius who happens to have bought into a really stupid vision of the world) have in fact done as of 2025, as they try to meme a revanchist Great Power world back into existence.</p><p>I’ve thought about this a lot in the last few months, and I’ve concluded the whole program is in fact exactly as stupid as it sounds, and will fail in profoundly stupid ways, doing a lot of irreversible damage (Brexit was a small scale model of what’s in store for us here in the US). </p><p>But to some extent I’ve made my peace with what’s coming, and have no desire to convince you that this is where things are headed. If you’ve bought into that, have fun being miserable in Middle Earth.</p><p>Instead, I want to sketch out for you how you can truly learn to think in pluralist there-are-many-alternatives ways.</p><p>The place to start is with the rules of Discworld.</p><p><span>If you haven’t read any Discworld novels, here is a map with a suggested reading order. I got it </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_(world)" rel="">from Wikipedia</a><span>, and literally checked off the books as I read them all a few years ago (except the Tiffany Aching ones). I recommend you do that too.</span></p><p><span>I read one Pratchett novel (</span><em>Thief of Time </em><span>I think) in college, but I’m glad I didn’t properly get into it till my mid-forties. These are books you cannot really appreciate if you’re too young. I read through the lot around 2017-19, during the first Trump admin, when I was in my early forties.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg" width="1456" height="1532" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1532,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:814386,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/i/158124604?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1078306-3ff2-456d-bc55-b1ef164ebc73_1698x1787.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Pratchett believed you should start with </span><em>Sourcery, </em><span>and he is right, not just because it is early in the in-world chronology of one of the main sequences, but because it forcefully establishes what is  perhaps the central dogma of Discworld:</span></p><p><em><strong>People who think they are Special and Chosen are dangerous and bad for the world.</strong></em></p><p><span>The story revolves around Discworld’s satirical version of the Chosen One plot arc. Here is the premise according to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcery" rel="">Wikipedia entry</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>On the Discworld, "sourcerers"—wizards who are sources of magic, and thus immensely more powerful than normal wizards—were the main cause of the Great Mage Wars that left areas of the Disc uninhabitable. As eight is a powerful magical number on Discworld, men born as the eighth son of an eighth son are commonly wizards. Since sourcerers are born the eighth son of an eighth son </span><em>of an eighth son</em><span>, they are "wizards squared". To prevent the creation of sourcerers, therefore, wizards are not allowed to marry or have children.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>These “sourcerers” are one species of annoying Chosen Ones in Discworld. In the novel, the prevention mechanisms fail, and a sourcerer is born, and wreaks havoc for a while trying to do dumb Chosen One things until one of the main protagonists of the world, Rincewind, a hapless, mediocre wizard, manages to contain him. With a lot of help of course — the mediocre protagonists of Discworld rarely act alone and never in hero-mode. Most Discworld stories are, to a first approximation, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrier-Theory-Fiction-Terra-Ignota/dp/1999675991" rel="">carrier-bag</a><span> stories.</span></p><p>Discworld is essentially a kind place though, so the antagonists are usually just contained and neutralized, and sometimes even redeemed. They’re not vengefully made an example of by protagonists. That’s a Chosen One move. Discworlders are kinder, even if it costs them. That’s a point we’ll say more about.</p><p>The Rincewind stories are one of four major sequences in the Discworld universe. These are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unseen University</strong><span>: Revolving around events at Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork, the setting for most stories, where Rincewind is a professor of geography. It is a den of complacent, mediocre, academic wizards who mostly don’t do anything. They rarely actually use magic for anything practical, not because of any lofty ideas of great power requiring great responsibility, but because they are lazy and magic is messy and causes more problems than it solves.  The other residents of Ankh-Morpork agree, and rarely call on them to do anything.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The City Watch novels</strong><span>, featuring a stubbornly everyman chief of police, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Vimes" rel="">Sam Vimes</a><span> (based on the historic Robert Peel who founded London’s police force) who in the universe stands for regicidal skepticisms of power and a plodding, quiet integrity that cannot be bought off or stopped. His ancestor killed the last despotic king of Ankh-Morpork, the city-state in which much of the action unfolds. One of Vimes’ lieutenants, the nice but ordinary Carrot, is in fact the True King, but harbors no ambitions of ascending to a throne in a restored monarchy.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Witches novels</strong><span>, featuring a milieu of witches in the countryside, with Granny Weatherwax as the no-nonsense elder. Like the wizards of Unseen University, they too don’t really make much actual use of magic, preferring to solve problems through wisdom and skeptical common sense, frequently battling Chosen One ambitions in their own ranks. The hold the wizards of Unseen University in affectionate contempt, as wild theorists doing weird experiments.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Death novels</strong><span>, featuring the regular scythe-wielding figure of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(Discworld)" rel="">Death</a><span>, who is really the steward of life itself on Discworld. He works tirelessly to keep life generative, messy, rich, and varied with his curatorial efforts. His primary antagonist is a bureaucracy, the Auditors of Reality, who hate life because it is messy, and would rather have a lifeless universe following predictable and well-behaved laws. </span></p></li></ul><p><span>The Auditors of Reality are particularly interesting. They are the Discworld edition of what I’ve called the Great Bureaucrat archetype elsewhere. Their ideology is something like the Wokism of Discworld, a deadening, stifling, faceless force of intersectional lifelessness. But as Discworld historigraphy correctly theorizes, the antidote to the dangers of Auditors of Reality is not individual Chosen Ones like sourcerers, over-ambitious witches, or kings claiming divine rights, but </span><em>Death </em><span>itself, understood  as a personification of the process of renewal, regeneration, and stewardship of the organic messiness of life.</span></p><p>I like this as acerbic commentary on the longevity fetish and Eternalism of the Tech Right. </p><p>I have no issues with individuals simply making an extreme sport of literally trying to live as long as possible. Bryan Johnson is a friend and occasional client of mine, and Vitalik Buterin, whom I have interactions with through my protocols work, is also a longevity maven. At more regular-people level, friends of this newsletter like Sarah Constantin are into longevity. </p><p><span>I don’t object to any of this, though personally I want no part of it. I think </span><em>thar be ossified Asimovian spacer worlds</em><span>. But if people want that kind of life and arrange their own affairs to try and get there, I have no quarrel with them.</span></p><p><span>What I have a problem with is people trying to live forever </span><em>as part of a Chosen One script </em><span>which involves them trying to carve up all of the world into the dead empires of a dystopian Great Game world run according to a totalizing script.</span></p><p>I prefer a world run by ordinary mortals who have embraced both their ordinariness and mortality.</p><p>While most core Discworld characters are either mediocre anti-heroes or parodied Chosen One antagonists, there is a big supporting cast of colorful characters who are neither, but not NPCs either. </p><p><span>The most important of these is the wise</span><em> (</em><span>but ordinary and mortal) despot who rules the city of Ankh-Morpork, Vetinari (an allusion to the Medicis). Vetinari’s style of governance is a cross between Daoist and LBJ in </span><em>Master of the Senate</em><span> mode. </span></p><p><span>He operates with an acute and finely tuned sense of the nature of power and how to wield it in the subtlest ways possible. As much as possible, he limits himself to the tiniest possible nudges, conducting the balance-of-power constituent forces of Ankh-Morpork like an orchestra, almost always working through others. His main job is keeping all the guilds of Ankh-Morpork, and its relations with foreign powers, in a stable balance of power (he himself is an alumnus of the Assassin’s Guild). He does this with pragmatism and compromise, nudging the arc of the moral universe to slouch towards utopia, but not at a pace it cannot handle. He is nearly always on the right side of history and social evolution, though sometimes he has to be convinced by more idealistic characters that the time is ripe for a particular change </span><em>now</em><span>, rather than later. He is no broad-based accelerationist, but he surreptitiously, selectively, and surgically helps accelerate currents of positive change that he must publicly appear to oppose.</span></p><p><span>The guilds are the load-bearing elements of Ankh-Morpork’s society. Not NPCs, but usually running as background processes, with Vetinari as system administrator, albeit one who is </span><em>very </em><span>wary of sudo-ing anything.</span></p><p><span>Vetinari is something like an anti-Chosen One. In the most Chosen One story, </span><em>Sourcery</em><span>, the sourcerer turns him into a lizard and puts him in a cage, and he remains out of the picture for the whole novel. That’s one reason things get so out of hand in that story: The main adult in the room is locked away from the action while the Chosen One tries to bull-doge a new reality into being. But in most stories, he adds a decisive nudge or two that allows the world to smoothly and elegantly switch tracks to better futures. </span></p><p><span>Within the rules of Discworld, you could say Vetinari only acts to the extent the system is underdetermined. While he is sovereign in the Schmittian sense — the one with the power to make exceptions — he only has this power to the extent he uses it to nudge the system towards doing what it most </span><em>wants</em><span> to do anyway. He counteracts destabilizing noise in the signal but does not impose his opinions on what Discworld wants to do.</span></p><p><span>Before I get to that, a word on what Discworld does </span><em>not </em><span>want.</span></p><p><span>The main thing Discworld does </span><em>not </em><span>want is to </span><em>be at the mercy of the gods </em><span>(and Chosen Ones with god-delusions)</span><em>.</em></p><p><span>There </span><em>are</em><span> gods on Discworld, but fortunately they are for the most part living in peaceful retirement in Dunmanifestin (“done manifesting”), making it a  </span><em>de facto </em><span>atheist universe. </span></p><p><span>Unlike most of the supporting cast of Discworld, the gods </span><em>are </em><span>NPCs. They don’t do anything, and don’t want to. Ontologically, they are creatures of pure belief, being stronger or weaker, or altogether non-existent, depending on the extent to which mortals believe in them. The only story revolving consequentially around gods is </span><em>Small Gods, </em><span>about a meme-stock god named GameStop, whose power crashes, and who ambitiously plans to pump himself back up to a new high. A parody Chosen One story crossed with Greek mythology tropes.</span></p><p><span>So the story of Discworld is explicitly </span><em>not </em><span>the story of what the gods have planned for it. They got it going and retired, leaving it to its own potentialities. Discworld is </span><em>free </em><span>in a theological sense. There is no Discworld eschatology.</span></p><p><span>Discworld is also not a story scripted by priestly intercessors. There </span><em>is </em><span>a class of time monks (who come across as vaguely Daoist/Buddhist and keep the machinery of time itself going). They are allies of Death, stewards of the messiness of life like him, helping keep the Auditors of Reality at bay. Their job is to keep</span><em> </em><span>history free and evolving through a timescape of many alternatives (not “free” in some narrative-captured sense).</span></p><p>There is also an array of occasional antagonists who periodically show up with grand Thielean “determinate optimism” type plans, convinced they know better than average shmucks, and threatening the freedom of Discworld for its own good. </p><p><span>These include monsters and dragons from the dungeon dimensions, and </span><em>elves</em><span>. </span></p><p>These last named are perhaps the closest thing Discworld has to unredeemed and unredeemable villains. </p><p><span>In Discworld, elves are evil in an insidious, feckless sort of way, being an invasive parasitic species with no imagination but a lot of superficial charm. Here is the essence of their nature, from the </span><a href="https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Elves" rel="">Discworld wiki</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>[Elves] are not native to the Disc, but come from a "parasite universe", sometimes called Fairyland. This pocket dimension can latch onto different universes at certain times… </p><p>…Elves have no proper imagination or real emotions, and therefore such things fascinate them. Because they cannot create they steal musicians and artists. Because they cannot have children (although they are capable of breeding with humans, resulting in offspring with superficially elvish characteristics - skinny, pointy ears, a tendency to giggle and burn easily in the sun - but fundamentally human traits i.e. empathy) they steal children from the Disc to be their toys. Because they cannot feel empathy they enjoy the suffering of others. Even if an elf is, for reasons of its own, trying to be nice, its lack of understanding of humans mean there's always something "off" about it.</p><p>Mostly they get away with this, due to the illusion-creating glamour they cast. While elves are, as mentioned above, not musical, elfsong is perceived as beautiful by humans, and is highly hypnotic. Elves are generally seen as innately beautiful and stylish, but this is just another aspect of the glamour. Some of them are only vaguely humanoid.</p></blockquote><p>At one point, the elves migrate to Roundworld and cause havoc there, by killing the narrative vigor of history with their empty and superficial illusions, until Discworlders save the day. I like to pretend this actually happened.</p><p><span>The elves are among the most sophisticated bits of world-building by Pratchett, because they are the personification of </span><em>anti-narrative </em><span>forces in the cosmology. They commonly pose a threat by obscuring the rich potentialities of reality with illusory, degenerative bullshit.</span></p><p><span>The ontological antithesis of the elves is </span><em>narrativium</em><span>, the most common element on Discworld. It is a kind of meta-fictional conceit on Pratchett’s part, allowing his universe to be metamodern without being tedious about it. </span></p><p>Everything satirized and parodied in Discworld, all the ironically deployed tropes of fantasy, are accounted for as the workings of narrativium. That means in-world, all the effects of narrativium are made fun of, but not treated as existential threats. Within the meta-story of Discworld, narrativium adds some of the coherence and discipline that the Auditors of Reality yearn for, but not in a deadening, joyless way. Narrativium is life-affirming narrative irony embodied and embraced.</p><p><span>Narrativium allows Discworld to escape the tyranny of hegemonic TINA stories that insist on destroying all alternative stories. It allows Discworld to have a history, but not be </span><em>bound </em><span>by history. It allows Discworld to constantly entertain and choose among </span><em>many </em><span>futures, as an entire entangled reality. It allows Discworld to forcefully reject (and sometimes eject from reality) the efforts of Chosen Ones to capture reality.</span></p><p><span>Narrativium is </span><em>also </em><span>what allows Discworld to escape the tyranny of the idea that there are, or should be, </span><em>no </em><span>stories (or what is the same thing, the idea that all stories are equally valid and good). This is the fatal flaw in the worldview of the Auditors of Reality who, like their Roundworld counterparts, want to arrive at an always-already bureaucratic perfection and forget anything imperfect ever happened, erasing not just history, but time itself. Death and the Time Monks might do the work necessary to keep them at bay, but Narrativium is what makes Discworld unauditable in the first place.</span></p><p><span>Narrativium is the </span><em>elan vital </em><span>that allows Discworld to pursue what it </span><em>wants </em><span>as opposed to merely avoiding what it does </span><em>not </em><span>want. </span></p><p>The essential property of Narrativium is that it ensures that the history of Discworld will unfold in satisfying ways that make it a good story. This property is most on display in the fifth major sequence of novels in the map: the Industrial Revolution sequence, which feature one of the most interesting characters, Moist Von Lipwig, who is Vetinari’s fixer, nudging technological progress along.</p><p><span>Through these books, Discworld in general, and Ankh-Morpork in particular, repeatedly breaks free of its own past with the help of technological innovations. There is an industrial revolution driven by steam, a postal system emerges, a film industry is born. A great deal more of this sort of thing happens. Discworld evolves a </span><em>lot </em><span>between the earliest and latest books by in-world chronology. That’s what makes the stories a “literature of change” in Ted Chiang terms. These are not stories of heroes restoring changeless sacred realities after profane excursions.</span></p><p>The details of these developments usually feature absurd (and absurdly entertaining) twists on the corresponding Roundworld historical events, while largely staying true to the logic of Roundworld history. For example, film technology on Discworld relies on some faux-science built around small goblins who sit in the cameras painting really fast (magical, but in an inconsequential way).</p><p>And it’s all very satisfying, in ways the corresponding histories on Roundworld are not. The story also feels a lot more forcefully inevitable and necessary, but not in a restrictive or totalizing way. It is intensified rather than revisionist Roundworld history. </p><p>That’s what makes narrativium good to have around.</p><p>This process is one of generative discovery and continuously improvised contingency. The rule that governs this evolutionary process on Discworld, in Pratchett’s own words, is “Our minds make stories, and stories make our minds.”</p><p>This is the Pratchett version of “hyperstitional theory fiction” which applies with much greater force in Discworld, such that far more consequential things can be memed into existence. </p><p>In the most extreme case, as we’ve seen, the gods of Discworld themselves are memed into existence by belief, like over-powered versions of the subjects of Roundworld cults of personality. Roundworld religions, thankfully, don’t have this kind of power to create Roundworld gods of equal substance, since unlike the retiring and lazy Discworld gods, we tend to imagine very interventionist and opinionated gods for ourselves.</p><p><span>In the case of more real things that exist by themselves, rather than as incarnated memes, narrativium undergirds a sort of theory of relativity. I actually independently rediscovered Pratchett’s theory of narrativium in 2019, just before encountering his version, by transposing J. A. Wheeler’s description of General Relativity to narratives. I wrote up my theory </span><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/25/worlding-raga-5-world-how/" rel="">as part of an extended series</a><span> on Worlding co-authored with Ian Cheng (that’s Ian’s term for world-building):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A bit of fun synchronicity. A few weeks ago, I came up with a snowcloned line inspired by a famous tldr of general relativity: </span><em>narratives tell archetypes how to evolve, archetypes tell narratives how to curve.</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/25/worlding-raga-5-world-how/#1" rel=""><sup>1</sup></a><span> Right after, I found a Terry Pratchett quote that says almost the same thing, but less ponderously: “Our minds make stories, and stories make our minds.” I prefer my version though, since I like the synaptic link to physics it creates.</span></p></blockquote><p>Roundworld, sadly, does not have more than trace quantities of narrativium, which is why Roundworld histories are often so unsatisfying and so easily fall prey to Discworld elves, or humans possessed by them.</p><p><span>The presence of narrativium, and the dynamic of stories and minds creating each other, lends to Discworld history a legitimate </span><em>telos. </em><span>On Roundworld all historicism (except perhaps Fukuyama’s) are simply bad thinking. But on Discworld, it is actually meaningful to ask, </span><em>what does Discworld want?</em></p><p><span>The answer is that Discworld </span><em>wants </em><span>to evolve in a way that could be interpreted as progress in the most neutral, non-ideological sense possible — that of an infinite game, where the goal is not for some to win at the expense of others, but for </span><em>all </em><span>to continue to play, and gradually learn to play ever more nicely and kindly as abundance and meaning increase in the world.</span></p><p>The sentiment behind the aspiration is perhaps a mark of British culture at its best. The high conceit of Discworld is that the infinite game always prevails and cannot truly be derailed by even by the most powerful forces. The mediocre efforts of ordinary characters powered by narrativium is enough to keep the infinite game going.</p><p><span>This is why the denizens of Discworld can often act with a generosity of spirit even towards their worst villains. A generosity that we on Roundworld can find hard to conjure up. They </span><em>know </em><span>they are good guys and necessarily on the winning side, while we can only </span><em>hope.</em></p><p><span>One of my favorite lines from </span><em>Doctor Who </em><span>captures the spirit of the Discworld’s narrativium-powered infinite game perfectly: </span><em>always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. </em></p><p><span>That’s a line from the regeneration speech of the twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi). Like Pratchett’s universe, the </span><em>Doctor Who </em><span>universe too tries to be about keeping the infinite game going, albeit not as elegantly (since the Doctor is a Special Person, making it a fantasy universe). </span></p><p><span>The plot device of regeneration that is limited to the Doctor in </span><em>Doctor Who </em><span>applies to all of Discworld. The whole </span><em>world</em><span> periodically regenerates into a new, richer, more complex form, through a process that looks very much like technological progress. </span></p><p><span>Discworld is </span><em>almost </em><span>perfect science fiction by Chiang’s Law; a world of strange rules rather than special people. Almost, but not quite. There is </span><em>one </em><span>big way in which Discworld is in fact fantasy: the </span><em>world </em><span>itself is a special world. A Chosen World.</span></p><p><span>The </span><em>telos </em><span>of Discworld that Roundworld lacks — it </span><em>wants </em><span>to evolve in open-ended ways that make it preternaturally resistant to capture by totalizing narratives — makes it special. </span></p><p>The history of Roundworld in recent centuries has, at least empirically, exhibited such tendencies, but unlike the denizens of Discworld, we cannot trust in that being the intrinsic nature of our world. Certainly those currently in power are trying to prove it isn’t.</p><p><span>Not so on Discworld. On Discworld, the arc of the moral universe </span><em>does </em><span>in fact have a particular disposition; not towards justice or liberalism or any other such tawdry Roundworld ideological conceit, but towards </span><em>greater generativity and complexity and more alternatives.</em><span> On Discworld, the show </span><em>actually </em><span>must go on, due to the laws of narrativium.</span></p><p>Or to put it another way, Discworld has an astounding, unbreakable resistance to Chosen Ones at any scale except the scale of the world itself. Discworld is powered by the anthropic principle on steroids. It keeps discovering new ways in which its entire reality is special.</p><p>This is one reason Discworld can afford to be such a kind world. As a world that is intrinsically pre-disposed to reject totalizing narratives and protect multiple possibilities in an ever-expanding garden of forking paths, reality is on the side of pluralism and against totalizing conceits.</p><p>This is why, on Discworld, even the weakest, most mediocre protagonists, when going up against a powerful Chosen One who wants to capture and enslave reality, can afford to be gracious. Even when they are at the lowest, and cowering before a Chosen One who thinks he has won. Because thanks to the narrativium levels in the environment, the protagonists know they will win, and need never despair. </p><p>The Discworld protagonist seems to know that though they must always scramble comically and improvise energetically to save it from the monstrous Chosen One of the Week, the arc of their moral universe bends in their favor. </p><p>Discworld is a world that knows what it wants, and how to get it. With some nudging along by Vetinari, Death, and Time Monks, and a lot of reluctant anti-heroic adventuring by the likes of Rincewind, Vimes, Granny Weatherwax, and Moist von Lipwig. Narrativium helps those who help themselves. </p><p><span>I </span><em>wish </em><span>this were true of Roundworld.</span></p><p>Unlike Discworld, our own Roundworld has no such specific disposition. The ideas that the arc of moral history on Roundworld bends towards justice, or that “reality” has a well-known liberal bias (a comforting premise of the late-lamented hyperstitional theory fiction of traditional American politics known as “normalcy”) that are popular with us are no more than thin, wishful fictions. Probably planted in our heads by the Discworld elves.</p><p>Roundworld does not want anything in particular, and no future is necessary. As Discworld scientists have discovered on their trips here, life and civilization have evolved and been destroyed multiple times on Roundworld, in a meaningless process of fragile evolution.</p><p><span>Unlike on Discworld, totalizing narratives of bleak “determinate optimism” can capture and destroy Roundworld. They can </span><em>actually </em><span>end history as surely as our Sun going nova. All it takes is a couple of idiots with their fingers on nuclear triggers, surrounding by admiring Yes Men reassuring them of their greatness.</span></p><p><span>But kindness is perhaps one bit of hyperstitial theory fiction that is worth believing in, even if it does not have any of the force of Discworld’s sympathetic magic to it. Kindness is a feature of our moral universe we can </span><em>pretend </em><span>we can meme it into bending towards. </span></p><p>Because kindness is worth it for its own sake, even if Roundworld lacks the narrativium leverage to turn it into a world-protecting force.</p><p>The idea that there are many alternatives is the second most politically loaded one I’ve ever put out, after the idea that with the right technological scaffolding, a proper reckoning with history is in fact possible and desirable, and not necessarily an exercise in bad-faith book-keeping of resentments and grievances. </p><p><span>Both these ideas currently only exist as talks. I haven’t written them up as essays. The reckoning-with-history idea is my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow43pFm9GLQ" rel="">Bloodcoin</a><span> talk from 2018, and the TAMA idea is in my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBA_9dm6xk" rel="">Civilizational Hypercomplexity</a><span> talk from 2021. Not surprisingly, both talks rely on blockchain-based models of reality. Blockchains are the closest thing to narrativium we Roundworlders have invented. They may be infested with scams and memes, but they cannot be easily captured by Chosen Ones peddling stupid TINAs.</span></p><p><span>The funny thing is, I was never against the original TINA story, neoliberalism. I rather liked it philosophically, liked living in it, and owe basically everything good in my life to it. Now that it is basically over, I do regret its passing, since every TINA hyperstitional theory fiction jockeying to replace it is </span><em>much</em><span> worse. </span></p><p>But at least we’re exploring many alternatives for the moment and not locking into one. And at least the value of real attempts to reckon with history, of the sort I gesture at in the Bloodcoin talk, is becoming crystal clear, given the barrage of wild and transparently motivated confabulations we are now enduring. </p><p><span>This thought inspired </span><a href="https://substack.com/@contraptions/note/c-98520101" rel="">a note</a><span> yesterday:</span></p><blockquote><p>If you want peace, prepare for war. If you want war, prepare for peace.</p><p>If you want the benefits of war without the costs of peace, lie through your teeth about everything</p></blockquote><p>Vetinari, incidentally, did not believe the popular first epigram; he thought the truth was more banal — If you want peace, prepare for peace, if you want war, prepare for war. But I think he would agree with my second thought. Whatever the causal pattern linking war and peace, it is clear that those possessed by elves (or Auditors of Reality) lie through their teeth about everything to justify doing whatever they please, as Chosen Ones.</p><p><span>All that said, there is still the question of kindness — should you be kind, </span><em>especially </em><span>to those you disagree with, and </span><em>especially especially </em><span>when they are strong and threatening to destroy all you hold dear, while you are weak and unable to protect any of it?</span></p><p>Should you live by Discworld rules of kindness and grace, when all that might get you is contempt and destruction? </p><p>Or should you tell yourself stories that make your mind of sterner stuff? </p><p><span>The thought I began with, that </span><em>The Lord of the Rings, </em><span>whatever its merits as a fantasy tale,</span><em> </em><span>is brain-rot for the technological mind, is one that I find so obvious it feels barely worth stating. I only started there because I think that’s where our world’s collective head is at. We not only lack the narrativium protections of Discworld, most humans seem to actively </span><em>prefer </em><span>totalizing single narratives and surrendering to Chosen Ones. Fantasy — in the regular, LOTR sense — is vastly more popular than science fiction.</span></p><p><span>But a comparison that is </span><em>not </em><span>so obvious is between Discworld and Iain M. Banks </span><em>very </em><span>similar Culture novels. Though the milieus couldn’t be more different (space opera vs. steampunk absurdist ironic fantasy), both are science fiction in the Chiang sense — literatures of change set in worlds governed by strange rules.</span></p><p>The Culture is a galactic-scale post-scarcity anarcho-capitalist mongrel utopia under the benevolent protection of superintelligent spaceships. The closest fully realized fictional universe to that meme about fully automated luxury gay space communism.</p><p><span>The Culture though </span><em>is </em><span>neither communism nor capitalism, but a post-capitalist anarchist milieu with few technological peers. It is a superpower on a galactic scale that behaves like a superpower — imposing its values on less developed civilizations with opinionated, unilateralist prejudice. That the values happen to be ones I agree with doesn’t make the Cultures actions more palatable. They are often very troubling (and meant to be).</span></p><p><span>If Discworld has the laws of narrativium going for it, so that mediocrities can serve as stewards, the Culture has a powerful and unapologetically interventionist secret service called Special Circumstances, which operates by the opposite of </span><em>Star Trek</em><span>’s Prime Directive. It cheerfully and heavily interferes all over the place, where it judges that history is headed in the wrong directions. It appoints itself as the Schmittian sovereign making exceptions wherever it likes.</span></p><p>The Culture’s AIs and drones have no compunctions about killing and destruction — this is no gentle Three Laws of Robotics Asimovian universe. In fact, the series opens in the aftermath of a bloody war between the Culture and a peer civilization.</p><p>In the Culture, what is a natural property of reality in Discworld is enforced with extreme prejudice and violence. The entirety of the Culture is like an Assassin’s Guild, with the agents and minds of Special Circumstances acting collectively like a much more forceful Vetinari. </p><p>While life inside the Culture is something like a high-abundance version of an Ursula Le Guin style peaceful anarchy, its actions in foreign space resemble those of the CIA and KGB at the height of the Cold War, rolled into one. Fomenting revolutions, deposing leaders, assassinations — the whole shebang.</p><p><span>To bring it back our core question, that of kindness, the Culture is often kind, though rarely tender, and acts to make sure it’s never in a weak position. It only ever needs to consider the question of kindness from a position of overwhelming strength. The question is never </span><em>if </em><span>it can prevail, but whether it can do so in keeping with its values.</span></p><p>Should we play by Discworld Rules or Culture Rules in the coming years? Should we try to become strong before choosing to be kind, or should we choose kindness whether or not we happen to be strong or weak at any given time?</p><p>I don’t know, but I like that I have at least two good alternatives to ponder. That is the power of not being tied to one narrative with no alternatives being admissible. </p><p>I may never end up choosing, but I think either set of rules would be better than LOTR rules.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2> Easier to learn Arabic </h2>
        <p>
            In the beginning, I found it difficult to learn Arabic. Now, since I overcame the first obstacles, learning Arabic is only fun and easy. I have built this website - <span>Learn Arabic</span> - to make it easier to learn Arabic. I use smart functionality to help people overcome the obstacles that hindered me to learn Arabic.         </p>
        <h3> Start reading Arabic before you learn the alphabet </h3>
        <p>
            I would have learned Arabic faster if it had not been for the Arabic alphabet. Because every letter have different shapes, and the letters are joined, it was time-consuming and annoying to try to read Arabic.         </p>
            <p>
                عرَبِيَّة
            </p>

            It barely helped me to have a table with the Arabic alphabet next to me. I still could not tell where one letter ended and the next started. I did not have any patience to memorize the Arabic alphabet. I wanted to get starting with Arabic words and sentences immediately, just like I did when I learned other languages.         </p>
        <p>
            The only times I felt hope, was when some books and websites showed a word with the letters split up.         </p>
            <p>
                ﻋَ ﺮَ ﺑِ ﻴَّ ﺔ            </p>
        <p>
        It got so much easier. I wished that they could do that with more words, preferably all the words. Even better would be if I could have a link to each letter, with more information about that letter.         </p><table>
            <thead></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr> <td colspan="5" lang="ar">عرَبِيَّة</td></tr>
                <tr dir="rtl">
                    <td lang="ar">ﺔ</td><td lang="ar">ﻴَّ</td><td lang="ar">ﺑِ</td><td lang="ar">ﺮَ</td><td lang="ar">ﻋَ</td>                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>a</td><td><a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/74">y</a></td><td><a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/40">b</a></td><td><a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/49">r</a></td><td><a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/57">ayn</a></td>                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            But I found no tool with that functionality, so I build one myself. The result is this website: <span>Learn Arabic</span>. So far, there are 8261 Arabic words. For each word, you can see the letters split up.        </p>
        <p>
            Here, you can start reading and writing Arabic without having to memorize the alphabet first. You will learn new letters and letter shapes as you learn new words.         </p>
        <h3> Learn Arabic sentences and words at the same time </h3>
        <p>
            The first thing I did when I decided to learn Arabic, was to get an Arabic phrasebook. That gave me nothing. The sentences seemed impossible to perceive, like random cascades of sounds and letters.         </p>
        <div>  
            <p>ﺍَﻟﻌَﺮَﺑِﻴَّﺔُ ﻣَﺼﺪَﺭُ ﺳَﻌَﺎﺩَﺗِﻲ</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            I have little use for knowing that the sentence above  means 'Arabic is the source of my happiness'. It is only when I know what the individual words mean, and why they are combined in that way, that I learn anything, and that I can build on my previous knowledge.         </p>
        
        <p>
            I can hear that <span>al-3arabiyya</span> means 'Arabic'. Regarding the other words, I can only guess their meaning, that <span>maSdar</span> means 'source' and <span>sa3aada</span> means 'happiness'. My guess is true. But it is not always the case that two sentences with the same meaning in Arabic and English has the same word order, or even the same words. The sentence still leaves me with more questions than answers. Where is the verb 'is' and where is the pronoun 'my'?         </p>
        <p>
            That is why almost every word in every sentence and phrase on this website is clickable, and takes you to a page with generous information about the word. That is why there is an eye icon next to each sentence and phrase on this website. When you click the icon, plenty of information about the sentence is displayed.         </p>
        <a href="https://arabic.fi/sentences/1868">
            <amp-img alt="Eye" src="https://arabic.fi/images/eye.svg" height="15" layout="fixed-height"></amp-img>
        </a> 
        <p>
            Now I will see that my guess about the meaning of the words was correct, and I get a chance to learn more. I will learn that <span>sa3aadatii</span> is a combination of <span>sa3aada</span> that means 'happiness' and <span>ii</span> that means 'my'. I can see that the sentence is an Arabic nominal sentence, that has no verb. I realize that <span>al3arabiyya</span> is definite form of <span>3arabiyya</span> that is feminine of <span>3arabiyy</span> that means 'Arabic'.        </p>
        <p>
            So far, there are 2625 Arabic sentences and phrases on this website. Each one has detailed information, and a link to each of the words.        </p>
        <h2> Learn Arabic with associations </h2>
        <p>
            We build knowledge through associations. Information will more likely stay in memory if we can connect it to things we already know.         </p>
        
        <p>
            Did you know that the word <span>maSdar</span> that means 'source' is related to <span>Sadr</span> that means 'chest' and <span>'aSdara</span> that means 'to publish'? The Arabic <a href="https://arabic.fi/lessons/roots">root system</a> makes it easier to remember new words.        </p>
        
        <p>
           Did you know that <span>maSdar</span> that means 'source' has the same patterns as <span>maktab</span> that means 'office' and <span>maSbaH</span> that means 'swimming pool'? All three words start with <span>ma</span>, has the vowel <span>a</span> in the middle and describe places. That is not a coincidence. Arabic words have  <a href="https://arabic.fi/lessons/patterns">patterns</a> that makes it easier to recognize them.        </p>
        <p>
            We build knowledge through associations. That is why all the word in <span>Learn Arabic</span> comes with so much information. Sentences where the word occurs, related words, words with the same patterns and, of course, information about each letter in the word. That is why all sentences has links to all words they are made of. That is why all texts and poems has links to all the sentences and words that they are made of.         </p>
