<p>Google has <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> it will shut down Manifest V2 in June 2024 and move on to Manifest V3, the latest version of its Chrome extension specification that has faced criticism for putting limits on ad blockers. Roughly said, Manifest V2 and V3 are the rules that browser extension developers have to follow if they want their extensions to get accepted into the Google Play Store.</p>



<p>Manifest V2 is the old model. The Chrome Web Store no longer accepts <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Manifest V2 extensions</a>, but browsers can still use them. For now. Manifest V3 is supported generally in Chrome 88 or later and will be the standard after the transition planned to take place in June 2024.</p>



<p>A popular type of browser extensions are ad blockers. Almost all these ad blockers work with block lists, which are long lists of domains, subdomains, and IP addresses that they filter out of your web traffic. These lists are commonly referred to as rulesets. One part of the transition will <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/improvements-to-content-filtering-in-manifest-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“improve” content filtering</a>. And to be fair, Google has made some compromises when it comes to the version as it’s now in the planning, compared to what it originally planned to do. </p>



<ul>
<li>Originally, each extension could offer users a choice of 50 static rulesets, and 10 of these rulesets could be enabled simultaneously. This changes to 50 extensions simultaneously and 100 in total.</li>



<li>Extensions could add up to 5,000 rules dynamically which encouraged using this functionality sparingly and made it easier for Google to detect abuse. Extensions can add rules dynamically to support more frequent updates and user-defined rules. But it comes with the risks of phishing or data theft because these “updates” are not checked during the Chrome Web Store review. For example, a redirect rule could be abused to inject affiliate links without consent. But Google has decided that <code>block</code> and <code>allow</code> are not that easily abused so it will allow up to 30,000 rules to be added dynamically.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, this is still far from enough to fully reach the potential of the best ad blockers we have now. And it’s not just the hard limits on filtering rulesets, there are a lot of other new limits on filtering. Items can’t be filtered based on the response headers or according to the URL in the address bar. Also, extension developers are limited in what regular expressions they can use, along with other technical limitations.</p>



<p>Even if this is not targeted at ad blockers specifically, it’s still a major change that makes blocking requests less flexible. But the bottom line result is that it limits the API that many ad blockers use, and replace it with a less capable one.</p>



<p>Google’s will tell you that by limiting extensions, the browser can be lighter on resources, and Google can protect your privacy from extension developers and calls it “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) however calls Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deceitful and threatening</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Under the new specifications, browser extensions that monitor and filter the web traffic between the browser and the website will have greatly reduced capabilities. This includes ad blockers and privacy-protective tracker blockers. No real surprise, considering Google has trackers installed on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75% of the top one million websites</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According</a> to Firefox’s Add-on Operations Manager, most malicious extension that manage to get through the security review process, are usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. So in their mind, what would really help security is a more thorough review process, but that’s not something Google says it has plans for.</p>



<p>After looking at the arguments Google used to justify this transition, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ArsTechnica</a> came to the conclusion that there’s no justification for arbitrarily limiting the list of filter rules. It says once Manifest V3 happens, Chrome users will be limited to light ad blocker functionality while users will need to switch to Firefox or some other non-limited browser to get the full extension.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Firefox said it will adopt Manifest V3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. And Chrome’s market share will certainly have influenced that decision as well.</p>



<p>Google Chrome Enterprise users with the “ExtensionManifestV2Availability” policy turned on will get an extra year of Manifest V2 compatibility. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about git so I’ve been thinking
about git branches a lot. I keep hearing from people that they find the way git
branches work to be counterintuitive. It got me thinking:  what might an
“intuitive” notion of a branch be, and how is it different from how git
actually works?</p>

<p>So in this post I want to briefly talk about</p>

<ul>
<li>an intuitive mental model I think many people have</li>
<li>how git actually represents branches internally (the “technically correct” definition)</li>
<li>how the “intuitive model” and the real way it works are actually pretty closely related</li>
<li>some limits of the intuitive model and why it might cause problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing in this post is remotely groundbreaking so I’m going to try to keep it pretty short.</p>

<h3 id="an-intuitive-model-of-a-branch">an intuitive model of a branch</h3>

<p>Of course, people have many different intuitions about branches. Here’s the one
that I think corresponds to the most closely to the physical “a branch of an
apple tree” metaphor.</p>

<p>My guess is that a lot of people think about a git branch like this: the 2
commits in pink in this picture are on a “branch”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/git-branch.png" width="200px"></p>

<p>I think there are two important things about this diagram:</p>

<ol>
<li>the branch has 2 commits on it</li>
<li>the branch has a “parent” (<code>main</code>) which it’s an offshoot of</li>
</ol>

<p>That seems pretty reasonable, but that’s not how git defines a branch – most
importantly, git doesn’t have any concept of a branch’s “parent”. So how does
git define a branch?</p>

<h3 id="in-git-a-branch-is-the-full-history">in git, a branch is the full history</h3>

<p>In git, a branch is the full history of every previous commit, not just the “offshoot” commits. So in our picture above both branches (<code>main</code> and <code>branch</code>) have 4 commits on them.</p>

<p>I made an example repository at <a href="https://github.com/jvns/branch-example">https://github.com/jvns/branch-example</a> which
has its branches set up the same way as in the picture above. Let’s look at the
2 branches:</p>

<p><code>main</code> has 4 commits on it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline main
70f727a d
f654888 c
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>mybranch</code> has 4 commits on it too. The bottom two commits are shared
between both branches.</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline mybranch
13cb960 y
9554dab x
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>mybranch</code> has 4 commits on it, not just the 2 commits <code>13cb960</code> and <code>9554dab</code> that are “offshoot” commits.</p>

<p>You can get git to draw all the commits on both branches like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --all --oneline --graph
* 70f727a (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main) d
* f654888 c
| * 13cb960 (origin/mybranch, mybranch) y
| * 9554dab x
|/
* 3997a46 b
* a74606f a
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-branch-is-stored-as-a-commit-id">a branch is stored as a commit ID</h3>

<p>Internally in git, branches are stored as tiny text files which have a commit ID in
them. That commit is the latest commit on the branch. This is the “technically correct” definition I was talking about at the beginning.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the text files for <code>main</code> and <code>mybranch</code> in our example repo:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/heads/main
70f727acbe9ea3e3ed3092605721d2eda8ebb3f4
$ cat .git/refs/heads/mybranch
13cb960ad86c78bfa2a85de21cd54818105692bc
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense: <code>70f727</code> is the latest commit on <code>main</code> and <code>13cb96</code> is the latest commit on <code>mybranch</code>.</p>

<p>The reason this works is that every commit contains a pointer to its parent(s),
so git can follow the chain of pointers to get every commit on the branch.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned before, the thing that’s missing here is any relationship at
all between these two branches. There’s no indication that <code>mybranch</code> is an
offshoot of <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about how the intuitive notion of a branch is “wrong”, I
want to talk about how it’s also right in some very important ways.</p>

<h3 id="people-s-intuition-is-usually-not-that-wrong">people’s intuition is usually not that wrong</h3>

<p>I think it’s pretty popular to tell people that their intuition about git is
“wrong”. I find that kind of silly – in general, even if people’s intuition
about a topic is technically incorrect in some ways, people usually have the
intuition they do for very legitimate reasons! “Wrong” models can be super useful.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about 3 ways the intuitive “offshoot” notion of a branch matches
up very closely with how we actually use git in practice.</p>

<h3 id="rebases-use-the-intuitive-notion-of-a-branch">rebases use the “intuitive” notion of a branch</h3>

<p>Now let’s go back to our original picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/git-branch.png" width="200px"></p>

<p>When you rebase <code>mybranch</code> on <code>main</code>, it takes the commits on the “intuitive”
branch (just the 2 pink commits) and replays them onto <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>The result is that just the 2 (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) get copied. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git switch mybranch
$ git rebase main
$ git log --oneline mybranch
952fa64 (HEAD -&gt; mybranch) y
7d50681 x
70f727a (origin/main, main) d
f654888 c
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>git rebase</code> has created two new commits (<code>952fa64</code> and <code>7d50681</code>) whose
information comes from the previous two <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> commits.</p>

<p>So the intuitive model isn’t THAT wrong! It tells you exactly what happens in a
rebase.</p>

<p>But because git doesn’t know that <code>mybranch</code> is an offshoot of <code>main</code>, you need
to tell it explicitly where to rebase the branch.</p>

<h3 id="merges-use-the-intuitive-notion-of-a-branch-too">merges use the “intuitive” notion of a branch too</h3>

<p>Merges don’t copy commits, but they do need a “base” commit: the way merges
work is that it looks at two sets of changes (starting from the shared base)
and then merges them.</p>

<p>Let’s undo the rebase we just did and then see what the merge base is.</p>

<pre><code>$ git switch mybranch
$ git reset --hard 13cb960  # undo the rebase
$ git merge-base main mybranch
3997a466c50d2618f10d435d36ef12d5c6f62f57
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us the “base” commit where our branch branched off, <code>3997a4</code>.
That’s exactly the commit you would think it might be based on our intuitive
picture.</p>

<h3 id="github-pull-requests-also-use-the-intuitive-idea">github pull requests also use the intuitive idea</h3>

<p>If we create a pull request on GitHub to merge <code>mybranch</code> into <code>main</code>, it’ll
also show us 2 commits: the commits <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. That makes sense and also
matches our intuitive notion of a branch.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/gh-pr.png" width="300px"></p>

<p>I assume if you make a merge request on GitLab it shows you something similar.</p>

<h3 id="intuition-is-pretty-good-but-it-has-some-limits">intuition is pretty good, but it has some limits</h3>

<p>This leaves our intuitive definition of a branch looking pretty good actually!
The “intuitive” idea of what a branch is matches exactly with how merges and
rebases and GitHub pull requests work.</p>

<p>You do need to explicitly
specify the other branch when merging or rebasing or making a pull request (like <code>git rebase main</code>),
because git doesn’t know what branch you think your offshoot is based on.</p>

<p>But the intuitive notion of a branch has one fairly serious problem: the way
you intuitively think about <code>main</code> and an offshoot branch are very different,
and git doesn’t know that.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the different kinds of git branches.</p>

<h3 id="trunk-and-offshoot-branches">trunk and offshoot branches</h3>

<p>To a human, <code>main</code> and <code>mybranch</code> are pretty different, and you probably have
pretty different intentions around how you want to use them.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty normal to think of some branches as being “trunk” branches,
and some branches as being “offshoots”. Also you can have an offshoot of an
offshoot.</p>

<p>Of course, git itself doesn’t make any such distinctions (the term “offshoot”
is one I just made up!), but what kind of a branch it is definitely affects how
you treat it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you might rebase <code>mybranch</code> onto <code>main</code> but you probably wouldn’t rebase <code>main</code> onto <code>mybranch</code> – that would be weird!</li>
<li>in general people are much more careful around rewriting the history on “trunk” branches than short-lived offshoot branches</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="git-lets-you-do-rebases-backwards">git lets you do rebases “backwards”</h3>

<p>One thing I think throws people off about git is – because git doesn’t
have any notion of whether a branch is an “offshoot” of another branch, it
won’t give you any guidance about if/when it’s appropriate to rebase branch X
on branch Y. You just have to know.</p>

<p>for example, you can do either:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout main
$ git rebase mybranch
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ git rebase main
</code></pre>

<p>Git will happily let you do either one, even though in this case <code>git rebase main</code> is
extremely normal and <code>git rebase mybranch</code> is pretty weird. A lot of people
said they found this confusing so here’s a picture of the two kinds of rebases:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/backwards-rebase.png"></p>

<p>Similarly, you can do merges “backwards”, though that’s much more normal than
doing a backwards rebase – merging <code>mybranch</code> into <code>main</code> and <code>main</code> into
<code>mybranch</code> are both useful things to do for different reasons.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram of the two ways you can merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/merge-two-ways.png"></p>

<h3 id="git-s-lack-of-hierarchy-between-branches-is-a-little-weird">git’s lack of hierarchy between branches is a little weird</h3>

<p>I hear the statement “the <code>main</code> branch is not special” a lot and I’ve been
puzzled about it – in most of the repositories I work in, <code>main</code> <strong>is</strong>
pretty special! Why are people saying it’s not?</p>

<p>I think the point is that even though branches <strong>do</strong> have relationships
between them (<code>main</code> is often special!), git doesn’t know anything about those
relationships.</p>

<p>You have to tell git explicitly about the relationship between branches every
single time you run a git command like <code>git rebase</code> or <code>git merge</code>, and if you
make a mistake things can get really weird.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether git’s design here is “right” or “wrong” (it definitely has
some pros and cons, and I’m very tired of reading endless arguments about
it), but I do think it’s surprising to a lot of people for good reason.</p>

<h3 id="in-github-the-default-branch-is-special">in GitHub, the default branch is special</h3>

<p>Also, it’s worth mentioning that GitHub does have a “special branch”: every
github repo has a “default branch” (in git terms, it’s what <code>HEAD</code> points at),
which is special in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s what you check out when you <code>git clone</code> the repository</li>
<li>it’s the default destination for pull requests</li>
<li>github will suggest that you protect the default branch from force pushes</li>
</ul>

<p>and probably even more that I’m not thinking of.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>This all seems extremely obvious in retrospect, but it took me a long time to
figure out what a more “intuitive” idea of a branch even might be because I was
so used to the technical “a branch is a reference to a commit” definition.</p>

<p>I also hadn’t really thought aoout how git makes you tell it about the
hierarchy between your branches every time you run a <code>git rebase</code> or <code>git
merge</code> command – for me it’s second nature to do that and it’s not a big deal,
but now that I’m thinking about it, it’s pretty easy to see how somebody could
get mixed up.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/wyden_hemisphere_letter/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/wyden_hemisphere_letter/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38393237">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A senator has complained that American law enforcement agencies snoop on US citizens and residents, seemingly without regard for the privacy provisions of the Fourth Amendment, under a secret program called the Hemisphere Project that allows police to conduct searches of trillions of phone records.</p>
<p>According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), these searches "usually" happen without warrants. And after more than a decade of keeping people — lawmakers included — in the dark about Hemisphere, Wyden wants the Justice Department to reveal information about what he called a "long-running dragnet surveillance program."</p>
<p>"I have serious concerns about the legality of this surveillance program, and the materials provided by the DoJ contain troubling information that would justifiably outrage many Americans and other members of Congress," Wyden wrote in a letter [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_hemisphere_surveillance_letter_112023.pdf">PDF</a>] to US Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>

    

<p>Under Hemisphere, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) pays telco AT&amp;T to provide all federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies with the ability to request searches of trillions of domestic phone records dating back to at least 1987, plus the four billion call records added every day.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T declined to answer any specific questions about Hemisphere, but a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>: "To be clear, any information referred to in Senator Wyden's letter would be compelled by subpoena, warrant, or court order."</p>
<p>"We defer to the Justice Department, to whom Senator Wyden's letter is addressed, for comment," the AT&amp;T spokesperson said. "Like all companies, we are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement agencies."</p>

        


        

<p>According to Wyden, federal and state law enforcement agencies can request a Hemisphere search with a subpoena — but many law enforcement agencies can issue these themselves. Additionally, any law enforcement agency across the country can request access to these searches, and they aren't limited to drug-related investigations, according to the Oregon senator.</p>
<p>Hemisphere first came to light in a 2013 New York Times <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/us/drug-agents-use-vast-phone-trove-eclipsing-nsas.html">report</a> that alleged the "scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the NSA's gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act."</p>
<h3>It's not classified, but that doesn't mean the Feds want you to see it</h3>
<p>Privacy advocates including the Electronic Frontier Foundations have filed Freedom of Information Act and state-level public records <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hemisphere">lawsuits</a> to learn more about the secret snooping program.</p>
<p>Few have made a dent: it appears that the Feds are doing everything they can to keep Hemisphere secret.</p>

        

<p>Although the program and its documents are not classified, the Justice Department has marked them as "Law Enforcement Sensitive," meaning their disclosure could hurt ongoing investigations. This designation also prevents the documents from being publicly released.</p>
<p>Senator Wyden wants the designation removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hemisphere is not subject to a federal <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-impact-assessments">Privacy Impact Assessment</a> due to its funding structure, it's claimed. The White House doesn't directly pay AT&amp;T - instead the ONDCP provides a grant to the Houston High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, which is a partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. And this partnership, in turn, pays AT&amp;T to operate this surveillance scheme.</p>

        

<p>In Wyden's letter, he quotes a law enforcement official who described Hemisphere as "AT&amp;T's Super Search Engine" and "Google on Steroids." He also cites ONDCP slides and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) emails disclosing that AT&amp;T searches records kept by its wholesale division, which carries communications on behalf of other telecom companies and their customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Another ONDCP document purportedly states that Hemisphere "can be used to identify alternate numbers used by a target, obtain location data and 'two levels of call detail records for one target number'.” That provision means Hemisphere searches can pull in phone records of everyone who communicated with the target of an investigation.</p>
<p>In other words: there's some serious snooping happening.</p>
<p>This letter to DOJ comes as Wyden and other lawmakers from both parties, in the US Senate and House of Representatives, have introduced the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/section_702_reform_legislation/">Government Surveillance Reform Act</a>, which would, among other things, require an independent court order before allowing surveillance of Americans' phone records. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A library instead moves these costs to the users of the library.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
</p><p>
  By library, I mean any software that can be <a href="https://catern.com/run.html">run by the user</a>:
  shared objects, modules, servers, command line utilities, and others.
  By service, I mean any software which the user can't run on their own;
  anything which depends (usually through an API)
  on a service provider for its functionality.
</p><p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy to write because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
</p><p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
</p><p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, <a href="https://catern.com/run.html">let users run the software</a>
  themselves, by writing libraries instead of services.
</p><p>
  "Write a library", in this sense, can still mean writing a standalone server reached through a network protocol.
  As long as the user runs the server themselves, you're still saving the administration costs.
  Both standalone servers and importable code are <a href="https://catern.com/schemas.html">equally expressive</a>,
  and equally cheap for you to administrate if you're not operating a service yourself.
</p><p>
  By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
  a library can afford to contain more functionality.
  That's good for both the developer and the user.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>My game - ΔV: Rings of Saturn (shameless <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/846030/V_Rings_of_Saturn/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_campaign=gamedev-plug">plug</a>) - is out in Early Access for two years now, and as you can expect, there are bugs. But I did find that a disproportionally big amount of these bugs was reported by players using Linux to play. I started to investigate, and my findings did surprise me.</p>

<h2>Let’s talk numbers.</h2>

<p>Percentages are easy to talk about, but when I read just them, I always wonder - what is the sample size? Is it small enough for the percentage to be just noise? As of today, I sold a little over 12,000 units of ΔV in total. 700 of these units were bought by Linux players. That’s 5.8%. I got 1040 bug reports in total, out of which roughly 400 are made by Linux players. That’s one report per 11.5 users on average, and one report per 1.75 Linux players. That’s right, an average Linux player will get you 650% more bug reports.</p>

<p>A lot of extra work for just 5.8% of extra units, right?</p>

<h2>Wrong. Bugs exist whenever you know about them, or not.</h2>

<p>Do you know how many of these 400 bug reports were actually platform-specific? 3. Literally only 3 things were problems that came out just on Linux. The rest of them were affecting everyone - the thing is, the Linux community is exceptionally well trained in reporting bugs. That is just the open-source way. This 5.8% of players found 38% of all the bugs that affected everyone. Just like having your own 700-person strong QA team. That was not 38% extra work for me, that was just free QA!</p>

<h2>But that’s not all. The report quality is stellar.</h2>

<p>I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed.</p>

<p>And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else.</p>

<h2>Worth it?</h2>

<p>Oh, yes - at least for me. Not for the extra sales - although it’s nice. It’s worth it to get the massive feedback boost and free, hundred-people strong QA team on your side. An invaluable asset for an independent game studio.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Requests over the network can fail. This is something we cannot avoid, and to
write robust software we need to handle these failures or else they may be
presented to users as errors. One of the most common techniques for handling a
failed request is to retry it.</p><p>In this post we're going to visually explore different methods of retrying
requests, demonstrating why some common approaches are dangerous and ultimately
ending up at what the best practice is. At the end of this post you will have a
solid understanding of what makes safe retry behaviour, and a vivid
understanding of what doesn't.</p><p>We'll be focusing on when you have control over the behaviour of the client.
The advice in this post applies equally to when you're making requests to your
own backend services or third-party ones. We won't be covering any server-side
mitigations to the problems described in this post.</p><h2 id="setting-the-stage"><a href="#setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</a></h2><p>Let's introduce the elements involved in our visualisation. We have:</p><ul><li><span>Requests</span> can be thought of as HTTP requests.

After getting a response, they will <span>wait</span> an amount of time before sending another <span>request</span>.</li></ul><p>Here's how all of that that looks.</p><p>We have one <span>client</span> sending <span>requests</span> periodically to one <span>server</span>. You could imagine this is a <span>client</span> periodically checking the status of some background
job. The <span>request</span> goes through a <span>load balancer</span> that selects which <span>server</span> to send the <span>request</span>
to. <span>Requests</span> either <span>succeed</span> or <span>fail</span> which you can
see when they're making their return journey to the <span>client</span>. While the <span>client</span> is <span>waiting</span> to send its next <span>request</span>, it shows as a circular timer.</p><h4 id="adjust-animation-speed"><a href="#adjust-animation-speed"><strong>Adjust animation speed</strong></a></h4><p>If the animations are too fast or too slow for you, feel free to change them
now. This will affect all animations on this page.</p><h2 id="basic-retry-handling"><a href="#basic-retry-handling">Basic retry handling</a></h2><p>The simplest way to handle a <span>failure</span> is to do nothing.
In this visualisation the <span>server</span> is configured to <span>fail</span> 100% of the time, and each <span>client</span> will just <span>wait</span> to send
its next <span>request</span>.</p><p>Not all that exciting. <span>Requests</span> <span>fail</span> and the <span>client</span> just <span>waits</span> to send another. Let's do what people tend to do when
they check Sentry and notice that they're serving 503s due to a <span>failed</span> <span>request</span> to a third-party
service: retry 10 times in a tight loop.</p><p>You can see now that when a <span>request</span> <span>fails</span>, it is immediately retried. No <span>
waiting</span>. We've configured a 100% failure rate to make the retries easier
to see, but if the failure rate was 5% then the odds of 2 requests failing
back to back is 1 in 400. 3 requests in a row is 1 in 8000. Retries allow you to
trade latency for reliability.</p><p>However, there's a subtle side-effect of behaving this way. Every time a <span>client</span> retries when it would have otherwise been <span>waiting</span>, an extra <span>request</span> is generated. This increases the overall load to our service.</p><p>Now we're going to add a few more <span>clients</span> and
introduce some buttons. The buttons control the <span>failure</span>
rate of our <span>servers</span>. For now, we're just going to
have 0% and 100%. When you're ready, switch from 0% to 100% and see what happens
to our <span>server</span>.</p><failure-rate-control target="control1" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>If I'm any good at tuning my simulations, you will quickly notice the <span>server</span> <em>explode</em>. Even after you set the <span>failure</span> rate back to 0% and the <span>server</span> has recovered, there's a chance it will keep
exploding.</p><p>What the explosion represents is a <span>server</span>
overloading and crashing. Then it restarts a few seconds later. This can happen
for all sorts of reasons in the real world, from the process running out of
memory to rare segfaults that only happen under stress. Typically <span>servers</span> will have <span>request</span>
queues that reject <span>requests</span> when the <span>server</span> has too much work to do, but to keep things simple
we're using overload to represent any potential failure mode.</p><p>Once the <span>server</span> has crashed once, the extra load
created by the retries can make it difficult to recover. When it comes back up,
it might get quickly overwhelmed and crash again. This problem gets worse as you
scale. Let's add in even more <span>clients</span> and a few more <span>servers</span> to handle the new load.</p><failure-rate-control target="control2" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>What you're likely to see here is that the moment you switch from a 0% <span>failure</span> rate to 100%, traffic begins to ramp up as <span>clients</span> begin to retry. Eventually, one of the <span>servers</span> will crash. As soon as one <span>server</span> goes, the remaining two will be unable to handle
the new load.</p><p>You'll notice that setting the <span>failure</span> rate back to 0%
here will likely have no meaningful effect. You may eventually recover, but if
you're doing retries in a tight loop and you get into this overloaded state it
can be very hard to get back out. In practice, the quickest way to recover is to
add more <span>servers</span> to absorb the load. Once
stabilised, you can spin the extra <span>servers</span> back
down.</p><p>Give that a try in the next visualisation. It's tuned the same way as the
previous one, but this time there's an extra toggle that lets you control the
number of <span>servers</span>. Set the <span>failure</span> rate up to 100%, get into an overloaded state, then
set it back down to 0% and gradually add <span>servers</span>
until you're recovered. How many extra <span>servers</span> do
you need in order to stabilise?</p><failure-rate-control target="control2.1" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><h2 id="retrying-with-a-delay"><a href="#retrying-with-a-delay">Retrying with a delay</a></h2><p>So retrying in a tight loop is problematic and we've seen why. The next thing
people do is to add a delay between each retry. 10 retries with a <code>sleep(1000)</code>
between them. Let's see how that fares.</p><failure-rate-control target="control3" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>You should notice the same pattern here as with no delay between retries. When
you set the <span>failure rate</span> to 100%, the <span>server</span> will crash shortly after. It may take a bit longer,
but it will happen. If the rate at which your <span>clients</span> retry is not longer than the rate at which they
normally send <span>requests</span>, you will see an increase in
overall load.</p><p>To demonstrate, let's try a <code>sleep(10000)</code> to wait 10 seconds after a <span>failed</span> <span>request</span>. This wait
is about twice as long as <span>clients</span> usually wait
before sending their next <span>request</span>.</p><failure-rate-control target="control4" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>This "works" insofar as the <span>server</span> is unlikely to
get overloaded, and if it does it is able to recover with ease. But this will
lead to a bad user experience in practice. Users don't like waiting, and the
longer you sleep between retries, the more likely they are to refresh manually
or go and do something else. Both bad outcomes.</p><h2 id="so-whats-the-answer"><a href="#so-whats-the-answer">So what's the answer?</a></h2><p>We need a way of retrying that retries quickly in case the error is low
probability, thus protecting the user experience, but recognises when things are
really wrong and waits longer to prevent unrecoverable overload.</p><p>We need "<strong>exponential backoff.</strong>" There are lots of things you can configure
when calculating exponential backoff, but if you imagine we started off waiting
for 1 second and waited twice as long each retry, 10 retries would look like
this:</p><ul><li>1 second</li><li>2 seconds</li><li>4 seconds</li><li>8 seconds</li><li>16 seconds</li><li>32 seconds</li><li>1 minute and 4 seconds</li><li>2 minutes and 8 seconds</li><li>4 minutes and 16 seconds</li><li>8 minutes and 32 seconds</li></ul><p>This would be an enormous amount of time to wait, so in practice exponential
backoff is tuned to start lower than 1 second, and often has a lower multiplier.
Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-http-client/1.43.0/com.google.api.client.util.ExponentialBackOff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Java HTTP Client Library</a>, for example, starts at 0.5 seconds and
has a multiplier of 1.5. This yields the following retry intervals:</p><ul><li>0.5 seconds</li><li>0.75 seconds</li><li>1.125 seconds</li><li>1.687 seconds</li><li>2.53 seconds</li><li>3.795 seconds</li><li>5.692 seconds</li><li>8.538 seconds</li><li>12.807 seconds</li><li>19.210 seconds</li></ul><p>Enough mathematics, how does this look in practice? All of the following
examples use the Google HTTP library backoff defaults (0.5 second initial delay,
1.5 multiplier).</p><failure-rate-control target="control5" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>As soon as you flip over to 100% <span>failure</span> rate you'll
notice the usual ramp up in <span>requests</span>, but as those <span>requests</span> are retried you will then notice that the
backoff kicks in and things calm down. The <span>server</span>
may crash but the <span>clients</span> give it space to recover.
When you flip back to 0% <span>failure</span> rate, the <span>server</span> is able to return to normal service quickly.</p><p>For fun, let's also see it in action at scale. I'm going to give you some more <span>failure</span> rates to play with, too. Go wild.</p><failure-rate-control target="control6" options="0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1"></failure-rate-control><p>You may have struggled to get any of the <span>servers</span> to
crash in this example, even at a 100% <span>failure</span> rate.
This is exponential backoff at work, helping your <span>clients</span> recognise trouble and getting them to give your <span>servers</span> space to recover.</p><h2 id="jitter"><a href="#jitter">Jitter</a></h2><p>We've seen the power of exponential backoff at work, but there's one last thing
we can do with our retries to make them truly best practice.</p><p>"Jitter" is the process of randomising how long we wait between retries to
within a specific range. To follow the Google HTTP client library example, they
add 50% jitter. So a retry interval can be between 50% lower and 50% higher than
the calculated figure. Here's how that affects our numbers from before:</p><ul><li>0.5 seconds, ± 0.25 seconds</li><li>0.75 seconds, ± 0.375 seconds</li><li>1.125 seconds, ± 0.5625 seconds</li><li>1.687 seconds, ± 0.8435 seconds</li><li>2.53 seconds, ± 1.265 seconds</li><li>3.795 seconds, ± 1.8975 seconds</li><li>5.692 seconds, ± 2.846 seconds</li><li>8.538 seconds, ± 4.269 seconds</li><li>12.807 seconds, ± 6.4035 seconds</li><li>19.210 seconds, ± 9.605 seconds</li></ul><p>This jitter helps prevent <span>clients</span> from synchronising
with each other and sending surges of <span>requests</span>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-in-to-code"><a href="#putting-this-in-to-code">Putting this in to code</a></h2><p>So you've read this post and realised you're either not making use of retries,
or you're doing them dangerously. Here's some example Go code that implements
the retry strategy we've built up to, exponential backoff with jitter, that you
can use in your own projects.</p><pre><div><p><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"encoding/json"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>

	<span>"github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4"</span>
)

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
	bo := backoff.NewExponentialBackOff()
	bo.InitialInterval = <span>500</span> * time.Millisecond
	bo.Multiplier = <span>1.5</span>
	bo.RandomizationFactor = <span>0.5</span>

	err := backoff.Retry(<span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> <span>error</span> {
		resp, err := http.Get(<span>"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"</span>)
		<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span> err
		}
		<span>defer</span> resp.Body.Close()

		<span>var</span> result <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>interface</span>{}
		<span>if</span> err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;result); err != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span> err
		}

		fmt.Printf(<span>"%+v\n"</span>, result)
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
	}, bo)

	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		fmt.Println(<span>"Request failed:"</span>, err)
	}
}
</code></p></div></pre><h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</a></h2><p>I hope that this post has helped visually cement how different retry behaviours
work in practice, and given you a good, intuitive understanding of the failure
modes. We can't always prevent failure, but we can set ourselves up to have the
best chance of recovering when it does happen.</p><p>To recap what we've learned:</p><ul><li><strong>Retrying in a tight loop is dangerous.</strong> You risk getting into overload
situations that are difficult to recover from.</li><li><strong>Retrying with a delay</strong> helps a little bit but is still <strong>dangerous.</strong></li><li><strong>Exponential backoff</strong> is a much safer way of retrying, balancing user
experience with safety.</li><li><strong>Jitter</strong> adds an extra layer of protection, preventing clients from sending
synchronised surges of requests.</li></ul><p>If you have questions or feedback, please reach out on

</p><p>The first incident took place during the sports segment of independent TV station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN-TV" title="WGN-TV">WGN-TV</a>'s 9:00 p.m. newscast. Like the later signal intrusion, it featured a person wearing a mask swaying erratically in front of a swiveling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_galvanised_iron" title="Corrugated galvanised iron">corrugated metal</a> panel, apparently meant to resemble Max Headroom's animated geometric background. Unlike the later intrusion, the only sound was a loud buzz. This interruption went on for almost 17 seconds before engineers at WGN were able to regain control of their broadcast tower.
</p><p>The second incident occurred about two hours later during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> member station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW" title="WTTW">WTTW</a>'s broadcast of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> serial <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock" title="Horror of Fang Rock">Horror of Fang Rock</a></i>. With nobody on duty at the affected tower, this signal takeover was more sustained, and the masked figure could be heard making reference to the real Max Headroom's advertisements for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke" title="New Coke">New Coke</a>, the animated TV series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_Cargo" title="Clutch Cargo">Clutch Cargo</a></i>, WGN sportscaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Swirsky" title="Chuck Swirsky">Chuck Swirsky</a>, "Greatest World Newspaper nerds", and other seemingly unrelated topics. The video concluded with the masked figure’s bare buttocks being spanked by a woman with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyswatter" title="Flyswatter">flyswatter</a> while yelling "They're coming to get me!", with the woman responding "Bend over, bitch!" as the figure was crying and screaming. At that point, the hijackers ended the pirate transmission, and normal programming resumed after a total interruption of about 90 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>The broadcast intrusion was achieved by sending a more powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_transmission" title="Microwave transmission">microwave transmission</a> to the stations' broadcast towers than the stations were sending themselves, triggering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_effect" title="Capture effect">capture effect</a>.

</p><p>No one has ever claimed responsibility for the stunt. Speculation about the identities of "Max" and his co-conspirators has centered on the theories that the prank was either an inside job by a disgruntled employee (or former employee) of WGN or was carried out by members of Chicago's underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture" title="Hacker culture">hacker community</a>. However, despite an official law enforcement investigation in the immediate aftermath of the incident and many unofficial investigations, inquiries, and online speculation in the ensuing decades, the identities and motives of the hijackers remain a mystery.<sup id="cite_ref-Shefsky_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-Shefsky-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Unruh_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-Unruh-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gallagher_8-7"><a href="#cite_note-Gallagher-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Haskins_9-3"><a href="#cite_note-Haskins-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wbur_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-wbur-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>Soon after the intrusion, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> official was quoted in news reporting that the perpetrators faced a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to a year in prison.<sup id="cite_ref-Knittel_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-Knittel-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Camper_12-3"><a href="#cite_note-Camper-12">[12]</a></sup> However, the five-year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> was surpassed in 1992, so the persons responsible for the intrusion would no longer face criminal punishment should their identities be revealed.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>Though the incident only briefly caught the attention of the general public, it has been overtly or subtly referenced in a variety of media over the ensuing decades, with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard_(website)" title="Motherboard (website)">Motherboard</a></i> claiming that it has been an influential "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> hacking trope".<sup id="cite_ref-Haskins_9-4"><a href="#cite_note-Haskins-9">[9]</a></sup>

</figure><p>Nobody expected polio to be back.</p><p>It’s 2040, a decade since the disease was eradicated. The global health campaign that vanquished the virus has disbanded; immunization efforts have slackened. Then, one day, a sick child in a conflict-wracked country develops paralysis; the cause turns out to be polio. Scientists trace the origin of the virus to a laboratory on the other side of the world. A technician at the lab had handled a forgotten batch of polio-infected material — and then visited their family abroad.</p><p>As cases multiply, the World Health Organization (WHO) appeals for help to conduct emergency immunization campaigns, but stocks of vaccines are low and few members of staff have direct experience of polio outbreaks. Soon there are tens of thousands of cases: millions more people around the world who haven’t had the vaccine are at risk.</p><p>This is just one of many possible scenarios that could follow polio eradication. Although the world has not yet eliminated poliovirus, many observers think it could be gone within three years. The polio-eradication campaign has increased its intensity and funding in the past year in the hope of finally meeting a deadline that’s been postponed many times since efforts were launched in 1988.</p><p>The front lines are Afghanistan and Pakistan, where pockets of wild polio <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02577-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02577-7" data-track-category="body text link">persist but are shrinking</a> (see ‘Wild polio tamed’), and a swathe of Africa, where a polio vaccine that includes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02501-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02501-3" data-track-category="body text link">live virus has itself seeded outbreaks</a>.

</figure><p>The final steps towards eradication are formidable, and it’s not clear when — or whether — nations will reach this goal. Nonetheless, with the demise of the virus in sight, health authorities are planning what happens next.</p><p>That’s because eradication is not extinction. Polio could lurk in testing labs and manufacturing facilities — from which it has leaked in the past — and even in some people. Mistakes years after eradication could let polio into an unprotected population where it could “wreak havoc”, says virologist Konstantin Chumakov, former associate director of vaccine research at the FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p><p>The end of polio is only the beginning of another effort: developing the resilience to keep it away, says Liam Donaldson, a public-health specialist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, UK, and the lead author of a series of independent reports on the campaign’s progress (see go.nature.com/49hho4a). “People have signed up to polio eradication, but they’ve not signed up to the longer journey.”</p><h2><b>Stamping it out</b></h2><p>Only one human disease has so far been declared eradicated: smallpox, in 1980. Polio has been more complex, says David Heymann, who heads the WHO’s Containment Advisory Group. That’s because of a key difference: every smallpox infection produces symptoms, but polio can silently infect up to 1,000 people before causing a case of paralysis. The other snag is that polio can be caused not only by the wild virus, but also, in very rare cases, by the vaccines deployed to prevent it. Eradication means getting rid of both forms for good.</p><p>The main tool is vaccination. Industrialized, polio-free countries use an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which doesn’t prevent the virus infecting the body and being shed in stools, but does protect against paralysis. Provided that immunization levels with IPV remain high and sanitation is good, a rogue poliovirus will probably peter out, according to Concepcion Estivariz, a polio researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>But because the inactivated vaccine can’t block transmission, children in at-risk countries still receive another type: an oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) that contains an attenuated form of the live virus, and can stop polio’s spread — which is crucial for eradication. It’s also cheaper and easier to deliver than IPV, which is administered by injection. The oral campaign has been hugely successful. Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) estimates it has prevented 20 million cases of polio paralysis.</p><figure>

</figure><p>But OPV has some important downsides. There is a low risk that the vaccine itself can cause paralysis. And, on rare occasions, the weakened virus used in the vaccine can mutate sufficiently to regain virulence. This can lead to outbreaks of cases known as vaccine-derived polio among people who have not been vaccinated fully or at all. “If we continue OPV,” says Estivariz, “we never stop the circle.” Most countries are now using IPV in their routine immunization programmes alongside OPV, and the WHO recommends that IPV administration should continue for a decade after disease transmission has been stopped, to protect against any accidental releases or hidden pockets of the virus.</p><p>Polio will be certified as eradicated when no case has been observed for three years, and when there is no sign of it in environmental surveillance data — that is, in samples of waste water. A year after that, OPV must be withdrawn to prevent vaccine-derived polio. The problem, however, is that removing it will be an extraordinarily delicate manoeuvre. Done messily, this process could trigger the return of the virus.</p><p>In 2016, for instance, the withdrawal of an OPV across 150 countries went disastrously wrong. “The results were sobering”, says Kimberly Thompson, an epidemiologist at the research non-profit organization Kid Risk, in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>There are three strains of wild polio — types 1, 2 and 3. Type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015, and type 3 followed in 2019. The oral vaccine contained attenuated versions of all three strains, but after type 2 was eradicated, the aim was to withdraw vaccines containing that strain to minimize the risk of seeding vaccine-derived type 2 polio. So the GPEI orchestrated a two-week period in April 2016 in which all three-strain oral vaccines were switched for versions containing just types 1 and 3.</p><p>Swiftly, however, cases of vaccine-derived type 2 polio began to build — in two countries in 2016, spreading to 24 countries by 2020, with countries in Africa worst affected. A case popped up in the United States in 2022, and the United Kingdom found the virus in wastewater samples. The cumulative number of paralysis cases so far is just over 3,200; the yearly total peaked at more than 1,000 in 2020 and now seems to be declining, with 238 recorded so far this year (see ‘Rare and receding: vaccine-derived polio’). African countries are still running multiple emergency campaigns delivering oral type 2 vaccines to stamp these outbreaks out.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Why the rebound? First, populations in the regions affected weren’t sufficiently vaccinated beforehand with IPV, which would have protected them until any outbreaks could be controlled. This was partly owing to a gap in vaccine supply, says Ondrej Mach, who co-chairs a new GPEI group that will oversee future withdrawals of the oral vaccine.</p><p>What’s more, says Mach, just before the switch, vaccine-derived type 2 polio was detected in Nigeria. Transmission was probably already under way in Nigeria and other countries, adds Mach, and the emergency type 2 vaccine seeded further outbreaks.</p><p>Since 2021, however, this seeding has become much less likely: vaccination campaigns are controlling the outbreaks using a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03045-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03045-2" data-track-category="body text link">genetically engineered oral vaccine</a>, which has an even lower chance of becoming virulent than the OPVs used previously.</p><p>What risks does the post-polio world face if full oral withdrawal goes wrong? An analysis by Kid Risk and the CDC gave one answer (D. A. Kalkowska <i>et al. Risk Anal. </i>https://doi.org/k428; 2023). Their model considers what might happen if all OPV use stopped in 2027 but vaccine-derived polio was not completely eliminated beforehand and outbreak responses were weak. In one scenario, the model predicts that there could be as many as 40,000 cases of paralysis caused by vaccine-derived polio 8 years after OPV administration is discontinued. To avoid this, the authors suggest that population immunity in areas with polio cases today needs to be very high — about 90% — just before withdrawal. Thompson says that most countries have achieved this in the past, at least for short periods of time.</p><h2><b>Keeping a lookout</b></h2><p>Even after OPVs are successfully withdrawn, therefore, countries can’t let their guard down. They must put in place surveillance “to detect any poliovirus, no matter where in the world it appears and however fleetingly”, says a report by the Transition Independent Monitoring Board, an independent group of scientists that reports periodically on the polio endgame and is chaired by Donaldson.</p><p>Polio surveillance takes two main forms: searching for cases of paralysis that might be caused by polio; and monitoring waste water for any virus shed by carriers.</p><p>Both will be crucial for years, as an example from Malawi shows. The country had been free from wild polio for three decades when, in 2021, a stool sample from a three-year-old with paralysis arrived at the national laboratory to be sent abroad for testing. The sample sat for two months before it was shipped with others, says Jamal Ahmed, who coordinates polio eradication for the WHO in its African region, which comprises 47 countries. The result came back a month later: it was wild polio type 1, not seen in the continent since 2016.</p><p>Sequencing traced its origin to Pakistan, but also revealed that the virus had been circulating for two years undetected — possibly in Malawi, and possibly elsewhere. Because Malawi had no wastewater surveillance at the time, it was impossible to know.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Within 30 days of receiving the result, emergency immunizations began. Six campaign rounds later, says Ahmed, Malawi has seen no more cases of wild polio. And, with the WHO’s help, the country swiftly installed environmental surveillance sites.</p><p>The episode also showed that the emergency vaccination programme wasn’t up to the job, says Jay Wenger, who leads the polio programme at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. “We had to rebuild the polio infrastructure we had before” to get rid of the virus, he says.</p><p>Global wastewater surveillance has become a bigger priority since the COVID-19 pandemic, says Donaldson, because politicians are paying more attention to trends in disease. Ahmed says that 41 of the 47 member states of WHO Africa now have environmental polio surveillance, and that the rest will soon catch up.</p><p>Innovations are helping to speed up a process in which timeliness is crucial. One breakthrough is direct detection, a method that leapfrogs several of the conventional stages of the testing process; for example, by extracting RNA directly from samples without the need to culture them.</p><h2><b>The threat of escape</b></h2><p>No matter how successful the eradication effort is, the virus will remain in research institutes and vaccine-manufacturing facilities — and in an unknown number of routine diagnostic labs.</p><p>Escapes happen. Last year, a lab worker at a manufacturing facility in Utrecht, the Netherlands, picked up type 3 virus at the facility, and this was then detected in wastewater surveillance outside the plant. No cases of paralysis resulted. Vaccine manufacturing is “a huge containment nightmare”, says Mach.</p><p>The WHO has a plan for poliovirus containment that urges nations to minimize the number of facilities retaining poliovirus materials and to destroy any unnecessary stocks. At the moment, the WHO knows of 74 facilities that hold polio, in 22 countries.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The first step was for each country to set up a national authority for containment by 2018, to ensure that facilities comply with biosafety requirements. China and Romania have not yet done this, and other countries have missed subsequent deadlines.</p><p>Even for compliant facilities, forgotten samples remain a threat, says Andy Macadam at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar, UK. “All you have to do is mislabel the tube.” And polio might lurk in some facilities that are not even subject to the containment plan, says Heymann. This could include frozen stool samples taken for other reasons at a time when polio was circulating.</p><p>Since 2000, there have been 21 reported incidents of poliovirus release from laboratories and vaccine-production facilities in 8 countries, with 16 cases of polio as a result, according to Derek Ehrhardt, who heads the WHO’s poliovirus containment unit. Most cases have been in vaccine-manufacturing facilities, but five of them were in research labs in which workers discovered that vials containing poliovirus were mislabelled (none of those cross-contamination incidents led to paralysis). The solution, says Heymann, is better biosecurity in all labs.</p><p>To reduce the need for live virus, scientists are developing ways to produce the inactivated vaccine without it — for example, by using a non-infectious, genetically engineered starting material, or by designing vaccines from virus-like particles or messenger RNA.</p><h2><b>A surprising source</b></h2><p>There is yet another source of poliovirus, unforeseen 35 years ago when eradication efforts began.</p><p>In most people who receive the oral vaccine, the immune system generates antibodies that protect them against the virus. But in a small number of people born with particular immune deficiency disorders, the immune system allows the attenuated virus from the vaccine to live on, evolving as time goes by and emerging in their stools. No drugs have been proved to cure an ongoing polio infection.</p><p>Only some of the several hundred types of immunodeficiency lead to chronic retention of poliovirus. No one knows how many people are affected, and no such shedding is known to have triggered a polio outbreak, although it might have contributed to one in the Philippines in 2019–21.</p><p>But, says Mach, even one person retaining and shedding poliovirus is incompatible with eradication. “We have to do something.” An international — if patchy — search for people with these immune disorders who have chronic polio has produced a register of 200 individuals.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>One person with the condition lives in the United Kingdom and was vaccinated with OPV as a child. For more than 20 years, he asymptomatically carried — and shed — the attenuated virus, which evolved to its disease-causing form. His gut was “essentially a culture vessel”, says David Boyle at PATH, a non-profit medical-research organization based in Seattle, Washington.</p><p>That’s why scientists were surprised to learn that the person’s infection had gone.</p><p>It disappeared after he received the antiviral drug remdesivir for severe COVID-19 in August 2021. This could be coincidence, says Macadam, but it bolsters the case that antivirals could be used to treat polio infection (two such drugs are being explored as polio treatments). Monoclonal antibodies are also under development.</p><h2><b>Complacency and responsibility</b></h2><p>Keeping vaccination rates high for at least a decade after eradication will be the best protection — but there are fears that commitment to IPVs might wane once eradication has been declared.

<p><strong>Sorry if this was slow to load before.</strong><br>It’s self hosted in my flat with a VDSL connection not designed for heavy traffic. I’ve swallowed my pride and ironically put this blog on a CDN.</p>



<h2>My ISP has never been amazing…</h2>



<p>Well, most aren’t. Browsing the Internet was getting worse and worse, but too unpredictable to see a clear pattern. Speed tests were fine, many websites loaded perfectly, but enough didn’t work, so it was worth investigating. Apple TV+ would crap out, but only if casting via AirPlay. BBC News wouldn’t load at all, but iPlayer would slowly.</p>



<h2>The network</h2>



<p>I have a VDSL2 line, Ubiquiti Wi-Fi and standard Catalyst switches. Nothing too weird.  I pay for a /29 block, so I have multiple usable IP addresses. Yes I host my own mail, and yes, I do DKIM, DMARC and SPF, and MXToolbox shows I’m not on any blocklists.</p>



<h2>The symptoms</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><mark>Working</mark></th><th><mark>Not working</mark></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>most websites load fine<br>(amazon.co.uk, halifax.co.uk)</td><td>but many not at all<br>(bbc.co.uk, farnell.com)</td></tr><tr><td>800Mbps iperf across the LAN</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stable 39 Mbps down / 7 Mbps up</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stable 6ms ping to 1.1.1.1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PPP is stable and not dropping</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AirPlay to LG TV works (via a Unifi AP)</td><td>but crashes once per show</td></tr><tr><td>AirPlay to LG TV works (TV wired in)</td><td>still crashes</td></tr><tr><td>Spotify can stream to a Bose Soundbar</td><td>but changing song takes 30sec+</td></tr><tr><td>DNS is fine</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>iOS app downloads take 3min to start</td></tr><tr><td>Swapping Cisco VDSL2 router for the ISP’s router makes some sites now work</td><td>but not all sites</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>The cause</h2>



<p>The freebie ISP router has IPv6 enabled by default, so would speak to the CDNs from the clean v6 range. <strong>When using my equipment without IPv6 configured, I can only speak on the IPv4 range</strong> that’s “shadow banned”.</p>



<h2>Proving my theory</h2>



<h3>Step 1: VPN egress traversing bad ISP’s network</h3>



<p>I set up a WireGuard tunnel to another site I have in the Isle of Man, supplied by another ISP. I forwarded all traffic from my workstation via this tunnel:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="219" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1024x219.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1024x219.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-300x64.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-768x164.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1536x328.png 1536w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.png 1735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I now pop out in the Isle of Man via ASN 42455’s network (www.infobyip.com to test):</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="259" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-1024x259.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-1024x259.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-300x76.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-768x195.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>and can surf and stream as normal:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="451" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-1024x451.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-1024x451.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-300x132.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-768x339.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Step 2: Wireshark deep-dive</h3>



<p>I took two captures of my workstation visiting bbc.co.uk in Chrome. The first without the WireGuard tunnel on, and the second with it on. Let’s look at <code>tcp</code> traffic:</p>



<p><strong>Without WireGuard:</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="888" height="551" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19.png 888w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19-300x186.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"><figcaption>No meaningful TCP traffic makes it out. A lot of retransmissions and duplicate ACKs are happening</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>With WireGuard:</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="888" height="520" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20.png 888w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20-300x176.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"><figcaption>A nice healthy TCP session</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>(I disabled checksum verification in the screenshots above, as I’m capturing on the same machine having problems, which also has checksum offloading on the NIC.)</em></p>



<h2><em>Zen Broadband</em>, my ISP (for now)</h2>



<p>I’ll save my views on Zen for when this case is resolved. I’ve got so far through the support process I’m now dealing with their Network Ops team to investigate this. They can still redeem themselves by simply giving me a different /29 block as far away from 82.71.78.0/29 as possible 🙂</p>



<h2>Be more specific. What do you mean by “throttled”?</h2>



<p>The blocking is nondeterministic. Whilst Akamai (who offers a reputation check) returns one of my IPs as clean, websites of their customers like eBay have shown the throttling behaviour. Apple TV+ appears to be served by Akamai too (tv.apple.com), which has been the worst offender for “throttling” my streaming:</p>



<div data-code-block-pro-font-family="Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>C</span><span>:\</span><span>WINDOWS</span><span>\system32&gt; nslookup tv.apple.com</span></span>

<span><span>          itunes.apple.com.edgekey.net</span></span></code></pre></div>



<p>It’s also available with IPv6, explaining the freebie ISP router theory.</p>



<p>Fastly doesn’t offer a rep check on their website but bbc.co.uk right now won’t load at all. Cloudflare is opaque too about disclosing what IPs they’re throttling.</p>



<h2>Why would a range get throttled or “shadow banned”?</h2>



<p>This is extremely difficult to answer and I have no good theory. The same IP range handles my email and I generally have no trouble emailing major providers like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo!, and many other counterparties.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry is banking on carbon capture as its “fix” for climate change. The IEA’s new report dispels that idea and offers real solutions.</p>



<p>The oil and gas sector currently accounts for just 1% of clean energy investment globally. A special report from the International Energy Agency (<a href="https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEA</a>) released ahead of the COP28 climate summit explores how the fossil fuel industry “can take a more responsible approach and contribute positively to the new energy economy.”</p>



<p>In other words, the fossil fuel industry needs to get on the renewables bandwagon<em>&nbsp;now</em>, and not with large-scale carbon capture. The IEA provides a roadmap in its<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-oil-and-gas-industry-in-net-zero-transitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;new report</a>, “The Oil and Gas Industry in Net Zero Transitions.”</p>



<p>Global demand for both oil and gas is set to peak by 2030, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/23/iea-predicts-that-global-emissions-will-peak-by-2025/">if not by 2025</a>. If governments deliver in full on their national energy and climate pledges, demand will fall 45% below today’s level by 2050. In a pathway to reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, which is necessary to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C within reach, oil and gas use will decline by more than 75% by 2050.</p>



<p>Or, to spell it out in monetary terms, the report’s analysis finds that the current valuation of private oil and gas companies could fall by 25% from $6 trillion today if all national energy and climate goals are reached, and by up to 60% if the world gets on track to limit global warming to 1.5C.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-status-quo-is-impossible">The status quo is impossible</h2>



<p>Every oil and gas company’s transition strategy can and should include a plan to reduce emissions from its own operations, asserts the report – yet companies with targets to reduce their emissions account for less than 50% of global oil and gas output.</p>



<p>The IEA also points out that carbon capture can’t be used as a linchpin by the fossil fuel industry to maintain the status quo. If oil and natural gas consumption were to evolve as projected under today’s policy settings, limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C would require an “entirely inconceivable” 32 billion tonnes of carbon captured for utilization or storage by 2050, including 23 billion tonnes via direct air capture.</p>



<p>The amount of electricity needed to power these technologies would be greater than the&nbsp;<em>entire world’s electricity demand</em>&nbsp;today.</p>



<p>IEA executive director Fatih Birol said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.</p>



<p>The [oil and gas] industry needs to commit to genuinely helping the world meet its energy needs and climate goals – which means letting go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-be-part-of-the-solution">How to be part of the solution</h2>



<p>The report finds that the oil and gas sector is well placed to scale up some crucial technologies for transitions to clean energy, such as offshore wind and geothermal energy. It’s going to have to change tack in many other aspects of its business, too. It needs to increase investment in EV charging facilities – turn the gas stations into EV stations. The sector can also move further into the plastics recycling industry as global bans on plastic continue to grow.</p>



<p>Further, the <em>production, transport, and processing</em> of oil and gas results in nearly 15% of global energy-related emissions – equal to the US’s entire energy-related emissions. The fossil fuel industry’s emissions must decline by 60% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C by 2050. The emissions intensity of oil and gas producers with the highest emissions is currently five to 10 times above those with the lowest, showing the vast potential for improvements. So it needs to boost efficiency and electrify its facilities across the sector. </p>



<p>Reducing emissions from methane, which accounts for half of the total emissions from oil and gas operations, would also provide a big win, as methane reduction strategies are well-known and inexpensive.</p>



<p>The oil and gas industry invested around $20 billion in clean energy in 2022, or roughly 2.5% of its total capital spending. It can and must do a lot better. To align with the Paris Agreement, the IEA says, it must put 50% of its capital expenditures towards clean energy projects by 2030, on top of the investment required to reduce emissions from its operations.</p>



<p>Not only is it imperative that the fossil fuel sector shifts gears to limit global warming – it’s also good business.</p>

They house hundreds of thousands of computer servers and disk drives and have brought cloud computing, more powerful search engines, and faster Internet service. He died unexpectedly of natural causes. </p><p>Barroso was born in Brazil and earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 1989 in electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/english/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro</a>. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in computer engineering in 1996 from the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>.</p><p>In 1995 he joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102750386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Research Laboratory</a>, in Palo Alto, Calif., as a researcher specializing in microprocessor design. While there, he investigated how to build hardware to run more modern business applications and Web services. Three years later, the company was acquired by <a href="https://www.compaq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Compaq</a> and his project was terminated.</p><p>He left Compaq in 2001 to join <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a> in Mountain View, Calif., as a software engineer.</p><p>The company housed its servers at leased space in third-party data centers, which were basically cages in which a few racks of computing equipment were placed. As Google’s business expanded, its need for infrastructure increased. In 2004 Barroso was tasked with investigating ways to build more efficient data centers.</p><p>He devised a way to use low-cost components and energy-saving techniques to distribute Google’s programs across thousands of servers, instead of the traditional method of relying on a few powerful, expensive machines.</p><p>The company’s first data center designed by Barroso opened in 2006 in The Dalles, Ore. It implemented fault-tolerance software and hardware infrastructure to make the servers less prone to disruption. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> now has 35 data centers in 10 countries, all drawing from Barroso’s groundbreaking techniques.</p><p>In 2009 Barroso co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacenter-Computer-Introduction-Warehouse-Scale-Architecture/dp/159829556X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Data Center as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines</em></a>, a seminal textbook.</p><p>He also led the team that designed Google’s AI chips, known as tensor processing units or TPUs, which accelerated machine-learning workloads. He helped integrate augmented reality and machine learning into Google Maps.</p><p>At the time of his death, Barroso was a Google Fellow, the company’s highest rank for technical staff.</p><p>He also was an executive sponsor of the company’s Hispanic and Latinx employee group and oversaw a program that awarded fellowships to doctoral students in Latin America.</p><p>For his contributions to computing architecture, he received the 2020 <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/barroso_UJ31885" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eckert-Mauchly Award</a>, an honor given jointly by IEEE and the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association for Computer Machinery</a>.</p><p>He was a Fellow of the ACM and the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.</p><p>He served on the board of <a href="https://www.rainforesttrust.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rainforest Trust</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting tropical lands and conserving threatened wildlife. Just weeks before he died, Barroso organized and led a weeklong trip to Brazil’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pantanal</a> wetlands.</p><p>Read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-visionary-designer-behind-googles-warehousescale-data-centers" target="_self"><em>The Institute’s</em> 2020 profile</a> of him to learn more about his career journey.</p><p><strong>Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao</strong></p><p>Former director of the Indian Statistical Institute </p><p>Honorary member, 102; died 23 August</p><p>Rao was onetime director of the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indian Statistical Institute</a>, in Kolkata. The pioneering mathematician and statistician spent more than four decades at the organization, where he discovered two seminal estimators: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cramér–Rao bound</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rao–Blackwell theorem</a>. The two estimators—rules for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data—provided the basis for much of modern statistics.</p><p>For his discoveries, Rao received the 2023 <a href="https://statprize.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Prize in Statistics</a>. The award is presented every two years to an individual or team for “major achievements using statistics to advance science, technology, and human welfare.” </p><p>Rao began his career in 1943 as a technical apprentice at the Indian Statistical Institute. He was promoted the following year to superintending statistician. Two years later, he published a paper in the <a href="https://www.calmathsociety.co.in/cmsPublications.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society</em></a>, demonstrating two fundamental statistical concepts still heavily used in the field today. The Cramér-Rao bound helps statisticians determine the quality of any estimation method. The Rao-Blackwell theorem provides a means for optimizing estimates. </p><p>Rao’s work formed the basis of information geometry, an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics.</p><p>Rao was a professor at the ISI’s research and training school before being promoted to director in 1964—a position he held for 12 years.</p><p>He moved to the United States in the 1980s to join the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a> as a professor of mathematics and statistics. He left Pittsburgh eight years later to teach at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a> in State College, where in 2001 he became director of its multivariate analysis center. Multivariate statistics are data analysis procedures that simultaneously consider more than two variables.</p><p>After nine years at Penn State he moved to New York, where he was a research professor at the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Buffalo</a> until shortly before he died.</p><p>Rao authored more than 14 books and 400 journal articles during his career. He received several awards for his lifetime contributions, including 38 honorary doctoral degrees from universities in 19 countries.</p><p>In 2010 he was honored with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Science_Award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Science Award</a>, the highest honor given by the government of India in the scientific sector. He received the 2002 U.S. <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/od/honorary-awards/national-medal-of-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Medal of Science</a>, the country’s highest award for lifetime achievement in scientific research.</p><p>He was nominated in 2013 for a <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-peace-prizes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his contributions to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-642-04898-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science</a>.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>



<ul>
<li>We expanded our Sparse Fine-Tuning research results to include Llama 2. The results include 60% sparsity with INT8 quantization and no drop in accuracy.</li>



<li>DeepSparse now supports accelerated inference of sparse-quantized Llama 2 models, with inference speeds 6-8x faster over the baseline at 60-80% sparsity.</li>



<li>We used some interesting algorithmic techniques in order to quantize Llama 2 weights and activations. We hardened the implementation and packaged them in SparseML for enterprise ML engineers to use.</li>
</ul>



<p>This year has been an exceptionally exciting year for open-source large language models (LLMs). Just 11 months ago proprietary models, like GPT-3, were the only reasonable choice for companies to build generative AI applications. Now, there is a thriving ecosystem of high-quality open-source models, like Meta’s Llama family. In February, Meta released the LLaMA models, proving it is possible to train a high-quality open-source LLM and share the recipe on how to do it. Later in the year, Meta released Llama 2, an improved version trained on twice as much data and licensed for commercial use, which made Llama 2 the top choice for enterprises building GenAI applications.</p>



<p>Neural Magic’s mission is to enable enterprises to deploy deep learning models, like Llama 2, performantly on standard CPU infrastructure. In our recent research paper collaboration with the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06927" title="">Sparse Fine-Tuning for Inference Acceleration of Large Language Models</a>,” we showed that combining pruning and quantization with Neural Magic's <a href="https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse" title="">DeepSparse</a>, a sparsity-aware inference runtime, can accelerate LLM inference on CPUs with no drop in accuracy. This <a href="https://neuralmagic.com/blog/sparse-finetuning-for-accelerating-large-language-models-with-deepsparse/" title="">blog</a> summarizes detailed insights on the sparse fine-tuning approach, which focuses on MosaicML’s MPT architecture.</p>



<p>Today, we are excited to announce that we now support Llama 2 in DeepSparse and have extended our Sparse Fine-Tuning research to <a href="https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?architectures=llama2&amp;datasets=gsm8k&amp;subArchitectures=7b&amp;task=text_generation&amp;ungrouped=true&amp;sort=Latency%3Aasc" title="">Llama 2 7B</a>. Yet again, we are able to demonstrate the applicability of our software-acceleration approach to leading model architectures.</p>

<h2>Recap: What is Sparse Fine-Tuning?</h2>



<p>Training a task-specific LLM consists of two steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, the model is trained on a very large corpus of text, to create a general model. This first step is called “pre-training.”</li>



<li>Second, the pre-trained model is then adapted for a specific downstream use case by continuing training with a much smaller, high-quality, curated dataset. This second step is called “fine-tuning”.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our paper with ISTA demonstrates that by applying model compression algorithms like pruning (which removes parameters from the network) and quantization (which converts parameters from high precision FP32 to low precision INT8) <strong><em>during the fine-tuning process</em>, </strong>we can create a highly compressed version of the model without losing accuracy. The compressed models can then be deployed with Neural Magic's DeepSparse, an inference runtime optimized to accelerate sparse-quantized models, to speed up inference by 7x over the unoptimized baseline, and to unlock CPUs as a deployment target for LLMs.</p>

<h2>Llama 2 Sparse Fine-Tuning Results</h2>



<p>Similar to the MPT setup, we focused on the GSM8k dataset, which consists of diverse grade school math questions. This task is very challenging for LLMs, and the Llama 2 7B base model achieves 0% zero-shot accuracy without any fine-tuning. By fine-tuning for two epochs on the training split of GSM (just ~7k examples), we dramatically improve the test set accuracy to 35.5%.</p>

<p>After fine-tuning, we apply <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00774">SparseGPT</a> to prune the model and continue training (with model distillation) to recover accuracy. After converging, we apply one-shot quantization to convert both the weights and activations of the model to INT8 from FP32. At the 60% sparse INT8 optimization level, we achieve the full accuracy of the unoptimized model.</p>

<p>The resulting sparse-quantized models can be accelerated with <a href="https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse">DeepSparse</a>. Running on AMD’s latest Zen 4 Genoa cores (on an AWS c7a.4xlarge instance), DeepSparse accelerates the sparse-quantized Llama models to 6-8x faster over the dense FP32 baseline.</p>

<h2>Technical Deep Dive: Quantizing Llama 2</h2>

Most quantization methods for LLMs (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323">GPTQ</a>) focus on weight-only quantization. However, since the activations remain at FP16 or FP32, the weights are up-converted at inference time to compute at floating-point precision, meaning inference performance only benefits from reduced data movement (i.e., there is no compute savings; only data movement savings). Minimizing data movement is meaningful for batch 1 inference performance since batch 1 inference is memory-bound, but becomes less valuable for server scenarios where batching can be utilized and the workload becomes more compute-bound.</p></div>



<p>At Neural Magic, we focus on quantizing <span>both the weights and activations</span>, so we can compress the model and accelerate inference by reducing data movement and compute requirements. However, one of the challenges with quantizing Llama 2 activations (and LLMs in general) is that activations can be tricky due to the presence of outliers in certain layers of the network. To get a quantized value from a floating point number, we use the function <code>x_quant = round(x / scale + zero_point)</code>. When outliers are present, the quantization scale must stretch to include them. For example, if a layer has values mostly between -1 and 1, but a few outliers near -10 or 10, the quantization scale must accommodate these extreme values. Because the quantization function becomes less sensitive to variations within the normal range, small yet crucial differences in common values are not accurately captured.</p>



<p>The Neural Magic research team has developed a strong default strategy for quantizing activations for Llama 2 that overcomes these outlier issues. This strategy has been codified in “recipes” available in Neural Magic’s SparseZoo, to make it easy for enterprises to leverage our research to quantize their Llama 2 models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two pieces to the strategy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Selective Quantization</strong>: One approach to dealing with outliers is to perform “selective quantization,” where we choose not to quantize the most problematic layers (keeping these layers at FP32 while the rest of the network is at INT8). The optimal criterion for selective quantization is to quantize one layer at a time, measuring the difference in accuracy. This combinatorial process, however, is very time-consuming and our team has developed a much faster heuristic that quickly identifies the most sensitive layers without much experimentation. The&nbsp;graph below shows the top 10 layers of Llama 2 7B sorted by the highest range of activations (the difference between the min and max value of the input) for&nbsp;each layer. The largest layer has a range that is almost 4000x larger than the 10th largest one! Clearly, we will need to treat these layers differently when we develop our quantization recipes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Smoothing Approaches:</strong> In addition to selective quantization, the research community has developed several techniques to deal with outliers in the weights and activations of LLMs, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03078">SpQR</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15987">Logarithmic Activation Equalization (LAE)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438">SmoothQuant</a>, which offer methodologies for smoothing, adjusting, or extracting the distribution of outliers in weights and activations, to reduce their impact. By applying these algorithms in concert with selective quantization, we can improve the accuracy recovery at various levels of sparsity, as indicated by the graph below, which shows SmoothQuant and LAE consistently outperforming regular quantization approaches across all sparsity levels.</li>
</ul>

It gives us a ton of new tools we can use to create sophisticated and fluid layouts.</p><p>It's also <em>surprisingly complex.</em> It took me quite a while to truly become comfortable with CSS Grid!</p><p>In this tutorial, I'm going to share the biggest 💡 lightbulb moments I've had in my own journey with CSS Grid. You'll learn the fundamentals of this layout mode, and see how to do some pretty cool stuff with it. ✨</p><div id="mental-model"><h2><a name="mental-model-1" id="mental-model-1" href="#mental-model-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Mental model</h2></div><p>CSS is comprised of several different <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/">layout algorithms</a>, each designed for different types of user interfaces. The default layout algorithm, Flow layout, is designed for digital documents. Table layout is designed for tabular data. Flexbox is designed for distributing items along a single axis.</p><p>CSS Grid is the latest and greatest layout algorithm. It's <em>incredibly</em> powerful: we can use it to build complex layouts that fluidly adapt based on a number of constraints.</p><p>The most unusual part of CSS Grid, in my opinion, is that the grid <em>structure</em>, the rows and columns, are defined <strong>purely in CSS:</strong></p><!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><!--/$--><p>With CSS Grid, a single DOM node is sub-divided into rows and columns. In this tutorial, we're highlighting the rows/columns with dashed lines, but in reality, they're invisible.</p><p><em>This is super weird!</em> In every other layout mode, the only way to create compartments like this is by adding more DOM nodes. In Table layout, for example, each row is created with a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, and each cell within that row using <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>:</p><pre></pre><p>Unlike Table layout, CSS Grid lets us manage the layout entirely from within CSS. We can slice up the container however we wish, creating compartments that our grid children can use as anchors.</p><p>We opt in to the Grid layout mode with the <code>display</code> property:</p><pre></pre><p>By default, CSS Grid uses a single column, and will create rows as needed, based on the number of children. This is known as an <em>implicit grid</em>, since we aren't explicitly defining any structure.</p><p>Here's how this works:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template><!--/$--><p>Implicit grids are dynamic; rows will be added and removed based on the number of children. Each child gets its own row.</p><p>By default, the height of the grid parent is determined by its children. It grows and shrinks dynamically. Interestingly, this isn't even a “CSS Grid” thing; the grid <em>parent</em> is still using Flow layout, and block elements in Flow layout grow vertically to contain their content. Only the <em>children</em> are arranged using Grid layout.</p><p>But what if we give the grid a fixed height? In that case, the total surface area is divided into equally-sized rows:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template><!--/$--><div id="grid-construction"><h2><a name="grid-construction-3" id="grid-construction-3" href="#grid-construction-3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Grid Construction</h2></div><p>By default, CSS Grid will create a single-column layout. We can specify columns using the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>By passing two values to <code>grid-template-columns</code> — <code>25%</code> and <code>75%</code> — I'm telling the CSS Grid algorithm to slice the element up into two columns.</p><p>Columns can be defined using any valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length-percentage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS <!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->length-percentage<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> value</a>, including pixels, rems, viewport units, and so on. Additionally, we also gain access to a new unit, the <code>fr</code> unit:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p><code>fr</code> stands for “fraction”. In this example, we're saying that the first column should consume 1 unit of space, while the second column consumes 3 units of space. That means there are 4 total units of space, and this becomes the denominator. The first column eats up ¼ of the available space, while the second column consumes ¾.</p><p>The <code>fr</code> unit brings Flexbox-style flexibility to CSS Grid. Percentages and <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> values create hard constraints, while <code>fr</code> columns are free to grow and shrink as required, to contain their contents.</p><p><strong>Try shrinking this container to see the difference:</strong></p><!--$?--><template id="B:3"></template><!--/$--><p>In this scenario, our first column has a cuddly ghost that has been given an explicit width of 55px. But what if the column is too small to contain it?</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Percentage-based columns are rigid, and so our ghost image will <em>overflow</em>, spilling out of the column.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>fr</code>-based columns are flexible, and so the column won't shrink below its minimum content size, even if that means breaking the proportions.</p></li></ul><p>To be more precise: the <code>fr</code> unit distributes <em>extra</em> space. First, column widths will be calculated based on their contents. If there's any leftover space, it'll be distributed based on the <code>fr</code> values. This is very similar to <code>flex-grow</code>, as discussed in my <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/">Interactive Guide to Flexbox</a>.</p><p>In general, this flexibility is a good thing. Percentages are too strict.</p><p>We can see a perfect example of this with <code>gap</code>. <code>gap</code> is a magical CSS property that adds a fixed amount of space between all of the columns and rows within our grid.</p><p>Check out what happens when we toggle between percentages and fractions:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:4"></template><!--/$--><p>Notice how the contents spill outside the grid parent when using percentage-based columns? This happens because percentages are calculated using the <em>total</em> grid area. The two columns consume 100% of the parent's content area, and they aren't allowed to shrink.

Our grid gains a second row. The grid algorithm wants to ensure that every child has its own grid cell. It’ll spawn new rows as-needed to fulfill this goal.

The syntax for this uses a slash to delineate start and end:</p><pre></pre><p>At first glance, this looks like a fraction, ¼. In CSS, though, the slash character is not used for division, it's used to separate groups of values. In this case, it allows us to set the start and end columns in a single declaration.</p><p>It's essentially a shorthand for this:</p><pre></pre><p><strong>There's a sneaky gotcha here:</strong> The numbers we're providing are based on the column <em>lines</em>, not the column indexes.</p><p>It'll be easiest to understand this gotcha with a diagram:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template><!--/$--><p>Confusingly, a 4-column grid actually has <em>5</em> column lines.

But then, we have this curious declaration:</p><pre></pre><p><strong>Here's how this works:</strong> We're drawing out the grid we want to create, almost as if we were making <span>ASCII art<span>?</span></span>. Each line represents a row, and each word is a name we're giving to a particular slice of the grid. See how it sorta looks like the grid, visually?</p><p>Then, instead of assigning a child with <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code>, we assign it with <code>grid-area</code>!</p><p>When we want a particular area to span multiple rows or columns, we can repeat the name of that area in our template. In this example, the “sidebar” area spans both rows, and so we write <code>sidebar</code> for both cells in the first column.</p><p><strong>Should we use areas, or rows/columns?</strong> When building explicit layouts like this, I really like using areas. It allows me to give semantic meaning to my grid assignments, instead of using inscrutable row/column numbers. That said, areas work best when the grid has a fixed number of rows and columns. <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> can be useful for implicit grids.</p><div id="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users"><h3><a name="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8" id="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8" href="#being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Being mindful of keyboard users</h3></div><p>There's a big gotcha when it comes to grid assignments: <strong>tab order will still be based on <em>DOM position,</em> not grid position.</strong></p><p>It'll be easier to explain with an example. In this playground, I've set up a group of buttons, and arranged them with CSS Grid:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In the “RESULT” pane, the buttons appear to be in order. By reading from left to right, and from top to bottom, we go from one to six.</p><p><strong>If you're using a device with a keyboard, try to tab through these buttons.</strong> You can do this by clicking the first button in the top left (“One”), and then pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the buttons one at a time.</p><p>You should see something like this:</p><p>The focus outline jumps around the page without rhyme or reason, from the user's perspective. This happens because the buttons are being focused based on the order they appear in the DOM.</p><p>To fix this, we should re-order the grid children in the DOM so that they match the visual order, so that I can tab through from left to right, and from top to bottom.<span></span></p><p>In all the examples we've seen so far, our columns and rows stretch to fill the entire grid container. This doesn't need to be the case, however!</p><p>For example, let's suppose we define two columns that are each 90px wide. As long as the grid parent is larger than 180px, there will be some dead space at the end:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:b"></template><!--/$--><p>We can control the distribution of the columns using the <code>justify-content</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:c"></template><!--/$--><p>If you're familiar with the Flexbox layout algorithm, this probably feels pretty familiar. CSS Grid builds on the alignment properties first introduced with Flexbox, taking them even further.</p><p><strong>The big difference is that we're aligning the <em>columns</em>, not the items themselves.</strong> Essentially, <code>justify-content</code> lets us arrange the compartments of our grid, distributing them across the grid however we wish.</p><p>If we want to align the items themselves <em>within</em> their columns, we can use the <code>justify-items</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:d"></template><!--/$--><p>When we plop a DOM node into a grid parent, the default behaviour is for it to stretch across that entire column, just like how a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in Flow layout will stretch horizontally to fill its container. With <code>justify-items</code>, however, we can tweak that behaviour.</p><p>This is useful because it allows us to break free from the rigid symmetry of columns. When we set <code>justify-items</code> to something other than <code>stretch</code>, the children will shrink down to their default width, as determined by their contents. As a result, items in the same column can be different widths.</p><p>We can even control the alignment of a <em>specific</em> grid child using the <code>justify-self</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:e"></template><!--/$--><p>Unlike <code>justify-items</code>, which is set on the grid parent and controls the alignment of <em>all</em> grid children, <code>justify-self</code> is set on the child. We can think of <code>justify-items</code> as a way to set a default value for <code>justify-self</code> on all grid children.</p><div id="aligning-rows"><h3><a name="aligning-rows-10" id="aligning-rows-10" href="#aligning-rows-10"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Aligning rows</h3></div><p>So far, we've been talking about how to align stuff in the <em>horizontal</em> direction.

<p>As Lisa Simpson once memorably remarked, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrLIx1YgC3M">I can see the music</a>.”</p>
<p>Pretty much anyone can these days.</p>
<p>Just switch on your <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/see-visual-effects-itns2947/windows#:~:text=Use%20the%20iTunes%20visualizer%20to,shows%20the%20videos%20by%20default.">device’s audio visualizer</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the case in the 1940s, when psychologist <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Cecil+A+Stokes">Cecil A. Stokes</a> used chemistry and polarized light to invent soothing abstract music videos, a sort of cinematic <a href="https://www.audiocipher.com/post/synesthesia-music">synesthesia</a> experiment such as can be seen above, in his only known surviving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroratone">Auroratone</a>.</p>


<p>(The name was suggested by Stokes’ acquaintance, geologist, Arctic explorer and Catholic priest, <a href="https://www.marywood.edu/about/history/historical-archives/records-management-archives/exhibitions-articles/rev-bernard-r-hubbard">Bernard R. Hubbard</a>, who found the result reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html">Aurora Borealis</a>.)</p>
<p>The trippy visuals may strike you as a bit of an odd fit with <a href="https://bingcrosby.com/">Bing Crosby</a>‘s cover of the sentimental crowdpleaser “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Promise_Me">Oh Promise Me</a>,” but traumatized WWII vets felt differently.</p>
<p>Army psychologists Herbert E. Rubin and Elias Katz’s research showed that Auroratone films had a therapeutic effect on their patients, including deep relaxation and emotional release.</p>
<p>The music surely contributed to this positive outcome. Other Auroratone films featured “Moonlight Sonata,” “Clair de Lune,” and an organ solo of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-SbWVE2umU">I Dream of Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair</a>.”</p>

Rubin and Katz <a href="https://0-www-jstor-org.library.nysoclib.org/stable/2785512?searchText=auroratone&amp;searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?Query=auroratone&amp;ab_segments=0/basic_search_gsv2/control&amp;refreqid=fastly-default:28f25c1d60eb2f012764909680cb31f6&amp;seq=2">reported</a> that patients reliably wept during Auroratones set to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoMyNo5ccR0">“The Lost Chord</a>,” “Ave Maria,” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VW7-GQUjyY">Home on the Range</a>” – another Crosby number.</p>
<p>In fact, Crosby, always a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/bing-crosby-bing-crosbys-innovations-in-technology/3584/">champion of technology</a>, contributed recordings for a full third of the fifteen known Auroratones free of charge and footed the bill for overseas shipping so the films could be shown to soldiers on active duty and medical leave.</p>

<p>Technophile Crosby was well positioned to understand Stokes’ <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2292172A/en?q=A63J17/00&amp;inventor=Cecil+A+Stokes">patented process and apparatus for producing musical rhythm in color</a> – <em>aka</em> Auroratones – but those of us with a shakier grasp of STEM will appreciate light artist John Sonderegger’s explanation of the process, as quoted in filmmaker and media conservator <a href="http://walterforsberg.com/?section=about">Walter Forsberg</a>’s history of Auroratones for <em><a href="https://incite-online.net/forsberg4.html">INCITE Journal of Experimental Media</a></em>:</p>
<p><span><i>[Stokes’] procedure was to cut a tape recorded melody into short segments and splice the resulting pieces into tape loops. The audio signal from the first loop was sent to a radio transmitter. The radio waves from the radio transmitter were confined to a tube and focused up through a glass slide on which he had placed a chemical mixture. The radio waves would interact with the solution and trigger the formation of the crystals. In this way each slide would develop a shape interpretive of the loop of music it had been exposed to. Each loop, in sequence, would be converted to a slide. Eventually a set of slides would be completed that was the natural interpretation of the complete musical melody.</i></span></p>
<p>Vets suffering from PTSD were not the only ones to embrace these unlikely experimental films.</p>
<p>Patients diagnosed with other mental disorders, youthful offenders, individuals plagued by chronic migraines, and developmentally delayed elementary schoolers also benefited from Auroratones’ soothing effects.</p>
<p>The general public got a taste of the films in department store screenings hyped as “the nearest thing to the Aurora Borealis ever shown”, where the soporific effect of the color patterns were touted as having been created “by MOTHER NATURE HERSELF.”</p>
<p>Auroratones were also shown in church by canny Christian leaders eager to deploy any bells and whistles that might hold a modern flock’s attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/about-us">Guggenheim Museum</a>‘s brass was vastly less impressed by the Auroratone Foundation of America’s attempts to enlist their support for this “new technique using non-objective art and musical compositions as a means of stimulating the human emotions in a manner so as to be of value to neuro-psychiatrists and psychologists, as well as to teachers and students of both objective and non-objective art.”</p>
<p>Co-founder <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/history/hilla-rebay">Hilla Rebay</a>, an abstract artist herself, wrote a letter in which she advised Stokes to “learn what is decoration, accident, intellectual confusion, pattern, symmetry… in art there is conceived law only –never an accident.”</p>
<p>A plan for projecting Auroratones in maternity wards to “do away with the pains of child-birth” appears to have been a similar non-starter.</p>
<p>While only one Auroratone is known to have survived – and <a href="https://incite-online.net/forsberg4.html">its discovery</a> by Robert Martens, curator of&nbsp;<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL63D7CF4C8827457A&amp;si=T6VcAXXWE6TX3yyb">Grandpa’s Picture Party</a>, is a fascinating tale unto itself – you can try cobbling together a 21st-century DIY approximation by plugging any of the below tunes into your preferred music playing software and turning on the visualizer:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Did you know that Unix systems have a binary whose name is a single symbol?</p><p>Go and look for it. Run <code>ls /bin/?</code> and behold:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ls /bin/?
/bin/[
</code></pre><p>Uh huh. <code>[</code>? The square bracket? That’s a program?!</p><p>But wait, it gets more interesting:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ls -li /bin/[ /bin/test
834 -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/[
834 -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/test
</code></pre><p>The two names, <code>[</code> and <code>test</code>, point to the same binary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But why? What are these?</p><p>The <code>test</code> program is what you use in the shell to evaluate an expression. You can use this to compare strings, compare numbers, and to check various conditions on files. If you have written a shell script—any shell script really—you certainly have used either of these variants.</p><p>The way this works is simple: the <code>test</code> program takes a bunch of arguments, evaluates the expression represented by them, and returns 0 if the expression is true or 1 if it is false. This then lets you do things like:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if test a = b; then
    echo "The two strings were the same! Oops!"
fi
</code></pre><p>So why do we have two names for this helper tool? I haven’t been able to find the definitive answer, but my guess is simply: because the above “looks ugly”, and the “obvious” solution to make it look nicer is to introduce <code>[</code> as a command. With it, you can express the same logic from above as:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if [ a = b ]; then
    echo "The two strings were the same! Oops!"
fi
</code></pre><p>Yup. Exact same code as above. The only difference here is that the <code>test</code> binary checks its <code>argv[0]</code> to see if it’s invoked as <code>test</code> or as <code>[</code>. If the invocation happens to use the latter, then the program ensures that the last argument is the matching <code>]</code> to keep things balanced.</p><p>With that, you can deduce that you don’t even need the conditional statement to use either of these commands and see what’s going on:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ test a = a; echo $?
0
$ test a = b; echo $?
1
$ [ a = a ]; echo $?
0
$ [ a = b ]; echo $?
1
</code></pre><p>That’s right. The <code>if</code> statement we used in the previous examples just takes <em>a command</em> as its argument and runs it to get its exit code. (And with this, you can “guess” that <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are… yup, yup… also helper binaries.)</p><p>To make things more confusing, though, pay attention to the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ /bin/test a b
test: a: unexpected operator
$ test a b
dash: 2: test: a: unexpected operator
</code></pre><p>Why did we get different outputs there? Well… as it so happens, <code>test</code> and <code>[</code> appear <em>a lot</em> in shell scripts. Invoking them as separate binaries would be very inefficient, so the vast majority of the shells implement these commands as built-ins <em>too</em>. You may get different behavior depending on whether you run the external binary or the builtin, which means you easily get different behavior across different shells. (And that’s true for many other things like the innocent-looking <code>echo</code>.)</p><hr><p>So what about <code>[[</code>? This is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html#index-_005b_005b">a Bash extension</a> and replaces the use of <code>[</code>. The key difference, however, is that <code>[[</code> is <em>guaranteed</em> to be a builtin and therefore it can change, and it does change, the fundamental rules of the language within the expression it evaluates. To illustrate this, let’s look at an example with globs:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ touch long-name
$ [ long* = long-name ] &amp;&amp; echo match
match
$ [[ long* = long-name ]] &amp;&amp; echo match
</code></pre><p>The first command shown here is an invocation of the <code>[</code> tool, which may or may not be a builtin. No matter what, all arguments are subject to the regular shell expansion rules, so <code>long*</code> is matched against the directory contents, is then expanded to <code>long-name</code>, and thus the test succeeds. But, in contrast, <code>[[</code> produces a different result because it treats the <code>long*</code> as a literal string, so all this is doing is comparing <code>long*</code> against <code>long-name</code> verbatim, and therefore failing.</p><p>What should you use, then? If you are writing a portable shell script (please do), then stick to <code>[</code>. You can also use <code>test</code>, but I don’t think that’s too common. But if you know your script is going to be Bash-specific anyway, you are probably better served by using <code>[[</code> unconditionally and consistently, as it provides a lot of nice features (like regular expression matches via <code>=~</code>).</p><hr><p>And now for the final lolz. I’ve said above that these are the commands you use to evaluate expressions… but the shell <em>also</em> has expressions of its own via the <code>!</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, and <code>||</code> operators—all of which work on command exit statuses. That is:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ grep ^hello$ /usr/share/dict/words &amp;&amp; grep ^bye$ /usr/share/dict/words
hello
bye
$ echo $?
0
$ grep ^tyop$ /usr/share/dict/words &amp;&amp; grep ^bye$ /usr/share/dict/words
$ echo $?
1
</code></pre><p>Which means… that you can combine <code>test</code> expressions and shell expressions in one invocation:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if [ a = b ] || grep -q ^hello$ /usr/share/dict/words; then
  echo "test failed and grep succeeded"
fi
</code></pre><p>You pick whether to be amused or horrified. I don’t know how exactly my coworker reacted when I hinted at this during a recent code review I did for them.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

 </article><p>“Our aim was to highlight that, in a few minutes, you can create a data set that is not supported by real original data, and it is also opposite or in the other direction compared to the evidence that are available,” says study co-author Giuseppe Giannaccare, an eye surgeon at the University of Cagliari in Italy.</p><p>The ability of AI to fabricate convincing data adds to concern among researchers and journal editors about research integrity. “It was one thing that generative AI could be used to generate texts that would not be detectable using plagiarism software, but the capacity to create fake but realistic data sets is a next level of worry,” says Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and independent research-integrity consultant in San Francisco, California. “It will make it very easy for any researcher or group of researchers to create fake measurements on non-existent patients, fake answers to questionnaires or to generate a large data set on animal experiments.”</p><p>The authors describe the results as a “seemingly authentic database”. But when examined by specialists, the data failed authenticity checks, and contained telltale signs of having been fabricated.</p><h2>Surgery comparison</h2><p>The authors asked GPT-4 ADA to create a data set concerning people with an eye condition called keratoconus, which causes thinning of the cornea and can lead to impaired focus and poor vision. For 15–20% of people with the disease, treatment involves a corneal transplant, performed using one of two procedures.</p><p>The first method, penetrating keratoplasty (PK), involves surgically removing all the damaged layers of the cornea and replacing them with healthy tissue from a donor. The second procedure, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), replaces only the front layer of the cornea, leaving the innermost layer intact.</p><article data-label="Related">

To do that, they asked it to show a statistical difference in an imaging test that assesses the cornea’s shape and detects irregularities, as well as a difference in how well the trial participants could see before and after the procedures.</p><p>The AI-generated data included 160 male and 140 female participants and indicated that those who underwent DALK scored better in both vision and the imaging test did than those who had PK, a finding that is at odds with what genuine clinical trials show. In a 2010 report of a trial with 77 participants, the outcomes of DALK were similar to those of PK for up to 2 years after the surgery<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>“It seems like it’s quite easy to create data sets that are at least superficially plausible. So, to an untrained eye, this certainly looks like a real data set,” says Jack Wilkinson, a biostatistician at the University of Manchester, UK.</p><p>Wilkinson, who has an interest in methods to detect inauthentic data, has examined several data sets generated by earlier versions of the large language model, which he says lacked convincing elements when scrutinized, because they struggled to capture realistic relationships between variables.</p><h2>Closer scrutiny</h2><p>At the request of <i>Nature</i>’s news team, Wilkinson and his colleague Zewen Lu assessed the fake data set using a screening protocol designed to check for authenticity.</p><p>This revealed a mismatch in many ‘participants’ between designated sex and the sex that would typically be expected from their name. Furthermore, no correlation was found between preoperative and postoperative measures of vision capacity and the eye-imaging test. Wilkinson and Lu also inspected the distribution of numbers in some of the columns in the data set to check for non-random patterns. The eye-imaging values passed this test, but some of the participants’ age values clustered in a way that would be extremely unusual in a genuine data set: there was a disproportionate number of participants whose age values ended with 7 or 8.</p><article data-label="Related">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Tesla prepares to deliver its first Cybertrucks to customers, a new report paints a grisly picture of the Texas factory where the truck is being built, including a casting machine explosion and a robot allegedly goring a worker. </p><p><em>The Information</em> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-teslas-giant-texas-factory-injuries-and-safety-lapses-mount">reported some of the gruesome incidents</a> that have occurred at the Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, where one out of every 21 workers were reportedly hurt in 2022. The data is derived from the required injury reports Tesla submits to OSHA. </p><p>One incident in 2021 involved an engineer who approached a supposed shutdown robot arm but got clawed and pinned to the wall by the machine performing its programmed motions. A witness said the engineer bled from his back and arms, and after someone hit the emergency stop button, the engineer pulled himself out and fell into a chute, leaving a trail of blood.</p><p>An injury report submitted to Travis County, Texas, by Tesla reportedly has a robot-related incident but does not clearly match the one from witness accounts. The reported one does not state the person missed any time from work. In unrelated incidents in August 2022, a worker’s ankle got caught under a cart, which put them out of work for 127 days. Days later, another worker suffered a head injury which put them out for 85 days.</p><p>Other injury reports were more recent. At least one worker was concussed after getting launched back from an explosion in the metal casting area around New Year’s 2023. The blast was allegedly caused by water inadvertently mixing into the molten aluminum press machine. A witness who saw surveillance video said the explosion sent a ball of fire and smoke into the air, damaged the die, and curled up a door that seals the chamber. It’s not clear if Tesla reported this to OSHA, which reportedly didn't have an inspection for this incident.</p><p>Another worker claims the molding machine also didn’t correctly seal and often spat out molten metal. When a worker presented a solution to fix the issue, they were reprimanded that shutting it down would slow production output.</p><p>In June, contractors installing metal grating for elevated walkways in the factory fell to the ground due to a lack of protective equipment. Some of the metal walkway fell on top of them, leaving them with fractures and a punctured lung. OSHA inspected this incident and fined the contractors. </p><p>It’s not the only time things fell from above: <em>The Information </em>reports incidents of air conditioning ducts, steel beams, and other building materials crashing to the ground near autoworkers.</p><p>Tesla’s Fremont factory in California also has a torrid history with worker injuries.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="how-do-i-become-a-graphics-programmer-a-small-guide-from-the-amd-game-engineering-team" role="main" data-id="3cfd864" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Every now and then we get asked what a beginner-friendly website is for learning graphics programming. We’d love to recommend GPUOpen of course, but the truth is, the main target audience for GPUOpen is intermediate or advanced graphics programmers. For someone who just started to dive into the world of graphics, there are surely other websites more suitable for them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, there is no one right way to get into graphics. It mostly depends on potential pre-existing knowledge, how you like to learn, personal preference, available hardware, etc. Hence, this guide is more a collection of websites that we think are useful for beginners, and a small discussion weighing the pro and cons of the websites and what they teach.</p>
<section id="which-programming-language">
<h2 id="which-programming-language?">Which programming language?</h2>
<p>When we talk to students about our job, one of the questions we almost always get is: which programming language do you use? The short answer is: C++.</p>
<p>The long answer is … well, if you do graphics, you write code for the host CPU, usually in C++, but you also write code for the GPU in what the industry has come to call shader code, typically in a high-level shading language such as HLSL or GLSL. You also need a way to tie them both together, asking the CPU to ask the GPU to do something useful using shaders and the other data and metadata needed to make that happen. That’s where the graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) come in, which you drive usually as host CPU code written in C++.</p>
<p>So the more controversial question is: which graphics API you should start with. And we don’t have an answer for you, just a bunch of different opinions and considerations. We’ll narrow in on the common graphics APIs used to write most PC games or 3D applications at this point, ignoring things like games consoles with their (mostly) proprietary APIs.</p>
<p>There are different graphics APIs out there, but in 2023 it essentially boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenGL® / Microsoft® DirectX®11 / WebGL™</li>
<li>Vulkan® / Microsoft® DirectX®12 / Metal / WebGPU</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenGL®, DirectX®11 and WebGL™ are legacy APIs. They’re based on a historical approach to programming the GPU. Nonetheless, they are still widely used across academia and industry since they’re simpler from the programmer’s perspective and thus easier to learn. Their simplicity comes at a cost however, since the underlying implementation of those APIs in any driver and runtime code became more complex over time, causing host-side bottlenecks and very complicated drivers for GPU vendors to write.</p>
<p>In 2014-2016 things changed with the introduction of Metal (2014), DirectX®12 and Vulkan® (both 2016), which all took a lower-level and more explicit approach to programming the GPU. They put a higher burden on the programmer being more clear and explicit about what they’d like the GPU to do, giving the programmer more control.</p>
<p>It effectively moves more of the traditional view of what a GPU driver is into the application. The tradeoff is more control for the programmer, and thus the opportunity for more performance and efficiency in what happens on the GPU.</p>
<p>Knowing how the GPU programming paradigm shifted, the decision about what API to pick might seem easy. If you want to learn graphics programming on Windows®, which is the primary target for PC games, then the instinct will be to pick Vulkan® or DirectX®12, as this is the new stuff, right?</p>
<p>However, not only are the legacy APIs still widely used, they are much simpler and easier to learn. So it might make sense to first learn the legacy APIs, and then later on move to the modern graphics APIs. Instead of immediately climbing Mount Everest, you first train at your local hill.</p>
<p>A simple comparison is how many lines of code are needed to draw a triangle on the screen, which is the “Hello, World!” equivalent in graphics programming. While OpenGL® or DirectX®11 need about 10 lines of code to get to the first triangle, Vulkan® and DirectX®12 require at least an order of magnitude more.</p>
<p>So, on the other hand, you can also say that Vulkan® and DirectX®12 require you to do more hand-holding for the GPU. You need 100 lines of code, but each line is clearer about what eventually happens on the GPU. While with OpenGL® and DirectX®11 a lot of the things are hidden and taken care for you, it’s easier for it to appear like a magic box and the few things you need to do might not make much sense in terms of understanding how the GPU works.</p>
<p>Vulkan® and DirectX®12 force you to deal with and gain that lower-level knowledge and understand early on, while OpenGL® and DirectX®11 act on a higher level and let you focus with the more productive aspects of graphics programming.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the AMD Game Engineering team have to say about whether one should start with a legacy API or with a modern API:</p>
<p><em>“Starting by learning graphics programming with DX12® or Vulkan® as a teenager would be rough.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We’re a long way away from the ol’ glVertex hello triangle.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Shame that OpenGL® is no longer super relevant tho.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I think it (OpenGL®) is still good enough to learn the basics imho.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I started out with DX10® which I think is not bad, but a lot of kids struggle with it if they are not proficient in C++.”</em> – DX10® is the predecessor of DX11® and outdated – don’t learn DX10®!</p>
<p><em>“But there are many things in play. Learning the theory of rasterisation and ray tracing. Learning the traditional pipeline. Learning how to feed a GPU work etc… I don’t know in what order they should be learnt but I’m usually all-in C++ (there is no need to start in another language) so I should probably say just start with Vulkan®… but I’m not really sure to be honest.”</em></p>
<p>And of course, there is also the possibility to learn graphics programming without OpenGL® and DirectX®11 or Vulkan® and DirectX®12. We mentioned WebGL™ and WebGPU in the broad classes of graphics APIs that are available, both of which operate in the web browser domain which is a whole software ecosystem (and arguably a full operating system) in its own right.</p>
<p>You can do real-time graphics in the web browser via WebGL™ or WebGPU too! One advantage is that you don’t need C++ for the web (but can technically still use it to drive graphics in the browser with something like WebAssembly). In the browser, the dominant programming language of JavaScript is fine!</p>
<p>Or, if you want to focus on higher-level stuff first and not bother with the lower-level details of a graphics API and hand-authoring shaders, maybe even a game engine is the right choice for you. <a href="https://gpuopen.com/unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine</a> is the biggest for PC games, with <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity®</a> the most common alternative, along with a boatload of smaller, simpler, open-source engines like <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot</a> to play with too.</p>
<p>Here’s some opinions from our AMD Game Engineering team:</p>
<p><em>“IMHO, getting newcomers to start out with DX12® or Vulkan® is rough, but maybe doable. I would say that starting out with WebGL™ just to understand the graphics pipeline is probably the easiest (and you focus on the right stuff).”</em></p>
<p><em>“WebGPU might give you concepts closer to modern graphics APIs without the extra low-level details.”</em></p>
<p><em>“WebGPU will probably get a lot better but right now I think you can expect a lot of kinks once you start writing nontrivial code. Still, it was very cool and it worked surprisingly well. I sincerely hope it gets better, but what exists right now is super promising. For prototyping stuff this is crazy good. And yeah, it would probably make a good API for learning / teaching too.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know a few schools use Unity® for their first rendering courses which probably isn’t half bad, but there is a risk those students will never understand why they need to learn the lower-level stuff…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Starting with an explicit API is fine if you have a good handle on the modern graphics pipeline and the high-level of how GPU hardware implements it, or you want to pick up that GPU hardware understanding along the way. Otherwise start with something simpler to get going and then look at an explicit API later if you need or want to.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Personally, I feel that maybe acclimating to shaders through a popular game engine before moving to writing custom host code might be a good way of getting into it. It’s very hard to learn if you don’t have a clear view of what you want to achieve in a graphics API, otherwise you might just quit when you get to the triangle.”</em></p>

<li><a href="https://learnopengl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learnopengl.com</a> – “LearnOpenGL is the best beginner site I can think of that shows you how to actually do this stuff with a real API in C++.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.scratchapixel.com</a> – “What makes scratch a pixel nice is that you don’t end up with a ton of code. You focus on learning how RT works for example.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.udemy.com/</a> – “Udemy is a good place for courses to get people started.”</li>
<li><a href="https://rastertek.com/tutindex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://rastertek.com/tutindex.html</a> – OpenGL®/DirectX®11 tutorial</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io</a> : Ray Tracing in one weekend – “I like hands on approaches to learning, so Ray Tracing in a weekend is nice if you can code a little.”</li>
<li><a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/</a> – “A trip through the graphics pipeline from the GPU’s perspective. It’s from 2011, so it pre-dates the explicit APIs, but lots of the hardware and software concepts still apply.”</li>
<li><a href="https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/</a> – “There is a “learn webgpu” site in the same style as learnopengl, but very wip.”</li>
<li><a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app</a> – “I haven’t fully read it, but this is decent.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a> – “Shadertoy lets you write shaders without the need to deal with any graphics API. I would never have gotten interested in graphics enough to want to learn OpenGL® if I hadn’t started out in something simpler (for me it was just direct painting on a java canvas).”</li>
<li><a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://vulkan-tutorial.com/</a> – “I also feel it’s important for people not to be afraid of copy-paste especially with Vulkan® and DirectX®.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So what now? If you haven’t made a decision by now about what programming language and graphics API ecosystem to start with, don’t worry. You can try out different approaches and then stick with the one that works for you best.</p>
<p>We’d also be very happy to hear your thoughts! How did you learn graphics programming? What can you recommend to fellow graphics programmers just getting started? We would love to add your contributions to this blog post to make it an even more useful starting point.</p>

              <h4>Which teams <i>won't</i> benefit from Call Stacking?</h4>
              <ol>
                  <li>If your team does not incur revenue loss from downtime attributed to code regressions,
                    Call Stacking isn't needed.</li>
                  <li>
                    If your team is senior lead and has a good grasp on your large code base, you probably don't need Call Stacking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If your SLAs are loosely enforced and engineers are allowed to respond to incidents on their time, the price of
                    Call Stacking isn't worth it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If your application is an internal one and usage is timeboxed between business hours, all bugs are resolved in upcoming sprint cycles,
                    you won't need Call Stacking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If code complexity has not been an issue and production incidents have largely been trivial or isolated,
                    Call Stacking isn't needed.
                  </li>
                </ol>

              <h4>Will the production level tracing impact my performance metrics?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes. It's impossible to capture the full context of an app - method calls, parameter values, return values, without adding some additional overhead per request.

              <h4>How is tracing enabled and disabled?</h4>
              <p>
                  Tracing is added and then removed on a per request basis using an <code>prepend_around_action</code> in your <code>ApplicationController</code>.
                </p>

                <p><code>
                    class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;include Callstacking::Rails::Helpers::InstrumentHelper<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;prepend_around_action :callstacking_setup
                  </code>
                </p>

                <p>HTTP request times may have to be extended depending on the size of the codebase.</p>
                  <p>Once the instrumented methods are removed for the request, all subsequent requests for that server will be called with the original implementation.</p>
                  <p>Only the instrumented requests will incur the overhead of tracing.</p>
