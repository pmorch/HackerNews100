Been loving this project, this website for years. The sounds, the stories, the community. &lt;3 This particular "noise" for me is a real lifesaver. It always helps me with (tension-) headaches. Thank you so much.</span></p><p>

I couldn't think for two days straight; it was so bad and kept getting worse. This quieted the constant chatter and noise down to a mild hum.</span></p><p>

Neural Hack sounds so funny, that one time I laughed so hard at night listening to this, that my mom came upstairs and whooped me. All jokes aside, if anyone has trouble managing their tinnitus, then this is the one for you! 8.7 out of 10.</span></p><p>

Stéphane and Steve have created a nearly magical tinnitus solution. Whenever my tinnitus starts acting up, I pop on these settings for a few minutes, and when I take the headphones off... Silence. Absolute silence. I have no idea how this works, but it's genius!</span></p><p>

You wouldn't think such an exotic, high-pitched, and beepy sound generator would be calming, but when you find the right spot and let it go for a few minutes, then pause the audio, it's so much quieter—not gone, but still a relief compared to before. Even just letting it play and noticing your ear ringing contributing to the music instead of being a distracting annoyance is calming.</span></p><p>

Once properly calibrated, after a few minutes of listening, it helps reduce the perception of tinnitus—and even after removing the headphones, the sensation almost seems to vanish. myNoise is a great tool to use when needed.</span></p><p>

I've been using this neuromodulator on a daily basis for many weeks and this is by far the best help I could ever find to release my tinnitus 24/7 head drill. It doesn’t get rid of it completely, but it tones it down massively - just leaves a soft background hum that lets you live your life. Honestly, it feels like magic. No idea how it works this well. Huge thanks to the creators - you guys rock!</span></p><p>

I use the tinnitus neuromodulator when things get rough. It doesn't just mask the tinnitus, it transports me into a space where I can focus again. For a while, I feel clear. What gets me is this: when I take off the headphones, the tinnitus is gone. Not reduced—gone. Then, slowly, it creeps back. That minute of silence is everything.</span></p><p>

If you have basic audio knowledge, this website is a much better option than commercial tinnitus therapies based on overpriced hearing aids. Thanks to this website, I’m reconfiguring my relationship with tinnitus in a much more organic and spontaneous way.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I love the strangeness of this generator. It sounds really fascinating and seems to help me focus. By the way, I guess this is what an aural representation (a strange tone poem?) of a ketamine trip would sound like :D</span></p><p>

This doesn't so much drown out my tinnitus as blend with it, but it's still a fantastic change from the usual! I've had tinnitus my entire life, and as a kid, I never understood why people liked silence so much since it was so loud! Weird alien beep-boops is the new silence.</span></p><p>

This is crazy, it actually works. Thankfully my tinnitus is not constant, but very annoying when it's present. It actually makes it disappear, even after I've closed the sound generator, for quite some time.</span></p><p>

This is the first time in a while that I've been able to just sit and be content without that infernal ringing hijacking my thoughts. Definitely not something I'd be able to listen to for longer periods, but it's amazing how well my tinnitus just blends in and becomes a part of the experience.</span></p><p>

I was using this to help me focus because I have really bad tinnitus, and it makes it so hard to focus! As soon as it started playing, it drowned out my tinnitus and made me able to think way better!

Against all odds, it apparently works. I have tested it a couple of times today by playing the audio on headphones for 5-10 minutes, and there is a significant relief in my tinnitus for shorter periods of time. I will try running the audio for a longer time to see if I can have a longer-lasting effect.</span></p><p>

I needed this sound every day in 2022 when I was having major mental issues and anxiety, which created a feedback loop for my tinnitus (tinnitus increased anxiety, anxiety increased tinnitus.) with the help of this sound generator I managed to reduce my anxiety and tinnitus to the point where it's nothing more than a passing thought every now and then, that I come back here to get rid of.

I don't have tinnitus; I have MS. Certain sounds have started to bother me a lot, even waking me up. I can't sleep for longer than 2 hours some nights. It's not fun. I usually have to turn some white noise on loud enough to mask the sounds but that hurts sometimes, and is hard to sleep with. This sound however is pretty weird. I don't have to crank it up loud, and it works. I'm actually sleepy.</span></p><p>

My form of tinnitus is masked by many of your noise generators. I prefer natural sounds, but this did remarkably let me forget the constant, piercing ring in my right ear rather than just mask it.</span></p><p>

Dude thank you, I've had musical ear syndrome since I was a kid, and a life of listening to heavy metal and rock and roll at high volume on headphones and going to shows has made tinnitus worse. Now I get musical ear syndrome all the time, it can be distracting as well a bit concerning but this soundscape cured it instantly. Thank you! This saved me from a mental breakdown.</span></p><p>

Relief from tinnitus, for the first time in years!  I can't handle listening to it for much longer than twenty minutes (because I'm bored by generated noise after a while), but when I take my headphones off, my tinnitus is so massively diminished I can hardly believe it.

Suffering from tinitus for many years, this is helping me tremendously. My tinitus sounds resemble the high pitch noise you get from old TV sets. Listening to this setting for just a couple of minutes brings me relief for up to an hour afterwards, sometimes even longer because I forget to concentrate on it. Just amazing!</span></p><p>

I started using MyNoise's ocean sounds years ago to help me sleep due to severe misophonia, it blocks the noise from the street and I don't need to sleep with earplugs or headphones anymore. Recently a covid infection damaged my ear nerves and caused intolerable sound sensitivity accompanied of tinnitus and hyperacusis. If it wasn't for these sound generators I would have lost my sanity.</span></p><p>

I have autism and difficulty focusing. I've never liked listening to things like this generator, but for the first time I quite like this! I love the way that I can hear the sounds travel from each side of my brain. It's pretty awesome to listen to when you've got synesthesia. </span></p><p>

For a few years I've used myNoise to block out the sounds of busy city life and to get to sleep.
More recently in late 2022 I contracted covid which unfortunately left me with hearing damage and significant tinnitus in one ear.
The only thing that has been able to relieve the horrible ringing so far are some of the neuromodulator tracks here, and for that I am grateful. </span></p><p>

As an autistic person with pretty debilitating hyperacusis (I pretty much can't function without ear plugs) the onset of some mild tinnitus was distressing to say the least. White noise is usually the recommended go-to for tinnitus but it's painful to me. High pitched fuzzy or low constant humming sounds are literal agony. This is varied enough to ease and accommodate both issues. Miraculous!</span></p><p>

Well it just works. I get into music stuff lately after a long session of mixing, mastering or drum take your ear just start to deafen sometimes with headaches. I used this as a tool to "reset" my ear by listening to it at a barely heard loudness and turning it down even more after I can hear it clearly, just rinse and repeat!</span></p><p>

Just wanted to add my comment to say that yes, in my experience (loud ~9kHz in left ear) this is more than a placebo effect re: tinnitus relief. HOW exciting. Cheers! Breathing deeper and slower too.</span></p><p>

When getting the automation right, it takes ages for piano or guitar sounds to get repetitive, sounds of nature and human voices (radio chatter etc) sound completely natural, organic, and at home here without feeling repetitive at all. And sci-fi sounds, and drone like instruments can pretty much do their thing forever and play well off of each other while they do it.</span></p><p>

Suffering since 11 months from tinnitus. I destressed my life, did different types of therapy but nothing came close to the effect this neural symphony has. It actually gives me seconds or minutes as close to silence as I wasn't for 11 months. THANK YOU!</span></p><p>

Amazing, always helps when silence is a bit too noisy. My uncle who has bad tinnitus commented that it helped even after a few minutes without headphones... Amazingly helpful in this era of being used to hearing fans, fridges, pinging tech and then ringing noises when it's supposed to be quiet.</span></p><p>

I developed a high pitched whistling tinnitus  10 years ago when I was 14 and I thought I lost the sound of silence forever, but listening to this for 20 minutes on shuffle makes my tinnitus disappear completely!

I can't say if this will work for everyone's tinnitus, but it does for mine! After listening for 20 minutes or so, my tinnitus is much reduced and stays that way for up to two hours afterward. I am interested to see if there is any long-term effect from using this generator daily.</span></p><p>

Thank you so much! My tinnitus began after a concussion 6 years ago. I have no hearing problems, just issues caused by my brain. I found your website, turned on my computer speakers &amp; immediately my neck &amp; shoulders relaxed as the tinnitus decreased significantly. Initially I listened for about 1/2 hour &amp; when I walked away it was much lower volume than before. Best for me on the default setting.</span></p><p>

This generator is completely amazing, if for no other reason it detracts attention away from my tinnitus, which is now chronic for years and years. The Neural Symphony functions are easy to use and adjust. I have discovered that for me I drop all pulses and warble to zero, and then use the automated slider animation. Wide range of high frequencies, ever changing. Bliss.</span></p><p>

This is certainly promising, and I did notice an affect pretty quickly. However, ACRN should be tunable to the frequency of of your tinnitus. The Steve Sequence is kind of all over the place, and mostly tuned lower than my own (6kHz, and pretty common). Would be nice to see something where the frequency can be tuned, and maybe change the waveform (sine, sawtooth, fuzz, etc). [Note from editor : try the Tape Speed Control feature]</span></p><p>

Holy Crap! I was experiencing on of my usual Tinnitus spikes (and you know how annoying this can be). I tried this custom noise take from one of the testimonials and my tinnitus just went down from 10 to 4! Thanks!</span></p><p>

Brilliant site I could spend hours here.  I have tinnitus  a different high pitched frequency in each ear.Slightly spacey space-station? A little dreamy but a little sedating as well and kills the tinnitus.</span></p><p>

This is a very strange soundscape, but in an enjoyable way. I personally do not have tinnitus, but I think this is still fun to listen to. You just have to find the right sliders to make sense of this one, hahaha.</span></p><p>

I have Tinnitus. I also have perfect hearing and from years of being a musician one would anticipate hearing loss. None. I am also a Director for an electric and water utility and I have a lot of concentrating work (reports, analysis, etc). When My Tinnitus is in full flight, it is impossible to concentrate. This is a life saver. I can work all day and feel the calming of the tones. Amazing! </span></p><p>

May be my imagination, listened for about 15 min,  then when taking my speakers away from my ears, my pulsating tinnitus was quieter.</span></p><p>

First I found myself heaving a relieved sigh, and then started crying when I found the custom noise that masked my tinnitus. It has been five months of unrelenting high pitched whine, yet I refused to allow myself a pity party, concluding, "It is what it is; suck it up, girl, there is little you can do." But to have this respite is a great blessing. Thank you! </span></p><p>

Kudos to all who put this wonderful chaotic neural symphony together!  As a tinnitus sufferer I found the sounds had a very soothing effect on me.   I will be using this selection again for sure.</span></p><p>

I noticed listening to  music with different frequencies helps soften my Tinnitus. I have a constant 24/7 14,000hz sawtooth sound in my head for the two years.  This program is amazing!   </span></p><p>

Not for me. Sounds more like star wars. What really helps me is a soft noise plug. Stick in the ear canal and when the sounds starts bothering switch to other ear. This is the only thing that helps me.</span></p><p>

I have been listening to music with MY Tinnitus frequency embedded into the music. I understand this works for some, not me. After over 6 months, no change. The past two days have been horrible... I am a musician and although I have been playing rock music for over 40 years, I have no hearing damage at all... 20 minutes on customizing my own pattern, I can actually concentrate on my work!</span></p><p>

Thank you so much for this incredible site!  I'm quite happy to make a donation to you out of simple gratitude for all your efforts putting these sounds online for us, and keeping the site (and your iOS app, myNoise) working.  I've experienced persistent tinnitus for a couple decades, now, with almost no respite except after one minutes or so of "Neural Hack" or "Neural Symphony!" Amazing!</span></p><p>

I'm a fairly new comer to myNoise having serendipitously discovered the site only three weeks ago and a very long sufferer of Tinnitus. I have only discovered this particular generator only moments ago and jumped right in to listen. Ironically, I've been having episodes all week so I'll absolutely write the results of my experience after one week and again at two weeks. Today is 8 June '16 </span></p><p>

Something very weird happens if I listen to this for 15-20 minutes: in addition to the tinnitus masking, my mind actually "quiets down". The parts of my brain that would normally be wandering seem to be occupied chasing down the bells and warbles, allowing the rest of my attention to focus entirely on the task at hand. Awesome brain hack.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I find myself enjoying the bizarre dreamlike discord that using the animation sliders can provide. It's a rather lovely chiming chaos... that is weirdly calming to me. I'm not sure what that says :)</span></p><p>

I guess I am fortunate that I only get ringing in my ears when I take certain prescription medications  I can't believe my luck that a few hours after I took the medication I started to get the ringing and came here to find some rain sounds and discovered this new generator.  What a gift this is!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Luxury goods are special: they are scarce and expensive, and they earn us status with some folks because it shows that we paid more than we needed to.</p>



<p>Luxury isn’t about quality, suitability or performance. Luxury isn’t a more accurate watch or a faster processor. Luxury is a marker that we can afford to do something others might consider wasteful.</p>



<p>A Birkin bag is a luxury good, and so is reading an entire non-fiction book, listening to a public radio broadcast or attending a concert when we could stay at home and listen for free.</p>



<p>By ‘wasting’ our attention on nuance, narrative, experiences and everything except the checkbox takeaway, we’re sending a message to ourselves and others. A message about allocating our time to something beyond optimized performance or survival.</p>



<p>If you’ve signed up to offer an attention-luxury good, you undermine it when you also try to make it quick and convenient.</p>

<p dir="auto">Flowistry is a tool that analyzes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(information_theory)" rel="nofollow">information flow</a> of Rust programs. Flowistry understands whether it's possible for one piece of code to affect another. Flowistry integrates into the IDE to provide a "focus mode" which helps you focus on the code that's related to your current task.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, this GIF shows the focus mode when reading a function that unions two sets together:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062086-4d58a149-86c8-4a48-a6aa-a07cf027641c.gif"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062086-4d58a149-86c8-4a48-a6aa-a07cf027641c.gif" height="180" data-animated-image=""></a>
 </kbd>
 <p dir="auto">When the user clicks a given variable or expression, Flowistry fades out all code that <em>does not influence</em> that code, and <em>is not influenced by</em> that code. For example, <code>orig_len</code> is not influenced by the for-loop, while <code>set.len()</code> is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry can be helpful when you're reading a function with a lot of code. For example, this GIF shows a real function in the Rust compiler. If you want to understand the role of a specific argument to the function, then Flowistry can filter out most of the code as irrelevant:</p>

<p dir="auto">Flowistry is available as a VSCode plugin. You can install Flowistry from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wcrichton.flowistry" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Marketplace</a> or the <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/wcrichton/flowistry" rel="nofollow">Open VSX Registry</a>. In VSCode:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Go to the Extensions pane by clicking this button in the left margin: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/134039225-68d11dce-be71-4f33-8057-569346ef26bc.png"><img width="30" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 9 30 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/134039225-68d11dce-be71-4f33-8057-569346ef26bc.png"></a></li>
<li>Search for "Flowistry" and then click "Install".</li>
<li>Open a Rust workspace and wait for the tool to finish installing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note on platform support:</strong> Flowistry does not yet support NixOS. Flowistry cannot provide pre-built binaries for ARM targets like M1 Macs, so Flowistry must be installed from scratch on these targets (this is done for you, but will take a few more minutes than usual).</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can install it from source:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install flowistry binaries

<p dir="auto">If you are interested in the underlying analysis, you can use the <code>flowistry</code> crate published to crates.io: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/flowistry" rel="nofollow">https://crates.io/crates/flowistry</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The documentation is published here: <a href="https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry/" rel="nofollow">https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry/</a></p>

<p dir="auto">Note: Docs.rs doesn't support documentation for crates that use <code>#![feature(rustc_private)]</code> so we have to host it ourselves.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the latest Flowistry has a <a href="https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/rustc_plugin/tree/main#maximum-supported-rust-version"><strong>Maximum</strong> Supported Rust Version</a> of <strong>Rust 1.73</strong>.
Flowistry is not guaranteed to work with features implemented after 1.73.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Startup</h3><a id="user-content-startup" aria-label="Permalink: Startup" href="#startup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have installed Flowistry, open a Rust workspace in VSCode. You should see this icon in the bottom toolbar:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155207447-4efb34b1-5e3d-4416-89aa-a0f7cd334ca4.png"><img width="121" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 46 12 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155207447-4efb34b1-5e3d-4416-89aa-a0f7cd334ca4.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <p dir="auto">Flowistry starts up by type-checking your codebase. This may take a few minutes if you have many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Flowistry type-checking results are cached in the <code>target/flowistry</code> directory. If you delete this folder, Flowistry will have to recompute types. Also for a large codebase this directory may take up a fair amount of disk space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entering focus mode</h3><a id="user-content-entering-focus-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Entering focus mode" href="#entering-focus-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once Flowistry has booted up, the loading icon will disappear. Then you can enter focus mode by running the "Toggle focus mode" command. By default the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+R Ctrl+A (⌘+R ⌘+A on Mac), or you can use the Flowistry context menu:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208449-83fceff7-86fe-4fe8-9fca-62552e6b0b43.png"><img width="450" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 52 39 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208449-83fceff7-86fe-4fe8-9fca-62552e6b0b43.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <p dir="auto">In focus mode, Flowistry will automatically compute the information flow within a given function once you put your cursor there. Once Flowistry has finished analysis, the status bar will look like this:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208955-1f47ab0c-f3ae-4028-82b3-6f67e6fc0db7.png"><img width="120" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 55 36 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208955-1f47ab0c-f3ae-4028-82b3-6f67e6fc0db7.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Flowistry can be a bit slow for larger functions. It may take up to 15 seconds to finish the analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry infers what you want to focus on based on your cursor. So if you click on a variable, you should see the focus region of that variable. Flowistry will highlight the focused code in gray, and then fade out code outside the focus region. For example, because the user's cursor is on <code>view_projection</code>, that variable is highlighted in gray, and its focus region is shown.</p>

<p dir="auto">Sometimes you want to keep the focus region where it is, and click on other code to inspect it without changing focus. For this purpose, Flowistry has a concept of a "mark". Once you have selected code to focus on, you can run the "Set mark" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+S / ⌘+R ⌘+S). Then a mark is set at your cursor's current position, and the focus will stay there until you run the "Unset mark" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+D / ⌘+R ⌘+D).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Selecting the focus region</h3><a id="user-content-selecting-the-focus-region" aria-label="Permalink: Selecting the focus region" href="#selecting-the-focus-region"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to modify all the code in the focus region, e.g. to comment it out or copy it, then you can run the "Select focused region" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+T / ⌘+R ⌘+T). This will add the entire focus region into your editor's selection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations" href="#limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry is an active research project into the applications of information flow analysis for Rust. It is continually evolving as we experiment with analysis techniques and interaction paradigms. So it's not quite as polished or efficient as tools like Rust Analyzer, but we hope you can still find it useful! Nevertheless, there are a number of important limitations you should understand when using Flowistry to avoid being surprised.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have questions or issues, please <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/issues">file a Github issue</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/XkcpkQn2Ah" rel="nofollow">join our Discord</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/wcrichton" rel="nofollow">DM @wcrichton on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Flowistry does not completely handle interior mutability</h3><a id="user-content-flowistry-does-not-completely-handle-interior-mutability" aria-label="Permalink: Flowistry does not completely handle interior mutability" href="#flowistry-does-not-completely-handle-interior-mutability"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When your code has references, Flowistry needs to understand what that reference points-to. Flowistry uses Rust's lifetime information to determine points-to information. However, data structures that use interior mutability such as <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> explicitly <em>do not</em> share lifetimes between pointers to the same data. For example, in this snippet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
let y = x.clone();
*x.lock().unwrap() = 1;
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, y.lock().unwrap());"><pre><span>let</span> x = <span>Arc</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Mutex</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> y = x<span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span>x<span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> = <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> y<span>.</span>lock<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>unwrap<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry <em>can</em> determine that <code>*x.lock().unwrap() = 1</code> is a mutation to <code>x</code>, but it <em>can not</em> determine that it is a mutation to <code>y</code>. So if you focus on <code>y</code>, the assignment to 1 would be faded out, even though it is relevant to the value of <code>y</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are researching methods to overcome this limitation, but for now just be aware that this is the main case where Flowistry is known to provide an incorrect answer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A focus region may include more code than you expect</h3><a id="user-content-a-focus-region-may-include-more-code-than-you-expect" aria-label="Permalink: A focus region may include more code than you expect" href="#a-focus-region-may-include-more-code-than-you-expect"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry's analysis tries to include all code that <em>could</em> have an influence on a focal point. This analysis makes a number of assumptions for both practical and fundamental reasons. For example, in this snippet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = v.get_mut(0);
println!(&quot;{:?} {}&quot;, v, x);"><pre><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> v = <span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> x = v<span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?} {}"</span><span>,</span> v<span>,</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you focus on <code>v</code> on line 3, it will include <code>v.get_mut(0)</code> as an operation that could have modified <code>v</code>. The reason is that Flowistry does not actually analyze the bodies of called functions, but rather approximates based on their type signatures. Because <code>get_mut</code> takes <code>&amp;mut self</code> as input, it assumes that the vector <em>could</em> be modified.</p>
<p dir="auto">In general, you should use focus mode as a pruning tool. If code is faded out, then you don't have to read it (minus the limitation mentioned above!). If it isn't faded out, then it might be relevant to your task.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Not all code is selectable</h3><a id="user-content-not-all-code-is-selectable" aria-label="Permalink: Not all code is selectable" href="#not-all-code-is-selectable"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry works by analyzing the <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html" rel="nofollow">MIR</a> graph for a given function using the Rust compiler's API. Then the IDE extension lifts the analysis results from the MIR level back to the source level. However, a lot of information about the program is lost in the journey from source code to MIR.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if the source contains an expression <code>foo.whomp.bar().baz()</code>, it's possible that a temporary variable is only generated for the expression <code>foo.whomp.bar()</code>. So if the user selects <code>foo</code>, Flowistry may not be able to determine that this corresponds to the MIR <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html" rel="nofollow">place</a> that represents <code>foo</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is why the IDE extension highlights the focused code in gray, so you can understand what your cursor's selection actually maps to.</p>

<p dir="auto">Flowistry analyzes a single function at a time. If a function contains other functions, e.g. <code>fn</code> definitions, or closures, or implicitly via async, then Flowistry will only show you focus regions within the smallest function body containing your cursor. This is usually well defined for function definitions and closures, but may be confusing for async since that depends on how rustc decides to carve up your async function.</p>

<p dir="auto">If rustup fails, especially with an error like "could not rename downloaded file", this is probably because Flowistry is running rustup concurrently with another tool (like rust-analyzer). Until <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/988" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/rust-lang/rustup/issues/988/hovercard">rustup#988</a> is resolved, there is unfortunately no automated way around this.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -c llvm-tools-preview"><pre><code>rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -c llvm-tools-preview
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then go back to VSCode and click "Continue" to let Flowistry continue installing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why isn't Flowistry part of Rust Analyzer?</h3><a id="user-content-why-isnt-flowistry-part-of-rust-analyzer" aria-label="Permalink: Why isn't Flowistry part of Rust Analyzer?" href="#why-isnt-flowistry-part-of-rust-analyzer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rust Analyzer does not support <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html" rel="nofollow">MIR</a> and the borrow checker, which are essential parts of Flowistry's analysis.

<p>ripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,<br>
some minor performance improvements and minor new features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search<br>
tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.<br>
By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip<br>
hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes<br>
a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent<br>
directories.</li>
<li>A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been<br>
fixed.</li>
<li><code>rg -vf file</code>, where <code>file</code> is empty, now matches everything.</li>
<li>The <code>-r/--replace</code> flag now works with <code>--json</code>.</li>
<li>A subset of Jujutsu (<code>jj</code>) repositories are now treated as if they were git<br>
repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect <code>jj</code>'s gitignores.</li>
<li>Globs can now use nested curly braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform support:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aarch64</code> for Windows now has release artifacts.</li>
<li><code>powerpc64</code> no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI<br>
release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to<br>
debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it<br>
back.</li>
<li>ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice<br>
small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary<br>
size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance improvements:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Today, I will be talking about some of the common and high impact SQL anti-patterns I have seen from experience that can make queries and pipelines difficult to maintain, or have slower than expected performance. These issues can compound, causing erosion in trust in data, and slower query development in general.</p><p>When working with larger enterprise software, it is common to have large CASE WHEN statements translating application status codes into plain English. For example, status code 1 could mean the item is out of stock. Now imagine there are hundreds of status codes that need to be categorized after talking to a stakeholder who requested a dashboard to track item statuses in your warehouse.</p><p>Because you need to get this dashboard developed quickly, you decide to place this large CASE WHEN logic only within a view for that specific dashboard. This is an anti-pattern because now other developers will either have to copy and paste your logic or skip it entirely and use the raw status codes. Over time, this creates a huge mess. I know because I have seen it happen.</p><p>When handling large CASE WHEN statements, it is better to create a dimension table or view, ideally sourced from the landed table where the original status column is populated. This way, the logic is accessible and consistent for everyone.</p><p>In SQL server especially, it’s pretty easy to work against the index if you are not careful. </p><p>For example: WHERE UPPER(name) = ‘ABC’</p><p>Instead you should:</p><ul><li><p>query WHERE name = ‘abc’</p></li><li><p>create an indexed UPPER(name) column</p></li></ul><p>This allows the database to leverage indexes properly and prevents unnecessary full table scans.</p><p>When developing views, it is tempting to slap a SELECT * at the very end and call it a day. This is not ideal because:</p><ul><li><p>Schema evolution can break your view, which can have downstream effects</p></li><li><p>You are bringing in unnecessary columns potentially </p></li></ul><p>One of the most common mistakes I’ve seen is developers using SELECT DISTINCT as a quick way to eliminate duplicates that appear after a bad join. It’s an easy fix, but it hides a deeper problem. Usually, the duplicates exist because the join condition is incomplete or the relationship between tables isn’t truly one-to-one. Using DISTINCT might make the results look right temporarily, but it masks the root cause. This becomes a nightmare when someone later builds metrics off the same dataset and gets inconsistent counts. The correct approach is to fix the join logic itself, ensuring each relationship is properly defined before aggregation or reporting.</p><p>In larger data environments, it’s easy to fall into the trap of layering views on top of views. At first, this seems modular and organized. But over time, as more teams build their own transformations on top of existing views, the dependency chain becomes unmanageable. Performance slows down because the database has to expand multiple layers of logic each time, and debugging turns into an archaeological dig through nested queries. The fix is to flatten transformations periodically and materialize heavy logic into clean, well-defined base views or tables.</p><p>Nested subqueries are useful when you need to isolate logic or filter data when starting out on a query, but they can quickly turn into an anti-pattern when overused or deeply nested. I’ve seen queries with three or four layers of subqueries, each one filtering or aggregating the results of the previous one, totaling over 5000 lines of code. As you can imagine, this makes debugging queries pretty difficult. You should consider using CTEs instead, as they tend to be more readable.</p><p>SQL is one of those languages that looks simple on the surface but grows in complexity as teams and systems scale. Most anti-patterns don’t start as bad ideas. They come from speed, deadlines, or small shortcuts that accumulate over time. The best teams treat SQL like production code: shared, versioned, reviewed, and optimized. A few minutes spent designing for clarity upfront can save hours of rework and confusion later.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.</p><p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.</p><p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.</p><p>In the 1990s, almost every DOS program you ran had a full-screen Text User Interface (TUI) which sported text-based windows, drop shadows, colors, and mouse support.

However, they were all so similar in how they looked like—80x25 characters didn’t leave much room for uniqueness—and how they worked that the differences didn’t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.</p><p><span>But let’s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1991), which </span><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows" rel="">I previously covered in a recent article</a><span> and is shown above. This editor “worked”, but it was really inconvenient for coding: you needed to exit the editor to compile and run your code, and when you re-ran the editor, you’d have to navigate back to where you were before.</span></p><p><span>“In my house”, we used something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick" rel="">SideKick Plus</a><span> (1984), which wasn’t really a code editor: it was more of a Personal Information Management (PIM) system with a built-in notepad. The cool thing about it, however, was that it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which meant that it loaded in the background and you could bring it up at any time by pressing Ctrl+Alt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SideKick Plus' main screen after pressing Ctrl+Alt to bring it up.

Turbo Pascal 1.0 (1983) shows the beginning of an integrated experience, although it did not feature its iconic TUI yet. QuickBASIC 2.0 (1986) shows more of a “traditional” TUI (the same as </span><code>EDIT.COM</code><span>, because they are the same editor), and MS-DOS 5 came with QBasic, a reduced version of QuickBASIC that didn’t allow compiling to native code but that had the same look.</span></p><p>The crown jewel of IDEs, in my opinion, were the later Borland Turbo series, which included Turbo C++ (1990), Turbo Assembler and Turbo Pascal. These IDEs were language specific, but they had full-screen TUIs and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Here, take a look at what we had.

printf.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s—a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.</p><p><span>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their </span><code>conio.h</code><span> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin </span><code>graphics.h</code><span> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was </span><em>without the Internet</em><span>. There was no option for many to just “look up how things worked” in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.</span></p><p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.</p><p><span>In Linux, almost every program was </span><em>also</em><span> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn’t “the Unix way”. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (</span><code>XF86Setup</code><span>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any “real” coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this didn’t stop me from my quest to </span><em>not</em><span> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the “best” editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being “fire and forget” like the Turbo family of IDEs.</span></p><p><span>Just look at the default Emacs configuration </span><em>today</em><span>, which hasn’t changed much (if at all) since then. It does have windows, but they aren’t decorated. It didn’t have colors (and now barely has), because why? It didn’t use to have mouse support. It </span><em>does</em><span> have a menu bar though, but it is just a gimmick? If you press M-` as the instructions tell you, you face a truly strange interface to navigate the menu—which makes one wonder why they even bothered to waste a full line of screen real state to show a menu bar that does nothing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" width="973" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:973,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A fresh installation of Emacs in the console, with the standard welcome screen in the background and the "menu" open after pressing M-`.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now try giving this to anyone with little coding experience and getting them to create, compile, and debug a program.

In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.</span></p><p><span>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="">LSP</a><span> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were “on hold” for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming </span><a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/" rel="">BSP</a><span> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.</span></p><p>It is fair to ask “Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!”</p><p><span>And it’s a good question. In general, you probably </span><em>don’t</em><span> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn’t give us.</span></p><p><span>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines—even better than VSCode. You can SSH into </span><em>any</em><span> machine with ease and launch the IDE. </span><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html" rel="">Combine it with tmux and you get “full” multitasking.</a><span> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I’ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.</span></p><p><span>The second is that </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">VSCode’s remote extensions are </a><em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">not</a></em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel=""> open source</a><span>, which isn’t a major problem… except for the fact that they don’t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.</span></p><p>And the third is… reduced resource consumption.</p><p>I can’t leave without ranting about “bloat” for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals…), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.</p><p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.</p><p>To get “real” IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it’s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.</p><p><span>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced </span><em>much</em><span> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally… they haven’t changed much. The only major difference that we are </span><em>starting</em><span> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!</span></p><p><span>And that’s all for today. On my side, I’ll happily continue using </span><em>all of</em><span> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Bézier curves are a core building block of text and 2D shapes rendering.
There are several approaches to rendering them, but one especially challenging
problem, both mathematically and technically, is computing the distance to
a Bézier curve. For quadratic curves (one control point), this is fairly
accessible, but for cubic (two control points) we're going to see why it is
so hard.</p>

<p>Having this distance field opens up many rendering possibilities. It's hard, but
it's possible; here is a live proof:</p>

</figure>
<p>In this visualization, I'm borrowing your device resources to compute the
distance to the curve for every single pixel. The yellow points are the control
points of the curve (in white) and the blue zone is a representation of the
distance field.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>All the demos and code in this article are self-contained GLSL fragment
shaders. Most of the code can be found in the article, but feel free to
inspect the source code of any of these WebGL demo for the complete code.
They can be run verbatim using <a href="https://github.com/ubitux/ShaderWorkshop">ShaderWorkshop</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>The basic maths</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.pkh.me/p/33-deconstructing-be%CC%81zier-curves.html">In a previous article</a>, we explained that a Bézier curve
can be expressed as a polynomial. In our case, a cubic polynomial:</p>
<p>
B_3(t) = \textbf{a}t^3 + \textbf{b}t^2 + \textbf{c}t + \textbf{d}
</p>
<p>Where <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong> and <strong>d</strong> are the vector coefficients derived from
the start (<span>P_0</span>), end (<span>P_3</span>), and control points (<span>P_1</span>, <span>P_2</span>) using the
following formulas (you can refer to the previous article for details):</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{a} &amp;= -P_0 + 3(P_1-P_2) + P_3 \\
\textbf{b} &amp;= 3P_0 - 6P_1 + 3P_2 \\
\textbf{c} &amp;= -3P_0 + 3P_1 \\
\textbf{d} &amp;= P_0
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>For a given point <span>p</span> in 2D space, the distance to that Bézier curve can be
expressed as a length between our curve and <span>p</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
d(t) &amp;= ||B_3(t) - \textbf{p}|| \\
     &amp;= ||\textbf{a}t^3 + \textbf{b}t^2 + \textbf{c}t + \textbf{d} - \textbf{p}||
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>Our goal is to find the <span>t</span> value where <span>d(t)</span> is the smallest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/length.xhtml">length</a> formula has an annoying square root, so we start with the distance
squared for simplicity, which we are going to unroll:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
D(t) &amp;= d(t)^2 \\
     &amp;= ||\textbf{a}t^3 + \textbf{b}t^2 + \textbf{c}t + \textbf{d} - \textbf{p}||^2 \\
     &amp;= (a_xt^3 + b_xt^2 + c_xt + d_x - p_x)^2 + (a_yt^3 + b_yt^2 + c_yt + d_y - p_y)^2
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>The derivative of that function will allow us to identify critical points:
that is, points where the distance starts growing or reducing. Said differently,
solving <span>D'(t)=0</span> will identify all the maximums and minimums (we're interested
in the latter) of <span>D(t)</span> (and thus <span>d(t)</span> as well).</p>
<p>It is a bit convoluted in our case but straightforward to compute:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
D'(t) &amp;= 2(3a_xt^2 + 2b_xt + c_x)(a_xt^3 + b_xt^2 + c_xt + d_x - p_x) \\
      &amp;+ 2(3a_yt^2 + 2b_yt + c_y)(a_yt^3 + b_yt^2 + c_yt + d_y - p_y) \\
      &amp;= 6a_x^2t^5 + 10a_xb_xt^4 + (8a_xc_x + 4b_x^2)t^3 + 6(a_xd_x + b_xc_x - a_xp_x)t^2 + (4b_x(d_x-p_x) + 2c_x^2)t + 2c_x(d_x-p_x) \\
      &amp;+ 6a_y^2t^5 + 10a_yb_yt^4 + (8a_yc_y + 4b_y^2)t^3 + 6(a_yd_y + b_yc_y - a_yp_y)t^2 + (4b_y(d_y-p_y) + 2c_y^2)t + 2c_y(d_y-p_y) \\
      &amp;= t^5  6(a_x^2+a_y^2) \\
      &amp;+ t^4  10(a_xb_x+a_yb_y) \\
      &amp;+ t^3  (8(a_xc_x+a_yc_y)+4(b_x^2+b_y^2)) \\
      &amp;+ t^2  6(a_x(d_x-p_x)+a_y(d_y-p_y) + b_xc_x+b_yc_y) \\
      &amp;+ t    (4(b_x(d_x-p_x)+b_y(d_y-p_y)) + 2(c_x^2+c_y^2)) \\
      &amp;+      2(c_x(d_x-p_x)+c_y(d_y-p_y)) \\
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>A polynomial, this time of degree 5, emerges here. For conciseness, we can express <span>D'(t)</span>
polynomial coefficients as a bunch of dot products:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
D'(t) &amp;= t^5 6(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{a}) \\
      &amp;+ t^4 10(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{b}) \\
      &amp;+ t^3 (8(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{c})+4(\textbf{b}\cdot\textbf{b})) \\
      &amp;+ t^2 6(\textbf{a}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p}) + \textbf{b}\cdot\textbf{c}) \\
      &amp;+ t   (4(\textbf{b}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p})) + 2(\textbf{c}\cdot\textbf{c})) \\
      &amp;+     2(\textbf{c}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p})) \\
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>Finally, we notice that solving <span>D'(t)=0</span> is equivalent to solving <span>D'(t)/2 =
0</span>, so we simplify the expression:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
D'(t)/2 &amp;= t^5 3(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{a}) \\
        &amp;+ t^4 5(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{b}) \\
        &amp;+ t^3 (4(\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{c})+2(\textbf{b}\cdot\textbf{b})) \\
        &amp;+ t^2 3(\textbf{a}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p}) + \textbf{b}\cdot\textbf{c}) \\
        &amp;+ t   (2(\textbf{b}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p})) + \textbf{c}\cdot\textbf{c}) \\
        &amp;+     \textbf{c}\cdot(\textbf{d}-\textbf{p}) \\
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>Assuming we are able to solve this equation, we will get at most 5 values of
<em>t</em>, among which we should find the shortest distance from <em>p</em> to the curve.
Since <em>t</em> is bound within 0 and 1 (start and end of the curve), we will also
have to test the distance at these locations.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>We could also compute the 2nd derivative in order to differentiate minimums
from maximums, but simply evaluating the 5(+2) potential <em>t</em> values and
keeping the smallest works just fine.</p>

<p>The red dot in the blue field is a random point in space. The red lines show
which distances are evaluated (at most 5+2) to find the smallest one.</p>
<h3>Translated to GLSL code</h3>
<p>Transposing these formulas into code gives us this base template code:</p>
<pre><code>float bezier_distance(vec2 p, vec2 p0, vec2 p1, vec2 p2, vec2 p3) {
    // Start by testing the distance to the boundary points at t=0 (p0) and t=1 (p3)
    vec2 dp0 = p0 - p,
         dp3 = p3 - p;
    float dist = min(dot(dp0, dp0), dot(dp3, dp3));

    // Bezier cubic points to polynomial coefficients
    vec2 a = -p0 + 3.0*(p1 - p2) + p3,
         b = 3.0 * (p0 - 2.0*p1 + p2),
         c = 3.0 * (p1 - p0),
         d = p0;

    // Solve D'(t)=0 where D(t) is the distance squared
    vec2 dmp = d - p;
    float da = 3.0 * dot(a, a),
          db = 5.0 * dot(a, b),
          dc = 4.0 * dot(a, c) + 2.0 * dot(b, b),
          dd = 3.0 * (dot(a, dmp) + dot(b, c)),
          de = 2.0 * dot(b, dmp) + dot(c, c),
          df = dot(c, dmp);

    float roots[5];
    int count = root_find5(roots, da, db, dc, dd, de, df);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
        float t = roots[i];
        // Evaluate the distance to our point p and keep the smallest
        vec2 dp = ((a * t + b) * t + c) * t + dmp;
        dist = min(dist, dot(dp, dp));
    }

    // We've been working with the squared distance so far, it's time to get its
    // square root
    return sqrt(dist);
}
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p><code>dot(dp,dp)</code> is a shorthand for the length squared, of course cheaper than
computing <code>length()</code> which contains a square root.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>We assume here the root finder only returns the roots that are within <span>[0,1]</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><code>root_find5()</code> is our 5th degree root finder, that is the function that gives us
all the <span>t</span> (at most 5) which satisfy:</p>
<p>
at^5+bt^4+ct^3+dt^2+et+f = 0
</p>
<p>But before we are able to solve that, we need to study the simpler 2nd degree
polynomial solving:</p>
<p>
at^2+bt+c = 0
</p>
<h2>Solving quadratic polynomial equations</h2>
<p>Diving into the rabbit hole of solving polynomial numerically will lead you
to insanity. But we still have to scratch the surface because superior degree
solvers usually rely on it.</p>
<p>My favorite quadratic root finding formula is the super simple one introduced
by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXO86wKeDY">3Blue1Brown</a>, which involves locating a mid point <span>m</span> from
which you get the 2 surrounding roots <span>r</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
m &amp;= -\frac{b}{2a} \\
r &amp;= m \pm \sqrt{m^2-\frac{c}{a}}
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>In GLSL, a code to cover most common corner cases would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Return true if x is not a NaN nor an infinite
// highp is probably mandatory to force IEEE 754 compliance
bool isfinite(highp float x) { return (floatBitsToUint(x) &amp; 0x7f800000u) != 0x7f800000u; }

// Quadratic: solve ax²+bx+c=0
int root_find2(out float r[5], float a, float b, float c) {
    int count = 0;
    float m = -b / (2.*a);
    float d = m*m - c/a;
    if (!isfinite(m) || !isfinite(d)) { // a is (probably) too small
        // Linear: solve bx+c=0
        float s = -c / b;
        if (isfinite(s))
            r[count++] = s;
        return count;
    }
    if (d &lt; 0.) // no root
        return count;
    if (d == 0.) {
        r[count++] = m; // single root
        return count;
    }
    float z = sqrt(d);
    r[count++] = m - z;
    r[count++] = m + z;
    return count;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not quite as straightforward as the math formula, isn't it?</p>
<p>We cannot know in advance whether the division is going to succeed, so we do
run divisions and only then check if they failed (and assume a reason for the
failing). This is much more reliable than an arbitrary epsilon value. We also
try to avoid duplicated roots.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The roots are automatically sorted because <em>z</em> is always positive.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p><code>isfinite()</code> may not be as reliable because in GLSL "NaNs are not required
to be generated", meaning some edge case may not be supported depending on
the hardware, drivers, and the current weather in Yokohama.</p>
</div>
<p>As much as I like it, this implementation might not be the most
stable numerically (even though I don't have have strong data to back
this claim). Instead, we may prefer the formula from <a href="https://numerical.recipes/">Numerical
Recipes</a>:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
\delta &amp;= b^2-4ac \\
q &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} (b + \mathrm{sign}(b)\sqrt{\delta}) \\
r_0 &amp;= \frac{q}{a} \\
r_1 &amp;= \frac{c}{q}
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>Leading to the following alternative implementation:</p>
<pre><code>int root_find2(out float r[5], float a, float b, float c) {
    int count = 0;
    float d = b*b - 4.*a*c;
    if (d &lt; 0.)
        return count;
    if (d == 0.) {
        float s = -.5 * b / a;
        if (isfinite(s))
            r[count++] = s;
        return count;
    }
    float h = sqrt(d);
    float q = -.5 * (b + (b &gt; 0. ? h : -h));
    float r0 = q/a, r1 = c/q;
    if (isfinite(r0)) r[count++] = r0;
    if (isfinite(r1)) r[count++] = r1;
    return count;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is not perfect at all (especially with the <span>b²-4ac</span> part). There
are actually many other possible implementations, and <a href="https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04116310v1/">this HAL CNRS
paper</a> shows how near impossible it is to make a correct one. It is
an interesting but <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bug/115351364099509082">depressing</a> read, especially since it "only" covers IEEE
754 floats, and we have no such guarantee on GPUs. We also don't have <code>fma()</code> in
WebGL, which greatly limits improvements. For now, it will have to do.</p>
<h2>Solving quintic polynomial equations: attempt 1</h2>
<p>Solving polynomials of degree 5 cannot be solved analytically like quadratics.
And even if they were, we probably wouldn't do it because of numerical
instability. Typically, in my experience, analytical 3rd degree polynomials
solver do not provide reliable results.</p>
<p>The first iterative algorithm I picked was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberth_method">Aberth–Ehrlich method</a>.
Nowadays, more appropriate algorithms exist, but at the time I started messing
up with these problems (several years ago), it was a fairly good contender.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIzCzfMDSzk">This video</a> explores how it works.</p>
<p>The convergence to the roots is quick, and it's overall simple to implement. But
it's not without flaws. The main problem is that it works in complex space. We
can't ignore the complex roots because they all "respond" to each others. And
filtering these roots out at the end implies some unreliable arbitrary threshold
mechanism (we keep the root only when the imaginary part is close to 0).</p>
<p>The initialization process also annoyingly requires you to come up with a guess
at what the roots are, and doesn't provide anything relevant. Aberth-Ehrlich
works by refining these initial roots, similar to a more elaborate Newton
iterations algorithm. Choosing better initial estimates leads to a faster
convergence (meaning less iterations).</p>
<p>The Cauchy bound specifies a space by defining the radius of a disk (complex
numbers are in 2D space) where all the roots of a polynomial should lie within.
We are going to use it for the initial guess, and more specifically its "tight"
version (which unfortunately relies on <code>pow()</code>).</p>
<p>Since Aberth-Ehrlich is a refinement and not just a shrinking process, we define
and use an inner disk that has half the area of Cauchy bound disk. That way,
we're more likely to start with initial guesses spread in the "middle" of the
roots; this is where the √2 comes from in the formula below.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/bezier-distance/cauchy.png" alt="Tight cauchy bound"></p>

int root_find5_aberth(out float roots[5], float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f) {
    // Initial candidates set mid-way of the tight Cauchy bound estimate
    float r = (1.0 + max_5(

         r4 = r * K5_4;

<p>The circle constants are generated with the following script:</p>
<pre><code>import math
import sys

n = int(sys.argv[1])
for k in range(n):
    angle = 2 * math.pi / n
    off = math.pi / (2 * n)

<p>When the main coefficient is too small, we fall back on the 4th degree (and so
on until we reach the analytic quadratic). The 4th and 3rd degree versions of
this function are easy to guess (they're pretty much identical, just removing
one coefficient at each degree).</p>
<p>We're also hardcoding a maximum of 16 iterations here because it's usually
enough. To have an idea of how many iterations are required in practice,
following is a visualization of the heat map of the number of iterations
for every pixel:</p>

  <figcaption>Heat map of the iterations of the Aberth-Ehrlich algorithm</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The big picture and the weaknesses of the algorithm should be pretty obvious
by now. Among all drawbacks of this approach, there are also surprising
pathological cases where the algorithm is not performing well. Fortunately,
there were some progress on the state of the art in recent years.</p>
<h2>Solving quintic polynomial equations: the state of the art</h2>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.cemyuksel.com/research/polynomials/">Cem Yuksel published a new algorithm for polynomial root
solving</a>. Initially I had my reservations because the <a href="https://github.com/cemyuksel/cyCodeBase/">official
implementation</a> had a <a href="https://github.com/cemyuksel/cyCodeBase/issues/20">few shortcomings on some edge
cases</a>, which made me question its reliability. It's also
optimized for CPU computation and is, to my very personal taste, overly complex.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Christoph Peters <a href="https://momentsingraphics.de/GPUPolynomialRoots.html">showed that it was possible on the
GPU</a> by implementing it for very large degrees, and without any
recursion. Inspired by that, I decided to unroll it myself for degree 5.</p>
<p>One core difference with Aberth approach is that it is designed for arbitrary
ranges. In our case this is actually convenient because, due to how Bézier
curves are defined, we are only interested in roots between 0 and 1. We will
need to adjust the Quadratic function to work in this range, as well as keeping
the roots ordered:</p>
<pre><code>     }
     float h = sqrt(d);
     float q = -.5 * (b + (b &gt; 0. ? h : -h));
-    float r0 = q/a, r1 = c/q;
-    if (isfinite(r0)) r[count++] = r0;
-    if (isfinite(r1)) r[count++] = r1;
+    vec2 v = vec2(q/a, c/q);
+    if (v.x &gt; v.y) v.xy = v.yx; // keep them ordered
+    if (isfinite(v.x) &amp;&amp; v.x &gt;= 0. &amp;&amp; v.x &lt;= 1.) r[count++] = v.x;
+    if (isfinite(v.y) &amp;&amp; v.y &gt;= 0. &amp;&amp; v.y &lt;= 1.) r[count++] = v.y;
     return r;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>The core logic of the algorithm relies on a cascade of derivatives for every
degree. Christoph Peters provides an analytic formula to obtain the derivative
for any degree. This is a huge helper when we need to work for an arbitrary
degree, but in our case we can just differentiate manually:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
f_5(x) &amp;= ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f \\
f_4(x) &amp;= 5ax^4+4bx^3+3cx^2+2dx+e \\
f_3(x) &amp;= 20ax^3+12bx^2+6cx+2d \\
f_2(x) &amp;= 60ax^2+24bx+6c
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>Since we're only interested in the roots, similar to what we did to <span>D(t)</span>, we
can simplify some of these expressions:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
f_5(x) &amp;= ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f \\
f_4(x) &amp;= 5ax^4+4bx^3+3cx^2+2dx+e \\
f_3(x) &amp;= 10ax^3+6bx^2+3cx+d \\
f_2(x) &amp;= 10ax^2+4bx+c
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>The purpose of that cascade of derivatives is to cut the curve into monotonic
segments. In practice, the core function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>int root_find5_cy(out float r[5], float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f) {
    float r2[5], r3[5], r4[5];
    int n = root_find2(r2,          10.*a, 4.*b,    c);            // degree 2
    n = cy_find5(r3, r2, n, 0. ,0., 10.*a, 6.*b, 3.*c,   d);       // degree 3
    n = cy_find5(r4, r3, n,     0.,  5.*a, 4.*b, 3.*c, d+d, e);    // degree 4
    n = cy_find5(r,  r4, n,             a,    b,    c,   d, e, f); // degree 5
    reutnr n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could unroll <code>cy_find3</code>, <code>cy_find4</code>, and <code>cy_find5</code>, but to keep the
code simple, the degree 3 to 5 will share the same function, with leading
coefficients set to 0 (hopefully the compiler does its job properly).</p>
<p><code>cy_find5</code> relies on roots found (at most 4) at previous stages to define
intervals of search:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/bezier-distance/root_find5.png" alt="Finding roots at degree 5"></p>
<p>Such an approach has the nice side effect of keeping the roots ordered.</p>
<p>The solver itself is not that complex either:</p>
<pre><code>float poly5(float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f, float t) {
     return ((((a * t + b) * t + c) * t + d) * t + e) * t + f;
}

// Quintic: solve ax⁵+bx⁴+cx³+dx²+ex+f=0
iint cy_find5(out float r[5], float r4[5], int n, float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f) {
    int count = 0;
    vec2 p = vec2(0, poly5(a,b,c,d,e,f, 0.));
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= n; i++) {
        float x = i == n ? 1. : r4[i],
              y = poly5(a,b,c,d,e,f, x);
        if (p.y * y &gt; 0.)
            continue;
        float v = bisect5(a,b,c,d,e,f, vec2(p.x,x), vec2(p.y,y));
        r[count++] = v;
        p = vec2(x, y);
    }
    return count;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The last brick of the algorithm is the Newton bisection, the slowest part:</p>
<pre><code>// Newton bisection
//
// a,b,c,d,e,f: 5th degree polynomial parameters
// t: x-axis boundaries
// v: respectively f(t.x) and f(t.y)
float bisect5(float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f, vec2 t, vec2 v) {
    float x = (t.x+t.y) * .5; // mid point
    float s = v.x &lt; v.y ? 1. : -1.; // sign flip
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++) {
        // Evaluate polynomial (y) and its derivative (q) using Horner's method in one pass
        float y = a*x + b, q = a*x + y;
              y = y*x + c; q = q*x + y;
              y = y*x + d; q = q*x + y;
              y = y*x + e; q = q*x + y;
              y = y*x + f;

        t = s*y &lt; 0. ? vec2(x, t.y) : vec2(t.x, x);
        float next = x - y/q; // Newton iteration
        next = next &gt;= t.x &amp;&amp; next &lt;= t.y ? next : (t.x+t.y) * .5;
        if (abs(next - x) &lt; eps)
            return next;
        x = next;
    }
    return x;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's pretty much it. Looking at its heat map, it has a completely
different look than Aberth:</p>
<figure>
  <canvas width="640" height="360" data-fragment="/frag/bezier-distance/cy-bisect-heatmap.frag"></canvas>
  <figcaption>Heat map of the iterations of Cem Yuksel algorithm</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The number of iterations might be larger but it is much faster (I observed a
factor 3 on my machine), the code is shorter, and actually more reliable.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The scale used to represent the heat map is <em>not</em> the same as the one used
in Aberth, but it is identical with the method presented in the next section.</p>
</div>
<h2>Exploring ITP convergence</h2>
<p>The bisection being the hot loop, it is interesting to ponder how to make
this faster. A while back, <a href="https://levien.com/">Raph Levien</a> hypothesized about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITP_method">ITP
method</a> could perform. Out of curiosity, I gave it a chance. The function
is designed to work like a bisection, claiming to be as performant in the worst
case.</p>
<p>There isn't a lot of code, and the paper provides a pseudo-code. But
implementing it was actually challenging in many ways.</p>
<p>First of all, the authors didn't seem to find relevant to mention that it only
works if <span>f(a)&lt;0&lt;f(b)</span>. If <span>f(a)&gt;0&gt;f(b)</span>, you're pretty much on your own. It
requires just 2 lines of adjustments but figuring out this shortcoming of the
algorithm was particularly unexpected.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/bezier-distance/itp-ok-fail.png" alt="ITP method failing case"></p>
<p>Another bothering aspect concerns the parameters: <span>K_1</span>, <span>K_2</span> and <span>n_0</span>. The
paper proposes those:</p>
<p>
\begin{aligned}
K_1 &amp;= 0.1 \\
K_2 &amp;= 0.98(1+\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})\approx 2.56567 \\
n_0 &amp;= ?
\end{aligned}
</p>
<p>I played with them for a while and couldn't find any set that would make
a real difference, so I ended up with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For performance reasons, reducing <span>K_2</span> to a value of 2 saves a call to
<code>pow()</code>.</li>
<li>For <span>K_1</span>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/itp/refman/itp.html">CRAN</a> seems to suggest <span>\frac{0.2}{b-a}</span> so I went along with it</li>
<li>And for <span>n_0</span>, well 1 or 2 seem to be the usual parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// ITP algorithm (2020) by Oliveira &amp; Takahashi
// "An Enhancement of the Bisection Method Average Performance Preserving Minmax Optimality"
//
// a,b,c,d,e,f: 5th degree polynomial parameters
// t: x-axis boundaries (a and b in the paper)
// v: respectively f(a) and f(b) in the paper (evaluation of the function with t.x and t.y)
float itp5(float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f, vec2 t, vec2 v) {
    float diff = t.y-t.x;

    // K1 and n0 suggested by CRAN
    float K1 = .2 / diff;
    int n0 = 1;

    // The paper has the assumption that f(a)&lt;0&lt;f(b) but we want to
    // support f(a)&gt;0&gt;f(b) too, so we keep a sign flip
    float s = v.x &lt; v.y ? 1. : -1.;

    // Using log(ab)=log(a)+log(b): log2(x/(2ε)) &lt;=&gt; log2(x/ε)-1
    int nh = int(ceil(log2(diff/eps)-1.)); // n_{1/2} (half point)
    int n_max = nh + n0;

    // ε 2^(n_max-k) = ε 2^n_max 2^-k = ε 2^n_max ½^k
    // ½^k is done iteratively in the loop, simplifying the arithmetic
    float q = eps * float(1&lt;&lt;n_max);

    while (diff &gt; eps+eps) {
        // Interpolation
        float xf = (v.y*t.x - v.x*t.y) / (v.y-v.x); // Regula-Falsi

        // Truncation
        float xh = (t.x+t.y) * .5; // x half point
        float sigma = sign(xh - xf);
        float delta = K1*diff*diff; // save a pow() by forcing K2=2
        float xt = delta &lt;= abs(xh - xf) ? xf + sigma*delta : xh; // xt: truncation of xf

        // Projection
        float r = q - diff*.5;
        float x = abs(xt-xh) &lt;= r ? xt : xh-sigma*r;

        // Updating
        float y = poly5(a,b,c,d,e,f, x);
        float side = s*y;
        if      (side &gt; 0.) t.y=x, v.y=y;
        else if (side &lt; 0.) t.x=x, v.x=y;
        else                return x;

        diff = t.y-t.x;
        q *= .5;
    }
    return (t.x+t.y) * .5;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function can be used as a drop'in replacement for <code>bisect5</code>.</p>
<p>I had a lot of expectations about it, but in the end it requires more iterations
than the bisection we implemented. The paper claims to perform at least as good
as a bisection, but our <code>bisect5</code> is driven by the derivatives so it converges
much faster. Here is the heat map with <code>itp5</code> instead of <code>bisect5</code>:</p>

  <figcaption>Heat map of the iterations of Cem Yuksel algorithm with ITP method</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The naive unrolled version of Cem Yuksel paper definitely is, so far, the best
choice for our problem. I have still concerns about how to implement a good
quadratic formula, and I have my reservations about various edge cases. There
is also still room for improvements in the cubic solver (degree 3) because
it's still a special case where analytical formulas exist, but in general this
implementation is satisfying.</p>
<p>The next step is to work with chains of Bézier curves to make up complex shapes
(such as font glyphs). It will lead us to build a <em>signed</em> distance field. This
is not trivial <em>at all</em> and mandates one or several dedicated articles. We will
hopefully study these subjects in the not-so-distant future.</p>

Strix Halo is AMD’s first chiplet APU in the consumer market with AMD using Strix Halo as a bit of a show piece for what both CPU and GPU performance can look like with a sufficiently large APU.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" width="393" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:393,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>AMD’s Strix Halo can be equipped with dual 8 core Zen 5 CCDs for a total of 16 cores that feature the same 512b FPU as the desktop parts. This is a change from the more mainstream and monolithic Strix Point APU which has “double-pumped” 256b FPUs similar to Zen 4 for use with AVX512 code. What is similar to the more mainstream Strix Point is the same 5.1GHz max boost clock which is a 600MHz deficit compared to the desktop flagship Zen 5 CPU, the Ryzen 9 9950X.</p><p>Moving to the 3rd die on a Strix Halo package, a RDNA 3.5 iGPU takes up the majority of the SoC die with 40 compute units, 32MB of Infinity Cache, and a boost clock of up to 2.9GHz placing raw compute capability somewhere between the RX 7600 XT and RX 7700.</p><p>To feed this chip, AMD has equipped Strix Halo with a 256b LPDDR5X-8000 memory bus, which provides up to 256GB/s shared between all of the components. This is slightly lower than the 288GB/s available to the RX 7600 XT but is much higher than any other APU we have tested.</p><p><span>A massive thank you to both </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">HP</a><span> for sending over a </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">ROG Flow Z13 (2025)</a><span> and a </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">ZBook Ultra G1a 14”</a><span> for testing which were both equipped with an </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html" rel="">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a><span>.

However, as you can see the CPU does not have access to the 32MB of Infinity Cache on the IO die.

GPU performance is comparable to mid range dedicated graphics, while still offering the efficiency and integration of an iGPU. High end dedicated graphics still have a place above Strix Halo, but the versatility of this design for smaller form factor devices is class leading.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" width="1456" height="917" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:917,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus ROG Flow Z13 2025</a><span> which is a very similar form factor to the Microsoft Surface but has a Strix Halo inside of it instead of a lower power Intel chip.

As a result of the long delay between the launch of Strix Halo and the release of ROCm 7.0.2, the ML performance will have to wait until a future article.</p><p>However, putting aside ROCm, Strix Halo is a very, very cool piece of technology and I would love to see successors to Strix Halo with newer CPU and GPU IP and possibly even larger memory buses similar to Apple’s Max and Ultra series of SoCs with 512b and 1024b memory respectively. AMD has a formula for building bigger APUs with Strix Halo, which opens the door to a lot of interesting hardware possibilities in the future.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>. Ring cooperating with law enforcement and the reported use of Flock technologies by federal agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has resurfaced privacy concerns that have followed the devices for years.</p>
<p>According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.</p>
<p>“Any footage a Ring customer chooses to submit will be securely packaged by Flock and shared directly with the requesting local public safety agency through the FlockOS or Flock Nova platform,” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>Flock said its local law enforcement users will gain access to Ring Community Requests in “the coming months.”</p>
<h2>A flock of privacy concerns</h2>
<p>Outside its software platforms, Flock is known for <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/ebooks/license-plate-reader-cameras-overview">license plate recognition cameras</a>. Flock customers can also <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-freeform#:~:text=Most%20tools%20rely%20on%20rigid,to%20find%20visual%20matches%20instantly.'">search</a> footage from Flock cameras using descriptors to find people, such as “man in blue shirt and cowboy hat.” Besides law enforcement agencies, Flock says 6,000 communities and 1,000 businesses use their products.</p>
<p>For years, privacy advocates have warned against companies like Flock.</p>
<p>This week, US Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf">[PDF]</a> to Flock CEO Garrett Langley saying that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Secret Service, and the US Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service have had access to footage from Flock’s license plate cameras.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I now believe that abuses of your product are not only likely but inevitable and that Flock is unable and uninterested in preventing them,” Wyden wrote.</p>
<p>In August, Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst for the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup">wrote</a> that “Flock is building a dangerous, nationwide mass-surveillance infrastructure.” Stanley pointed to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">ICE using</a> Flock’s network of cameras, as well as Flock’s efforts to build a <a href="https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/">people lookup tool</a> with data brokers.</p>
<p>Matthew Guariglia, senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), told Ars via email that Flock is a “mass surveillance tool” that “has increasingly been used to spy on both immigrants and people exercising their First Amendment-protected rights.”</p>
<p>Flock has earned this reputation among privacy advocates through its own cameras, not Ring’s.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica that only local public safety agencies will be able to make Community Requests via Flock software, and that requests will also show the name of the agency making the request.</p>
<p>A Flock spokesperson told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flock does not currently have any contracts with any division of [the US Department of Homeland Security], including ICE. The Ring Community Requests process through Flock is only available for local public safety agencies for specific, active investigations. All requests are time and geographically-bound. Ring users can choose to share relevant footage or ignore the request.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flock’s rep added that all activity within FlockOS and Flock Nova is “permanently recorded in a comprehensive CJIS-compliant audit trail for unalterable custody tracking,” referring to a set of standards created by the FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis">Criminal Justice Information Services</a> division.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But there’s still concern that federal agencies will end up accessing Ring footage through Flock. Guariglia told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even without formal partnerships with federal authorities, data from these surveillance companies flow to agencies like ICE through local law enforcement. Local and state police have run more than 4,000 Flock searches on behalf of federal authorities or with a potential immigration focus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c_dUFIaqOJutylG4zjHu0">reporting has found</a>. Additionally, just this month, it became clear that Texas police searched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0I2Yt8eYfc6vO0usQ4AwxA">83,000 Flock cameras</a> in an attempt to prosecute a woman for her abortion and then tried to cover it up.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ring cozies up to the law</h2>
<p>This week’s announcement shows Amazon, which acquired Ring in 2018, increasingly positioning its consumer cameras as a law enforcement tool. After years of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cops-offering-ring-doorbell-cameras-for-information/">cops using Ring footage</a>, Amazon last year said that it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/amazon-ring-stops-letting-cops-get-doorbell-footage-without-a-warrant/">stop letting police request Ring footage</a>—unless it was an “emergency”—only to reverse course about 18 months later by allowing police to request Ring footage through a Flock rival, <a href="https://www.axon.com/newsroom/press-releases/axon-announces-new-fixed-ALPR-camera-solutions-and-next-gen-AI-advancements-to-expand-real-time-public-safety-ecosystem">Axon</a>.</p>
<p>While announcing Ring’s deals with Flock and Axon, Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff claimed that the partnerships would help Ring cameras keep neighborhoods safe. But there’s doubt as to whether people buy Ring cameras to protect their neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Ring’s new partnership with Flock shows that the company is more interested in contributing to mounting authoritarianism than servicing the specific needs of their customers,” Guariglia told Ars.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ring initiated conversations about a deal with Flock, Langely told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html">CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Flock says that its cameras don’t use facial recognition, which has been criticized for <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/unmasking-bias-facial-recognition-algorithms">racial biases</a>. But local law enforcement agencies using Flock will soon have access to footage from Ring cameras with facial recognition. In a conversation with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/03/amazon-ring-doorbell-facial-recognition-pricacy/">The Washington Post</a> this month, Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the consumer advocacy and policy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, described the new feature for Ring cameras as “invasive for anyone who walks within range of” a Ring doorbell, since they likely haven’t consented to facial recognition being used on them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Amazon, for its part, has mostly pushed the burden of ensuring responsible facial recognition use to its customers. Schroeder shared concern with the Post that Ring’s facial recognition data could end up being shared with law enforcement.</p>
<p>Some people who are perturbed about Ring deepening its ties with law enforcement have complained online.</p>
<p>“Inviting big brother into the system. Screw that,” a user on the Ring subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/1o8jl9u/amazons_ring_to_partner_with_flock_a_network_of/">said</a> this week.</p>
<p>Another Reddit user said: “And… I’m gone. Nope, NO WAY IN HELL. Goodbye, Ring. I’ll be switching to a UniFi[-brand] system with 100 percent local storage. You don’t get my money any more. This is some <em>1984</em> BS …”</p>
<p>Privacy concerns are also exacerbated by Ring’s past, as the company has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/ring-used-parties-swag-to-build-700-police-partnerships-report-finds/">failed to meet users’ privacy expectations</a>. In 2023, Ring agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle claims that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">employees illegally spied on Ring customers</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon and Flock say their collaboration will only involve voluntary customers and local enforcement agencies. But there’s still reason to be concerned about the implications of people sending doorbell and personal camera footage to law enforcement via platforms that are reportedly widely used by federal agencies for deportation purposes. Combined with the privacy issues that Ring has already faced for years, it’s not hard to see why some feel that Amazon scaling up Ring’s association with any type of law enforcement is unacceptable.</p>
<p>And it appears that Amazon and Flock would both like Ring customers to opt in when possible.</p>
<p>“It will be turned on for free for every customer, and I think all of them will use it,” Langely told CNBC.</p>

                    <p>Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that effort to understand what they're building? Just open up your browser and type "make me a website" into Claude or ChatGPT, and you're on your way! There are hundreds of identical prompts to choose from, but go ahead and use the same exact one everyone else uses, paste the output without reading it, and you're done! No one will notice that every AI-coded site looks identical! Plus you get to argue on Twitter about whether "prompt engineering" counts as real programming!</p>

                            This is as close to Tailwind CSS as we're getting on a pure HTML site.

                    <p>This site was built in 5 minutes by asking Claude "make me a website" and I'm very proud of myself.</p>
                    <p>No, I did not read any of the code. Yes, it works. No, I cannot explain how. Yes, I will put "Full Stack Developer" on my resume.</p>

<p dir="auto">WebMCP allows websites to share tools, resources, prompts, etc. to LLMs. In other words, WebMCP allows a website to be an MCP server. No sharing API Keys. Use any model you want.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://webmcp.dev/" rel="nofollow">Here's a simple website I built that is WebMCP-enabled</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It comes in the form of a widget that a website owner can put on their site and expose tools to give client-side LLMs what they need to provide a great UX for the user or agent.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The look, feel, how it's used, and security are all absolutely open for contribution / constructive criticism. MCP Clients directly building WebMCP functionality seems like an ideal outcome.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">An end-user can connect to any number of websites at a time - and tools are "scoped" (by name) based on the domain to simplify organization.</p>

<p dir="auto">When you're ready to connect to a website, you can ask your model to generate you an mcp token.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you'd rather your model / service never see the token, you can manually execute <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp --new</code> instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some MCP clients, including Claude Desktop, need to be restarted to get access to new tools. (at least at time of writing)</p>
<p dir="auto">To disconnect, you can close the browser tab, click "disconnect", or shut down the server with <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp -q</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The bridge between the MCP client and the website is a localhost-only (not accessible to requests outside your computer) websocket server. Because it is configured to allow requests from your local web browser, authentication / token exchange is required, in case you visit a website attempting to abuse this.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Ideally the web browser itself would have an explicit permission for this, like webcam or microphone use.</em></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The MCP client connects to the <code>/mcp</code> path using the server token from <code>.env</code> (auto-generated)</li>
<li>The server generates a registration token (instigated via the built-in mcp tool by a model or the <code>--new</code> command)</li>
<li>Web clients connect to the <code>/register</code> endpoint with this token and its domain.</li>
<li>Web pages connect to their assigned channel based on their domain.</li>
<li>When an LLM wants to use a tool / resource / prompt, the request flows from:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>MCP Client → MCP Server → WebSocket Server → Web Page with the tool / resource / prompt</li>
<li>(similar for requesting a list of tools / resources / prompts)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">There is a <code>Dockerfile</code> specifically for Smithery deployment.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd like to use docker to run the websocket server, I've added a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">If <code>--docker</code> is provided to the mcp client config alongside <code>--mcp</code>, it will assume the server is running. This will allow you to dockerize the main process (websocket server), and your mcp client will connect to your docker container via websocket. Similarly, websites will communicate with your docker container.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to mislead anyone here. This corner of the website—“New Stuff”—is not a resurrection of <em>The Far Side</em> daily cartoons. (Well, not exactly, anyway—like the proverbial tiger and its stripes, I’m pretty much stuck with my sense of humor. Aren’t we all?) The thing is, I <em>thoroughly</em> enjoyed my career as a syndicated cartoonist, and I hope, in spirit at least, we had some laughs together. But after fifteen years of meeting deadlines, well, blah blah blah … you know the rest. The day after I retired from syndication, it felt good <em>not</em> to draw on a deadline. And after moving on to other interests, drawing just wasn’t on my to-do list. Things change. But then a few years ago—and returning to the subject at hand—­something happened in my life, and it started with a clogged pen.</p>
    <p>Despite my retirement, I still had intermittent connections to cartooning, including my wife’s and my personal Christmas card. Once a year, I’d sit myself down to take on Santa, and every year it began with the same ritual: me cursing at, and then cleaning out, my clogged pen. (Apparently, the concept of cleaning it before putting it away each year was just too elusive for me.) As problems go, this is admittedly not exactly on the scale of global warming, but in the small world of my studio, it was cataclysmic. Okay, highly annoying.</p>
    <p>So a few years ago—finally fed up with my once-loyal but now reliably traitorous pen—I decided to try a digital tablet. I knew nothing about these devices but hoped it would just get me through my annual Christmas card ordeal. I got one, fired it up, and lo and behold, something totally unexpected happened: within moments, I was having fun drawing again. I was stunned at all the tools the thing offered, all the creative potential it contained. I simply had no idea how far these things had evolved. Perhaps fittingly, the first thing I drew was a caveman.</p>
    <p>The “New Stuff” that you’ll see here is the result of my journey into the world of digital art. Believe me, this has been a bit of a learning curve for me. I hail from a world of pen and ink, and suddenly I was feeling like I was sitting at the controls of a 747. (True, I don’t get out much.) But as overwhelmed as I was, there was still something familiar there—a sense of adventure. That had always been at the core of what I enjoyed most when I was drawing <em>The Far Side</em>, that sense of exploring, reaching for something, taking some risks, sometimes hitting a home run and sometimes coming up with “Cow tools.” (Let’s not get into that.) But as a jazz teacher once said to me about improvisation, “You want to try and take people somewhere where they might not have been before.” I think that my approach to cartooning was similar—I’m just not sure if even <em>I</em> knew where I was going. But I was having fun.</p>
    <p>So here goes. I’ve got my coffee, I’ve got this cool gizmo, and I’ve got no deadlines. And—to borrow from Sherlock Holmes—the game is afoot.</p>
    <p>Again, please remember, I’m just exploring, experimenting, and trying stuff. New Stuff. I have just one last thing to say before I go: thank <em>you</em>, clogged pen.</p>
