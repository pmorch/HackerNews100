Picotool was used to write the covert code to the OTP. Then the RP2350's OTP memory was locked behind the Page Locks hardware protection feature, set to an 'inaccessible' state '13:12' as per the table above. Firmware was also signed, with Secure Boot enabled, and they disabled the chip debug feature, so prying eyes couldn't get to the secret via a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface. Furthermore, all other bootkeys were disabled, the RP2350 Glitch Detector was turned on and then set to its highest sensitivity. It certainly sounds like it was locked down.</p><p>Cullen says he started his hacking process by studying the RP2350 data sheet and the dependencies outlined in the documentation. Then Cullen drilled down on how the RP2350 boots and establishes its security settings, with particular attention to the OTP.</p><p>Cullen's first idea was to get the OTP to misread its critical bit settings, you could get the chip to work in a non-secure way. Cullen even X-rayed the RP2350 as part of his investigations and annotated the chip blocks. However, he stresses that this was just a pursuit of interest and not really instrumental to beating the challenge.</p><p>Research compelled Cullen to focus on Pin 53, labeled USB-OTP_VDD, as it is connected to OTP (and USB) functions. Perhaps a hacker could "mess with this power supply externally" to affect these functions, he pondered. So he took off the chip and isolated Pin 53 (physically cutting PCB trace), so it was ready to be electrically tampered with separately on a reassembled board.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-V5ppwQPQlYKQEEzp8YfYNSf4WgG7yCzH"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>With this hardware-modified setup, Cullen probed Pin 53 to "inject whatever voltages I want" and checked what happened. An unprotected RP2350 board was kept on hand for side-by-side comparisons. Once the hardware was set up he watched what normally occurs when a secured and a non-secured RP2350 started up – according to the probe readout on an oscilloscope.</p><p>16 groups of spikes were seen, corresponding with 16 initial OTP reads on startup. Cullen then tested injecting power glitches to Pin 53 at certain points in the boot process. Disappointingly, the debug remained locked down. Next, a Python script was used to sweep the position of a glitch power input through the entire 600-microsecond range of OTP reads during startup. The debug functionality was checked but never became available. So Cullen looked at the unlocked RP2350 board again, with debugging enabled, for clues.</p><p>Then, something interesting was observed, as the RISC-V cores showed up via the glitch on the unsecured RP2350. Cullen then used another script to check where the RISC-V debug access port shows up.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>Imagine shrinking satellite technology that predicts the weather into a device that transmits vital information about the health of the person wearing it.</p>

<p>University of Waterloo engineers have achieved this&nbsp;technological feat to help people faced with&nbsp;chronic health problems such as diabetes monitor their glucose levels.</p>

<p>The Waterloo team’s breakthrough addresses the major challenge of creating non-invasive, continuous glucose monitoring, essential for those managing diabetes.</p>

<p>Currently, diabetics must frequently prick their fingers or rely on invasive wearable patches with micro-needles to track their blood-sugar levels. But the system designed by Dr. George Shaker, an adjunct associate professor at Waterloo’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and his colleagues eliminates this need, thereby reducing pain, the risk of infection and improving people’s quality of life.</p>

<p><img alt="George Shaker picture" height="233" src="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/sites/ca.news/files/resize/styles/feature_small/public/george_shaker_23-06-13_0853_1-350x233.jpg?itok=mvnnwrr9" width="350">“We’ve developed radar technology that can now fit inside a smart watch and sense glucose levels more accurately than ever before,” Shaker said. “Just like you use glasses to improve your vision, our technology helps for better sensing of glucose levels.”</p>

<p>To explain how the new system works, Shaker points to weather satellites that use radar to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere and, for example, measure storm movements and other kinds of cloud cover.</p>

<p>“We’ve figured a way to miniaturize these radar systems on satellites and put them in a wearable device and use the same radar technology that looks at changes in the atmosphere to look at changes in the human body,” he said</p>

<p>The system’s key components are a radar chip, which sends and receives signals through the body, an engineered “meta-surface”, which helps focus these signals for better accuracy, and microcontrollers, which process the radar signals using artificial intelligence algorithms. The algorithms improve the accuracy and reliability of the readings by learning from the data over time.</p>

<p>The unique aspect of this system is the meta-surface which Shaker and his team have developed. It further improves the radar’s resolution and sensitivity, allowing for more accurate glucose readings.</p>

<p>“Unlike existing methods that require skin penetration our system is entirely non-invasive and can detect even small changes in glucose level,” Shaker said. “No other technology can provide this level of precision without direct contact with the bloodstream.”</p>

<p>More work remains to perfect their system. Although the engineers now power their device with a USB cable, they’re planning to optimize it for battery use to improve portability. Eventually, they hope it can be used to gather other health-related data, such as blood pressure.</p>

<p>The team is currently working with industry partners to introduce the technology to be installed in the next generation of wearables.</p>

<p>“We have a minimum viable product that’s already being used in clinical trials, and while there’s more work to be done, we’re much closer to a full marketable device,” Shaker said.</p>

<p>The research paper, “Radar near-field sensing using metasurface for biomedical applications” was recently featured in Nature’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00194-4"><i>Communications Engineering</i></a>.</p>

<p>Plastic recycling is commonplace but imperfect. Part of the problem, says <a href="https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-jason-e-bara/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Bara</a>, is that current processes yield lower-quality plastics with reduced value and fewer end uses. In a circular plastic economy, any plastic could be broken down to its component parts and then reconstituted into new products with little or no waste.</p>



<p>The science is not there yet, but it may be one step closer.</p>

<div>
<p>Bara, a professor in the College of Engineering, leads a team at The University of Alabama working to improve <a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/08/ua-researchers-part-of-national-effort-to-tackle-plastic-waste/">methods to recycle</a> the ubiquitous plastics we interact with daily.</p>



<p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common plastic that responds well to chemolysis, a chemical process that depolymerizes plastic for recycling. Much of the previous work on chemolysis and PET has focused on water, alcohols, and amines.&nbsp; Amines are a group of compounds derived from ammonia and are especially effective for PET depolymerization, but most products formed from the aminolysis of PET have limited uses, Bara said.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2 id="h-let-s-see-what-happens"><strong>“Let’s See What Happens”</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing in the literature pointed to the effectiveness of imidazoles in this process. Imidazole, and its related compounds, are a group of organic molecules that are used in a wide range of applications and even appear within biologically important compounds.</p>



<p>“I’ve been working with imidazole for much of my career,” said Bara. “It’s pretty amazing how versatile it is.” Bara had been working for two years with using amines to break down plastics as part of a National Science Foundation grant geared toward reducing plastic waste. His appreciation for imidazole’s versatility made it a natural extension to see what happened when he tried using it for chemolysis.</p>



<p>“My student came back into the lab and said oh — the plastic is gone. It’s all gone.”</p>



<p>The University of Alabama has filed a patent application for the process, which offers several key advantages over other chemical recycling methods for PET. Among these is the lack of need of an additional solvent or catalyst because imidazole has a relatively low melting point. These are favorable qualities for developing a cost efficient and commercially viable process.</p>



<p>Breaking down PET via imidazolysis yields chemical intermediates that can be transformed to a range of other chemicals that are hard to get by traditional methods.</p>



<p>“Our imidazolysis process is unique in that it’s a flexible recycling technology, and you can get a wider range of final products from PET depolymerization when you do it our way,” Bara said.</p>



<h2 id="h-chasing-the-next-challenge"><strong>Chasing the Next Challenge</strong></h2>



<p>Bara says one of the more exciting things about the research is what lies ahead.</p>



<div><p>PET is among the easier plastics to recycle. For one thing, it is relatively clean because it is used in food containers and drink bottles, and it generally contains few additives. Based on their results so far, imidazolysis is also useful in depolymerizing polyurethanes, which are trickier to work with than PET.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Wooden box marked with a recycling symbol holding a variety of plastic bottles.

<p>“There is generally good awareness around the need to recycle plastics and other materials (paper, metal) that commonly go into our recycling bins,” he said. “But it’s harder to appreciate that polyurethanes can also be chemically recycled.”</p>



<p>Polyurethanes are generally encountered as foams that are full of air, do not melt and often are formulated with any number of inorganic additives. Think packing foams, seat cushions, memory foam mattresses and automobile seats.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1439" src="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_294651475-edited-scaled.jpeg" alt="Yellow chunks of polyurethane foam, torn into irregular pieces.

<p>“While municipal recycling is limited to the most common thermoplastics, consumers likely don’t understand the magnitude of the polyurethane problem that needs to be addressed.”</p>



<p>Imidazolysis not only works to break down polyurethanes and allows for recovery of the molecular components (the polyols used to make polyurethanes can be especially valuable to recover), but the physical properties of imidazole also make it a better reagent for carrying out the reaction.</p>



<p>“While I think what we’ve already published on the successful imidazolysis of PET is very exciting,” Bara said, “The chemical recycling of polyurethanes is where imidazolysis may potentially have a much bigger impact.”</p>



<p>This work on recycling PET and PU via imidazolysis has been supported by active funding from NSF and includes contributions from researchers at Iowa State University.</p>

<p>First off, no, your ANT+ devices aren’t going to stop working. In fact, companies are not only supporting them going forward, but will continue to make ANT+ devices for some time to come. Instead, ANT+ (or more technically, Garmin), has announced a policy change that effectively and officially ceases the development of new ANT+ standards. Though practically speaking, that mostly happened long ago.</p>
<p>The core reason for this change is the <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/radio-equipment-directive-red_en">European Union’s Radio Equipment Directive</a> (simply called EU RED), which will ultimately take full effect next summer (it’s currently in a transitional phase). That directive covers a flotilla of different areas, but one of the most applicable pieces is that it requires authentication and encryption for wireless communications of personal information. Or, at the very least, it requires manufacturers to make you aware when data is being transmitted without such protections.</p>
<p>While ANT+ has long offered the ability to authenticate and encrypt data streams, it hasn’t been implemented in common profiles like heart rate or cycling power. Garmin says that to do so going forward would effectively break backward compatibility, as it significantly increases the payload sent in any message. Given the landscape of devices and Bluetooth in 2025, there’s virtually no appetite from other manufacturers to re-create the wheel when it comes to ANT+.</p>
<p>As a result, Garmin is making a bunch of changes around the certification side, development, and program side. None of these ANT+ changes will impact consumers in any way, anytime soon. However, there are some other Garmin changes that will soon start to impact consumers.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into it – but first, it’s important to understand a tiny bit of backstory here, to see the long term challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<h3 data-test="1/5" id="a-bit-of-backstory"><span><strong>A Bit of Backstory:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about ANT+ (or Garmin’s ownership of it), it has remained as the most stable thing in the sports tech universe for almost two decades. I say ‘stable’, because it forced companies to align to a standard, which made communications and interoperability seamless for devices like heart rate sensors and cycling power meters. There’s no question that cycling power meters wouldn’t have taken off if we were still back in the days of proprietary SRM wireless, or wired PowerTap SL hubs. And certainly, as the Bluetooth power meter profile has (and continues to) demonstrate – it’s far from a reliable standard. In a review set for tomorrow, I’ll show how a popular watch doesn’t seem to implement this decade-old Bluetooth power meter standard correctly.</p>
<p>Of course, Bluetooth Low Energy (the direct competitor to ANT+, versus full-blown Bluetooth used for audio that’s a different beast), quickly gained popularity in the early 2010’s after the consortium announced standards around fitness devices, notably the heart rate strap first. While <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/10/samsung-mobile-devices.html">companies like Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2011/09/hands-on-review-of-sony-ericsson-xperia.html">Sony had adopted ANT+</a> in their phones, it was Apple’s decision to skip it that ultimately doomed ANT+. In fact, to this day, the mere mention of ANT+ in front of Apple employees in the know, is akin to smearing poop on the bathroom stall (seriously). It should be noted, for funsies, that Fitbit actually used to use ANT+ for communications between their early devices and the initial wireless adapter for your computer.</p>
<p>It’d be remiss to write an article about ANT+, without mentioning Dynastream (based in Cochrane, Alberta). That’s the original company behind ANT+, <a href="https://sgbonline.com/garmin-to-acquire-dynastream-in-36-million-deal/">that Garmin acquired in 2006</a>. The founder of Dynastream would eventually go on to found 4iiii in 2010, maker of power meters and many other products over the last 15 years. Still, despite Garmin’s ownership of ANT+, it was never really a meaningful problem for competitors. The (significant) value in having a common interoperability standard far outweighed the very small licensing fee these companies paid to Dynastream/Garmin. Consumers saw that value, and gravitated towards products that had standards in place.</p>

<p>A key part of any device communication on either ANT+ or Bluetooth smart are so-called sport/sensor/device profiles.</p>
<p>Think of a sensor/device profile as a way to define how certain types of devices communicate. For example, there’s a heart rate device profile for heart rate sensors. Or the cycling power meter one, and so on. Companies that have a stake in these profiles come together to try and create a single cohesive standard. For ANT+, <a href="https://www.thisisant.com/company/activity-icons/">there are dozens of these profiles</a>. Some companies like SRAM did an exceptional job of each new product they launched, they created an open profile for it (such as Dropper Post or ANT+ shifting). And Garmin largely did the same as well for each new product.</p>
<p>In the case of ANT+, this process was highly regulated, and sometimes (ok, most times) a wee bit slow. But if a company had a vision for the profile and a specific product launch timeframe/date, it was generally pretty efficient. It became less efficient the more companies got involved, or if the company didn’t have a specific product launch date. Said differently: If you danced your own dance with purpose, you could get a standard profile pretty darn quickly. If you involved a massive committee of competitors or were wishy-washy on dates, it dragged on for years. One only needs to see the much-requested Aero sensor profile as an example of that. And there are many more.</p>
<p>However, the Bluetooth SIG side had its own issues. These profiles were coming hot and heavy, but often driven by players that frankly didn’t have any business being part of that profile. We’d see automotive companies involved in the cycling power meter profile, for example. Thus, that profile still suffers plenty of problems to this day as it doesn’t really capture everything that power meters did 10 years ago, let alone today.</p>
<p>Still, by the mid-late 2010’s, most of the core sports profiles used were available in Bluetooth, including Bluetooth footpods, Bluetooth power meters, Bluetooth heart rate sensors, Bluetooth Speed &amp; Cadence sensors, and Bluetooth FTMS (for smart trainer control). Likewise, by that time, most of the chipsets used were dual ANT+/Bluetooth Smart. Almost every sensor made since 2016ish has been dual ANT+/Bluetooth Smart, albeit, it wasn’t until a few years later when multi-channel Bluetooth chipsets became commonplace, ensuring users could connect to their heart rate strap from more than one device at once (a problem primarily in the indoor training space).</p>
<p>As a result, Bluetooth finally became not only viable for sports use, but just as reliable in most scenarios. And in some cases, it handled wireless interference better than ANT+ did.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier on, the single biggest dagger to ANT+ is the EU RED, and the need to encrypt data. All of this would require a massive overhaul of ANT+, breaking backward compatibility with tens (if not hundreds) of millions of devices. Setting aside whether or not consumers actually want their live heart rate data at the gym encrypted, that’s where we find ourselves. As a result, Garmin has <a href="https://www.thisisant.com/business/go-ant/ant-brand/">announced the following changes</a>:</p>
<p><strong>– They are discontinuing membership programs/fees:</strong> Up until now, there were different membership tiers of ANT+ that companies/startups could join. These had fees, though relatively minor. Still, Garmin says it wouldn’t be right to charge companies for a membership that doesn’t have long-term viability in it.<br>
<strong>– They are discontinuing certification programs:</strong> Companies could submit products to be certified as compliant with standards. Some companies like Wahoo took this quite seriously, and sent everything. As of March 31st, ANT+ will stop accepting certification submissions. And as of June 30th, they’ll stop certifying new products.<br>
<strong>– They are ceasing development of new ANT+ Profiles:</strong> No surprise here, there’s no new development/expansion of ANT+ profiles.<br>
<strong>– They are however continuing to ensure ANT+ is available on silicon:</strong> This ensures that ANT+ is still available on chipset providers for a long time to come. As one might expect, there are millions of devices, both from a sensor and display (e.g., watch/bike computer) standpoint, that still want to use ANT+ connections. Garmin says they’re working to ensure these chipset providers continue to make dual ANT+/Bluetooth chipsets.<br>
<strong>– All documentation to be made fully available online:</strong> Certain tier ANT+ members could access more detailed documentation than lower tiers. This basically makes all ANT+ documents available to everyone.</p>
<p>All of this basically means that your ANT+ devices will continue to work just fine, and we’ll actually probably continue to see ANT+ devices made by companies like Garmin/Wahoo/etc for quite some time as well. That’s because there are workarounds to the EU RED requirements, such as notifying the user. Or, simply assuming that portions of the EU RED will get delayed yet again.</p>
<p>In fact, we’re already seeing Garmin introduce some mitigations. In recent Garmin watch/bike computer beta firmware versions, you’ll see a new connection option type shown:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_2431.jpeg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431.jpeg" alt="" width="355" height="266" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431.jpeg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431-200x150.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"> <img loading="lazy" title="IMG_2432.jpeg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432.jpeg" alt="" width="355" height="266" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432.jpeg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432-200x150.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>More on related things later/soonish.</p>
<p>As for the reduction of ANT+ positions within Garmin, the company noted that they “have a shortage of people, not ideas”. Everyone in the Cochrane office is simply being reassigned to other work areas. Garmin has largely leveraged the Cochrane office in recent years for projects related to sensors and other communication technologies (e.g., heart rate sensors, power meters, etc…).</p>
<h3 data-test="4/5" id="a-lot-of-gaps"><span><strong>A Lot of Gaps:</strong></span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Radar.jpg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>Now going back to that initial excitement period in the 2010’s, standards-based profiles largely halted. Most companies, including Garmin, saw the Bluetooth SIG as a hopeless entity more concerned with putting in place roadblocks than progress. We saw companies like Polar and Wahoo – who used to have significant presence on the Bluetooth SIGs (committee groups), significantly reduce involvement. As a result, there’s been no new sports/fitness profiles in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Thus, while it’s easy for many consumers to dismiss ANT+ as irrelevant, it’s very much still a part of certain scenes – the biggest being cycling. Things get really messy, really quick.</p>
<p><strong>Got a cycling radar (like a Varia Radar device)?</strong> Yup, that’s almost exclusively on ANT+. The only Bluetooth implementations are private/proprietary implementations that are unique to each company. Even radars from Bryton, Magene, and others all use ANT+ as the primary protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Got wireless shifting or Di2?</strong> Those too are on ANT. In the case of SRAM/Campagnolo/FSA, that’s broadcasting your gear and battery status on the ANT+ shifting protocol. In the case of Shimano, that’s using their proprietary ANT (but not ANT+) protocol. Of course, <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/05/shimano-hammerhead-functionality.html">that’s resulted in all sorts of messiness</a>. But there is absolutely *zero* Bluetooth alternative for any of these companies right now.</p>
<p><strong>How about cycling lights?</strong> If you want those cycling lights connected to your Wahoo/Garmin/Hammerhead/COROS/whatever bike computer, that’s using ANT+. Sure, there are, again, proprietary Bluetooth implementations out there. But they only work within that specific company’s ecosystem (thinking of Lezyne as an example).</p>
<p>Sure, for heart rate data the standard is well understood on Bluetooth. It simply doesn’t matter whether or not you have an ANT+ or Bluetooth Smart heart rate strap, they both work perfectly fine. There are minor pros and cons to each, but for 99.9% of consumers, it just doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>So what happens to mitigate these gaps?</p>
<h3 data-test="5/5" id="what-happens-next-for-consumers"><span><strong>What Happens Next for Consumers:</strong></span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="ANTSymp.jpg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>The answer to this section headline is simple: Back to walled gardens.</p>
<p>Of course, that was already mostly the trend the last 4-5 years. Unfortunately, the COVID era further cemented that by eliminating various interoperability conferences/events that had occurred prior. Adding to that is the heavy shift towards startup tech companies that have largely eschewed standards as well, be it protocol or file format.</p>
<p>While one might assume Bluetooth SIGs would be the answer going forward, history and current company commentary have very clearly indicated otherwise. I’ve yet to find a single sports tech company that wants to deal with pushing forward new device profiles with the Bluetooth SIG. Companies don’t see that as a viable route to success, and certainly not worth their time and headaches.</p>
<p>Instead, companies like Garmin say they’re going to work to make private profiles more available. I asked Garmin, for example, about the radar profile, for which Garmin has had a private Bluetooth implementation available for years now. They give that to some companies upon request, to implement within their apps. They didn’t have (yet) a specific firm answer for how that’ll look going forward, but instead pointed to Wahoo’s early release a decade ago of their trainer control protocols as an example of the likely direction.</p>
<p>For those that don’t remember the early 2010 protocol days of Wahoo smart trainers, they basically created their own trainer control standard, and then published the API/SDK on a website for all to use. That quickly made Wahoo’s KICKR trainer protocol the de facto standard for a period before the <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/07/everything-wanted-trainers.html">ANT+ FE-C standard came into play</a>.</p>
<p>Garmin has plenty of history of doing variants of that, both within the ANT+ sphere, but also their Connect IQ developer programs. But whether they actually do so is a different matter. In the trainer space, Garmin/Wahoo/Elite/Zwift all kinda quietly work together on various protocol things, but they don’t often reach the finish line in a public way.</p>
<p>The sports tech industry needs some replacement for what the <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/tag/ant-symposium">ANT+ Symposium</a> did for over a decade, both in terms of an event to talk protocols (with competitors no less), but also the backend process to keep companies aligned to standards for the other 51 weeks of the year. Unfortunately, I don’t see how that happens going forward.</p>
<p>Until then, the good news is our ANT+ devices will continue to keep working.</p>
<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>

I made a mistake, but … I’ve changed my life.’”</p><p>It was long considered taboo in media to retract or alter old stories, particularly when there are no concerns about accuracy. But Quinn said he felt an ethical obligation to rethink those norms. “I couldn’t take it any more … I just got tired of telling people no and standing on tradition instead of being thoughtful.”</p><p>He recalled an early case of a <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2018/07/right_to_be_forgotten_clevelan.html" data-link-name="in body link">drunken teenager</a> who broke part of a monument in a cemetery and was charged. Years later, he had “completely atoned” and was starting to apply for jobs, Quinn said. “He did something stupid as a kid … and he said: ‘I can’t move on.’” The editor granted his request, removed his name and presented it to his colleagues as a model for similar cases.</p><p>There was some initial internal resistance, but eventually Quinn and his staff came up with general parameters: they would not erase names in cases of violence, sex offenses, crimes against children or corruption. Police officers would be treated as public officials, so stories of their wrongdoing would remain. The incident typically had to be at least four years old, although the paper has made exceptions. Quinn did not want to have strict rules, since every case is different. The guiding question, he said, was: “What’s more valuable – this story remaining available to the public, or this person being able to move on?”</p><p>The concept has since <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/02/boston-globe-fresh-start-right-to-be-forgotten-newspapers.html" data-link-name="in body link">spread</a> to the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/22/metro/globes-fresh-start-initiative-frequently-asked-questions/" data-link-name="in body link">Boston Globe</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/old-arrest-boston-globe-fresh-start/2021/01/22/122cbd0c-5cd1-11eb-b8bd-ee36b1cd18bf_story.html" data-link-name="in body link">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, the <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/forgetme/" data-link-name="in body link">Bangor Daily News</a> in Maine, the <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2024/11/letter-from-the-editor-heartfelt-request-for-clean-slate-underscores-why-we-offer-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">Oregonian</a> and New Jersey’s <a href="http://nj.com/" data-link-name="in body link">NJ.com</a>. The efforts gained momentum after racial justice protests in 2020 prompted newsroom reflections across the US about the media’s legacy of biased and harmful coverage, including its <a href="https://nbcuacademy.com/claire-wang-mugshots-crime-beat-police/" data-link-name="in body link">widespread use of mugshots</a>.</p><p>Quinn dramatically scaled up his work after receiving Google funding allowing his newsroom to develop a tool for proactively identifying stories potentially worthy of deletion. The work was painstaking, but allowed for <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/02/weve-helped-thousands-of-people-get-past-their-mistakes-with-googles-support-letter-from-the-editor.html" data-link-name="in body link">thousands of removals</a>, making the program more equitable, instead of only benefiting readers aware of its initiative.</p><p>The Portland-based Oregonian once had community reporters in bureaus in surrounding suburbs who would cover hyperlocal news, including very trivial offenses, said Therese Bottomly, the paper’s editor. “Is that something that should really haunt somebody for years and years?” she questioned. Recognizing these were minor offenses the paper no longer covered, she formally launched a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2021/03/letter-from-the-editor-well-be-taking-a-new-look-at-old-crime-news.html" data-link-name="in body link">clean slate program</a> in 2021, establishing an internal committee to review requests.</p><p>The Oregonian offers several options. It can remove a mugshot – a logical step after Oregon changed the law to limit the release of booking photos, with lawmakers recognizing their <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/11/02/oregon-mugshot-law-booking-photos-released/" data-link-name="in body link">severe harm</a>. The paper can also remove a subject’s name, delete the story entirely, or ask Google to deindex the article, meaning it would still exist on OregonLive.com, but wouldn’t easily surface in a web search. The committee factchecks claims of requesters, ensuring they have completed court requirements and stayed clean.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Each case is carefully considered. An educator who had an expunged misdemeanor harassment case <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2021/03/letter-from-the-editor-well-be-taking-a-new-look-at-old-crime-news.html" data-link-name="in body link">requested removal</a>, but the Oregonian decided to maintain its article because additional reporting suggested he had dodged sexual misconduct allegations for years. The committee has <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2023/12/letter-from-the-editor-an-update-on-our-clean-slate-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">removed articles</a> about a man jailed for car thefts and a woman caught with illegal drugs.</p><p>In November, Bottomly published excerpts from one subject’s heartfelt plea for the removal of an article about a non-violent conviction when he had “hit rock bottom” in the throes of addiction. He spoke of his long journey of rehabilitation and the family he was now raising.</p><p>“I can now take pride in saying my life is unrecognizable from the one written about in the OregonLive article,” he <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2024/11/letter-from-the-editor-heartfelt-request-for-clean-slate-underscores-why-we-offer-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>. “I live in fear that a single Google search of my name will ruin what I have worked so hard to build.” His nearly 10-year-old story was removed. In total, the Oregonian has approved 56 requests, partially approved 11 (including deindexing but not removing) and denied 29 cases, Bottomly said.</p><p>Bottomly noted that the vast majority of people in state prison will eventually be released. “These folks are going to be our neighbors, our co-workers and hopefully contributing members of society someday. So should we figure out ways to at least not be an unnecessary barrier to re-entry for something truly minor and in the past, and for which somebody has paid their debt?”</p><p>Editors say the programs have inspired newsrooms to be more deliberate in their current coverage, leaving names out when not relevant and thinking through the consequences of photos in crime stories.</p><p>Saun Hough, director of partnerships for Californians for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group that has fought for <a href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2024/03/california-criminal-records-expungement-law/" data-link-name="in body link">mass expungements</a>, said reporters often capture a one-sided, law enforcement narrative about an arrest, then fail to follow up. Someone jailed for drug trafficking may ultimately be convicted of possession, or a woman arrested for prostitution could later be confirmed a sex-trafficking survivor, he said. It can take years for cases to be adjudicated, but a report based on an initial arrest might be the story that follows someone through life.</p><p>“It creates this constant sense of anxiety that many people live with,” said Hough, noting that crime stories generally lack context about a person’s traumas or struggles that led to the incident. “People wake up every day and pray that they don’t have to talk about what the newspaper wrote about their arrest and relive that. You have this thought in your mind that you’re one Google [search] away from everything being ripped away.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
