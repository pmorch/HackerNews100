<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>I was an early employee at CircleCI. I have used, in anger, nearly every CI system that has ever existed. Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI, Semaphore, Drone, Concourse, Wercker (remember Wercker?), TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab CI, CodeBuild, and probably a half dozen others I’ve mercifully forgotten. I have mass-tested these systems so that you don’t have to, and I have the scars to show for it, and I am here to tell you: GitHub Actions is not good. It’s not even fine. It has market share because it’s <em>right there</em> in your repo, and that’s about the nicest thing I can say about it.</p>
<p>Buildkite is what CI should feel like. But first, let me tell you what CI should <em>not</em> feel like.</p>
<h2 id="if-youre-a-nix-shop-you-can-leave-early">If You’re a Nix Shop, You Can Leave Early</h2>
<p>Before I get into it: if you’re a Nix shop, take a look at <a href="https://garnix.io/">Garnix</a>. It evaluates your flake, figures out what needs building, and builds it. No YAML. No pipeline configuration. It just looks at your <code>flake.nix</code> and does the right thing. Sometimes the best CI configuration is no CI configuration.</p>
<p>Most shops are not Nix shops. This post is for the rest of you. I’m sorry.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="part-i-the-descent">Part I: The Descent</h2>
<h2 id="the-log-viewer-or-where-your-afternoon-goes-to-die">The Log Viewer, or: Where Your Afternoon Goes to Die</h2>
<p>Let me start with the most visceral thing, the thing that will sound like I’m exaggerating but I am not.</p>
<p>Your build fails. You get a red X on your pull request. You click through to see what happened. This is where the ordeal begins.</p>
<p>First you land on the checks summary page, which shows you a list of workflow runs. Maybe one failed. Maybe three failed. You click the one that looks relevant. Now you’re on the workflow run page, which shows you a list of jobs. You click the failed job. Now you’re on the job page, which shows you a list of steps, all collapsed. You click the step that failed. The page hitches. You scroll. There is a pause, a held breath, and then the logs appear, slowly, like a manuscript being revealed one line at a time to a supplicant who has not yet proven worthy.</p>
<p>That’s three or four clicks just to see the error, and every one of them loads a new page with its own loading spinner, and none of them are fast. You are navigating a bureaucracy. You are filling out forms at the DMV of CI.</p>
<p>And then the log viewer itself. I have used every CI system known to man, and the GitHub Actions log viewer is the only one that has <em>crashed my browser</em>. Not once. Repeatedly. Reliably. Open a long build log, try to search for an error, and Chrome will look you in the eye and die. This is the log viewer for the most popular CI system in the world. This is the tool you are expected to use to understand why your build failed. It cannot survive contact with its own output.</p>
<p>With large logs (and if you have a real build system, you have large logs) you often can’t even scroll to the bottom. The page just gives up. The scrollbar is there, technically, but it’s decorative. It’s a suggestion. You drag it down and the page chokes and stutters and eventually you realize you’re not going to get there this way. So you download the raw log artifact and open it in a text editor like it’s 2003 and you’re reading Apache access logs on a shared hosting box. Except it’s 2025 and this is a product made by one of the richest companies on earth.</p>
<p>And when you’re done, when you’ve finally found the error, processed your grief, and want to go back to the pull request that started this whole ordeal, you hit the back button. Does it take you to the PR? No. It takes you to some other page in the GitHub Actions UI. A summary page, maybe. Or a different run. Or a page you don’t recognize. The back button in the GitHub Actions UI is a roulette wheel. You will land somewhere. It will not be where you wanted to go. You will click the back button again. You will land somewhere else. Eventually you give up and type the PR URL from memory or go find it in your browser history, which is now 80% GitHub Actions URLs, a fact that will haunt you when you look at it later.</p>
<p>So the logs have betrayed you, or perhaps they simply could not be made to appear at all. Now begins the second ritual: the debugging.</p>
<p>You push a commit. You wait. A runner picks it up. You watch logs scroll. Something fails. The error looks like someone fed a stack trace through a paper shredder and then set the shredder on fire. You add a <code>run: env</code> step to see what’s going on. You push again. You wait again. A twenty-minute feedback loop for a one-line change. You do this fourteen times. This is your afternoon now. You had plans. You were going to go outside. The afternoon belongs to the CI now. It has always belonged to the CI. You are only now perceiving this truth.</p>
<p>There is something devotional about the experience. You approach the logs. You make your offering of clicks and patience. The page considers your request. Sometimes it grants you the knowledge you seek. Sometimes it takes your browser tab instead, a small sacrifice, consumed, gone. You open a new tab. You try again. This is the ritual. You did not choose it. The work continues.</p>
<h2 id="the-yaml-trap">The YAML Trap</h2>
<p>Every CI system eventually becomes “a bunch of YAML.” I’ve been through the five stages of grief about it and emerged on the other side, diminished but functional. But GitHub Actions YAML is a special breed. It’s YAML with its own expression language bolted on, its own context object model, its own string interpolation rules, and a scattering of gotchas that will slowly hollow you out as a person. Each gotcha leaves a mark. The marks do not fade.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to conditionally set an environment variable based on which branch you’re on? Have you done the <code>${{ }}</code> expression dance, misquoted something, and then waited four minutes for a runner to spin up just to discover your string got eaten? Of course you have. We all have. We have all stared at a diff that changes one character in a YAML expression and thought “I went to college for this.”</p>
<p>The expression syntax has the quality of a language that grew in the dark, unsupervised. It began as a convenience. It accreted features. Somewhere along the way it crossed a threshold, and now it exists in a liminal space- too complex to be configuration, too constrained to be a proper language. You learn its grammar not from documentation but from failure, each error message a koan that points toward understanding but does not provide it.</p>
<h2 id="but-the-marketplace">”But the Marketplace!”</h2>
<p>Ah yes, the GitHub Actions Marketplace. The npm of CI. A bazaar of community-maintained actions of varying quality, most of which are shell scripts with a <code>Dockerfile</code> and a dream.</p>
<p>Every time you type <code>uses: some-stranger/cool-action@v2</code>, you’re handing a stranger access to your repo, your secrets, and your build environment. Yes, you can pin to a SHA. Nobody does. And even if you do, you’re still running opaque code you didn’t write and probably haven’t read, in a context where it has access to your <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and whatever else you’ve stuffed in there. Every action you add is another set of house keys you’re handing to someone you’ve never met and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>The Marketplace has the energy of a night market in a city you don’t know, where every stall sells something that claims to solve your problem. Some of them do. Some of them have other intentions. You cannot tell which is which from the outside. You can only install them and see what happens. This is called “dependency management.” We have normalized it. The normalization does not make it safe.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-own-your-compute">You Don’t Own Your Compute</h2>
<p>With GitHub Actions, you’re renting Microsoft’s runners. They’re slow, they’re resource-constrained, you can’t customize them in any meaningful way, and you’re at the mercy of GitHub’s capacity planning. Need a beefy machine for a big build? You can pay for a larger runner, at prices that will get you a calendar invite from finance titled “we need to talk,” and you still don’t control the environment.</p>
<p>You know how I know GitHub’s runners are bad? Because there’s an entire cottage industry of companies whose sole product is “GitHub Actions, but the runners don’t suck.” Namespace, Blacksmith, Actuated, Runs-on, BuildJet. There are at least half a dozen startups that exist purely to solve the problem of GitHub Actions being slow. Their pitch is, essentially, “keep your workflows, we’ll just make them not take forever.” The fact that this is a viable business model, that multiple companies can sustain themselves on the premise that the default compute for the world’s most popular CI system is inadequate, tells you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, you <em>can</em> bring your own runners to GitHub Actions. Self-hosted runners exist. You can set up your own machines, install Nix, configure your environment exactly how you want it. And this does solve the compute problem. Your builds will be faster. Your caches will be warm. But you’ll still be writing GitHub Actions YAML. You’ll still be fighting the expression syntax and the permissions model and the marketplace and the log viewer that crashes your browser. You’ve upgraded the engine but you’re still driving the car that catches fire when you turn on the radio.</p>
<p>I think the people who originally built GitHub Actions were probably well-intentioned. They probably cared about developer experience. But this is a Microsoft product now, and Microsoft is where ambitious developer tools go to become enterprise SKUs. The original engineers have long since been reorged into other divisions or ground down into product managers. The vision, if there was one, is entombed now. But if you press your ear to the floor during a particularly slow build, you can still hear its heart beating, faintly, beneath the floorboards.</p>
<h2 id="the-little-things">The Little Things</h2>
<p>Things that seem small but accumulate. Each one is survivable. Together they form a compelling case for simply walking into the sea. The sea does not have YAML. The sea does not require a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>actions/cache</code> action is an exercise in futility. Cache keys are confusing, cache misses are silent, and cache eviction is opaque. You will spend more time debugging caching than you save by having a cache.</p>
<p>Reusable workflows can’t be nested beyond a certain depth, can’t access the calling workflow’s context cleanly, and live in YAML files that are impossible to test in isolation. At some point you realize you’re writing a distributed system in YAML and you have to sit down and think about the choices that led you here. The thinking changes you. You do not get the old version of yourself back. That person didn’t know what a <code>workflow_call</code> trigger was. That person was happy.</p>
<p>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> permissions model is a maze. <code>permissions: write-all</code> is a hammer, fine-grained permissions are a puzzle, and the interaction between repository settings, workflow settings, and job-level settings will make you want to lie down on the floor. I once spent an entire day on token permissions. I will never get that day back. It’s gone. I could have learned to paint. I could have called my mother. I could have mass-tested a new CI system. Anything.</p>
<p>Concurrency controls are blunt. Cancel in-progress runs on the same branch? Sure, one line. Anything more nuanced? No. The system does not wish to discuss nuance. The system has other concerns.</p>
<p>Secrets can’t be used in <code>if</code> conditions. This means you can’t do things like <code>if: secrets.DEPLOY_KEY != ''</code> to conditionally run a step based on whether a secret is configured. GitHub doesn’t want secret values leaking into logs via expression evaluation, which is a reasonable security concern. But the practical result is that you can’t write workflows that gracefully degrade when optional secrets aren’t present. Instead you need awkward workarounds like setting a non-secret environment variable that flags whether the real secret exists. It’s one of those decisions that makes perfect sense in a security review and makes you want to scream when you’re actually trying to write a workflow that works in both forks and the main repo.</p>
<h2 id="just-write-bash-scripts">”Just Write Bash Scripts”</h2>
<p>At some point in every engineer’s CI journey, a temptation presents itself.</p>
<p>“What if I just wrote bash scripts?” the voice whispers. “What if I stopped fighting the CI system and just <code>run:</code>’d a big shell script that does everything? I could run it locally. I could test it. I’d be free.”</p>
<p>I understand the appeal. I have felt it myself, late at night, after the fourth failed workflow run in a row. The desire to burn down the YAML temple and return to the simple honest earth of <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and <code>set -euo pipefail</code>. To cast off the chains of marketplace actions and reusable workflows and just <em>write the damn commands</em>. It feels like liberation. It is not.</p>
<p>Here’s what actually happens. Your bash script works. You feel clever. You tell your coworkers about it. Then the script grows. It acquires conditionals. It acquires functions. It acquires argument parsing. It acquires a second script that it sources. Someone adds error handling. Someone else adds logging. Someone (and this person should be stopped, but never is) adds “just a little bit of parallelism.”</p>
<p>Three months later you have 800 lines of bash that reimplements job parallelism with <code>wait</code> and PID files, has its own retry logic built on a <code>for</code> loop and <code>sleep</code>, and parses its own output to determine success or failure. The script has become self-aware. There’s a race condition in the cleanup trap that only manifests on Linux kernel 6.x, and you are the only person who understands the script, and you are on vacation, and your phone is ringing.</p>
<p>You have not escaped CI. You have built a CI system. It’s just worse than every other CI system, because it’s written in bash, and nobody can follow it, and it has no test framework, and <code>shellcheck</code> is screaming into the void, and the void is also written in bash.</p>
<p>Bash is fine for glue. Bash is fine for “run these four commands in order.” Bash is not a build system. Bash is not a test harness. The fact that it can be coerced into impersonating both is not a recommendation. It’s a warning sign. You are not simplifying. You are moving complexity from a place with guardrails to a place with none. The complexity will not be grateful for its new freedom. The complexity will use its freedom to make your life worse.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="part-ii-the-emergence">Part II: The Emergence</h2>
<p>There are other ways to live. Buildkite is what CI should feel like. Not joyful, nothing about CI is joyful, but <em>tolerable</em>. A tool that understands its purpose and does not fight you. Let me tell you how the other half lives.</p>
<h2 id="a-log-viewer-that-does-not-consume-your-browser">A Log Viewer That Does Not Consume Your Browser</h2>
<p>Buildkite’s log viewer is just a web page that shows you logs and doesn’t crash. I realize that’s a low bar. It’s a bar that GitHub Actions trips over and falls face-first into the mud, gets up, slips again, and somehow sets the mud on fire.</p>
<p>The terminal output rendering is excellent. Build logs look like terminal output, because they are terminal output. ANSI colors work. Your test framework’s fancy formatting comes through intact. You’re not squinting at a web UI that has eaten your escape codes and rendered them as mojibake. This sounds minor. It is not minor. You are reading build logs dozens of times a day. The experience of reading them matters in the way that a comfortable chair matters. You only notice how much it matters after you’ve been sitting in a bad one for six hours and your back has filed a formal complaint.</p>
<p>Annotations let your build steps write rich Markdown output (test failure summaries, coverage reports, deploy links,) right into the build page. You don’t have to dig through log output to find the thing you care about. The information comes to you. After years of fighting GitHub Actions’ collapsible log groups and wondering which of the seventeen nested folds contains the actual error message, this feels like stepping out of a cave into sunlight.</p>
<p>And debugging? Buildkite doesn’t make CI debugging fun. Nothing does. Nothing can. It is one of the irreducible sufferings of our craft. But because the agent runs on your infrastructure, you can SSH into the box. You can look at what’s actually happening. You can reproduce the environment locally because <em>you built the environment</em>. You are still mortal, but at least you have tools.</p>
<h2 id="yaml-that-knows-its-place">YAML That Knows Its Place</h2>
<p>Buildkite has YAML too, but the difference is that Buildkite’s YAML is <em>just describing a pipeline</em>. Steps, commands, plugins. It’s a data structure, not a programming language cosplaying as a config format. When you need actual logic? You write a script. In a real language. That you can run locally. Like a human being with dignity and a will to live.</p>
<p>This is the boundary the bash zealots were actually looking for: not “put everything in bash,” but “put the orchestration in config and the logic in code.” Buildkite respects this boundary. GitHub Actions blurs it until you can no longer tell where configuration ends and programming begins, and then the programming happens in a language that can’t do basic arithmetic without <code>${{ }}</code> and a prayer.</p>
<h2 id="you-own-your-compute">You Own Your Compute</h2>
<p>With Buildkite, the agent is a single binary that runs on <em>your</em> machines. Your cloud, your on-prem boxes, your weird custom hardware. You control the instance types, the caching, the local storage, the network. Run agents on a fleet of massive EC2 instances with NVMe drives and 20 gigs of Docker layer cache. Run them on a Raspberry Pi. It doesn’t care. The fastest CI is the one with a warm cache on a big machine that you control.</p>
<p>You don’t see a cottage industry of “Buildkite, but faster.” You don’t need one. You just run bigger machines.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions will never give you this. GitHub Actions will give you a mass-produced Ubuntu VM with the emotional warmth of a hospital waiting room.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-running-your-own-infrastructure">A Note on Running Your Own Infrastructure</h3>
<p>I can hear the objection forming: “But I don’t want to run my own CI infrastructure. I just want to push code and have tests run.”</p>
<p>Fair. Running your own agents is not for everyone. If you’re maintaining a small open source library in your spare time, you shouldn’t have to spin up EC2 instances and manage autoscaling groups. GitHub Actions’ free tier for public repos is genuinely valuable for the OSS ecosystem, and I’m not here to tell a solo maintainer they need to set up Terraform to run their unit tests.</p>
<p>This post is mostly aimed at teams running production systems at businesses, places where you’re already managing infrastructure, where CI time is measured in engineering hours lost per week, where the build that takes 45 minutes is costing you real money in both compute and salary. If that’s you, the overhead of running Buildkite agents pays for itself quickly. If you’re publishing a 200-line npm package on your weekends, the calculus is different and that’s fine.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-pipelines">Dynamic Pipelines</h2>
<p>In Buildkite, pipeline steps are just data. You can <em>generate them</em>.</p>
<p>Your pipeline YAML can contain a step that runs a script, and that script can emit more pipeline steps. Dynamically. At runtime. Based on whatever logic you want: which files changed, what day of the week it is, the phase of the moon, whether the build gods are feeling merciful.</p>
<p>So you write a script that looks at your monorepo, figures out what changed, and uploads exactly the right set of steps for the things that need building and testing. No hardcoded matrix. No <code>if: contains(github.event.pull_request...)</code> spaghetti. Just a program that outputs steps.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions has <code>matrix</code> strategies and <code>if</code> conditions and reusable workflows and all sorts of mechanisms that try to approximate this. They’re all worse. They’re declarative in the worst sense: you’re declaring things in a language that isn’t powerful enough to express what you mean, so you end up building a Rube Goldberg machine out of YAML and regret. The machine grows. You feed it. It does not thank you.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-matter-of-plugins">On the Matter of Plugins</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest: Buildkite’s plugin system is structurally pretty similar to the GitHub Actions Marketplace. You’re still pulling in third-party code from a repo. You’re still trusting someone else’s work. I won’t pretend there’s some magic architectural difference that makes this safe.</p>
<p>The real difference is narrower than I’d like: Buildkite plugins tend to be thin shell hooks rather than entire Docker images with their own runtime, so there’s less surface area to hide things in, and you can usually read the whole plugin in a few minutes. More importantly, they run on <em>your</em> infrastructure, so at least the blast radius is something you control. It’s not a solved problem. It’s a smaller problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-small-delights">The Small Delights</h2>
<p>Buildkite has custom emoji. You can put a little <code>:parrot:</code> or <code>:docker:</code> or your team’s custom emoji next to your pipeline steps. This is, objectively, a frivolous feature. It is also one of my favorite things about Buildkite, because it tells you something about the people who built it. They thought about what it <em>feels like</em> to use their product. They knew that CI is a slog and that a small dumb thing like a custom emoji next to your deploy step can make the slog a fraction more bearable.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions would never do this. GitHub Actions is a product designed by a committee that has never once asked “but is it delightful?” and it shows.</p>
<p>Buildkite is built by people who clearly use CI every day and have thought hard about what makes it tolerable. The result is a tool that, if not exactly joyful, at least does not make you want to lie down on the floor. In this industry, that’s high praise.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="but-everyone-uses-it">But Everyone Uses It!</h2>
<p>Yeah. GitHub Actions won by being the default, not by being good. It’s free for public repos, it’s built into the platform everyone already uses, and it’s Good Enough. It’s the Internet Explorer of CI. It ships with the thing. People use it because switching costs are real and life is finite and we’re all just trying to ship code and go home.</p>
<p>If you’re a small team with a simple app and straightforward tests, it’s probably fine. I’m not going to tell you to rip it out.</p>
<p>But if you’re running a real production system, if you have a monorepo, if your builds take more than five minutes, if you care about supply chain security, if you want to actually <em>own</em> your CI: look at Buildkite.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for a long time. I’ve watched CI systems come and go. I’ve helped build one. The pattern is always the same: the CI system that wins market share is never the one that’s best at being a CI system. It’s the one that’s easiest to start using.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions is the easiest CI to start using. Buildkite is the best CI to keep using. And in the long run (assuming your CI hasn’t already ground you into a fine paste, assuming the YAML hasn’t hollowed you out entirely, assuming there’s still someone left who remembers what it was like before,) that’s what matters.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If your CI works and you’re happy, great, keep going. But if you’ve got that nagging feeling that it’s fighting you more than helping you: you’re not the problem. The tooling is. There are other ways to live.</em></p>   </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing a four-part article for Field Newspaper Syndicate at the<br>
beginning of each year for several years now and in 1980, mindful of the<br>
approach of the year 1984, FNS asked me to write a thorough critique of<br>
George Orwell's novel <i>1984</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reluctant. I remembered almost nothing of the book and said 
so -<br>
but Denison Demac, the lovely young woman who is my contact at FNS, simply<br>
sent me a copy of it and said, 'Read it.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So I read it and found myself absolutely astonished at what I read. 
I<br>
wondered how many people who talked about the novel so glibly had ever read<br>
it; or if they had, whether they remembered it at all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt I would have to write the critique if only to set people 
straight.<br>
(I'm sorry; I love setting people straight.)</p><p>

A. THE WRITING OF 1984<br>
In 1949, a book entitled <i>1984</i> was published. It was written by Eric Arthur<br>
Blair under the pseudonym of George Orwell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The book attempted to show what life would be like in a world of 
total<br>
evil, in which those controlling the government kept themselves in power by<br>
brute force, by distorting the truth, by continually rewriting history, by<br>
mesmerising the people generally.<br>
&nbsp;This evil world was placed only thirty-five years in the future so that<br>
even men who were already in their early middle age at the time the book was<br>
published might live to see it if they lived out a normal lifetime.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I, for instance, was already a married man when the book appeared 
and yet<br>
here we are less than four years away from that apocalyptic year (for '1984'<br>
has become a year that is associated with dread because of Orwell's book),<br>
and I am very likely to live to see it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter, I will discuss the book, but first: Who was 
Blair/Orwell<br>
and why was the book written?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blair was born in 1903 into the status of a British gentleman. His 
father<br>
was in the Indian civil service and Blair himself lived the life of a<br>
British Imperial official. He went to Eton, served in Burma, and so on.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he lacked the money to be an English gentleman to the 
full.<br>
Then, too, he didn't want to spend his time at dull desk jobs; he wanted to<br>
be a writer. Thirdly, he felt guilty about his status in the upper class.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So he did in the late 1920s what so many well-to-do American young 
people<br>
in the 1960s did. In short, he became what we would have called a 'hippie'<br>
at a later time. He lived under slum conditions in London and Paris,<br>
consorted with and identified with slum dwellers and vagrants, managed to<br>
ease his conscience and, at the same time, to gather material for his<br>
earliest books.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He also turned left wing and became a socialist, fighting with the<br>
loyalists in Spain in the 1930s. There he found himself caught up in the<br>
sectarian struggles between the various left-wing factions, and since he<br>
believed in a gentlemanly English form of socialism, he was inevitably on<br>
the losing side. Opposed to him were passionate Spanish anarchists,<br>
syndicalists, and communists, who bitterly resented the fact that the<br>
necessities of fighting the Franco fascists got in the way of their fighting<br>
each other.<br>
The communists, who were the best organised, won out and Orwell had to leave<br>
Spain, for he was convinced that if he did not, he would be killed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From then on, to the end of his life, he carried on a private 
literary<br>
war with the communists, determined to win in words the battle he had lost<br>
in action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; During World War II, in which he was rejected for military service, 
he<br>
was associated with the left wing of the British Labour party, but didn't<br>
much sympathise with their views, for even their reckless version of<br>
socialism seemed too well organised for him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn't much affected, apparently, by the Nazi brand of<br>
totalitarianism, for there was no room within him except for his private war<br>
with Stalinist communism. Consequently, when Great Britain was fighting for<br>
its life against Nazism, and the Soviet Union fought as an ally in the<br>
struggle and contributed rather more than its share in lives lost and in<br>
resolute courage, Orwell wrote <i>Animal Farm</i> which was a satire of the Russian<br>
Revolution and what followed, picturing it in terms of a revolt of barnyard<br>
animals against human masters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He completed <i>Animal Farm</i> in 1944 and had trouble finding a 
publisher<br>
since it wasn't a particularly good time for upsetting the Soviets. As soon<br>
as the war came to an end, however, the Soviet Union was fair game and<br>
<i>Animal Farm </i>was published. It was greeted with much acclaim and Orwell<br>
became sufficiently prosperous to retire and devote himself to his<br>
masterpiece,<i> 1984</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That book described society as a vast world-wide extension of 
Stalinist<br>
Russia in the 1930s, pictured with the venom of a rival left-wing sectarian.<br>
Other forms of totalitarianism play a small role. There are one or two<br>
mentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition. At the very start, there is a<br>
reference or two to Jews, almost as though they were going to prove the<br>
objects of persecution, but that vanishes almost at once, as though Orwell<br>
didn't want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture is of Stalinism, and Stalinism only.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time the book came out in 1949, the Cold War was at its 
height.<br>
The book therefore proved popular. It was almost a matter of patriotism in<br>
the West to buy it and talk about it, and perhaps even to read parts of it,<br>
although it is my opinion that more people bought it and talked about it<br>
than read it, for it is a dreadfully dull book - didactic, repetitious, and<br>
all but motionless.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was most popular at first with people who leaned towards the<br>
conservative side of the political spectrum, for it was clearly an<br>
anti-Soviet polemic, and the picture of life it projected in the London of<br>
1984 was very much as conservatives imagined life in the Moscow of 1949 to<br>
be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; During the McCarthy era in the United States, 1984 became 
increasingly<br>
popular with those who leaned towards the liberal side of the political<br>
spectrum, for it seemed to them that the United States of the early 1950s<br>
was beginning to move in the direction of thought-control and that all the<br>
viciousness Orwell had depicted was on its way towards us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in an afterword to an edition published in paperback by New<br>
American Library in 1961, the liberal psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich<br>
Fromm concluded as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most<br>
unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted <i>1984</i> as another description of<br>
Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Stalinism and McCarthyism are disregarded, however, more 
and more<br>
Americans were becoming aware of just how 'big' the government was getting;<br>
how high taxes were; how increasingly rules and regulations permeated<br>
business and even ordinary life; how information concerning every facet of<br>
private life was entering the files not only of government bureaux but of<br>
private credit systems.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>1984,</i> therefore, came to stand not for Stalinism, or even for<br>
dictatorship in general - but merely for government. Even governmental<br>
paternalism seemed '1984ish' and the catch phrase 'Big Brother is watching<br>
you' came to mean everything that was too big for the individual to control.<br>
It was not only big government and big business that was a symptom of 1984<br>
but big science, big labour, big anything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, so thoroughly has 1984-ophobia penetrated the 
consciousness of<br>
many who have not read the book and have no notion of what it contains, that<br>
one wonders what will happen to us after 31 December 1984. When New Year's<br>
Day of 1985 arrives and the United States is still in existence and facing<br>
very much the problems it faces today, how will we express our fears of<br>
whatever aspect of life fills us with apprehension? What new date can we<br>
invent to take the place of 1984?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell did not live to see his book become the success it did. He 
did not<br>
witness the way in which he made 1984 into a year that would haunt a whole<br>
generation of Americans. Orwell died of tuberculosis in a London hospital in<br>
January 1950, just a few months after the book was published, at the age of<br>
forty-six. His awareness of imminent death may have added to the bitterness<br>
of the book.</p><p>

B. THE SCIENCE FICTION OF 1984<br>
Many people think of <i>1984 </i>as a science fiction novel, but almost the only<br>
item about<i> 1984</i> that would lead one to suppose this is the fact that it is<br>
purportedly laid in the future. Not so! Orwell had no feel for the future,<br>
and the displacement of the story is much more geographical than temporal.<br>
The London in which the story is placed is not so much moved thirty-five<br>
years forward in time, from 1949 to 1984, as it is moved a thousand miles<br>
east in space to Moscow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell imagines Great Britain to have gone through a revolution 
similar<br>
to the Russian Revolution and to have gone through all the stages that<br>
Soviet development did. He can think of almost no variations on the theme.<br>
The Soviets had a series of purges in the 1930s, so the Ingsoc (English<br>
Socialism) had a series of purges in the 1950s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries, Leon Trotsky, 
into a<br>
villain, leaving his opponent, Joseph Stalin, as a hero. The Ingsoc,<br>
therefore, convert one of their revolutionaries, Emmanuel Goldstein, into a<br>
villain, leaving his opponent, with a moustache like Stalin, as a hero.<br>
There is no ability to make minor changes, even. Goldstein, like Trotsky,<br>
has 'a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a<br>
small goatee beard'. Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue by<br>
giving Stalin a different name so he calls him merely 'Big Brother'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very beginning of the story, it is made clear that 
television<br>
(which was coming into existence at the time the book was written) served as<br>
a continuous means of indoctrination of the people, for sets cannot be<br>
turned off. (And, apparently, in a deteriorating London in which nothing<br>
works, these sets never fail.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The great Orwellian contribution to future technology is that the<br>
television set is two-way, and that the people who are forced to hear and<br>
see the television screen can themselves be heard and seen at all times and<br>
are under constant supervision even while sleeping or in the bathroom.<br>
Hence, the meaning of the phrase 'Big Brother is watching you'.<br>
This is an extraordinarily inefficient system of keeping everyone under<br>
control. To have a person being watched at all times means that some other<br>
person must be doing the watching at all times (at least in the Orwellian<br>
society) and must be doing so very narrowly, for there is a great<br>
development of the art of interpreting gesture and facial expression.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One person cannot watch more than one person in full concentration, 
and<br>
can only do so for a comparatively short time before attention begins to<br>
wander. I should guess, in short, that there may have to be five watchers<br>
for every person watched. And then, of course, the watchers must themselves<br>
be watched since no one in the Orwellian world is suspicion-free.<br>
Consequently, the system of oppression by two-way television simply will not<br>
work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell himself realised this by limiting its workings to the Party<br>
members. The 'proles' (proletariat), for whom Orwell cannot hide his British<br>
upper-class contempt, are left largely to themselves as subhuman. (At one<br>
point in the book, he says that any prole that shows ability is killed - a<br>
leaf taken out of the Spartan treatment of their helots<br>
twenty-five hundred years ago.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, he has a system of volunteer spies in which children 
report<br>
on their parents, and neighbours on each other. This cannot possibly work<br>
well since eventually everyone reports everyone else and it all has to be<br>
abandoned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell was unable to conceive of computers or robots, or he would 
have<br>
placed everyone under non-human surveillance. Our own computers to some<br>
extent do this in the IRS, in credit files, and so on, but that does not<br>
take us towards <i>1984</i>, except in fevered imaginations. Computers and tyranny<br>
do not necessarily go hand in hand. Tyrannies have worked very well without<br>
computers (consider the Nazis) and the most computerised nations in today's<br>
world are also the least tyrannical.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell lacks the capacity to see (or invent) small changes. His 
hero<br>
finds it difficult in his world of 1984 to get shoelaces or razor blades. So<br>
would I in the real world of the 1980s, for so many people use slip-on shoes<br>
and electric razors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, too, Orwell had the technophobic fixation that every 
technological<br>
advance is a slide downhill. Thus, when his hero writes, he 'fitted a nib<br>
into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. He does so 'because<br>
of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with<br>
a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Presumably, the 'ink-pencil' is the ball-point pen that was coming 
into<br>
use at the time that <i>1984 </i>was being written. This means that Orwell<br>
describes something as being written' with a real nib but being 'scratched'<br>
with a ball-point. This is, however, precisely the reverse of the truth. If<br>
you are old enough to remember steel pens, you will remember that they<br>
scratched fearsomely, and you know ball-points don't.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not science fiction, but a distorted nostalgia for a past 
that<br>
never was. I am surprised that Orwell stopped with the steel pen and that he<br>
didn't have Winston writing with a neat goose quill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor was Orwell particularly prescient in the strictly social 
aspects of<br>
the future he was presenting, with the result that the Orwellian world of<br>
<i>1984</i> is incredibly old-fashioned when compared with the real world of the<br>
1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell imagines no new vices, for instance. His characters are all 
gin<br>
hounds and tobacco addicts, and part of the horror of his picture of 1984 is<br>
his eloquent description of the low quality of the gin and tobacco.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He foresees no new drugs, no marijuana, no synthetic hallucinogens. 
No<br>
one expects an s.f. writer to be precise and exact in his forecasts, but<br>
surely one would expect him to invent some differences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his despair (or anger), Orwell forgets the virtues human beings 
have.<br>
All his characters are, in one way or another, weak or sadistic, or sleazy,<br>
or stupid, or repellent. This may be how most people are, or how Orwell<br>
wants to indicate they will all be under tyranny, but it seems to me that<br>
under even the worst tyrannies, so far, there have been brave men and women<br>
who have withstood the tyrants to the death and whose personal histories are<br>
luminous flames in the surrounding darkness. If only because there is no<br>
hint of this in 1984, it does not resemble the real world of the 1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor did he foresee any difference in the role of women or any 
weakening<br>
of the feminine stereotype of 1949. There are only two female characters of<br>
importance. One is a strong, brainless 'prole' woman who is an endless<br>
washerwoman, endlessly singing a popular song with words of the type<br>
familiar in the 1930s and 1940s (at which Orwell shudders fastidiously as<br>
'trashy', in blissful non-anticipation of hard rock).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other is the heroine, Julia, who is sexually promiscuous (but 
is at<br>
least driven to courage by her interest in sex) and is otherwise brainless.<br>
When the hero, Winston, reads to her the book within a book that explains<br>
the nature of the Orwellian world, she responds by falling asleep - but then<br>
since the treatise Winston reads is stupefyingly soporific, this may be an<br>
indication of Julia's good sense rather than the reverse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, if 1984 must be considered science fiction, then it is 
very bad<br>
science fiction.</p><p>

C. THE GOVERNMENT OF <i>1984</i><br>
Orwell's <i>1984</i> is a picture of all-powerful government, and it has helped<br>
make the notion of 'big government' a very frightening one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to remember, though, that the world of the late 1940s, 
during<br>
which Orwell was writing his book, was one in which there had been, and<br>
still were, big governments with true tyrants - individuals whose every<br>
wish, however unjust, cruel or vicious, was law. What's more, it seemed as<br>
though such tyrants were irremovable except by the chance of outside force.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Benito Mussolini of Italy, after twenty-one years of absolute rule, 
was<br>
overthrown, but that was only because his country was suffering defeat in<br>
war.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolf Hitler of Germany, a far stronger and more brutal tyrant, 
ruled<br>
with a steel hand for twelve years, yet even defeat did not, in itself,<br>
bring about his overthrow. Though the area over which he ruled shrank and<br>
shrank and shrank, and even though overwhelming armies of his adversaries<br>
closed in from the east and west, he remained absolute tyrant over whatever<br>
area he controlled - even when it was only over the bunker in which he<br>
committed suicide. Until he removed himself, no one dared remove him. (There<br>
were plots against him, to be sure, but they never worked, sometimes through<br>
quirks of fate that seemed explainable only by supposing that someone down<br>
there liked him.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell, however, had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler. His 
enemy<br>
was Stalin, and at the time that 1984 was published, Stalin had ruled the<br>
Soviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty-five years, had survived a<br>
terrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now<br>
stronger than ever. To Orwell, it must have seemed that neither time nor<br>
fortune could budge Stalin, but that he would live on forever with ever<br>
increasing strength. - And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, that was not the way it really was. Orwell didn't live 
long<br>
enough to see it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published,<br>
and it was not long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny<br>
by - guess who - the Soviet leadership.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviet Union is still the Soviet Union, but it is not 
Stalinist, and<br>
the enemies of the state are no longer liquidated (Orwell uses 'vaporised'<br>
instead, such small changes being all he can manage) with quite such<br>
abandon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Mao Tse-tung died in China, and while he himself has not 
been<br>
openly denounced, his close associates, as 'the Gang of Four', were promptly<br>
demoted from Divinity, and while China is still China, it is not Maoist any<br>
longer.<br>
Franco of Spain died in his bed and while, to his very last breath, he<br>
remained the unquestioned leader he had been for nearly forty years,<br>
immediately after that last breath, Fascism abruptly dwindled in Spain, as<br>
it had in Portugal after Salazar's death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Big Brothers do die, or at least they have so far, and 
when<br>
they die, the government changes, always for the milder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to say that new tyrants may not make themselves felt, 
but<br>
they will die, too. At least in the real 1980s we have every confidence they<br>
will and the undying Big Brother is not yet a real threat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything, in fact, governments of the 1980s seem dangerously 
weak. The<br>
advance of technology has put powerful weapons - explosives, machine guns,<br>
fast cars into the hands of urban terrorists who can and do kidnap, hijack,<br>
gun down, and take hostages with impunity while governments stand by more or<br>
less helplessly.<br>
In addition to the immortality of Big Brother, Orwell presents two other<br>
ways of maintaining an eternal tyranny.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; First -,present someone or something to hate. In the Orwellian 
world it<br>
was Emmanuel Goldstein for whom hate was built up and orchestrated in a<br>
robotized mass function.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is nothing new, of course. Every nation in the world has used<br>
various neighbours for the purpose of hate. This sort of thing is so easily<br>
handled and comes as such second nature to humanity that one wonders why<br>
there have to be the organised hate drives in the Orwellian world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs scarcely any clever psychological mass movements to make 
Arabs<br>
hate Israelis and Greeks hate Turks and Catholic Irish hate Protestant<br>
Irish - and vice versa in each case. To be sure, the Nazis organised mass<br>
meetings of delirium that every participant seemed to enjoy, but it had no<br>
permanent effect. Once the war moved on to German soil, the Germans<br>
surrendered as meekly as though they had never Sieg-Heiled in their lives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Second - rewrite history. Almost every one of the few individuals 
we meet<br>
in 1984 has, as his job, the rapid rewriting of the past, the readjustment<br>
of statistics, the overhauling of newspapers - as though anyone is going to<br>
take the trouble to pay attention to the past anyway.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This Orwellian preoccupation with the minutiae of 'historical 
proof' is<br>
typical of the political sectarian who is always quoting what has been said<br>
and done in the past to prove a point to someone on the other side who is<br>
always quoting something to the opposite effect that has been said and done.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As any politician knows, no evidence of any kind is ever required. 
It is<br>
only necessary to make a statement - any statement - forcefully enough to<br>
have an audience believe it. No one will check the lie against the facts,<br>
and, if they do, they will disbelieve the facts. Do you think the German<br>
people in 1939 pretended that the Poles had attacked them and started World<br>
War II? No! Since they were told that was so, they believed it as seriously<br>
as you and I believe that they attacked the Poles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure, the Soviets put out new editions of their Encyclopaedia 
in<br>
which politicians rating a long biography in earlier editions are suddenly<br>
omitted entirely, and this is no doubt the germ of the Orwellian notion, but<br>
the chances of carrying it as far as is described in 1984 seem to me to be<br>
nil - not because it is beyond human wickedness, but because it is totally<br>
unnecessary.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell makes much of 'Newspeak' as an organ of repression - the<br>
conversion of the English language into so limited and abbreviated an<br>
instrument that the very vocabulary of dissent vanishes. Partly he got the<br>
notion from the undoubted habit of abbreviation. He gives examples of<br>
'Communist International' becoming 'Comintern' and 'Geheime Staatspolizei'<br>
becoming 'Gestapo', but that is not a modern totalitarian invention. 'Vulgus<br>
mobile' became 'mob'; 'taxi cabriolet' became 'cab'; 'quasi-stellar radio<br>
source' became 'quasar'; 'light amplification by stimulated emission of<br>
radiation' became 'laser' and so on. There is no sign that such compressions<br>
of the language have ever weakened it as a mode of expression.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, political obfuscation has tended to use many 
words<br>
rather than few, long words rather than short, to extend rather than to<br>
reduce. Every leader of inadequate education or limited intelligence hides<br>
behind exuberant inebriation of loquacity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, when Winston Churchill suggested the development of 'Basic 
English'<br>
as an international language (something which undoubtedly also contributed<br>
to 'Newspeak'), the suggestion was stillborn.<br>
We are therefore in no way approaching Newspeak in its condensed form,<br>
though we have always had Newspeak in its extended form and always will<br>
have.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have a group of young people among us who say things like 
'Right<br>
on, man, you know. It's like he's got it all together, you know, man. I<br>
mean, like you know -' and so on for five minutes when the word that the<br>
young people are groping for is 'Huh?'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, however, is not Newspeak, and it has always been with us, 
too. It<br>
is something which in Oldspeak is called 'inarticulacy' and it is not what<br>
Orwell had in mind.</p><p>

D. THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF 1984<br>
Although Orwell seemed, by and large, to be helplessly stuck in the world of<br>
1949, in one respect at least he showed himself to be remarkably prescient,<br>
and that was in foreseeing the tripartite split of the world of the 1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The international world of <i>1984</i> is a world of three superpowers: 
Oceania,<br>
Eurasia, and Eastasia - and that fits in, very roughly, with the three<br>
actual superpowers of the 1980s: the United States, the Soviet Union, and<br>
China.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oceania is a combination of the United States and the British 
Empire.<br>
Orwell, who was an old Imperial civil servant, did not seem to notice that<br>
the British Empire was in its last throes in the late 1940s and was about to<br>
dissolve. He seems to suppose, in fact, that the British Empire is the<br>
dominant member of the British-American combination.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, the entire action takes place in London and phrases such 
as<br>
'the United States' and 'Americans' are rarely, if ever, mentioned. But<br>
then, this is very much in the fashion of the British spy novel in which,<br>
ever since World War II, Great Britain (currently about the eighteenth<br>
strongest military and economic power in the world) is set up as the great<br>
adversary of the Soviet Union, or of China, or of some invented<br>
international conspiracy, with the United States either never mentioned or<br>
reduced to the small courtesy appearance of an occasional CIA agent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eurasia is, of course, the Soviet Union, which Orwell assumes will 
have<br>
absorbed the whole European continent. Eurasia, therefore, includes all of<br>
Europe, plus Siberia, and its population is 95 per cent European by any<br>
standard. Nevertheless, Orwell describes the Eurasians as 'solid-looking men<br>
with expressionless Asiatic faces'. Since Orwell still lives in a time when<br>
'European' and 'Asiatic' are equivalent to ' 'hero' and 'villain', it is<br>
impossible to inveigh against the Soviet Union with the proper emotion if it<br>
is not thought of as 'Asiatic'. This comes under the heading of what<br>
Orwellian Newspeak calls 'double-think', something that Orwell, like any<br>
human being, is good at.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be, of course, that Orwell is thinking not of Eurasia, or 
the<br>
Soviet Union, but of his great b�te noire, Stalin. Stalin is a Georgian, and<br>
Georgia, lying south of the Caucasus mountains, is, by strict geographic<br>
considerations, part of Asia.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eastasia is, of course, China and various dependent nations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is prescience. At the time Orwell was writing <i>1984</i>, the 
Chinese<br>
communists had not yet won control of the country and many (in the United<br>
States, in particular) were doing their best to see that the anti-Communist,<br>
Chiang Kai-shek, retained control. Once the communists won, it became part<br>
of the accepted credo of the West that the Chinese would be under thorough<br>
Soviet control and that China and the Soviet Union would form a monolithic<br>
communist power.<br>
&nbsp; Orwell not only foresaw the communist victory (he saw that victory<br>
everywhere, in fact) but also foresaw that Russia and China would not form a<br>
monolithic bloc but would be deadly enemies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There, his own experience as a Leftist sectarian may have helped 
him. He<br>
had no Rightist superstitions concerning Leftists as unified and<br>
indistinguishable villains. He knew they would fight each other as fiercely<br>
over the most trifling points of doctrine as would the most pious<br>
of Christians.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He also foresaw a permanent state of war among the three; a 
condition of<br>
permanent stalemate with the alliances ever-shifting, but always two against<br>
the strongest. This was the old-fashioned 'balance of power' system which<br>
was used in ancient Greece, in medieval Italy, and in early modern Europe.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell's mistake lay in thinking there had to be actual war to keep 
the<br>
merry-go-round of the balance of power in being. In fact, in one of the more<br>
laughable parts of the book, he goes on and on concerning the necessity of<br>
permanent war as a means of consuming the world's production of resources<br>
and thus keeping the social stratification of upper, middle, and lower<br>
classes in being. (This sounds like a very Leftist explanation of war as the<br>
result of a conspiracy worked out with great difficulty.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In actual fact, the decades since 1945 have been remarkably 
war-free as<br>
compared with the decades before it. There have been local wars in<br>
profusion, but no general war. But then, war is not required as a desperate<br>
device to consume the world's resources. That can be done by such other<br>
devices as endless increase in population and in energy use, neither of<br>
which Orwell considers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell did not foresee any of the significant economic changes that 
have<br>
taken place since World War II. He did not foresee the role of oil or its<br>
declining availability or its increasing price, or the escalating power of<br>
those nations who control it. I don't recall his mentioning the word 'oil'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps it is close enough to mark Orwellian prescience here, 
if we<br>
substitute 'cold war' for 'war'. There has been, in fact, a more or less<br>
continual 'cold war' that has served to keep employment high and solve some<br>
short-term economic problems (at the cost of creating long-term greater<br>
ones). And this cold war is enough to deplete resources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the alliances shifted as Orwell foresaw and very 
nearly as<br>
suddenly. When the United States seemed all-powerful, the Soviet Union and<br>
China were both vociferously anti-American and in a kind of alliance. As<br>
American power decreased, the Soviet Union and China fell apart and, for a<br>
while, each of the three powers inveighed against the other two equally.<br>
Then, when the Soviet Union came to seem particularly powerful, a kind of<br>
alliance sprang up between the United States and China, as they co-operated<br>
in vilifying the Soviet Union, and spoke softly of each other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1984 every shift of alliance involved an orgy of history 
rewriting. In<br>
real life, no such folly is necessary. The public swings from side to side<br>
easily, accepting the change in circumstance with no concern for the past at<br>
all. For instance, the Japanese, by the 1950s, had changed from unspeakable<br>
villains to friends, while the Chinese moved in the opposite direction with<br>
no one bothering to wipe out Pearl Harbour. No one cared, for goodness'<br>
sake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell has his three great powers voluntarily forgo the use of 
nuclear<br>
bombs, and to be sure such bombs have not been used in war since 1945. That,<br>
however, may be because the only powers with large nuclear arsenals, the<br>
United States and the Soviet Union, have avoided war with each other. Were<br>
there actual war, it is extremely doubtful that one side or the other would<br>
not finally feel it necessary to push the button. In that respect, Orwell<br>
perhaps falls short of reality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; London does, however, occasionally suffer a missile strike, which 
sounds<br>
very much like a V-1 or V-2 weapon of 1944, and the city is in a 1945-type<br>
shambles. Orwell cannot make <i>1984</i> very different from 1944 in this respect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orwell, in fact, makes it clear that by 1984, the universal 
communism of<br>
the three superpowers has choked science and reduced it to uselessness<br>
except in those areas where it is needed for war. There is no question but<br>
that the nations are more eager to invest in science where war applications<br>
are in clear view but, alas, there is no way of separating war from peace<br>
where applications are in question.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Science is a unit, and everything in it could conceivably be 
related to<br>
war and destruction. Science has therefore not been choked off but continues<br>
not only in the United States and Western Europe and Japan, but also in the<br>
Soviet Union and in China. The advances of science are too numerous to<br>
attempt to list, but think of lasers and computers as 'war weapons' with<br>
infinite peaceful applications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise, then: George Orwell in <i>1984</i> was, in my opinion, 
engaging in<br>
a private feud with Stalinism, rather that attempting to forecast the<br>
future. He did not have the science fictional knack of foreseeing a<br>
plausible future and, in actual fact, in almost all cases, the world of<i> 1984</i><br>
bears no relation to the real world of the 1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world may go communist, if not by 1984, then by some not very 
much<br>
later date; or it may see civilisation destroyed. If this happens, however,<br>
it will happen in a fashion quite different from that depicted in <i>1984</i> and<br>
if we try to prevent either eventuality by imagining that <i>1984</i> is accurate,<br>
then we will be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong<br>
direction and we will lose.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=9534">https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=9534</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903929">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-9534">
				
<p>Last night, I was taken aback to discover that my name appears in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein">Epstein Files</a>, in 26 different documents. This is despite the fact that I met Jeffrey Epstein a grand total of zero times, and had zero email or any other contact with him … which is more (less) than some of my colleagues can say.</p>



<p>The bulk of the correspondence involves Epstein wanting to arrange a meeting with me and Seth Lloyd back in 2010, via an intermediary named Charles Harper, about funding a research project on “Cryptography in Nature.”</p>



<p>Searching my inbox, it turns out that this Charles Harper <em>did</em> contact me in May 2010, and I then met him at S&amp;S Deli in Cambridge (plausible, although I have zero recollections of this meeting—only of the deli).  Harper then sent me a detailed followup email about his proposed Cryptography in Nature project, naming Jeffrey Epstein for the first time as the project’s funder, and adding: “perhaps you will know Jeffrey and his background and situation.”</p>



<p>For whatever reason, I forwarded this email to my parents, brother, and then-fiancee Dana. My brother then found and shared a news article about Epstein’s prostitution conviction, adding to a different article that I had found and shared. (At that time, like many others, I’d probably <em>vaguely</em> heard of Epstein, but he didn’t have 0.1% the infamy that he has now.) Then my mom wrote the following: “be careful not to get sucked up in the slime-machine going on here! Since you don’t care that much about money, they can’t buy you at least.”</p>



<p>It appears from emails that Charles Harper tried again later that summer to arrange a meeting between me and Epstein, but that I took my mom’s advice and largely blew him off, and no such meeting ever happened. Amazingly, I then <em>forgot entirely that any of this had occurred</em> until last night.  By way of explanation, some business/finance dude trying to interest me in half-baked ideas involving quantum, AI, cryptography, etc., often dangling the prospect of funding for my students and postdocs, shows up in my life like every month.  Most of their world-changing initiatives go nowhere for one reason or another.  There really <em>wasn’t</em> much reason to think further about this, <em>until</em> Epstein had become history’s most notorious sex criminal, which (again) wouldn’t happen until years later, after I’d forgotten.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.  In the Epstein Files, one also finds a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02417369.pdf">November 2010 letter from Charles Harper to Epstein</a> about organizing a conference on the same Cryptography in Nature topic, which includes the following idea about me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Scott Aaronson was born on May 21st, 1981. He will be 30 in 2011. The conference could follow a theme of: “hurry to think together with Scott Aaronson while he is still in his 20s and not yet a pitiful over-the-hill geezer in his 30s.” This offers another nice opportunity for celebration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I see no indication that any such conference ever happened; in any case, <em>I</em> didn’t get invited to one!</p>



<p>On my Facebook, some friends are joking that “it tracks that someone into teenage girls might think Scott Aaronson was a hot property in his nubile 20s, who would get old and boring in his 30s”—and that maybe Epstein was less sexist about such matters than everyone assumes.  I replied that I <em>wished</em> I could say the proposition that I’d gradually get slower and more senile through the 2010s and 2020s was entirely false.</p>



<p>But the best comment was that I’ve been incredibly lucky to have such an astute family.  If only Bill Gates and Larry Summers had had my mom to go to for advice, they could’ve saved themselves a lot of grief.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-theme="ivory"><p><em>Written by Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on our Safeguards team. </em></p><p>I've been experimenting with a new approach to supervising language models that we’re calling "agent teams." </p><p>With agent teams, multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention. This approach dramatically expands the scope of what's achievable with LLM agents. </p><p>To stress test it, I tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">The compiler is an interesting artifact</a> on its own, but I focus here on what I learned about designing harnesses for long-running autonomous agent teams: how to write tests that keep agents on track without human oversight, how to structure work so multiple agents can make progress in parallel, and where this approach hits its ceiling.</p><h2 id="enabling-long-running-claudes">Enabling long-running Claudes</h2><p>Existing agent scaffolds like Claude Code require an operator to be online and available to work jointly. If you ask for a solution to a long and complex problem, the model may solve part of it, but eventually it will stop and wait for continued input—a question, a status update, or a request for clarification.</p><p>To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop (if you’ve seen Ralph-loop, this should look familiar). When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next. <em>(Run this in a container, not your actual machine).</em></p><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short=6 HEAD)
    LOGFILE="agent_logs/agent_${COMMIT}.log"

    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
           -p "$(cat AGENT_PROMPT.md)" \
           --model claude-opus-X-Y &amp;&gt; "$LOGFILE"
done
</code></pre></div><p><br>In the agent prompt, I tell Claude what problem to solve and ask it to approach the problem by breaking it into small pieces, tracking what it’s working on, figuring out what to work on next, and to effectively keep going until it’s perfect. (On this last point, Claude has no choice. The loop runs forever—although in one instance, I did see Claude <code>pkill -9 bash</code> on accident, thus killing itself and ending the loop. Whoops!).</p><h2 id="running-claude-in-parallel"><br>Running Claude in parallel</h2><p>Running multiple instances in parallel can address two weaknesses of a single-agent harness:</p><ul><li>One Claude Code session can only do one thing at a time. Especially as the scope of a project expands, debugging multiple issues in parallel is far more efficient.</li><li>Running multiple Claude agents allows for specialization. While a few agents are tasked to solve the actual problem at hand, other specialized agents can be invoked to (for example) maintain documentation, keep an eye on code quality, or solve specialized sub-tasks.</li></ul><p>My implementation of parallel Claude is bare-bones. A new bare git repo is created, and for each agent, a Docker container is spun up with the repo mounted to <code>/upstream</code>. Each agent clones a local copy to <code>/workspace</code>, and when it's done, pushes from its own local container to upstream.</p><p>To prevent two agents from trying to solve the same problem at the same time, the harness uses a simple synchronization algorithm:</p><ol><li>Claude takes a "lock" on a task by writing a text file to current_tasks/ (e.g., one agent might lock current_tasks/parse_if_statement.txt, while another locks current_tasks/codegen_function_definition.txt). If two agents try to claim the same task, git's synchronization forces the second agent to pick a different one.</li><li>Claude works on the task, then pulls from upstream, merges changes from other agents, pushes its changes, and removes the lock. Merge conflicts are frequent, but Claude is smart enough to figure that out.</li><li>The infinite agent-generation-loop spawns a new Claude Code session in a fresh container, and the cycle repeats.</li></ol><p>This is a very early research prototype. I haven’t yet implemented any other method for communication between agents, nor do I enforce any process for managing high-level goals. I don’t use an orchestration agent. </p><p>Instead, I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the “next most obvious” problem. When stuck on a bug, Claude will often maintain a running doc of failed approaches and remaining tasks. In the <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">git repository</a> of the project, you can read through the history and watch it take out locks on various tasks.</p><h2 id="lessons-from-programming-with-claude-agent-teams">Lessons from programming with Claude agent teams</h2><p>The scaffolding runs Claude in a loop, but that loop is only useful if Claude can tell how to make progress. Most of my effort went into designing the environment around Claude—the tests, the environment, the feedback—so that it could orient itself without me. These are the approaches I’ve found most helpful when orchestrating multiple Claude instances.</p><h3 id="write-extremely-high-quality-tests">Write extremely high-quality tests</h3><p>Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it. So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem. Improving the testing harness required finding high-quality compiler test suites, writing verifiers and build scripts for open-source software packages, and watching for mistakes Claude was making, then designing new tests as I identified those failure modes.</p><p>For example, near the end of the project, Claude started to frequently break existing functionality each time it implemented a new feature. To address this, I built a continuous integration pipeline and implemented stricter enforcement that allowed Claude to better test its work so that new commits can’t break existing code.</p><h3 id="put-yourself-in-claudes-shoes">Put yourself in Claude’s shoes</h3><p>I had to constantly remind myself that I was writing this test harness for Claude and not for myself, which meant rethinking many of my assumptions about how tests should communicate results.</p><p>For example, each agent is dropped into a fresh container with no context and will spend significant time orienting itself, especially on large projects. Before we even reach the tests, to help Claude help itself, I included instructions to maintain extensive READMEs and progress files that should be updated frequently with the current status.</p><p>I also kept in mind the fact that language models have inherent limitations, which, in this case, needed to be designed around. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Context window pollution:</strong> The test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes. At most, it should print a few lines of output and log all important information to a file so Claude can find it when needed. Logfiles should be easy to process automatically: if there are errors, Claude should write ERROR and put the reason on the same line so grep will find it. It helps to pre-compute aggregate summary statistics so Claude doesn't have to recompute them.</li><li><strong>Time blindness:</strong> Claude can't tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress. The harness prints incremental progress infrequently (to avoid polluting context) and includes a default <code>--fast </code>option that runs a 1% or 10% random sample. This subsample is deterministic per-agent but random across VMs, so Claude still covers all files but each agent can perfectly identify regressions.</li></ul><h3 id="make-parallelism-easy">Make parallelism easy</h3><p>When there are many distinct failing tests, parallelization is trivial: each agent picks a different failing test to work on. After the test suite reached a 99% pass rate, each agent worked on getting a different small open-source project (e.g., SQlite, Redis, libjpeg, MQuickJS, Lua) to compile.</p><p>But when agents started to compile the Linux kernel, they got stuck. Unlike a test suite with hundreds of independent tests, compiling the Linux kernel is one giant task. Every agent would hit the same bug, fix that  bug, and then overwrite each other's changes. Having 16 agents running didn't help because each was stuck solving the same task.</p><p>The fix was to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCC </a>as an online known-good compiler oracle to compare against. I wrote a new test harness that randomly compiled most of the kernel using GCC, and only the remaining files with Claude's C Compiler. If the kernel worked, then the problem wasn’t in Claude’s subset of the files. If it broke, then it could further refine by re-compiling some of these files with GCC. This let each agent work in parallel, fixing different bugs in different files, until Claude's compiler could eventually compile all files. (After this worked, it was still necessary to apply delta debugging techniques to find pairs of files that failed together but worked independently.)</p><h3 id="multiple-agent-roles">Multiple agent roles</h3><p>Parallelism also enables specialization. LLM-written code frequently re-implements existing functionality, so I tasked one agent with coalescing any duplicate code it found. I put another in charge of improving the performance of the compiler itself, and a third I made responsible for outputting efficient compiled code. I asked another agent to critique the design of the project from the perspective of a Rust developer, and make structural changes to the project to improve the overall code quality, and another to work on documentation.</p><h2 id="stress-testing-the-limits-of-agent-teams">Stress testing the limits of agent teams</h2><p>This project was designed as a capability benchmark. I am interested in stress-testing the limits of what LLMs can just <em>barely</em> achieve today in order to help us prepare for what models will reliably achieve in the future.</p><p>I’ve been using the C Compiler project as a benchmark across the entire Claude 4 model series. As I did with prior projects, I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.</p><p>Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects. My goal with Opus 4.6 was to again test the limits.</p><h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3><p>Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000. Compared to even the most expensive Claude Max plans, this was an extremely expensive project. But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself—let alone an entire team.</p><p>This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build a bootable Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis, and has a 99% pass rate on most compiler test suites including the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Torture-Tests.html">GCC torture test suite</a>. It also passes the developer's ultimate litmus test: it can compile and run Doom.</p><p>The compiler, however, is not without limitations. These include:</p><ul><li>It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot Linux out of real mode. For this, it calls out to GCC (the x86_32 and x86_64 compilers are its own).</li><li>It does not have its own assembler and linker; these are the very last bits that Claude started automating and are still somewhat buggy. The demo video was produced with a GCC assembler and linker.</li><li>The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It's not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.</li><li>The generated code is not very efficient. Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations <em>disabled.</em></li><li>The Rust code quality is reasonable, but is nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.</li></ul><p>The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.</p><p>As one particularly challenging example, Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase (This is only the case for x86. For ARM or RISC-V, Claude’s compiler can compile completely by itself.)</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">source code for the compiler is available</a>. Download it, read through the code, and try it on your favorite C projects. I’ve consistently found the best way to understand what language models can do is to push them to their limits, and then study where they start to break down. Over the coming days, I’ll continue having Claude push new changes if you want to follow along with Claude’s continued attempts at addressing these limitations.</p><h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2><p>Each generation of language models opens up new ways of working with them. Early models were useful for tab-completion in IDEs. Before long, models could complete a function body from its docstring. The launch of Claude Code brought agents into the mainstream and enabled developers to pair-program with Claude. But each of these products operates under the assumption that a user defines a task, an LLM runs for a few seconds or minutes and returns an answer, and then the user provides a follow-up.</p><p>Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously. This allows us, as users of these tools, to become more ambitious with our goals.</p><p>We are still early, and fully autonomous development comes with real risks. When a human sits with Claude during development, they can ensure consistent quality and catch errors in real time. For autonomous systems, it is easy to see tests pass and assume the job is done, when this is rarely the case. I used to work in penetration testing, exploiting vulnerabilities in products produced by large companies, and the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.</p><p>So, while this experiment excites me, it also leaves me feeling uneasy. Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026. The rapid progress in both language models and the scaffolds we use to interact with them opens the door to writing an enormous amount of new code. I expect the positive applications to outweigh the negative, but we’re entering a new world which will require new strategies to navigate safely.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>Special thanks to Josef Bacik, Edwin Chen, Bernardo Meurer Costa, Jake Eaton, Dan Kelley, Felix Klock, Jannet Park, Steve Weis, and many other people across Anthropic for their assistance and contributions.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>My experience adopting any meaningful tool is that I've necessarily
gone through three phases: (1) a period of inefficiency (2) a period
of adequacy, then finally (3) a period of workflow and life-altering
discovery.</p>
<p>In most cases, I have to force myself through phase 1 and 2 because
I usually have a workflow I'm already happy and comfortable with.
Adopting a tool feels like work, and I <em>do not</em> want to
put in the effort, but I usually do in an effort to be a well-rounded
person of my craft.</p>
<p>This is my journey of how I found value in AI tooling and what I'm
trying next with it. In an ocean of overly dramatic, hyped takes,
I hope this represents a more nuanced, measured approach to my views
on AI and how they've changed over time.</p>
<div><p>This blog post was fully written by hand, in my own words. I hate that I have to say that but
especially given the subject matter, I want to be explicit about it.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-drop-the-chatbot">Step 1: Drop the Chatbot</h2>
<p>Immediately cease trying to perform meaningful work via a chatbot
(e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini on the web, etc.). Chatbots have real value
and are a daily part of my AI workflow, but their utility in coding
is highly limited because you're mostly hoping they come up with the
right results based on their prior training, and correcting them
involves a human (you) to tell them they're wrong repeatedly. It is
inefficient.</p>
<p>I think everyone's first experience with AI is a chat interface.
And I think everyone's first experience trying to code with AI has
been asking a chat interface to write code.</p>
<p>While I was still a heavy AI skeptic, my first "oh wow" moment
was pasting a screenshot of Zed's command palette into Gemini, asking
it to reproduce it with SwiftUI, and being truly flabbergasted that it
did it <em>very well</em>. The command palette that ships for macOS in Ghostty
today is only very lightly modified from what Gemini produced for me
in seconds.</p>
<p>But when I tried to reproduce that behavior for other tasks, I was left
disappointed. In the context of brownfield projects, I found the chat
interface produced poor results very often, and I found myself very
frustrated copying and pasting code and command output to and from
the interface. It was very obviously far less efficient than me doing
the work myself.</p>
<p>To find value, you <em>must</em> use an <strong>agent</strong>. An agent is the industry-adopted
term for an LLM that can chat and invoke external behavior in a loop<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>
At a bare minimum, the agent must have the ability to: read files,
execute programs, and make HTTP requests.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-reproduce-your-own-work">Step 2: Reproduce Your Own Work</h2>
<p>The next phase on my journey I tried
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a>. I'll cut to the
chase: I initially wasn't impressed. I just wasn't getting good results
out of my sessions. I felt I had to touch up everything it produced and
this process was taking more time than if I had just done it myself.
I read blog posts, watched videos, but just wasn't that impressed.</p>
<p>Instead of giving up, I <strong>forced myself to reproduce all my manual commits
with agentic ones.</strong> I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually,
and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality
and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).</p>
<p>This was <em>excruciating</em>, because it got in the way of simply getting things
done. But I've been around the block with non-AI tools enough to know that
friction is natural, and I can't come to a firm, defensible conclusion
without exhausting my efforts.</p>
<p>But, expertise formed. I quickly discovered for myself from first principles
what others were already saying, but discovering it myself resulted in
a stronger fundamental understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Break down sessions into separate clear, actionable tasks. Don't try
to "draw the owl" in one mega session.</li>
<li>For vague requests, split the work into separate planning vs. execution
sessions.</li>
<li>If you give an agent a way to verify its work, it more often than
not fixes its own mistakes and prevents regressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>More generally, I also found the edges of what agents -- at the time --
were good at, what they weren't good at, and for the tasks they were good at
how to achieve the results I wanted.</p>
<p>All of this led to significant efficiency gains, to the point where I was
starting to naturally use agents in a way that I felt was no slower than
doing it myself (but I still didn't feel it was any faster, since I was mostly
babysitting an agent).</p>
<p>The negative space here is worth reiterating: part of the efficiency gains
here were understanding when <em>not</em> to reach for an agent. Using an agent
for something it'll likely fail at is obviously a big waste of time and
having the knowledge to avoid that completely leads to time savings<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At this stage, I was finding adequate value with agents that I was happy
to use them in my workflow, but still didn't feel like I was seeing any
net efficiency gains. I didn't care though, I was content at this point
with AI as a tool.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-end-of-day-agents">Step 3: End-of-Day Agents</h2>
<p>To try to find some efficiency, I next started up a new pattern:
<strong>block out the last 30 minutes of every day to kick off one or more agents.</strong>
My hypothesis was that <em>perhaps</em> I could gain some efficiency if the agent
can make some <em>positive progress</em> in the times I can't work anyways.
Basically: instead of trying to do more in the time I have, try to do
more in the time I don't have.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous task, I at first found this both unsuccessful
and annoying. But, I once again quickly found different categories of work
that were really helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep research sessions</strong> where I'd ask agents to survey some
field, such as finding all libraries in a specific language with
a specific license type and producing multi-page summaries for each
on their pros, cons, development activity, social sentiment, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel agents attempting different vague ideas I had but didn't
have time to get started on.</strong> I didn't expect them to produce something
I'd ever ship here, but perhaps could illuminate some unknown unknowns
when I got to the task the next day.</li>
<li><strong>Issue and PR triage/review.</strong> Agents are good at using <code>gh</code> (GitHub CLI),
so I manually scripted a quick way to spin up a bunch in parallel to
triage issues. I would NOT allow agents to respond, I just wanted
reports the next day to try to guide me towards high value or low effort
tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, I did not go as far as others went to have agents running
in loops all night. In most cases, agents completed their tasks in less than
half an hour. But, the latter part of the working day, I'm usually tired
and coming out of flow and find myself too personally inefficient, so
shifting my effort to spinning up these agents I found gave me a "warm start"
the next morning that got me working more quickly than I would've otherwise.</p>
<p>I was happy, and I was starting to feel like I was doing more than I was
doing prior to AI, if only slightly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-outsource-the-slam-dunks">Step 4: Outsource the Slam Dunks</h2>
<p>By this point, I was getting very confident about what tasks my AI was
and wasn't great at. I had really high confidence with certain tasks that
the AI would achieve a mostly-correct solution. So the next step on my
journey was: <strong>let agents do all of that work while I worked on other tasks.</strong></p>
<p>More specifically, I would start each day by taking the results of my
prior night's triage agents, filter them manually to find the issues that
an agent will almost certainly solve well, and then keep them going
in the background (one at a time, not in parallel).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>I'd work on something else.</strong> I wasn't going to social media
(any more than usual without AI), I wasn't watching videos, etc. I was
in my own, normal, pre-AI deep thinking mode working on something I
wanted to work on or had to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Very important at this stage: turn off agent desktop notifications.</strong>
Context switching is very expensive. In order to remain efficient, I
found that it was my job as a human to be in control of when I interrupt
the agent, not the other way around. Don't let the agent notify you.
During natural breaks in your work, tab over and check on it, then
carry on.</p>
<p>Importantly, I think the "work on something else" helps counteract
the highly publicized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills">Anthropic skill formation paper</a>.
Well, you're trading off: not forming skills for the tasks you're
delegating to the agent while continuing to form skills naturally
in the tasks you continue to work on manually.</p>
<p>At this point I was firmly in the "no way I can go back" territory.
I felt more efficient, but even if I wasn't, the thing I liked the most
was that I could now focus my coding and thinking on tasks I really loved
while still adequately completing the tasks I didn't.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-5-engineer-the-harness">Step 5: Engineer the Harness</h2>
<p>At risk of stating the obvious: agents are much more efficient when they
produce the right result the first time, or at worst produce a result that
requires minimal touch-ups. The most sure-fire way to achieve this is
to give the agent fast, high quality tools to automatically tell it
when it is wrong.</p>
<p>I don't know if there is a broad industry-accepted term for this yet,
but I've grown to calling this "harness engineering." It is the idea that
anytime you find an agent makes a mistake, you take the time to engineer
a solution such that the agent never makes that mistake again. I don't need
to invent any new terms here; if another one exists, I'll jump on the
bandwagon.</p>
<p>This comes in two forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Better implicit prompting (AGENTS.md).</strong> For simple things, like
the agent repeatedly running the wrong commands or finding the wrong
APIs, update the <code>AGENTS.md</code> (or equivalent). Here is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/ca07f8c3f775fe437d46722db80a755c2b6e6399/src/inspector/AGENTS.md">an example from Ghostty</a>.
Each line in that file is based on a bad agent behavior, and it almost
completely resolved them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actual, programmed tools.</strong> For example, scripts to take screenshots,
run filtered tests, etc etc. This is usually paired with an AGENTS.md
change to let it know about this existing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This is where I'm at today.</strong> I'm making an earnest effort whenever I see
an agent do a Bad Thing to prevent it from ever doing that bad thing again.
Or, conversely, I'm making an earnest effort for agents to be able to
verify they're doing a Good Thing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-6-always-have-an-agent-running">Step 6: Always Have an Agent Running</h2>
<p>Simultaneous to step 5, I'm also operating under the goal of
<strong>having an agent running at all times.</strong> If an agent isn't running,
I ask myself "is there something an agent could be doing for me right now?"</p>
<p>I particularly like to combine this with slower, more thoughtful
models like Amp's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/news/deep-mode">deep mode</a> (which
is basically just GPT-5.2-Codex) which can take upwards of 30+ minutes
to make small changes. The flip side of that is that it does tend to
produce very good results.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not [yet?] running multiple agents, and currently don't really want to.</strong>
I find having the one agent running is a good balance for me right now
between being able to do deep, manual work I find enjoyable, and babysitting
my kind of stupid and yet mysteriously productive robot friend.</p>
<p>The "have an agent running at all times" goal is still just a goal.
I'd say right now I'm maybe effective at having a background agent running
10 to 20% of a normal working day. But, I'm actively working to improve that.</p>
<div><p><strong>I don't want to run agents for the sake of running agents.</strong> I only want to run them when there
is a task I think would be truly helpful to me. Part of the challenge of this goal is improving my
own workflows and tools so that I can have a constant stream of high quality work to do that I can
delegate. Which, even without AI, is important!</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>And that's where I'm at today.</p>
<p>Through this journey, I've personally reached a point where I'm having
success with modern AI tooling and I believe I'm approaching it with the
proper measured view that is grounded in reality. I really don't care
one way or the other if AI is here to stay<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, I'm a software craftsman
that just wants to build stuff for the love of the game.</p>
<p>The whole landscape is moving so rapidly that I'm sure I'll look back
at this post very quickly and laugh at my naivete. But, as they say,
if you can't be embarassed about your past self, you're probably not
growing. I just hope I'll grow in the right direction!</p>
<p>I have no skin in the game here<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>, and there are of course other
reasons behind utility to avoid using AI. I fully respect anyone's
individual decisions regarding it. I'm not here to convince you! For
those interested, I just wanted to share my personal approach to navigating
these new tools and give a glimpse about how I approach new tools
<em>in general</em>, regardless of AI.</p>

      <p>
	February 5th 2026
      </p>
      <p>
	We are pleased to announce the release of Ardour 9.0. This is
	a major release for the project, seeing several substantive
	new features that users have asked for over a long period of
	time. Region FX, clip recording, a touch-sensitive GUI,
	pianoroll windows, clip editing and more, not to mention
	dozens of bug fixes, new MIDI binding maps, improved GUI
	performance on macOS (for most) ...
      </p>
      <p>
	We expect to get feedback on some of the major new features in
	this release, and plan to take that into account as we improve
	and refine them and the rest of Ardour going forward. We have
	no doubt that there will be both delight and disappointment
	with certain things - rather than assume that we don't know
	what we're doing, please leave us feedback
	on <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/">the forums</a> so
	that Ardour gets better over time. Those of you new to our
	clip launching implementation might care to read up
	on <a href="https://ardour.org/clip_differences.html"> the differences with
	Ableton Live</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	In the coming weeks, we'll begin to sketch out what we have
	planned next for Ardour, in addition to responding to the
	feedback we get on this 9.0 release.

      <h2 id="major-new-features">Major New Features</h2>

      <h3 id="pianoroll-windows">Pianoroll Windows</h3>
      <p>
	Double-click on a MIDI region to edit it in its own dedicated
	window, or in a pane at the bottom of the main window. Editing in
	that window will work almost identically to the way it does in the
	main timeline, but without the distractions of the rest of the user
	interface. You can also see MIDI automation (velocity, CC parameters
	etc.), optionally overlaid.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/pianoroll.png" alt="Pianoroll window in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="cue-editing">MIDI and Audio Cue Editing</h3>
      <p>
	The Cue page now allows direct editing of the contents of MIDI cues
	(“clips” for Live &amp; Bitwig users). A pianoroll area opens that
	allows precisely the same MIDI editing operations as would be
	available on the editor timeline.
      </p>

      </p></div>

      <h3 id="cue-recording">Cue Recording</h3>
      <p>
	You can now record directly into cue slots, making Ardour a “looper”
	in the same sense that Live, Bitwig and several other contemporary
	DAWs are. You can pre-specificy the recording duration (e.g. “Record
	4 bars”) or you can record until you think you’re done. Whatever you
	recorded will start playing at the next quantization point (e.g.
	bar/beat).
      </p>

      <h3 id="region-fx">Region FX</h3>
      <p>
	If you've ever asked “how do I add some delay to just this part of
	my vocal?”, then region FX are what you've been looking for. Similar
	to region gain it allows to apply any plugin a given audio region
	only. The effect and its automation remains with the region, even
	when it is moved around on the timeline. While the same result can
	be achieved with channels-strip plugins in the mixer (using bypass
	automation), applying effects directly to regions on the timeline is
	convenient for many workflows. The given effect is applied offline,
	when reading the region from disk and does not add any additional
	DSP load.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/region-fx.png" alt="Region FX in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="real-time-analyzer">Realtime Perceptual Analyzer</h3>
      <p>
	A dedicated perceptual analyzer window is now available within
	Ardour which allows one to visualize the live spectrum of multiple
	signals. A key feature is that one can overlay individual sources
	(tracks and busses) on top of each other. This allows one to see
	which track contributes a given of frequency range to the
	overall mix, find conflicting ranges or holes in the spectrum.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/rta.png" alt="Realtime perceptual analyzer in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="note-brushing">Note Brushing</h3>
      <p>
      	Want to set up a pattern of hihats every 1/16th notes? 1/8th
	note pizzicato strings every 1/4 note? Just hold down the
	shift key and drag the mouse while draw MIDI notes, and Ardour
	will fill according to your grid and note settings. Hold down
	Alt as well, and get only every other note drawn. Engage caps
	lock, and you can pick the notes that are drawn from a MIDI
	keyboard or pad device. A fast, easy way to draw melodies and
	rhythms.
      </p>

      <h3 id="keyboard-drive-automation-editing">Keyboard-Driven Automation Editing</h3>
      <p>
      	You can now use keyboard modifiers, arrow keys, and the Enter key
      	to add new automation control points and change their position and value.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mixer-strips-importing-exporting">Mixer Strips Importing and Exporting</h3>
      <p>
	You can now import mixer strips from arbitrary Ardour sessions as new track or map existing track to processing in mixer strips of external sessions. You can also export strips as local (session-level) or global presets for reuse.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/mixer-strip-import.png" width="100%" alt="Mixer strip mapping"></p><h3 id="multi-touch-ui">Multi-Touch GUI</h3>
      <p>
	On Linux and Windows, Ardour now supports multi-touch interaction as
	provided by the operating system. This may come for macOS
	eventually, but the way multi-touch works there is significantly
	different and will need more work.
      </p>

    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="ui-changes">User Interface Changes</h2>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-app-bar">Updated Application Bar and Pane Control</h3>
      
      <p>The application bar was cleaned up and reorganized for each context. Editor specific options toggles, such as <strong>Follow Playhead</strong> and <strong>Follow Range</strong>, are now in the editor toolbar next to zoom controls. Other advanced and workflow specific options such as <strong>Rec Cues</strong> and <strong>Play Cues</strong> and the <strong>Plugin Delay Compensation</strong> (PDC) section are not shown by default anymore. Sections visibility can be configured in <a href="#new-preferences">Preferences</a> &gt; Appearance &gt; Application Bar.</p>

      <p>Additionally, one can now toggle the visibility of the left, the right, and the bottom panes directly from the toolbar. The control section is on the right, next to page switchers.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-application-bar.png" alt="Updated application bar"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-editor-list">Revamped Editor List</h3>

      <p>The editor List panel has been redesigned to simplify switching between two commonly used tabs which you can select at the top of the panel.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-editor-list.png" alt="New Editor List pane"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-new-session-dialog">Revamped New Session Dialog</h3>

      <p>We now used tabbed interface for the <strong>New Session / Recent Sessions</strong> dialog where you can quickly switch between creating a new session, opening a recent one, and opening an arbitrary session from the disk. The new dialog was originally developed for Harrison LiveTrax.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/recent-sessions.png" alt="Updated New Session dialog"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-rulers">Updated Ruler Area</h3>

      <p>Rulers now have additional controls to add new markers and navigate to the previous or next marker from the current playhead position. Several rulers have been collapsed into one: all range-based markers are in one ruler, and all location-based markers are in another.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-rulers.png" alt="Updated ruler area"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-library-manager">Improved Library Manager</h3>

      <p>The dialog for managing clip libraries has received cleanup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only show progress bar when downloading/installing.</li>
        <li>Don't allow re-install.</li>
        <li>Scale progress bar width with UI.</li>
        <li>Make sure target clip library folder exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-midnam-controls">MIDNAM Controls Relocated</h3>

      <p>MIDNAM related controls have been moved out of the track header of MIDI tracks and into the header context menu. Far too many users were confused about the functionality associated with these controls, so we've moved them to a place where we can make this much clearer.</p>

    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="editing-changes">Editing Changes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Ardour now supports the concept of MIDI files and regions that are longer than their data would suggest (e.g. a 4-bar segment with the last note before the end of the 4th bar). This is mostly useful when playing clips in the cue editor for looping to work corectly.</li>
	<li>Step Editor improvements:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Chord mode: advance on final note-off.</li>
	    <li>Improve overlapping note handling:
	      <ul>
	        <li>No need to shift notes during normal edit.</li>
	        <li>Prevent duplicate (overlapping) chord notes.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>Better management of visible note range in MIDI tracks and pianorolls.</li>

	<li>Add MIDI note strumming operator.</li>

	<li>When timestretching an audio region, stretch both its gain envelope and region-FX automation.</li>

	<li>In the internal edit mode, a rubber-band select with no motion (i.e. click) selects region.</li>

	<li>In pianoroll editors, allow shifting all existing MIDI later in a region/clip during a drag operation (this is not yet possible for editing on the main timeline (in the editor).</li>

	<li>Region trimming now obeys ripple mode settings.</li>

	<li>Drag threshold (how far you need to drag the pointer
	before we consider it really a "drag" operation) returns to using just pure pixel distances (rather than distances that are affected by the current zoom level).</li>

	<li>Copy-drags now require more motion before they start.</li>

	<li>Switch to draw tool when selecting region line to be shown in the region editor.</li>
	
	<li>Dragging notes past the end of a MIDI region extends it to cover them.</li>

	<li>The new "Any" algorithm for timestretching uses the StaffPad library.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Default file format is now WAV-compatible RF64.
	  <p>
	    If the file is too large for WAV, it will be converted to
	    RF64 automatically; otherwise it will be a normal WAV
	    file. Ardour has supported this format for years, but it
	    is now the default one to use when recording.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>I/O plugins and their ports can be renamed now.</li>
	<li>ACE fluidsynth: relax sample rate constraint, unload soundfonts after use, allow MMA style bank select an all channels, and pick drums on channel 10 when available.</li>
	<li>Round to bars when mouse scroll/dragging BBT bars.</li>
	<li>Monitor controls in application bars now appropriately sensitive.</li>
	<li>Show "+" icon on editor track-header area, suggesting use
	for adding new tracks etc.</li>
	<li>Use round-robin palette color for new groups.</li>
	<li>Add "search all" mode to the mixer's sidebar plugin list.</li>
	<li>Prevent issues when changing processors while recording #10017.</li>
	<li>Make scrollbar less prominent with default theme and themeable.</li>
	<li>Update themes, make transport option button state visible.</li>
	<li>Enforce a 1 octave minimum note range in MidiViews.</li>
	<li>Set executable stack flag when linking.
	  <p>
	    This is required on some modern hardened Linux systems to allow
	    Ardour to load plugins.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Ignore FLAC seek/peak-file read while recording.</li>
	<li>For the dark colored theme (the default) make pianoroll dividing lines less bright.</li>
	<li>Single pixel line, in themed "black" color, to divide B/C and E/F on piano roll header.</li>
	<li>Add find-and-display-stripable, bound to <key>Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-L</key> by default.</li>
	<li>MIDI mute fix
	  <p>
	    Previously, a sustained note that was audible as a track
	    was muted would not return when the track was unmuted. Now, the
	    note will return after the track is muted/unmuted during its
	    duration.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Exclusive solo may select track.</li>
	<li>Micro-optimization: speed up connection-matrix rendering.</li>
	<li>Clarify PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) label units.</li>
	<li>Add color scheme for inactive selected tracks.</li>
	<li>Allow selection of inactive tracks.</li>
	<li>Replace git.ardour link with github
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://git.ardour.org/">git.ardour.org</a> no
	    longer allows access to individual commits
	    or source files (thanks to LLM scrapers trying to get them
	    one by one, which is ridiculous).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Sources/Regions get their own tempo and meter.</li>
	<li>Don't show hidden tracks in the editor-mixer.</li>
	<li>Reduce likelihood of dropouts when reordering processors (plugins etc).</li>
	<li>Use configurable parameter for max gain everywhere (some
	parts of the program used a hardcoded 6dB value).</li>
	<li>More correctly handle real-time (MMCSS) threads on windows, and add a popup dialog when MMCSS threads are exhausted.</li>
	<li>Overhaul persistent tooltip position #9979.</li>
	<li>Reimplement MIDI file import to retain metadata in the
	  files written.
	  <p>
	    Previosuly, all meta data was thrown away. Now we retain it, so that MIDI
	    regions can ask about their source file's tempo &amp; meter.
	  </p>
	</li><li>Allow selection of VCAs in the mixer window.</li>
	<li>Produce valid HTML when printing bindings. </li>
	<li>Add click-free bypass/enable to the ACE Amp plugin.</li>
	<li>Implement restoring hardware-to-hardware connections for internal backends</li>
	<li>Improve keyboard shortcuts for track height
	  <p>
	    Just use Alt as a modifier, instead of Alt-Shift.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Add an action to print keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Expose marker scene changes. In this context,
	  "scene changes" are a pair of MIDI bank and program change
	  messages that Ardour will send to a dedicated port when the
	  playhead passed the marker.
	  <p>
	    Access the marker edit dialog via double clicking a marker
	    (or right click the marker and choose "Edit").
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle for scenes
	  <p>
	    The 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle was not working correctly for markers
	    with scene changes. Location markers would get turned into section markers,
	    but would not get shifted down to the correct row.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>First time use dialog now allows the user to specify a
	  default location for samples/clips.</li>
	<li>You can now create audio inputs for VST3 plugin in the Pin Connection dialog directly. This already worked for AU and Lua plugins prior to v9.0.</li>
	<li>Add support for global mixer strip templates to the Template Manager.</li>
	<li>Support newer APIs at Soundcloud and Freesound.</li>
	<li>Dramatically improve behavior when using BBT markers.</li>
	<li>Allow SchedRR for I/O threads, as originally intended.</li>
	<li>When using Pipewire's JACK support, clean up names
	displayed on I/O buttons in the mixer strip and the context
	  menu for those buttons (full names still appear in the port
	  matrix).</li>
	<li>Use a bold font for bar tick labels in the BBT ruler.</li>
	<li>Correctly handle timeline cue scenes that have "Again"
	  as their follow action.</li>
	<li>Errors during loading a session are now properly escaped,
	  so that reporting the error does not cause its own set of problems.</li>
	<li>When changing MIDI port properties (e.g. "Follow
	  Selection"), Ardour now automatically updates the ports used
	  for connection dialogs and menus appropriately.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="plugin-support">Plugin Support</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>In the plugin selector, if neither name nor tag buttons
	  are enabled, the plugins' creator will also be used when searching.</li>
	<li>LV2: add Bool variant support.</li>
	<li>LV2: don't hide bypass/enabled port</li>
	<li>LV2: remove non-standard, deprecated bypass/enable extension.</li>
	<li>LV2: fix loading channel numbers from standard/common port groups.</li>
	<li>VST3: initialize bus and speaker arrangement during instantiation.</li>
	<li>VST3: implement host/global IContextInfoProvider (for Sonible VST3 plugins).</li>
	<li>VST3: Allow IRunLoop to query itself.</li>
	<li>Fix VST3 spec link.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="lua-scripting">Lua Scripting</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>New features:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Expose control point and automation line selection as Lua bindings.</li>
	    <li>Add support to create midi regions from Lua.</li>
	    <li>Add support to set color transparency from Lua (with example script).</li>
	    <li>Add Lua script snippet showing how to add sources to a track.</li>
	    <li>Add fade_in_length and fade_out_length Lua bindings on region.</li>
	    <li>Add new text control type for LuaDialog, based on Gtk::TextView.</li>
	    <li>Expose some session statistics (number of routes, tracks, audio tracks, busses) as Lua bindings.</li>
	    <li>Add missing Lua bindings for Route Import.</li>
	    <li>Add missing Lua Bindings for UIConfig.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>New scripts:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Capture impulse resoponses.</li>
	    <li>Create a playlist on selected audio tracks with only audible contents.</li>
	    <li>Mono to Stereo panner using Ardour's builtin pan law.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixes and improvements:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Fix region-gain curve example script.</li>
	    <li>Properly create LuaWindow (always use Ardour's window manager).</li>
	    <li>Update track organizer Lua script to use text-area for comments.</li>
	    <li>Lua bindings for modifier keys now available.</li>

<div>
      <h2 id="macos-improvements">macOS Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Faster GUI drawing
	  <p>
	    Without telling anyone, Apple have subtly changed the way their drawing APIs
	    work for graphical applications over the last 5-10 years. The result has been
	    that a naive graphical app would end up redrawing its entire window even if
	    only a few pixels needed updating. We’re far from the only application to be
	    affected by this. In Ardour 9.0 the GUI drawing speed will be significantly
	    faster, at least on very dense pages like the mixer.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is a complicated area, and there are still monitor
	    configurations where our new implementation will
	    misbehave. You can switch back to a drawing model where
	    macOS is in charge, which will work but can be slower.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Reduce chance of "device busy" when ejecting DMG.</li>
	<li>Improve retina scaling.</li>
	<li>Add new NSApplicationDelegate method to deal with warning on macOS Sonoma.</li>
	<li>Use ArdourMono font on macOS for consistency.</li>
	<li>use small text for ruler text on macOS.</li>

      <h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Fix some odd behavior when using note splitting/joining.
	  <p>
	    This commit ends the split/join operation any time
	    selection is cleared or notes are added to the selection
	    (except when in the middle of a split). This prevents some
	    rather hard to predict behavior when using note splitting.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Redraw arrangement rectangles after tempo change
	  <p>
	    Previously they remained unchanged and thus incorrectly

      <h2 id="coding-build-changes">Coding &amp; Build Changes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>We began to use C++17 syntax and features, which caused us to
	  drop support for macoS earlier than 10.13 (High Sierra, 2017).</li>
	<li>We moved a lot of our C++ header file inclusion to use <code>#pragma once</code></li>
	<li>PBD::Signal was reimplemented using contemporary C++ and
	  avoiding as much realtime memory allocation as possible.</li>
	<li>Large amounts of our use of the Boost libraries were
	  replaced by their <code>std::</code> equivalents.</li>
	<li>The build-time requirements for JACK were bumped to JACK2.</li>
	<li>The build system will now allow builds with recent msys2/mingw.</li>
	<li>reduce use of gettimeofday in favor of truly monotonic time.</li>
	<li>Use global FFT planner lock in GUI
	  <p>
	    This <em>should</em> not be needed since the GUI is single
	    threaded, but ... we're looking at you, JUCE.

                <p><i>New documents show the tactics Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok execs used to disrupt learning, prey on minors, and co-opt the PTA to control the narrative with parents</i></p>
<p><b>WASHINGTON, DC –</b>&nbsp;Today, The Tech Oversight Project published a new report spotlighting newly unsealed documents in the 2026 social media addiction trials. The documents provide smoking-gun evidence that Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok all purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens with no regard for known harms to their wellbeing, and how that mass youth addiction was core to the companies’ business models. The documents contain internal discussions among company employees, presentations from internal meetings, expert testimony, and evidence of Big Tech coordination with tech-funded groups, including the National Parent Teachers Association (PTA) and Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), in attempts to control the narrative in response to concerned parents.</p>
<p>“These unsealed documents prove Big Tech has been gaslighting and lying to the public for years, and it’s high time parents and young people get their day in court,” <b>said Sacha Haworth, Executive Director of The Tech Oversight Project.</b> “Disrupted learning and social media addiction are core to Big Tech’s business model, and while the JCCP and MDL cases have the potential to chip away at their wrongdoing, Congress needs to make good on their years-long promise to pass the Senate’s version of the <em>Kids Online Safety Act</em>.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>We’re upgrading our smartest model.</p><p>The new Claude Opus 4.6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cowork</a>, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.</p><p>The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation <a href="https://www.tbench.ai/news/announcement-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terminal-Bench 2.0</a> and leads all other frontier models on <a href="https://agi.safe.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanity’s Last Exam</a>, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test. On <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPval-AA</a>—an evaluation of performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains<sup>1</sup>—Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry’s next-best model (OpenAI’s GPT-5.2) by around 144 Elo points,<sup>2</sup> and its own predecessor (Claude Opus 4.5) by 190 points. Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on <a href="https://openai.com/index/browsecomp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrowseComp</a>, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.</p><p>As we show in our extensive <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system card</a>, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.</p><p>In Claude Code, you can now assemble <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>agent teams</em></a> to work on tasks together. On the API, Claude can use <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>compaction</em></a> to summarize its own context and perform longer-running tasks without bumping up against limits. We’re also introducing <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>adaptive thinking</em></a>, where the model can pick up on contextual clues about how much to use its extended thinking, and new <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>effort</em></a> controls to give developers more control over intelligence, speed, and cost. </p><p>We’ve made substantial upgrades to <a href="https://claude.com/claude-in-excel">Claude in Excel</a>, and we’re releasing <a href="https://claude.com/claude-in-powerpoint">Claude in PowerPoint</a> in a research preview. This makes Claude much more capable for everyday work.</p><p>Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on <a href="https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.e507e1cd-3026-4d12-9231-8fab64df59c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claude.ai</a>, our API, and all major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, use <code>claude-opus-4-6</code> via the <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude API</a>. Pricing remains the same at $5/$25 per million tokens; for full details, see our <a href="https://claude.com/pricing#api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing page</a>.</p><p>We cover the model, our new product updates, our evaluations, and our extensive safety testing in depth below.</p><h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2><p>We build Claude with Claude. Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.</p><p>Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the <code>/effort</code> <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parameter</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:<br></p><div><div><p><img alt="Notion logo" loading="lazy" width="120" height="48" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/7cfef6cd8ce2515a6abd52560ac4189f89f9ad35-116x40.svg"></p><blockquote><p>Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped.

The table below shows how Claude Opus 4.6 compares to our previous models and to other industry models on a variety of benchmarks.</p><div><figure><img alt="Benchmark table comparing Opus 4.6 to other models" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="2968" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F0e5c55fa8fd05a893d11168654dc36999e90908b-2600x2968.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F0e5c55fa8fd05a893d11168654dc36999e90908b-2600x2968.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>Opus 4.6 is much better at retrieving relevant information from large sets of documents. This extends to long-context tasks, where it holds and tracks information over hundreds of thousands of tokens with less drift, and picks up buried details that even Opus 4.5 would miss.</p><p>A common complaint about AI models is “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">context rot</a>,” where performance degrades as conversations exceed a certain number of tokens. Opus 4.6 performs markedly better than its predecessors: on the 8-needle 1M variant of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/mrcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MRCR v2</a>—a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark that tests a model’s ability to retrieve information “hidden” in vast amounts of text—Opus 4.6 scores 76%, whereas Sonnet 4.5 scores just 18.5%. This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance.</p><p>All in all, Opus 4.6 is better at finding information across long contexts, better at reasoning after absorbing that information, and has substantially better expert-level reasoning abilities in general.</p><p>Finally, the charts below show how Claude Opus 4.6 performs on a variety of benchmarks that assess its software engineering skills, multilingual coding ability, long-term coherence, cybersecurity capabilities, and its life sciences knowledge.</p><h2 id="a-step-forward-on-safety">A step forward on safety</h2><p>These intelligence gains do not come at the cost of safety. On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date. Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.</p><div><figure><img alt="Bar charts comparing Opus 4.6 to other Claude models on overall misaligned behavior" loading="lazy" width="3840" height="2160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F569d748607388e6ed42e3ff0ff245d9b0cde6878-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F569d748607388e6ed42e3ff0ff245d9b0cde6878-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>The overall misaligned behavior score for each recent Claude model on our automated behavioral audit (described in full in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>).</figcaption></figure></div><p>For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interpretability</a>, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.</p><p>A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>.</p><p>We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probes</a>—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.</p><p>We’re also accelerating the cyber<em>defensive</em> uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity blog post</a>). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.</p><h2 id="product-and-api-updates">Product and API updates</h2><p>We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.</p><p><strong>Claude Developer Platform</strong></p><p>On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive thinking.</strong> Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adaptive thinking</a>, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.</li><li><strong>Effort. </strong>There are now four <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effort</a> levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.</li><li><strong>Context compaction (beta).</strong> Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context compaction</a> automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.</li><li><strong>1M token context (beta).</strong> Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).</li><li><strong>128k output tokens.</strong> Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.</li><li><strong>US-only inference. </strong>For workloads that need to run in the United States, <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/data-residency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US-only inference</a> is available at 1.1× token pricing.</li></ul><p><strong>Product updates</strong></p><p>Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.</p><p>We’ve introduced <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agent teams</a> in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tmux</a>.</p><p>Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.</p></div></article></div><div><h4>Footnotes</h4><p>[1] Run independently by Artificial Analysis. <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking#gdpval-aa">See here</a> for full methodological details.</p><p>[2] This translates into Claude Opus 4.6 obtaining a higher score than GPT-5.2 on this eval approximately 70% of the time (where 50% of the time would have implied parity in the scores).</p><ul><li>For GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro models, we compared the best reported model version in the charts and table.</li><li><strong>Terminal-Bench 2.0</strong>: We report both scores reproduced on our infrastructure and published scores from other labs. All runs used the Terminus-2 harness, except for OpenAI’s Codex CLI. All experiments used 1× guaranteed / 3× ceiling resource allocation and 5–15 samples per task across staggered batches. See system card for details.</li><li><strong>Humanity’s Last Exam</strong>: Claude models run “with tools” were run with web search, web fetch, code execution, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 3M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and adaptive thinking enabled. A domain blocklist was used to decontaminate eval results. See system card for more details.</li><li><strong>SWE-bench Verified:</strong> Our score was averaged over 25 trials. With a prompt modification, we saw a score of 81.42%.</li><li><strong>MCP Atlas: </strong>Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort. When run at high effort, it reached an industry-leading score of 62.7%.</li><li><strong>BrowseComp</strong>: Claude models were run with web search, web fetch, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 10M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and no thinking enabled. Adding a multi-agent harness increased scores to 86.8%. See system card for more details.</li><li><strong>ARC AGI 2: </strong>Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort and a 120k thinking budget score.</li><li><strong>CyberGym</strong>: Claude models were run on no thinking, default effort, temperature, and <code>top_p</code>. The model was also given a “think” tool that allowed interleaved thinking for multi-turn evaluations.</li><li><strong>OpenRCA</strong>: For each failure case in OpenRCA, Claude receives 1 point if all generated root-cause elements match the ground-truth ones, and 0 points if any mismatch is identified. The overall accuracy is the average score across all failure cases. The benchmark was run on the benchmark author’s harness, graded using their official methodology, and has been submitted for official verification.</li></ul></div><div data-theme="ivory"><p><h2>Related content</h2></p><div><div><h3>Claude is a space to think</h3><p>We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/spotlighting-the-world-factbook-as-we-bid-a-fond-farewell/">Spotlighting The World Factbook as We Bid a Fond Farewell</a></strong> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46891794" title="Hacker News">via</a>) Somewhat devastating news today from CIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of CIA’s oldest and most recognizable intelligence publications, The World Factbook, has sunset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's not even a hint as to <em>why</em> they decided to stop maintaining this publication, which has been their most useful public-facing initiative since 1971 and a cornerstone of the public internet since 1997.</p>
<p>In a bizarre act of cultural vandalism they've not just removed the entire site (including the archives of previous versions) but they've also set every single page to be a 302 redirect to their closure announcement.</p>
<p>The Factbook has been released into the public domain since the start. There's no reason not to continue to serve archived versions - a banner at the top of the page saying it's no longer maintained would be much better than removing all of that valuable content entirely.</p>
<p>Up until 2020 the CIA published annual zip file archives of the entire site. Those are available (along with the rest of the Factbook) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260203124934/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/">on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>I downloaded the 384MB <code>.zip</code> file for the year 2020 and extracted it into a new GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020/">simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020</a>. I've enabled GitHub Pages for that repository so you can browse the archived copy at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020">simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the CIA World Factbook website homepage. Header reads &quot;THE WORLD FACTBOOK&quot; with a dropdown labeled &quot;Please select a country to view.&quot; Navigation tabs: ABOUT, REFERENCES, APPENDICES, FAQs. Section heading &quot;WELCOME TO THE WORLD FACTBOOK&quot; followed by descriptive text: &quot;The World Factbook provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities. The Reference tab includes: a variety of world, regional, country, ocean, and time zone maps; Flags of the World; and a Country Comparison function that ranks the country information and data in more than 75 Factbook fields.&quot; A satellite image of Earth is displayed on the right. Below it: &quot;WHAT'S NEW :: Today is: Wednesday, February 4.&quot; Left sidebar links with icons: WORLD TRAVEL FACTS, ONE-PAGE COUNTRY SUMMARIES, REGIONAL AND WORLD MAPS, FLAGS OF THE WORLD, GUIDE TO COUNTRY COMPARISONS. Right side shows news updates dated December 17, 2020 about Electricity access and new Economy fields, and December 10, 2020 about Nepal and China agreeing on the height of Mount Everest at 8,848.86 meters. A &quot;VIEW ALL UPDATES&quot; button appears at the bottom." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/factbook-2020.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a neat example of the editorial voice of the Factbook from the <a href="https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/docs/whatsnew.html">What's New page</a>, dated December 10th 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years of wrangling were brought to a close this week when officials from Nepal and China announced that they have agreed on the height of Mount Everest. The mountain sits on the border between Nepal and Tibet (in western China), and its height changed slightly following an earthquake in 2015. The new height of 8,848.86 meters is just under a meter higher than the old figure of 8,848 meters. <em>The World Factbook</em> rounds the new measurement to 8,849 meters and this new height has been entered throughout the <em>Factbook</em> database.</p>

We use advanced tools to automate compliance checks, store our code in version-controlled repositories, and manage our infrastructure as code. However, when describing and managing our company, we resort to digital paper and tidbits of info distributed across people in the building.</p><p>The disconnect became increasingly apparent as I reflected on our day-to-day process: 90% of our products, documents, communication, and decision-making live in digital channels. That’s data. It lives in the cloud, spread over SaaS solutions that specialise in handling individual work processes—all systems with robust APIs and programmatic access.</p><p>At the centre of it all sits a lonely island of documents: our ambitions, goals, policies and formal structures. And I think those are pretty important.</p><p><span>Our security posture was solid before we even considered ISO 27001 because we’d already worked hard to comply with our customer’s requirements. Between collecting evidence for controls, arguing about and updating policy wording, document review, and the actual audit, </span><em><strong>we spent hundreds of additional person-hours</strong></em><span> that could’ve otherwise been spent creating great products for our users.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg" width="1232" height="928" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:928,&quot;width&quot;:1232,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:396166,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://42futures.substack.com/i/157739313?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P-Is!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cddc69a-a86d-4a18-82c9-4ffa6a4eeb98_1232x928.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>If we desire operational data to be so rich, why do we accept organisational data to be so sparse?

    References = AnotherEntity.Identifier
    Attribute = Value
    ListAttribute = [
        "Item One",
        "Item Two"
    ]
}</code></pre><p>A type, unique identifier, and set of attributes define each entity. Entities can reference each other using dot notation, creating a web of relationships that forms our organisational graph.</p><p>Let's walk through how you could define a small engineering team in this language:</p><ol><li><p>First, let’s define the roles that exist in the organisation:</p></li></ol><pre><code>Role "SoftwareEngineer" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Write clean, maintainable code",
        "Participate in code reviews",
        "Document technical decisions"
    ]
}

Role "EngineeringManager" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Provide technical leadership",
        "Conduct performance reviews",
        "Manage team resources"
    ]
}</code></pre><ol start="2"><li><p>Next, we’ll create an organisational unit for our team:</p></li></ol><pre><code>OrganisationalUnit "EngineeringTeam" {
    Department = "Engineering"
    CostCenter = "ENG-001"
}</code></pre><ol start="3"><li><p>With these structures in place, we can define the actual people and their relationships:</p></li></ol><pre><code>Person "AliceSmith" {
    FullName = "Alice Smith"
    Role = Role.EngineeringManager
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Email = "alice.smith@company.com"
}

Person "BobJohnson" {
    FullName = "Bob Johnson"
    Role = Role.SoftwareEngineer
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Manager = Person.AliceSmith
    Email = "bob.johnson@company.com"
}</code></pre><ol start="4"><li><p>Policy definitions create a framework for compliance:</p></li></ol><pre><code>PolicyGroup "SecurityPolicies" {
    Owner = Person.AliceSmith
}

PolicyRule "MFARequired" {
    Group = PolicyGroup.SecurityPolicies
    Enforcement = "Mandatory"
    ComplianceLevel = "Critical"
}</code></pre><ol start="5"><li><p>Finally, we can map these policies to external requirements:</p></li></ol><pre><code>ExternalRequirement "ISO27001_A9_4_1" {
    Standard = "ISO 27001:2013"
    Control = "A.9.4.1"
    ComplianceLevel = "Mandatory"
}

ComplianceMapping "MFACompliance" {
    Requirement = ExternalRequirement.ISO27001_A9_4_1
    ImplementingPolicies = [PolicyRule.MFARequired]
}</code></pre><p>This declarative approach allows us to build a complete picture of our organisation, from high-level structures to individual policies and their regulatory implications. Each definition is clear and self-documenting, while the references between entities create a graph of relationships that can be analysed, validated, and used to automate organisational processes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

This requires a storage strategy that can:</p><ul><li><p>Persist the organisational graph itself</p></li><li><p>Store data associated with graph entities (like evidence)</p></li><li><p>Enable validation of considered changes</p></li></ul><p>A way to deliver this at scale would be to combine several data stores: A graph database for the organisational model, a relational database for associated data, and an event store for audit trail and change tracking. If you wanted to start small, you could serialise all this information to your local filesystem instead.</p><p>To activate external data, we would need an integration framework with a plug-in architecture to bridge the organisational model and production systems. This would handle three key aspects: (1) data collection from integrated systems like GitHub or Azure, mapping evidence to nodes in our graph; (2) policy validation that programmatically checks collected evidence against rules; and (3) policy enforcement where organisational changes automatically trigger updates across connected systems—from employee provisioning to access permission changes.</p><p>The DSL would supply this functionality using built-in modules or user-supplied plug-ins to perform the work needed to interact with other systems. Let’s imagine a Control entity in the DSL which uses a custom script to perform routine checks on MFA usage and links results to the compliance mapping:</p><pre><code>Control "MFAMonitoring" {
    Implements = ComplianceMapping.MFACompliance
    
    Verify {
        Script = "Security/mfa-checks.js"
        Methods = [
            "allUsersHaveMfaEnabled"
        ]
        Frequency = "Daily"
    }
}</code></pre><p><span>Then in </span><code>security/mfa-checks.js</code><span>: </span></p><pre><code>export async function allUsersHaveMfaEnabled() {
    const users = await myAuthClient.listUsers()
    return users.every(user =&gt; user.mfaEnabled)
}</code></pre><p><span>The solution should be open and extendable to maximise its usefulness, allowing for custom integrations, validations, and automation. Terraform does a good job of this with its “</span><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers" rel="">Providers</a><span>” plug-in architecture, although integrations to inspect and modify data in corporate systems might need to support more custom scripting.</span></p><p>For organisations wanting to test this approach, you could start small:</p><ol><li><p>Model just your organisational structure and reporting lines.</p></li><li><p>Add key policies and compliance mappings.</p></li><li><p>Begin connecting to your most critical systems.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg" width="1232" height="928" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:928,&quot;width&quot;:1232,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:463092,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://42futures.substack.com/i/157739313?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vw8K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90ad1389-c5e3-45e2-96ec-3938cf5e1cdd_1232x928.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>A code-based declaration of an organisation offers powerful capabilities for technologists, but we also need to acknowledge that many business stakeholders don’t “think in code”. </p><p>The elegance of a DSL doesn’t have to be limited to those most comfortable with text editors and version control software.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago, <a href="https://1password.com/blog/its-openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><span><span>I published a post</span></span></a> about why OpenClaw feels like a portal to the future, and why that future is scary in a very specific way.</p><p>The short version: agent gateways that act like OpenClaw are powerful because they have real access to your files, your tools, your browser, your terminals, and often a long-term “memory” file that captures how you think and what you’re building. That combination is exactly what modern infostealers are designed to exploit.</p><p>This post is the uncomfortable, “and then it happened” follow-up.</p><p>Because it’s not just that agents can be dangerous once they’re installed. The ecosystem that distributes their capabilities and skill registries has already become an attack surface.
</p><p><img alt="An orange-red warning box that says &quot;Warning: do not use OpenClaw on a company device&quot;" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/4tgJD9yNDl4RNKI4VO2Jax/bcb7c3596444352f0f627db0525b8e2a/Blog_In-Line_The_Risk_of_Agent_Skill_Registries_Warning_Box.webp"></p><p><b>If you are experimenting with OpenClaw, do not do it on a company device. Full stop.</b></p><p>In my first post, I described OpenClaw as a kind of Faustian bargain. It is compelling precisely because it has real access to your local machine, your apps, your browser sessions, your files, and often long-term memory. That same access means there isn’t yet a safe way to run it on a machine that holds corporate credentials or has access to production systems.</p><p><b>If you have already run OpenClaw on a work device, treat it as a potential incident and engage your security team immediately.</b> Do not wait for symptoms. Pause work on that machine and follow your organization’s incident response process.
</p><h2><b>Skills are just markdown. That’s the problem.</b></h2><p>In the OpenClaw ecosystem, a “skill” is often a markdown file: a page of instructions that tells an agent how to do a specialized task. In practice, that markdown can include links, copy-and-paste commands, and tool call recipes.</p><p>That sounds harmless until you remember how humans, and agents, actually consume documentation:</p><ul><li><p>“Here’s the prerequisite.”</p></li><li><p>“Run this command.”</p></li><li><p>“Install the core dependency.”</p></li><li><p>“Paste this in Terminal.”</p></li></ul><p>Markdown isn’t “content” in an agent ecosystem. Markdown is an installer.</p><p><img alt="A gray warning box that says &quot;A dangerous misconception: MCP makes skills safe&quot;" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/9jAWHqi26gZkDIQI9jgZc/770fb8af2e0e5b8b2a5ff248b8b29759/Blog_In-Line_The_Risk_of_Agent_Skill_Registries_Info_Box.webp"></p><h3>A dangerous misconception: “MCP makes skills safe”</h3><p>Some people assume the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18"><span><span>Model Context Protocol </span></span></a>layer makes this safer, because tools can be exposed through a structured interface, with explicit user consent and authorization controls depending on the host and server implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>But skills do not need to use MCP at all.</p><p>The Agent Skills specification places no restrictions on the markdown body, and skills can include whatever instructions will “help agents perform the task,” including copy and paste terminal commands. And skills can also bundle scripts alongside the markdown, which means execution can happen outside the MCP tool boundary entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>So if your security model is “MCP will gate tool calls,” you can still lose to a malicious skill that simply routes around MCP through social engineering, direct shell instructions, or bundled code. MCP can be part of a safe system, but it is not a safety guarantee by itself.</p><p>Just as importantly, this is not unique to OpenClaw. “Skills” are increasingly portable because many agents are adopting the open <a href="https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills"><span><span>Agent Skills format,</span></span></a> in which a skill is a folder centered on a SKILL.md file with metadata and freeform instructions, and it can also bundle scripts and other resources. Even <a href="https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills"><span><span>OpenAI’s documentation</span></span></a> describes the same basic shape: a SKILL.md file plus optional scripts and assets. That means a malicious “skill” is not just an OpenClaw problem. It is a distribution mechanism that can travel across any agent ecosystem that supports the same standard.</p><h2><b>What I found: The top downloaded skill was a malware delivery vehicle</b></h2><p>While browsing ClawHub (I won’t link it for obvious reasons), I noticed the top downloaded skill at the time was a “Twitter” skill. It looked normal: description, intended use, an overview, the kind of thing you’d expect to install without a second thought.</p><p>But the very first thing it did was introduce a “required dependency” named “openclaw-core,” along with platform-specific install steps. Those steps included convenient links (“here”, “this link”) that appeared to be normal documentation pointers.</p><p>They weren’t.</p><p>Both links led to malicious infrastructure. The flow was classic staged delivery:</p><ol><li><p>The skill’s overview told you to install a prerequisite.</p></li><li><p>The link led to a staging page designed to get the agent to run a command.</p></li><li><p>That command decoded an obfuscated payload and executed it.</p></li><li><p>The payload fetched a second-stage script.</p></li><li><p>The script downloaded and ran a binary, including removing macOS quarantine attributes to ensure macOS’s built-in anti-malware system, Gatekeeper, doesn’t scan it.</p></li></ol><p>I’m intentionally not pasting the exact commands or URLs here. The mechanics are unfortunately straightforward, and repeating them helps attackers more than it helps defenders. The key point is that this was not “a suspicious link.” This was a complete execution chain disguised as setup instructions.</p><h2><b>Confirmed: Infostealing malware</b></h2><p>I downloaded the final binary safely and submitted it to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/30f97ae88f8861eeadeb54854d47078724e52e2ef36dd847180663b7f5763168?nocache=1"><span><span>VirusTotal</span></span></a>.</p><p>The verdict was not ambiguous. It was flagged as macOS infostealing malware.</p><p><img alt="A screenshot from a malware identification website, labeling a file as a malicious trojan stealer." loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/1UiwBYiIp4flOcOEjhXeMW/490636f98aea1ebb1f26a7b42b54e879/Screenshot_2026-02-02_at_12.12.27%C3%A2__PM.webp"></p><p>This is the type of malware that doesn’t just “infect your computer.” It raids everything valuable on that device:</p><ul><li><p>Browser sessions and cookies</p></li><li><p>Saved credentials and autofill data</p></li><li><p>Developer tokens and API keys</p></li><li><p>SSH keys</p></li><li><p>Cloud credentials</p></li><li><p>Anything else that can be turned into an account takeover</p></li></ul><p>If you’re the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from.</p><h2><b>This wasn’t an isolated case. It was a campaign.</b></h2><p>After I shared this internally, <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/341-openclaw-skills-distribute-macos-malware-via-clickfix-instructions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><span><span>broader reporting</span></span></a> surfaced, putting the scale into focus: hundreds of OpenClaw skills were reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions.</p><p>That detail matters because it confirms what this really is.</p><p>Not a one-off malicious upload.</p><p>A deliberate strategy: use “skills” as the distribution channel, and “prerequisites” as the social engineering wrapper.</p><h2><b>When ‘helpful’ becomes hostile in an agent world</b></h2><p>We’ve spent years learning that package managers and open-source registries can become supply chain attack vectors.</p><p>Agent skill registries are the next chapter, except that the “package” is documentation.</p><p>And that makes the attack path even smoother:</p><ul><li><p>People don’t expect a markdown file to be dangerous.</p></li><li><p>People are trained to follow setup steps quickly.</p></li><li><p>People trust “top downloaded” as a proxy for legitimacy.</p></li><li><p>And in agent ecosystems, the line between reading instructions and executing them collapses.</p></li></ul><p>Even if an agent can’t run shell commands directly, it can still do something dangerous: it can normalize risky behavior.</p><p>It can confidently summarize a malicious prerequisite as “the standard install step.” It can encourage you to paste a one-liner. It can reduce hesitation.</p><p>And if your agent can execute local commands, then a malicious skill isn’t “bad content.” <b>It’s remote execution wrapped in friendly docs.</b></p><h2><b>What you should do right now</b></h2><h4><b>If you are using OpenClaw or any skill registry</b></h4><p>Do not run this on a company device. There isn’t a safe way to do it. If you already did, or you ran any “install” commands from a skill, engage your security team immediately and treat it as a potential compromise.</p><ul><li><p>Stop using the device for sensitive work.</p></li><li><p>Rotate sessions and secrets first: browser sessions, developer tokens, SSH keys, cloud console sessions.</p></li><li><p>Review recent sign-ins for email, source control, cloud, CI/CD, and admin consoles.</p></li></ul><p>If you experiment anyway, use an isolated machine with no corporate access and no saved credentials.</p><h4><b>If you run a skill registry</b></h4><p>You are operating an app store. Assume it will be abused.</p><ul><li><p>Scan for one-liner installers, encoded payloads, quarantine removal, password-protected archives.</p></li><li><p>Add provenance and publisher reputation.</p></li><li><p>Put warnings and friction on external links and install steps.</p></li><li><p>Review top-ranked skills and remove malicious ones fast.</p></li></ul><p>Markdown is executable intent here.</p><h4><b>If you build agent frameworks</b></h4><p>Assume skills will be weaponized.</p><ul><li><p>Default-deny shell execution.</p></li><li><p>Sandbox access to browsers, keychains, and credential stores.</p></li><li><p>Use permissions that are specific, time-bound, and revocable.</p></li><li><p>Add friction for remote code and command execution.</p></li><li><p>Log provenance and actions end-to-end.</p></li></ul><h2><b>Designing for the future: The trust layer agents require</b></h2><p>This is the clearest proof yet of the point I made in my earlier post. OpenClaw is powerful because it collapses the distance between intent and execution. That is the magic. It also introduces significant risk. When capabilities are distributed as skills and installed via documentation, the registry becomes a supply chain, and the easiest install path becomes the attacker’s favorite path.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is not to stop building agents. The answer is to build the missing trust layer around them. Skills need provenance. Execution needs mediation. Permissions need to be specific, revocable, and continuously enforced, not granted once and forgotten. If agents are going to act on our behalf, credentials and sensitive actions cannot be “grabbed” by whatever code happens to run. They need to be brokered, governed, and audited in real time.</p><p>This is exactly why we need that next layer: when “skills” become the supply chain, the only safe future is one in which every agent has its own identity and has the minimum authority it needs right now, with access that is time-bound, revocable, and attributable.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">ElCity is a small, turn-based city builder that runs entirely inside Emacs.
  The UI is ASCII-based and optimized for terminal Emacs sessions.  The core
  simulation is deterministic and pure, while the UI handles rendering and input.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an excercise in implementing the “functional core / imperative shell” architecture
  in a moderately sized project that with a developed UI. Every tile type is defined through
  a DSL, with a strong separation between state and effects. Most functions in the core are
  either pure or pure-ish.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benefits to this approach:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>easy to debug</li>
  <li>scalable in terms of code: reduced cognitive load on both people and LLMs</li>
  <li>easy UX/UI as state is always localized</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>If you haven’t already heard, BMW’s R&amp;D teams have been busy “innovating.” Unfortunately, they aren’t focusing on the things that actually matter—like stellar engine performance or the legendary driving dynamics that gearheads love. Instead, the C-suite execs decided that the best use of their engineering budget was to design a proprietary security screw specifically intended to prevent BMW drivers from fixing their own cars.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1234" height="694" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/01/30111608/bmw_screw_patent.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-screw-that-no-one-else-can-turn">Autoblog.com</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>At first glance, it’s almost cute: a screw head shaped exactly like the BMW logo. But the novelty wears off the moment you consider the physics. Because this head prioritizes branding over utility, neither the bit nor the screw head can withstand the torque of a standard Torx or Hex fastener. The result? Broken bits, stripped screws, and more time spent on what would otherwise be a simple task.</p>



<p>It’s a masterpiece of anti-functional design. To the casual observer, it seems to serve no purpose other than to look “cool”, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of DIY repair, it ensures that a standard toolbox is useless for basic maintenance. In fact, the patent explicitly states this as a function of its design in <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=DE469242297">section [0006]</a>: “…to prevent being loosened or tightened…by unauthorized individuals.”</p>



<p>This type of insular protectionism isn’t a one off either, it’s baked into the corporate culture. Our CEO Kyle Wiens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/intellectual-property-circular-economy-bmw-apple">observed</a> this firsthand during a visit to BMW’s Recycling and Dismantling Center (RDC) located in Landshut just north of Munich, Germany. It’s a peculiar, one of a kind facility that recovers materials from pre-production and prototype vehicles that will never reach consumer hands. The RDC processes a few thousand vehicles each year which represents only a tiny fraction of the <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0454605EN/bmw-group-once-again-produces-more-than-one-million-vehicles-in-germany?language=en">more than one million cars</a> BMW produced in 2025 in Germany alone.</p>



<p>BMW doesn’t seem shy about <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0444794EN/bmw-group-recycling-and-dismantling-centre-rdc-:-30-years-of-setting-the-pace-for-the-circular-economy?language=en">declaring the RDC’s </a>mission either, proclaiming it a “template for the industry” while stating: “<strong><em>In view of new regulations</em></strong> and the BMW Group’s ambitious targets, the RDC will play an even more important role going forward…” (italics for emphasis). New regulations certainly have a way of encouraging ambitious targets, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Their barely-passive hostility towards repair and recycling is even less hidden on the operations floor. As Kyle noted during his visit, BMW’s engineers developed a clever tool to drain oil from shock absorbers so the oil could be reused: “When a member of my tour group asked if BMW sold it to other refurbishers, the man holding the tool looked confused, as though the suggestion was patently absurd. That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.” So much for a “template for the industry.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.”</strong></p>
<cite>Kyle Wiens; “Intellectual property is putting circular economy in jeopardy” for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/intellectual-property-circular-economy-bmw-apple">The Guardian</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In BMW’s defense—and the defense of an ever-growing list of manufacturers desperate to gatekeep their ecosystems—this isn’t their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23204950/bmw-subscriptions-microtransactions-heated-seats-feature">first dumb idea</a>. Heck, they’re not even the first to use security screws, the first dates back to the <a href="https://www.brycefastener.com/bryce-security-blog.html/2012/01/31/tamperproof-screws-are-history-the-age-of-high-security-screws-has-begun/">one-way screw</a> of the early 1900s. Since then, we’ve seen a parade of “tamperproof” fasteners flood the market, including some very <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">insidious designs</a> like the Pentalobe screws used on iPhones.</p>



<p>The justifications are always the same: anti-theft measures or “protecting” the user from dangerous components. While those excuses might hold water for public infrastructure or high-voltage utility boxes, they fall apart when applied to consumer products. In your garage, these aren’t safety features; they are <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">barriers to ownership</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear, it’s not like we’re anti-new screws or anything, as evidenced by our resident mechanical engineers <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/110702/torx-plus-the-high-tech-screw-hiding-in-our-gadgets">waxing poetic</a> about the functional benefits of strip resistant Torx Plus screws when compared to regular old Torx or Hex. Fasteners, like all things, are subject to improvement over time and we’re all for it. That’s not what proprietary security screws are designed to do though.</p>



<p>As with any cash-grab engineered to stifle repair, the DIY community isn’t taking it lying down. Our friends over at Adafruit didn’t even need a physical screw to win this round; they used BMW’s own spurious patent filings to map the dimensions and <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/02/02/from-ultimate-dr%E2%80%A6ogo-screw-patent/">3D-print a replica bit</a> to defeat the lock.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1536" height="864" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/01/30110849/Citizen-Engineer.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is where BMW’s plan hits a wall. We’re living in an era where the efforts of industrial giants can be unraveled by a hobbyist with a $200 printer and a bit of ingenuity. The fact that a grassroots effort can dismantle a multi-million dollar “security” initiative in a matter of days speaks volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tide is turning. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/right-to-repair-progress">Across the US</a>, we’re making massive strides in securing the right to repair our stuff, and that includes both <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/70877/deere-promised-farmers-the-right-to-repair-can-we-trust-them">commercial</a> and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_1,_%22Right_to_Repair_Law%22_Vehicle_Data_Access_Requirement_Initiative_(2020)">consumer</a> vehicles. In this climate, BMW’s move to lock down hardware with proprietary screws is tone-deaf and will be seen for the desperate cash-grab that it is.</p>
