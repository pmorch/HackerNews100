<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="govspeak">
<p>The National Drought Group met today (Monday 11 August) with the current water shortfall situation in England now defined as a “nationally significant incident.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five areas are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the driest six months to July since 1976.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the unsettled weather last month, many river flows and reservoir levels in England continued to recede compared to June.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rainstorms and showers helped mask the fact that July was still the fifth warmest on record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>August has started to see a return of drier conditions and the fourth heatwave of the summer - putting more pressure on already struggling public water supplies and navigational waterways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Drought Group - which includes the Met Office, government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, Canal &amp; River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts – used the meeting to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also praised the public for reducing their own daily usage, with Yorkshire Water reporting a 10% reduction in domestic demand following their hosepipe ban. This equates to saving up to 80 million litres per day – equivalent to 32 Olympic-sized swimming pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The less water that is used, the less needs to be abstracted from local rivers – therefore protecting the health of our waterways and wildlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="the-environment-agencys-director-of-water-and-ndg-chair-helen-wakeham-said">The Environment Agency’s Director of Water and NDG chair, Helen Wakeham said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water. We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with them, other land users, and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions. Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent rainfall has been welcomed by growers, although the impacts from the dry weather remain as farmers continue their harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Farmers Union noted how water shortages have impacted the growing season this year. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="nfu-vice-president-rachel-hallos-said">NFU Vice-President, Rachel Hallos said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>British farmers and growers continue to face extremely dry conditions, with harvest underway and crop yields proving mixed across the country. Some farms are reporting a significant drop in yields, which is financially devasting for the farm business and could have impacts for the UK’s overall harvest. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Farming is a long-term industry and there is growing concern about the months ahead. Minimal grass growth means many livestock farmers are already tapping into winter feed stocks, raising the risk of higher production costs later in the year.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Access to clean, reliable water is essential for food production. What’s worked well during this drought has been early, coordinated communication with stakeholders around licence restrictions and drought permits and orders and it’s crucial this continues.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To avoid the swing between extreme drought and flooding and to secure water supplies for food production, we urgently need investment in water infrastructure and a more effective planning system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Periods of dry weather and low rivers reduce oxygen levels in water that can lead to fish kills and more algal blooms. Lower river flows also prevent wildlife from moving up or downstream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drying out wetlands can be devastating for species that depend on those habits while England has seen an increase in wildfires, devastating vulnerable areas of heathland and moorland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Met Office updated the group on the future weather outlook, noting drier weather has returned.</p>

<h4 id="chief-meteorologist-at-the-met-office-dr-will-lang-said">Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, Dr Will Lang said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>This week is starting off warmer than of late across England and Wales with temperatures getting towards the mid-30s Celsius for some in the south.</p>

  <p>While conditions remain mostly&nbsp;settled across the south, the picture is more unsettled further northwest, with rain or showers at times.</p>

  <p>As we move into the second half of August, there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heat and climate change also impact human health, through issues such as heatstroke, dehydration, and respiratory problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Reed, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Philip Duffy, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, have also briefed Pat McFadden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, about the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="speaking-after-attending-the-meeting-water-minister-emma-hardy-said">Speaking after attending the meeting, Water Minister Emma Hardy said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Working with the National Drought Group, the Government is urgently stepping up its response to ensure we are successfully managing the impacts of ongoing dry weather. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Water companies must now take action to follow their drought plans - I will hold them to account if they delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We face a growing water shortage in the next decade. That’s why we are pushing ahead with root and branch reform under our Plan for Change, which includes £104 billion of private investment to build nine reservoirs and new pipes to cut leaks.</p>
</blockquote>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 500,000 customers with Anglian Water have had leaks identified via their smart meters. This helped the firm reduce leaks by a total of 187 million litres a day, equivalent to 75 Olympic-sized swimming pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anglian Water’s satellite technology has also helped prioritise leak detection, saving over 320,000 litres of water a day in rural areas, enough to supply 1,000 homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drought-and-the-environment-agency">DROUGHT AND THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency continues to work with Government, including Defra and the Cabinet Office, on the drought response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency has escalated its operational response and diverted resources to ensure a rapid and nationwide response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is conducting more compliance checks on businesses who abstract water to ensure regulations are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is actively engaging with water companies on requests for drought permits and drought orders and ensuring they follow their drought plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increased monitoring of river and groundwater level and more modelling of rainfall patterns to inform decisions, including additional restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency  is working closely with farmers in East Anglia, requesting voluntary reductions on surface water abstraction. This will help conserve and extend the total period when water is available for abstraction, protect the environment and delay the need for any formal restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regulator has sped up the process of alerting abstractors about restrictions.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licences-online">Manage your water abstraction licence online - GOV.UK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>There’s a lot to like about the Rationalist community, but they do have a certain tendency to spawn — shall we say — high demand groups. We sent a card-carrying Rat to investigate what’s really going on.</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>The rationalist community was drawn together by AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky’s blog post series The Sequences, a set of essays about how to think more rationally. You would think, then, that they’d be paragons of critical thinking and skepticism — or at least that they wouldn’t wind up summoning demons. &nbsp;</p><p>And yet, the rationalist community has hosted perhaps half a dozen small groups with very strange beliefs (including two separate groups that wound up interacting with demons). Some — which I won’t name in this article for privacy reasons — seem to have caused no harm but bad takes. But the most famous, a loose group of vegan anarchist transhumanists nicknamed the Zizians, have been linked to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/delirious-violent-impossible-true-story-zizians/">six violent deaths</a>. Other groups, while less violent, have left a trail of trauma in their wake. One is Black Lotus, a Burning Man camp led by alleged rapist Brent Dill, which developed a metaphysical system based on the tabletop roleplaying game Mage the Ascension. Another is Leverage Research, an independent research organization that became sucked into the occult and wound up as Workplace Harassment With New Age Characteristics.&nbsp;</p><p>For this article, I spoke to ten people who were associated with various rationalist-adjacent groups, including Black Lotus, Leverage Research, and the Zizians. I also spoke with people who were familiar with the early development of the rationalist community. I myself am a rationalist, and the rationalist community is closely knit; my interviewees included exes, former clients, and the dad of my kid’s best friend. I am close to my subject in a way most journalists aren’t. At the same time, I got an unprecedented level of access and honesty from members of a community that is often hostile to outsiders.&nbsp;</p></div>

											<p><h2>The problem of young rationalists</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The rationalist community as a whole is remarkably functional. Like any subculture, it is rife with gossip, personality conflicts, and drama that is utterly incomprehensible to outsiders. But overall, the community’s activities are less drinking the Kool-Aid and more mutual support and vegan-inclusive summer barbeques.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, some groups within the community have wound up wildly <em>dys</em>functional–a term I’m using to sidestep definitional arguments about what is and isn’t a cult. And some of the blame can be put on the rationalist community’s marketing.</p><p>The Sequences make certain implicit promises. <em>There is an art of thinking better, and we’ve figured it out. If you learn it, you can solve all your problems, become brilliant and hardworking and successful and happy, and be one of the small elite shaping not only society but the entire future of humanity.&nbsp;</em></p><p>This is, not to put too fine a point on it, not true.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple interviewees remarked that the Sequences create the raw material for a cult. To his credit, their author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, shows little interest in running one. He has consistently been distant from and uninvolved in rationalist community-building efforts, from Benton House (the first rationalist group house) to today’s Lightcone Infrastructure (which hosts LessWrong, an online forum, and Lighthaven, a conference center). He surrounds himself with people who disagree with him, discourages social isolation, and rarely directs his fans to do anything other than read his BDSM-themed fanfiction.&nbsp;</p><p>But people who are drawn to the rationalist community by the Sequences often <em>want</em> to be in a cult. To be sure, no one wants to be exploited or traumatized. But they want some trustworthy authority to change the way they think until they become perfect, and then to assign them to their role in the grand plan to save humanity. They’re disappointed to discover a community made of mere mortals, with no brain tricks you can’t get from Statistics 101 and a good CBT workbook, whose approach to world problems involves a lot fewer grand plans and a lot more muddling through.</p><p>Black Lotus used a number of shared frameworks, including the roleplaying game Mage: the Ascension, that would allow them to cut through social norms and exercise true agency over their lives. Brent supposedly had the most insight into the framework, and so had a lot of control over the members of Black Lotus — control he was unable to use wisely.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if Brent wasn’t there, Black Lotus would have been fine. One interviewee said that, when Brent wasn’t there, Black Lotus led to beautiful peak experiences that he still cherishes: “Brent surrounded himself with people who built the thing he yearned for, missed, and couldn’t have.”&nbsp;</p><p>But in other cases — as in Leverage Research — the toxic dynamics emerged from the&nbsp; bottom up. Interviewees with experience at Leverage Research were clear that there was no single wrongdoer. Leverage was fractured into many smaller research groups, which did everything from writing articles about the grand scope of human history to incubating a cryptocurrency. Some research groups stayed basically normal to the end; others spiralled into self-perpetuating cycles of abuse. In those research groups, everyone was a victim and everyone was a perpetrator. The trainer who broke you down in a marathon six-hour debugging session was unable to sleep because of the panic attacks caused by her own.</p><p>Worse, the promise of the Sequences is more appealing to people who have very serious life problems they need desperately to solve. While some members of dysfunctional rationalist groups are rich, stable, and as neurotypical as rationalists ever get, most are in precarious life positions: mentally ill (sometimes severely), traumatized, survivors of abuse, unemployed, barely able to scrape together enough money to find a place to sleep at night in the notoriously high-rent Bay Area. Members of dysfunctional rationalist groups are particularly likely to be transgender: transgender people are often cut off by their families and may have a difficult time finding friends who accept them as they are. The dysfunctional group can feel like a safe haven from the transphobic world.&nbsp;</p><p>People in vulnerable positions are both more likely to wind up mistreated and less likely to be able to leave. Elizabeth Van Nostrand, who knows many members of dysfunctional groups both rationalist and non-rationalist, said, “I know people who've had very good experiences in organizations where other people had very bad ones. Sometimes different people come out of the same group with very different experiences, and one of the major differences is whether they feel secure enough to push back or leave if they need to. There isn't a substitute for a good BATNA.”<sup>

</p><p>Still, vulnerability alone can’t explain why some members of the rationalist community end up in abusive groups. Mike Blume was a member of Benton House, which was intended to recruit talented young rationalists. He said, “I was totally coming out of a super depressive and dysfunctional phase in my life, and this was a big upswing in my mood and ability to do things. We were doing something really important. In retrospect, I feel like this is the sort of thing you can't do forever. You burn out on it eventually. But I would wake up in the morning and I'd be a little bit tired and trying to get out of bed and I'd be like, well, you know, the lightcone<sup>

</sup>
 depends on me getting out of bed and going to sleep and learning how to program. So I'd better get on that.”</p><p>Mike Blume was depressed, lonely, and unemployed when he entered the rationalist community, and he sincerely believed in both the art of rationality and the importance of the cause. The difference wasn’t his vulnerability. The difference was that his community helped him use his idealism and belief in the cause to learn real skills, become less depressed, and get to a more stable place.</p><p>One interviewee observed that the early rationalist community had been more supportive of less functional rationalists, perhaps because it was smaller. While it wasn’t capable of transforming them into a superhumanly rational elite (no one can do that), it helped them learn useful skills, and become independent. This interviewee said that, once the early rationalists became functional, they pulled the ladder up behind them. They (understandably) only wanted to hang out with people who already have their shit together. But without the support of more successful people, less functional new rationalists can be easy prey for anyone willing to offer help. &nbsp;</p><p>I’m not sure I agree. The early rationalist community had a number of success stories; it also had a guy that multiple people referred to, sighed, and said “that wasn’t a cult, he just did too many whippets.” The rationalist community I see provides a lot of support to many people who are neurodivergent, traumatized, or transgender; it also fails a lot of people. &nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Taking ideas seriously</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>When discussing dysfunctional or abusive groups, many academics treat their beliefs as secondary. The real coercive control comes from threats or sleep deprivation, social isolation or the manipulations of the leader; the beliefs are so many rationalizations. Most of my interviewees took great pains to say that this wasn’t true for them. While the problems were certainly exacerbated by social isolation and other interpersonal dynamics, the core reason for the dysfunctionality was the beliefs.</p><p>It’s difficult to understand the internal dynamics of the Zizians. They don’t have former members, and members tend to isolate themselves from their former friends. So anything I say about them is inherently speculative.</p><p>However, my interviewees and my own experiences are unequivocal: when the Zizians stabbed their landlord with a katana or got in a shootout with the cops, this was <em>really actually</em> because they believed an obscure version of decision theory that meant that you should always escalate when threatened. Social isolation likely made these beliefs seem more plausible, and their&nbsp; meditation techniques — including their belief that half of the brain can fall asleep while the other half remains awake, known as “hemispheric sleep” — likely made them less able to reason rationally.&nbsp;</p><p>But, long before weapons and violence were brought into the mix, Zizians seriously and coherently argued for their unusual version of decision theory. Their actions derive directly from beliefs they had for years. And several Zizians behaved violently without any opportunity for anyone to exercise coercive control. Most notably, Maximilian Snyder allegedly murdered Curtis Lind, who was the primary witness in the case against several Zizians. Before he was arrested, Snyder seems to have had little contact with Ziz other than reading her blog.</p><p>Leverage Research put a lot of work into developing a grand unified theory of psychology. What they called “Connection Theory” purported to explain how people’s goals, beliefs, and other mental processes interrelated. “Charting”— diagramming how an individual’s mental processes are connected — would allow people to understand themselves and resolve their mental problems. Charting was combined with “belief reporting”: setting a firm intention to tell the truth and then saying what you ‘really’ believe.</p><p>People would try to act in accordance with the artificially simple model of the mind created by these techniques, which could in itself cause mental health problems. For example, someone who belief-reported that they didn’t love their partner could wind up breaking up with their partner, even if in reality it just reflected transient irritation. But Leverage soon noticed that Connection Theory wasn’t a complete explanation of the mind. They began to explore alternate models, such as bodywork.&nbsp;</p><p>Through their explorations of bodywork and other “woo” practices, Leverage researchers began to believe that mental processes can interact and pass from mind to mind through microexpressions and other subconscious things. Leverage researchers initially used “demons” as a metaphor for these mental processes, but over time many researchers became more convinced that the occult was a real, powerful way to manipulate the subconscious. Occult beliefs pervaded many research groups. Routine tasks, such as deciding whose turn it was to pick up the groceries, required working around other people’s beliefs in demons, magic, and other paranormal phenomena. Eventually these beliefs collided with preexisting social conflict, and Leverage broke apart into factions that fought with each other internally through occult rituals.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Brent promoted a cynical version of the world, in which humans were inherently bad, selfish, and engaged in constant deception of themselves and others. He taught that people make all their choices for hidden reasons: men, mostly to get sex; women, mostly to get resources for their children. Whenever someone outside Black Lotus made a choice, Brent would dissect it to reveal the hidden selfish motivations. Whenever someone outside Black Lotus was well-respected or popular, Brent would point out (or make up) ways that they were exploiting those weaker than them for their own benefit. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy. One interviewee identified this ideology as the worst harm of Black Lotus, more than sexual boundary violations or being coerced into taking drugs. It took a long time to rebuild their ability to trust and have faith in other people.</p><p>Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who knew both Zizians and participants in Leverage Research, put it bluntly. “There’s this belief [among rationalists],” she said, “that society has these really bad behaviors, like developing self-improving AI, or that mainstream epistemology is really bad–not just religion, but also normal ‘trust-the-experts’ science. That can lead to the idea that we should figure it out ourselves. And what can show up is that some people aren't actually smart enough to form very good conclusions once they start thinking for themselves.”</p><p>One way that thinking for yourself goes wrong is that you realize your society is wrong about something, don’t realize that you can’t outperform it, and wind up even wronger. But another potential failure is that, knowing both that your society is wrong and that you can’t do better, you start looking for someone even more right. Paradoxically, the desire to ignore the experts can make rationalists more vulnerable to a charismatic leader. &nbsp;</p><p>Or, as Jessica Taylor said, “They do outsource their thinking to others, but not to the typical authorities.”</p><p>In and of itself, that dynamic is bad but not necessarily seriously so. Many effective altruists–members of a community closely linked to the rationality community–similarly defer to more experienced effective altruists. While effective altruists <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Jx6ncakmergiC74kG/deference-culture-in-ea">have widely critiqued this habit</a>, it results only in poorly thought out viewpoints about charity evaluation, not in violent crime. But bad actors can easily take advantage of the desire to find someone to think for you. If you’re using neither the normal error-checking processes of society nor your own mind, how can you tell if someone is wrong?</p><p>A rationalist virtue is “taking ideas seriously”: when you are convinced of a belief, you notice all its implications and act on them. Another rationalist virtue is “agency”: taking actions to pursue your goals, even if the actions are unusual or break the rules. Together, these are dangerous. We know what happens if you do normal things; an enormous number of previous normal people have found that out for us..&nbsp;</p><p>But if you’re using your decision theory to make decisions and not just to get a PhD in mathematics, it really matters that you chose correctly. If you’re using your all-encompassing theory of human psychology to decide how to treat people, it really matters that you actually understand it. And all of these are more dangerous if, instead of following reasoning you understand, you’re deferring to the judgment of someone else who seems like they’ve thought about it a lot. &nbsp;</p><p>Agency and taking ideas seriously aren’t bad. Rationalists came to correct views about the COVID-19 pandemic while many others were saying masks didn’t work and only hypochondriacs worried about covid; rationalists were some of the first people to warn about the threat of artificial intelligence. If you want better outcomes than normal people, then you also need to do something different than what normal people do. But diverging from the norm is often risky and the risks have often not been taken seriously.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Beware psychology</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The most interesting question I asked my interviewees was “what was your day-to-day life in the group like?”</p><p>Here is a sampling of answers from people in and close to dysfunctional groups: “We spent all our time talking about philosophy and psychology and human social dynamics, often within the group.” “Really tense ten-hour conversations about whether, when you ate the last chip, that was a signal that you were intending to let down your comrades in selfish ways in the future.” “Like somebody's going through a real bad breakup and you need to, like, hold their hair out of the toilet over text, tell them that it's going to be okay and help them put their life back together, except for years.”&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, when I asked interviewees in high-demand groups that wound up basically functional, like Benton House, they gave answers like: “I learned to drive, which was really important. I got my first programming job. We played calibration games and a rationalist version of Family Feud called Schelling Point.” "I wrote LessWrong posts and started a rationalist fiction novel, helped someone immigrate, and once scrambled like thirty eggs in a wok."</p><p>One Black Lotus member wanted to emphasize to me that Black Lotus wasn’t all bad. The abuse was real. But he had been stuck in a dead-end job for years when Brent Dill looked at him and said “you’re smart, you can be in charge of build for my Burning Man camp.” Suddenly, he was putting in sixteen-hour days running a team of a dozen people, and he was <em>good </em>at it. He realized that he could manage people, troubleshoot problems, and build something he was proud of. He felt capable in a way he never had before.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, interviewees who knew about Leverage Research emphasized that some research groups were much more dysfunctional than others. Research groups that focused on real-world goals — like incubating the cryptocurrency <a href="https://reserve.org/">Reserve</a> — tended to be more functional. On the other hand, research groups that focused on ten-hour debugging sessions using Connection Theory were recognized even within the group as being cultier.&nbsp;</p><p>The rationalist organization the Center for Applied Rationality seems at first blush like an exception to this rule. It develops curricula and teaches workshops about how to think more rationally, but — while in the past it occasionally blurred the line between rationality curriculum development, people management, and therapy — it doesn’t seem to have approached the level of Leverage Research. CFAR mostly tests its newly developed rationality techniques on outside volunteers, for about an hour each. They don’t do eight-hour debugging sessions. They also strove to be empirical as best they could. If a technique seemed to make workshop participants happier and better off, it stayed; otherwise, it was removed. &nbsp;</p><p>Rationalist groups tend to be functional to the extent that their activities involve learning to program, writing papers for general publication, building a giant dome on the playa, or otherwise interacting with the real world. Rationalist groups tend to be dysfunctional to the extent that their activities involve very long conversations about human psychology and social dynamics, especially dynamics within the group itself. Relatedly, the clearest-cut cases of rationalists being right have involved external events in the world and not the nature of human beings.</p><p>Diving deep into human psychology isn’t an unusual pattern for the Bay Area: from Esalen to Circling, many groups outside the rationalist community become obsessed with the inner workings of the mind and how they manifest in the group dynamic. But I think this obsession tends to inflame a number of harmful dynamics. They, of course, offer a lot of opportunities for bad actors to manipulate group members, but even if everyone involved is well-intentioned they end badly. There is no conflict so small that five hours straight of emotional processing can’t make it feel both profoundly important and profoundly unsolvable. This kind of conversation leads to guilt and shame when you don’t measure up; it leads to paranoia and isolation when outsiders don’t. And without the steadying influence of some kind of external goal you either achieve or don’t achieve, your beliefs can get arbitrarily disconnected from reality — which is very dangerous if you’re going to act on them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>One interviewee said, “One kind of cult you can have is when you and ten of your closest friends all live in a house together and you have the blackout curtains drawn and a lot of MDMA, and you sit around and talk about the implications of the whatever.” The rationalist community keeps spawning groups like this. Most are nothing but a (possibly fun) waste of time. But when the conversations become fraught and obsessively inward-facing, it can spawn Leverage Research, or Black Lotus, or the Zizians.<sup>

</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike agency or taking ideas seriously, I feel no compunctions about warning against very long, stressful conversations alternating between broader theories of human psychology and specific processing of the group members’ emotions. That kind of conversation is neither fun nor productive. If you’re having a tense conversation about feelings for ten hours, you might not be in a cult, but <em>something</em> has gone wrong.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Consequentialism&nbsp;</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Several interviewees identified consequentialism as one of the riskier ideas to take seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Brent Dill convinced some people that he was an extraordinary genius who would be capable of fantastic achievements, just as soon as he stopped being depressed. Therefore, from a consequentialist perspective, you should focus your effort on fixing his depression, no matter how much time or money or emotional energy it takes (and if you could throw your vagina into the bargain that would help too). The costs to you, no matter how large, are outweighed by the benefit a non-depressed Brent could bring to the world.</p><p>Several interviewees noted particular risks from overriding harms. “The issue is that ‘something, something dead babies’ justifies an awful lot,” said one interviewee. The long-term benefit that rationalists tend to be most worried about is AI. Many rationalists believe that an artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be developed very soon: for example, a mostly-rationalist team wrote the forecast <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">AI 2027</a>. Many of them also expect that, without heroic effort, AGI development will lead to human extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>These beliefs can make it difficult to care about much of anything else: what good is it to be a nurse or a notary or a novelist, if humanity is about to go extinct? Unfortunately, many people simply don’t have the skills to become AI policymakers or technical AI safety researchers. The vulnerable people particularly attracted by the Sequences are especially likely to not have enough work ethic or mental health to be able to contribute.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you do? You attach yourself to any project that seems like it might be able to help. The lucky ones accumulate a stack of rejections, or aimlessly drift from small grant to small grant and from badly-run nonprofit to badly-run nonprofit. The unlucky ones get sucked into a dysfunctional group.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people keep having the tense psychology discussions I talked about because they think AI is important and right now they can’t do anything to help. If you’re acutely aware that your ADHD or your trauma, your depression or your subclinical procrastination tendencies, are keeping you from preventing human extinction, then you’d do anything to fix it.&nbsp;</p><p>The overwhelming stakes of AGI can lead to a dangerous sense of grandiosity. “It’s a story in which they matter and in which it is justified for them to do weird stuff and stand up for themselves,” said an interviewee familiar with the Zizians. “Every action has great meaning, and that hooks into people in two ways. One of which is that it's empowering, and the other of which is that it's a great trigger for becoming obsessed with whether you're a bad person.”</p><p>He continued, “It makes it easy for small things to seem very big. And I think it also&nbsp; makes it easy for big things to seem sort of the same size as small things. When you get pulled over and then you get in a gunfight with the cops or whatever, this is the same level of treating the situation like it is anomalous or a big deal as having an argument about who washed the dishes.”</p><p>Early rationalist writing, such as the Sequences and the Harry Potter fanfiction <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>, emphasized the lone hero, standing defiantly against an uncaring world. But the actual process of saving the world is not very glamorous. It involves filling out paperwork, making small tweaks to code, running A/B tests on Twitter posts. Most rationalists — like Mike Blume — adjust well to the normalcy of world-saving. (Today he works as a programmer and donates to AI safety and global health nonprofits, a common rationalist career trajectory.) Others want acts of heroism as grand as the threat they face.</p><p>The Zizians and researchers at Leverage Research both felt like heroes, like some of the most important people who had ever lived. Of course, these groups couldn’t conjure up a literal Dark Lord to fight. But they could imbue everything with a profound sense of meaning. All the minor details of their lives felt like they had the fate of humanity or all sentient life as the stakes. Even the guilt and martyrdom could be perversely appealing: you could know that you’re the kind of person who would sacrifice everything for your beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>The project itself in each of these dysfunctional groups was vague, free-floating, and almost magical. As soon as you have to accomplish specific goals in the real world, the mundanity of everyday life comes flooding in, with its endless slog of tasks variously boring, frustrating, and annoying. But as long as you’re sitting in a room taking LSD with the blackout curtains over the windows, you can be Superman.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Beware isolation</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>When asked how people could tell that their project wasn’t a cult, one interviewee said, “You leave the house regularly. Or if there's an office, you leave <em>both</em> the office and the house regularly.”&nbsp;</p><p>A recurring theme in my interviews was social isolation and groupthink: speaking primarily or only to people inside the group; rejecting dissidents or outsiders as unenlightened, as ignorant, as evil. Several people remarked that the main sign that someone had become a Zizian was that they disappeared from the Internet for a few months, and the next you hear from them is a news article talking about how they’re wanted for murder.&nbsp;</p><p>Interviewees particularly emphasized the epistemic problems created by social isolation. People tend to check in with the people around them to see whether their actions or beliefs are reasonable. But if you want to trick someone into believing absolute nonsense, you can introduce them to four people who already believe it and keep them away from critics. Then it seems like “everyone” agrees.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes this dynamic was created deliberately. If one of his followers objected to his behavior, Brent Dill would ask a few of his other followers to talk to them about it. Even if three of them told Brent Dill he was in the wrong, the fourth might agree — and that was the one Brent sent to talk to the dissident. &nbsp;</p><p>Other times, the dynamic occurred more-or-less by accident. Researchers at Leverage all lived together, which seemed like a reasonable cost-saving measure. Researchers typically socialized and dated within the group. Leverage took care of many of its researchers’ needs: meals, transportation, even handling their mail. When members had mental health crises due to unpacking their trauma in debugging sessions, Leverage stepped in to make sure their needs were met. Although apparently compassionate, this pattern meant that many researchers got everything from Leverage: sense of purpose and meaning, work, therapy, friendship, romance, food, housing, and routine life maintenance. Connections to the outside world often faded. Some researchers, after they left, found themselves helpless in the wider world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, the broader rationalist community played into this isolation. Members of organizations that were on the outs among rationalists, including Leverage Research, have trouble talking about their work at parties. Instead of normal small talk, they find themselves having to justify or apologize for their group. Naturally, they wind up going to fewer parties — and losing contact with the broader rationalist community.&nbsp;</p><p>Leverage Research didn’t like firing people. When a researcher was a poor fit, or the program they’d originally joined closed, they were shuffled from group to group. That explains some of the wildly different experiences people had at Leverage: Leverage didn’t expel people who really shouldn’t have been there, either because Connection Theory was harming them or because they were hurting others. &nbsp;</p><p>The isolation and groupthink was reinforced by a culture of secrecy. The norm was that individual research groups kept their research secret, even from other research groups within Leverage. That meant that the more functional research groups couldn’t provide a check on the less functional groups. Without much ability to learn what other research groups were actually doing, dysfunctional research groups became paranoid about (sometimes demon-related) sabotage — further isolating themselves from any kind of outside influence.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>One of my interviewees speculated that rationalists aren’t actually any more dysfunctional than anywhere else; we’re just more <em>interestingly </em>dysfunctional. Dysfunctional workplaces, rape, abuse, and even murder aren’t unusual. People are more interested in rape or murder when it has a complicated and unusual philosophical justification, but we shouldn’t confuse being more fun to talk about with being more common.&nbsp;</p><p>Bearing that possibility in mind, what conclusions does my project suggest?</p><p>To some extent, dysfunctional rationalist groups are a product of features of rationalist culture that rationalists would rather not give up. For better or worse, rationalists want to act on their beliefs, and they want to do things differently from the society around them. But I believe it is possible to reduce the number of dysfunctional groups and how damaging they are.</p><p>For individuals concerned about joining a dysfunctional group, I suggest:</p><p>1. If your relationship with a person or a group consists mostly of discussions about human psychology and social dynamics, that is a yellow flag. It is a red flag if:<br>a. The conversations are many hours long and displace other activities in your life.<br>b. The conversations generally focus on group members’ feelings and interactions, rather than social science or philosophy.<br>c. The conversations are tense, stressful, and not fun.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Try to do things where there is some external gauge of whether you’re succeeding at them or not. Similarly, try to test your beliefs against reality.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Maintain multiple social groups. Ideally, have several friends who aren’t rationalists.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Keep your work, housing, and therapy separate.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Before assuming that something is true because everyone else seems to believe it, either check the argument yourself or talk to someone outside the friend group and who wasn’t introduced to you by anyone in the group.&nbsp;</p><p>6. The longer and more abstract a chain of reasoning is, the less you should believe it. This is particularly true if the chain of reasoning concludes:<br>a. That it’s okay to do something that hurts people.<br>b. That something is of such overwhelming importance that nothing else matters.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Be cautious about joining high-demand groups if you have nowhere else to go.&nbsp;</p><p>My recommendations for the general rationalist community are:</p><p>If someone is in a group that is heading towards dysfunctionality, try to maintain your relationship with them; don’t attack them or make them defend the group. Let them have normal conversations with you.&nbsp;</p><p>Think carefully about how we can create more realistic expectations in new rationalists and whether it would be possible to offer more of them the support they need to become useful community members.</p><p>Give people realistic expectations about whether they will ever be able to get a job in AI safety. Don’t act like people are uncool or their lives are pointless if they can’t work in AI safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider talking about “ethical injunctions:” things you shouldn’t do even if you have a really good argument that you should do them. (Like murder.)&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Now, I know I’m framing this as a completely unforseen outcome, a surprise betrayal, but the truth is that folks knew this would happen from the get-go. <a href="https://luxagraf.net/">Scott Gilbertson</a> wrote this in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408045015/http://www.webmonkey.com/2009/12/google_jumps_on_the_url-shortening_bandwagon_with_goodotgl">an article for Webmonkey/Wired</a> covering the services introduction in 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course the bigger problems with URL shorteners — link-rot, spam and redirect mishaps to name a few — are still problems regardless of whether the shortener is controlled by Google or anyone else. And for anyone who thinks that Google services have a better chance of being around far into the future, may we remind you that Google Notebook, Google Answers and several other services have disappeared over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prescient, right? The fact is that URL shorteners which don’t share their database (read: all URL shortners if you round up) are a terrible, no good, very bad idea. Link rot makes us amnesiacs, and if our history is our future, it’s looking very hazy.</p>
<h2 id="the-resistance">The Resistance</h2>
<p>Time and time again, moments before the ossified arches of a website are set to crumble due to active neglect by the arsonists on payroll in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, a certain brigade of ragtag vigilantes always rush in to save the furniture and family photos. I’m of course talking about the famed <a href="https://archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>.</p>
<p>The Archive Team are the same folks that saved <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/04/28/geocities_preservation/">Geocities</a> from Yahoo!, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-archiving-yahoo-answers-so-youll-always-know-how-b-1846643969">Yahoo! Answers</a> from Yahoo!, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/11/these-crusaders-want-preserve-human-culture-online-their-latest-target-yahoo-groups/">Yahoo! Groups</a> from… uh… well, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/">you know</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking now: “wow, these Archive Team people are the coolest ever, I bet they have clear skin and healthy hair”. Well, what if I could tell you that anyone who can operate a terminal can join the war effort in as little as two commands. Despair not if you don’t meet that description but desire to join the club, it’s also pretty easy to do by pointing and clicking.</p>
<h2 id="enlisting-in-the-fight-against-link-rot">Enlisting in the Fight Against Link Rot</h2>
<p>To join in the effort to help stem the damage goo.gl’s shutdown will cause, the Archive Team is trying to map all the short URLs (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>http://goo.gl/gEdpoS</code>) to their long URLs (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>https://www.clubic.com/int...</code>). How do we do that? Well it’s very simple, and very stupid:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit a goo.gl short link.</li>
<li>Observe what URL it redirects to, if any.</li>
<li>Do this again for every possible short link.</li>
</ol>
<p>As best as I can tell from the Archive Team tracker, it looks like there are about <del>3 billion</del> 230 billion<label for="sidenote-dcd0837b899bc60769b94246e448d3a3f914640aadb0a821f6612f301807a1f2">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>Thanks to arkiver on the Archive Team IRC for correcting this number.</span> links that need visiting. That’s just too many for one person to do. At the time of writing, <strong>there’s less than two weeks left to archive all these links</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Archive Team have put together a handy programme that automates this. It’s so easy to use that &gt;3,000<label for="sidenote-af20bb82e7c1f18070cfc4c8f24375d6a85082e086bda45836f021bc42031741">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>A quick estimate from quickly grep’ing the <a href="https://tracker.archiveteam.org/goo-gl/">leaderboard</a> so don’t hold me to that number.</span> other folks have used it to save goo.gl short links.</p>
<p>As I alluded to, there are two ways to run this programme (known as the Archive Team <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">Warrior</a>). It’s super easy and anyone can do it. Just don’t use a VPN or run this over an ISP that will block or alter websites. More info <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Can_I_use_whatever_internet_access_for_the_Warrior?">here</a> about that.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-command-line-and-docker">Using the Command Line and Docker</h3>
<p>Quoting from the <del>sacred texts</del> <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">Archive Team wiki</a>, you need simply:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Download and install Docker</a></li>
<li>Open your terminal on Mac and Linux, or your Command Prompt on Windows.</li>
<li>Copy/paste the first encantation</li>
</ol>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>docker run --detach --name watchtower --restart<span>=</span>on-failure --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --label-enable --include-restarting --cleanup --interval <span>3600</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="4">
<li>Copy/paste the second encantation</li>
</ol>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>docker run --detach --name archiveteam-warrior --label<span>=</span>com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable<span>=</span><span>true</span> --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size<span>=</span>50m --restart<span>=</span>on-failure --publish 8001:8001 atdr.meo.ws/archiveteam/warrior-dockerfile
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Visit <code>http://localhost:8001</code></li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it! Follow the on-screen instructions and make sure you click on the Goo.gl project (selecting “ArchiveTeam’s Choice” will do it). You can run this on your desktop or laptop, or even better yet, set-it-and-forget-it on a VPS or server somewhere in cloud land.</p>
<p>If you can’t/won’t use Docker, here are instructions for how to do this with <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Installing_and_running_with_Podman">Podman</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Installing_and_running_with_Orbstack">Orbstack</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pointing-and-clicking-with-virtualbox">Pointing and Clicking with VirtualBox</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Install VirtualBox</a></li>
<li>Grab the <a href="https://warriorhq.archiveteam.org/downloads/warrior4/archiveteam-warrior-v4.1-20240906.ova">Warrior Virtual Machine</a></li>
<li>In VirtualBox, click File &gt; Import Appliance… and open the file.</li>
<li>Start the virtual machine.</li>
<li>Outside of the virtual machine (<em>i.e.</em>, on your host), visit <code>http://localhost:8001</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="im-doing-my-part">“I’m Doing My Part!”</h2>
<p>I started running the Warrior on the 9th of August and, according to the <a href="https://tracker.archiveteam.org/goo-gl/">leaderboard</a>, I’ve uploaded more than 370,000 URLs, or about 14Gb worth at the time of writing<label for="sidenote-a4758764483dacd5447ee072256a27443ec300c88223948d4758d8f83d623b88">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>If you’re thinking the data size and the number of URLs is disproportionate, I’m right with you. I’m not sure what the deal is, but I know I’m misunderstanding something about the leaderboard.</span> other folks have used it to save goo.gl short links. We have less than two weeks with just under half a billion left to go as of the night of the 11th of August.</p>

<p>I’m not going to lie, I am more than a little bit motivated by the fact that I am above the median of individuals who’ve backed up goo.gl URLs (as judged by the position of the scroll bar when I Ctrl+F <code>jszym</code>). But I’ve also spent untold hours on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and the <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/">Geocities Gallery</a>. I’ve made stuff for the internet, relied on services to keep it around, and have them disappear due to capital interests or indifference. I’m happy to think that there is a very remote chance that I’m helping someone in the future unlock the secrets of our collective past.</p>

						<img width="900" height="604" src="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Qodo-Command-scores-71.2-on-SWE-Bench-Verified.png" alt="" loading="lazy">					</figure>
					<p>We’re excited to announce that Qodo Command, our CLI agent, achieved a scored of 71.2% on SWE-bench Verified (submission pending review), the leading benchmark for evaluating AI agents on real-world software engineering tasks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench.png" alt="" width="900" height="604" srcset="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench.png 900w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-300x201.png 300w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-768x515.png 768w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-48x32.png 48w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-58x39.png 58w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-72x48.png 72w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<p><span>This achievement is a strong signal that Qodo’s agents are built for the realities of production development. For use cases like reviewing code, writing tests, fixing bugs, and generating features, our CLI agent goes beyond autocomplete to deliver thoughtful, context-aware, and high-integrity code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="one-shot-real-world-execution">One-Shot, Real-World Execution</h2>
<p><span>Most AI benchmarks evaluate agents in isolated, simplified environments. However, SWE-bench Verified tests coding agents in messy, complex, real-world software engineering scenarios. Each test case in SWE-bench is built from a real GitHub issue in one of 12 widely-used, open-source Python repositories. Agents are given the GitHub issue and the codebase in the state it was in when the issue was opened, and must reason, plan, and edit code, iterating over many turns as a developer would – without shortcutting the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Qodo Command scored 71.2% using a single run of the production version of Qodo Command—no finetuning or benchmark-specific adjustments—exactly the way any developer would by running it out-of-the-box with the simple install package</span>: <code>npm install -g @qodo/command.&nbsp;</code></p>
<h3 id="llm-model-flexibility-amp-claude-partnership">LLM Model Flexibility &amp; Claude Partnership</h3>
<p>While Qodo Command is designed to support all top-tier LLMs, Claude 4 emerged as our model of choice for SWE Bench Verified results. Thanks to a strong partnership with Anthropic—Qodo is a “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/partners/powered-by-claude">Powered by Claude</a>” solution, we’re collaboratively building the world’s most adaptive and learning-oriented coding agents, leveraging one of the most advanced language models available today.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture-behind-our-71-2-swe-bench-success">The Architecture Behind Our 71.2% SWE-bench success</h2>
<p>Achieving high performance on SWE-bench wasn’t about optimizing for the benchmark–it was the natural result of engineering Qodo Command to excel at real-world software engineering challenges. Here’s how our architectural decisions directly contributed to its performance:</p>
<h3 id="context-summarization">Context Summarization</h3>
<p>SWE-bench Verified tests AI on complex, muli-file codebases where understanding interdependencies is crucial for success. Succeeding in this environment requires more than feeding raw files to an LLM, pattern-matching or autocomplete.</p>
<p><span>Qodo Command solves this by distilling multi-layered code into precise, high-signal summaries—ensuring that language models receive only the most relevant, structured context at every step. This enables deep reasoning, accurate generation, and high-quality reviews without hitting context limits or losing essential detail.</span></p>
<h3 id="execution-planning">Execution Planning</h3>
<p>Qodo’s default plan-first approach ensures that implementation begins only after a structured breakdown of user intent. Instead of rushing into action, we first deeply analyze the user’s goal, then decompose it into clear, actionable subtasks arranged for optimal execution. This creates a roadmap for the LLM, enabling precise task tracking and reliable validation. Completion is judged not just by output but by strict adherence to the original plan—gaps trigger feedback and retry loops until full alignment is achieved</p>
<h3 id="retry-and-fall-back-mechanisms">Retry and Fall-back Mechanisms</h3>
<p>When a tool call fails, Qodo agents don’t stop—they adapt. The system extracts error feedback, invokes the LLM to diagnose the failure, and intelligently adjusts the tool parameters or structure. Agents are empowered to retry up to three times if needed, refining their calls each round. If resolution isn’t possible through retries, the agent pivots to alternative strategies, ensuring progress continues despite initial breakdowns.</p>
<h3 id="powered-by-langgraph">Powered by LangGraph</h3>
<p>Qodo Command uses LangGraph, a framework for agents and agentic workflows that require structure, modularity and state management, giving Qodo Command modularity and speed. LangGraph enables graph-based orchestration, where each step is a configurable node. This foundation allowed us to reuse and extend proven components from Qodo Gen, our IDE extension—including code analysis, summarization and security scanning—while giving us the flexibility to split, extend and repurpose workflows effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="agent-tools">Agent Tools</h3>
<p><span>Qodo Command combines agentic reasoning with a powerful set of execution tools. These tools allow Qodo’s agents to operate more like expert developers—interacting with real environments, scanning large codebases, and thinking in structured steps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FileSystem: </strong>Standard tools for reading, writing, and editing files and directories. Since even state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs may produce errors when using exact matches with the edit file tool, we have implemented a fallback mechanism that allows fuzzy matching to improve the tool’s success rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shell Tool:</strong> executing like a real developer, Qodo agents can interact with the system shell to run build scripts and linters, execute test suites and validate hypotheses in real-time</li>
<li><b>Ripgrep</b>: for deep codebase understanding, Qodo Command is natively designed for optimized usage of ripgrep recursive search tool to locate relevant code across large repositories</li>
<li><b>Sequential Thinking</b><span>: structured agent reasoning helped contribute to the benchmark results by breaking down tasks into actionable steps. This shows the importance of interacting with ai coding agents in a step-by-step iteration, and how well structured tickets or PRDs can yield better code results. While this tool is not enabled by default, it can be easily added via MCP to any custom agent with Qodo Command.</span></li>
<li><strong>Web Search:</strong> this tool has been disabled for SWE-bench run to prevent data leakage in solutions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-qodo-command-exceptional-for-complex-codebases-code-quality">What Makes Qodo Command Exceptional for Complex Codebases Code Quality</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qodo.ai/blog/introducing-qodo-gen-cli-build-run-and-automate-agents-anywhere-in-your-sdlc/"><span>We recently announced Qodo Command</span></a><span> and it’s already transforming how we develop software at Qodo. What makes Qodo Command unique is our foundational focus on automation with integrity. Here’s what you can do with Qodo Command:</span></p>
<h3 id="code-integrity-automations">Code Integrity Automations</h3>

</ul>
<p>And many more agents that enhance code quality, which&nbsp; you can explore in Qodo Command <a href="https://github.com/qodo-ai/agents">agents</a> repository.</p>
<h3 id="ui-mode-for-reviewing-code">UI Mode for Reviewing Code</h3>
<p>Code quality doesn’t stop at generation—it depends on consistent, structured review. That’s why Qodo Command includes a dedicated UI mode with Qodo Merge, our advanced code review agent, built in.</p>
<p>This integration enables developers to generate and review code in a single, streamlined flow. Every AI-assisted task is automatically routed through a review process that checks for correctness, completeness, and quality—helping teams ship faster without lowering standards.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-you-build-next">What will you build next?</h2>
<p>Qodo Command isn’t built for benchmarks – it’s built for your production environment. The same version that ranked in the global top 5 on SWE-bench Verified is available today with a single command:</p>
<p><code>npm install -g @qodo/command</code></p>
<p>Use it to automate your code integrity workflows, accelerate code reviews, and generate tests, docs, and feature code—all while maintaining the quality standards your team depends on.

At the same time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">recent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">research</a> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">cast doubt</a> on whether those models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">have even a basic understanding of general logical concepts</a> or an accurate grasp of their own "thought process." Similar research shows that these "reasoning" models can often produce incoherent, logically unsound answers when questions include irrelevant clauses or deviate even slightly from common templates found in their training data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01191">a recent pre-print paper</a>, researchers from the University of Arizona summarize this existing work as "suggest[ing] that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text." To pull on that thread, the researchers created a carefully controlled LLM environment in an attempt to measure just how well chain-of-thought reasoning works when presented with "out of domain" logical problems that don't match the specific logical patterns found in their training data.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the seemingly large performance leaps made by chain-of-thought models are "largely a brittle mirage" that "become[s] fragile and prone to failure even under moderate distribution shifts," the researchers write. "Rather than demonstrating a true understanding of text, CoT reasoning under task transformations appears to reflect a replication of patterns learned during training."</p>
<h2>No one trained me for this!</h2>
<p>To test an LLM's generalized reasoning capability in an objective, measurable way, the researchers created a specially controlled LLM training environment <a href="https://github.com/ChengshuaiZhao0/DataAlchemy">called DataAlchemy</a>. This setup creates small models trained on examples of two extremely simple text transformations—an <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher">ROT cypher</a> and <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icee/2010/3997d483/12OmNvo67DA">cyclical shifts</a>—followed by additional training that demonstrates those two functions performed in various orders and combinations.</p>

<p>These simplified models were then tested using a variety of tasks, some of which precisely or closely matched the function patterns in the training data and others that required function compositions that were either partially or fully "out of domain" for the training data. For instance, a model trained on data showing two cyclical shifts might be asked to perform a novel transformation involving two ROT shifts (with basic training on what a single example of either shift looks like). The final answers and reasoning steps were compared to the desired answer using <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu">BLEU scores</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein Distance</a> for an objective measure of their accuracy.</p>
<p>As the researchers hypothesized, these basic models started to fail catastrophically when asked to generalize novel sets of transformations that were not directly demonstrated in the training data. While the models would often try to generalize new logical rules based on similar patterns in the training data, this would quite often lead to the model laying out "correct reasoning paths, yet incorrect answer[s]." In other cases, the LLM would sometimes stumble onto correct answers paired with "unfaithful reasoning paths" that didn't follow logically.</p>

<p>The researchers went on to test their controlled system using input text strings slightly shorter or longer than those found in the training data, or that required function chains of different lengths than those it was trained on. In both cases the accuracy of the results "deteriorates as the [length] discrepancy increases," thus "indicating the failure of generalization" in the models. Small, unfamiliar-to-the-model discrepancies in the format of the test tasks (e.g., the introduction of letters or symbols not found in the training data) also caused performance to "degrade sharply" and "affect[ed] the correctness" of the model's responses, the researchers found.</p>

<h2>“A false aura of dependability”</h2>
<p>Using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to introduce even a small amount of relevant data to the training set can often lead to strong improvements in this kind of "out of domain" model performance. But the researchers say that this kind of "patch" for various logical tasks "should not be mistaken for achieving true generalization. ... Relying on SFT to fix every [out of domain] failure is an unsustainable and reactive strategy that fails to address the core issue: the model’s lack of abstract reasoning capability."</p>
<p>Rather than showing the capability for generalized logical inference, these chain-of-thought models are "a sophisticated form of structured pattern matching" that "degrades significantly" when pushed even slightly outside of its training distribution, the researchers write. Further, the ability of these models to generate "fluent nonsense" creates "a false aura of dependability" that does not stand up to a careful audit.</p>
<p>As such, the researchers warn heavily against "equating [chain-of-thought]-style output with human thinking" especially in "high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, or legal analysis." Current tests and benchmarks should prioritize tasks that fall outside of any training set to probe for these kinds of errors, while future models will need to move beyond "surface-level pattern recognition to exhibit deeper inferential competence," they write.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://stardict-4.sourceforge.net/index_en.php">StarDict</a> is a
GPLv3-licensed cross-platform dictionary application. It includes dictionaries
for a number of languages, and has a rich plugin ecosystem. It also has a
glaring security problem: while running on X11, using Debian's default configuration,
it will send a user's text selections over unencrypted HTTP to two remote servers.
</p>

<p>
On August&nbsp;4, Vincent Lefevre
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250804092217.GA962280@qaa.vinc17.org/">
reported</a> the problem to the oss-security mailing list and to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370">
Debian's bug tracker</a>.
He identified it while testing his setup before the
upcoming Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") release.
Installing StarDict will also
install the <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> package by default, because the former
recommends the latter. The plugins package contains a set of commonly used
StarDict plugins, including a plugin for
<a href="https://www.youdao.com/">
YouDao</a>, a Chinese search engine that supplies Chinese-to-English
translations. The plugin also contacts a second online Chinese dictionary,
<a href="https://dict.cn/">
dict.cn</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would normally not be much cause for concern; of course a dictionary
program will include code to talk to dictionary-providing web sites. But one of
StarDict's features, which is also enabled by default, is its "scan"
functionality: it will watch the user's text selections (i.e. text highlighted
with the mouse), and automatically
provide translations as a pop-up. Taken together, the two features result in any
selected text being sent to both servers. This only occurs while StarDict is
open, but the application is designed to be left open in the background in case
the user needs a quick reference while reading.
</p>

<blockquote>
The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make
our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/daroc2/claim">becoming one of them</a>?
</blockquote>
<p>
StarDict on Wayland doesn't have this problem, because Wayland
prevents applications from being
able to capture text from other applications by default. That does mean that it
breaks StarDict's scan feature, though.
</p>

<p>
Xiao Sheng Wen, the Debian package maintainer for StarDict,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#10">
didn't see a problem</a> with the behavior, noting that if a user doesn't want
to use the scan functionality or the YouDao plugin, both can be disabled.
Lefevre
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#29">
wasn't satisfied</a> with that, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
But this is not the whole point. Features with privacy concerns
should never be enabled by default (unless the feature is the
only purpose of the package, and such a package would never be
installed automatically — and even in such a case, there should
be a big warning first).
</blockquote>

<p>
In response, Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#34">
pointed out</a> that
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-gtk">
the package description</a> can be read by any
user who chooses to install the software, and it does mention the scan feature.
That said, I noted during my investigation that the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-plugin">
description</a> of <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> did
not mention that the YouDao plugin uses an online service instead of an offline
dictionary. Xiao suggested splitting the networked dictionary plugins into a
separate package, but was "<q>not sure whether it's very necessary to do so</q>".
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the scan feature, while obviously a problem in this
context, is one of the reasons that a user might choose to use StarDict over an
alternative. Reading foreign-language media is often easier when words can be
sought in a dictionary with as little fuss as possible. From that perspective,
it makes sense that Xiao might not view the feature as problematic.
</p>

<p>
Any user who did read the description of the package, and who knew what the
YouDao plugin would do, might nevertheless expect the resulting communication to
at least be encrypted. But the plugin actually reaches out to its backend
servers — dict.youdao.com and dict.cn — over unsecured HTTP. So, not only are
these servers sent any text the user selects, but anyone who can view traffic
anywhere along its path can see the same thing.
</p>

<p>
This is not even the first time that StarDict has sent user selections to the
internet; the
same kind of problem
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534731">was
reported</a> by Pavel Machek in 2009 and
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#5">again</a>
by "niekt0" in 2015. The 2009 bug was solved by patching
the application's default configuration to disable networked dictionaries. That
appears to have worked for a time, but the YouDao plugin, which was added in
2016, does not respect the
configuration option. The 2015 problem was not fixed
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#57">until
August 6 of this year</a> (although the package was removed from Debian for
unrelated reasons for a few months from 2020 to 2021). That fix just removed the
<tt>stardict_dictdotcn.so</tt> plugin, which also sent translation requests to
dict.cn and was later subsumed by the YouDao plugin,
from the package. In fairness to Xiao, he
was not the
StarDict maintainer in 2015 —
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912065912/https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/stardict">
that was</a> Andrew Lee — but Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#28">knew</a>
about the 2015 bug since at least 2021, even if he didn't consider it a priority.
</p>

<p>
According to Debian's
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=stardict">package popularity
contest statistics</a>,
only 178 people have
StarDict installed, down from around a thousand between 2009 and 2015.
That obviously doesn't capture people who have configured
their Debian system not to participate in the statistics collection, but it does
suggest there were a number of people who might have been broadcasting their text
selections to the internet for several years. Given that people copy and
paste passwords from their password managers, or select the text of sensitive
emails and documents during the course of editing, that should be a significant cause
for concern.
</p>

<p>
Debian is a large distribution, containing tens of thousands of packages.
Moreover, because of its commitment to stability, a decent fraction of these
are older software with delayed or sporadic updates. The reality is that Linus's
law ("<q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</q>") only holds up if
people are looking — and if, once they have looked, and have reported things,
the people who have taken up maintenance of the software actually agree that
there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
Part of the justification for moving to Wayland over X11 is to make security
vulnerabilities relating to one application spying on another more difficult to
introduce. That obviously has to be balanced against the
cost of adapting to a new way of doing things, but it's not hard to see why so
many people are eager to make Wayland work. Maybe, in the future, StarDict's
default behavior would
have had little to no impact. Or maybe StarDict would have started asking for
special permissions to let it work on Wayland, and users would have accepted
those defaults the same way they currently do.
</p>

<p>
Either way, the existence of serious security problems that can be
found, diagnosed, reported, and still remain unfixed is cause for concern. Linux
has long enjoyed a reputation for security; maintaining that reputation depends
on the developers, maintainers, and users of open-source software caring enough
to fix security problems when they arise.

<p>This is a blog post based on a transcript of a talk by Devine on November 26th 2022. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJuOwy4aGA" target="_blank">video version</a> on (YouTube). The slideshow presentation was made using <a href="https://100r.co/site/adelie.html">Adelie</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to Matt Mascarenhas for providing us with an auto-transcript, it would have taken us ages to put this text together without it.</p>

<p>While we are grateful to have had the opportunity to give this presentation, an event in 2025 has resulted in us distancing ourselves from the conference responsible for hosting this talk. Below is a text by Devine explaining the situation.</p>

 		<p><b>February 2025.</b><i> Some months ago, attendees of the Handmade Seattle conference expressed their grievances with the November 2024 conference in regards to its pivoting to include talks with mentions of social justice awareness and a slightly more diverse panel of speakers, at the cost of the usual guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of that exact flavor.<br>
		In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders, promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free and open source software developers would no longer be welcomed as speakers.<br>
		I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of low-level talks, and not something else. It did not take long for bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.<br>
		What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and partially blaming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since requested for the talk videos to be removed from their YouTube channel, Vimeo, and their website.</i><br>Reposted from <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html" target="_blank">xxiivv.com</a></p>

<h2>Weathering Software Winter</h2>

<p>I work with a little studio called Hundred Rabbits, it is a small collective of two which operates from a small solar-powered sailboat. All of our devices are donated, discarded devices. Our <a href="https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html">philosophy</a> is that to make fast software, you need slow computers, and we've tried to espouse this as much as we could. We spend our time sailing around, and doing experiments with resilience, that covers computers, but we also touch on food security, preservation, and on studying past technologies that could be used today in times of crisis.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_04.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We started sailing seven years ago, it took us all around the Pacific. We went through <a href="https://100r.co/site/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/french_polynesia.html">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/new_zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, up through <a href="https://100r.co/site/fiji.html">Fiji</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/japan.html">Japan</a>, and then followed the Russian Coast, brushing by Alaska before returning to <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a>. Our thinking was that we could keep doing art, music, and video games as we sailed around, but it soon became obvious that all the technology that we took for granted, and that we had with us, was not designed to leave the Western world.</p>

<p>The moment we cast off from Mexico, all of our devices started breaking down. In his 2022 Handmade Seattle opening speech, Abner was making a point about the Roombas starting to fail. If your Roomba fails, you pick up a broom, but on a sailboat you depend on devices working to find your position, knowing the weather, etc. These things have a more direct impact on your survival, and all of that technology is built on the same stack as the Roomba.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_05.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Many of the tools that we thought we could rely on broke down, whether it is Apple products, or software that require subscription services, <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr>, etc. As an artist you spend time developping a skill, you become a Photoshop illustrator. When your connection to the internet fails and that the software locks up, that skill that you thought was yours was actually entirely owned by someone, and can be taken away.</p>

<p>Even though we've been paying for this sort of software for years, the moment that you can't have access to authenticate yourself that skill is gone. We didn't expect this, it scared us.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_06.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Nowadays, everything is built on the cloud. While sailing along the US coast in early 2016, we'd stop by conferences to see all the happenings in tech. We would speak with people at the booths, and they would try and sell us their product, but we'd have to stop them mid-sentence to ask, "Does it work offline?" 99% of times people say, "ah, yeah no, sorry. It's on the cloud."</p><p>It seemed that no one was building things that we could use. This was a sad realization. I love programming, and for a time it seemed that it was utterly incompatible with our new way of life.</p>

<p>Before I go on any further, I will paint you a picture of what it looks like to try to use modern stacks when away from the shores of the Western world.</p>

<p>Imagine two people in a small sailboat in the tropics, somewhere like the Marquesas, or another island in the South Pacific Ocean. These islands are covered with beautiful lush forests, they require rain and sun, that's all, then there's us sharing that same space, busy lifting a smartphone in a Ziploc bag up the mast to try and get one bar of signal to update Xcode, which at the time was 11 gigs. We had a stack of cards, each worth two gigabytes of mobile data, but with Xcode you can't resume the download if it fails. We could swap the codes for the cards, and if we did it within 10 seconds it would detect a timeout and would continue. The problem is that if the download is not done by 1600, then the sun is setting, the solar panels aren't charging the batteries anymore, and our laptops are dying. The download is at 7 gigs with three more hours left to download the update, it won't finish, and we will have spent all that data for nothing.</p>

<p>This wasn't ideal. We tried to look for alternatives...</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In 2016, we were publishing games for iOS, we used Xcode, as well as iPhones, and Macbook Pros. Rek used Photoshop to draw, having never been exposed to tools like Krita, and Gimp. We knew of Linux back then, but not well enough to consider it. As artists, we didn't think Linux could work for us (evidently, we were wrong). We'd always lived in cities, close to an internet connection. Updating Xcode on a fast and stable home connection was never a problem, we never looked at the size of any download because we didn't have to care. On land, we had seemingly infinite power, and we had bandwidth. When resources are scarce, then we had to start focusing on details like download size, and how much sun the day will bring. We were so focused on sailing that first year, that we didn't stop to think if it made sense to do iOS development while traveling. When we left Canada we were a bit naive, but we didn't know what we didn't know. Now, in 2023, Rek draws mainly by hand, and processes drawings with Gimp. Both of us use linux(Manjaro), and we don't own a smart phone. See <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for further details on our shaky beginnings.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_07.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We noticed that all the software that we had written in the past was gradually becoming unusable. We grew up in Montreal, and many of our friends worked in <abbr title="Triple-A">AAA</abbr> studios like Ubisoft, making free-to-play games, building projects that had a lifespan of three years. The projects that we made in the past on the Apple stack, Electron, or on Unity3D, also had a lifespan of three to four years, but games like Super Mario, as well as others produced in that era, are still playable today. We are in a dark age, where game developers and artists spend years building games that quickly become lost <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/stack.html" target="_blank">bitrot</a>. We'll never be able to play Scott Pilgrim on the PlayStation again.</p>

<p>Looking online, it seemed that others shared these concerns.</p> 

<p>In the above image are four philosophies of digital data preservation, they all have their flaws. Data preservation is a somewhat new field, we don't know what sort of data we'll be able to recover in a hundred years, but from the experiments that we've looked at, it doesn't look good. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> had a project where they were trying to mimic one of their longest lasting books, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book" target="_blank">Domesday book</a>. It was written by monks a few hundred years ago. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s thinking was that we still have this book today, we can still read it, do we have technology to make something like this? Is it possible to record our way of life today, so that people in a thousand years can see how we lived? They created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Domesday_Project" target="_blank">BBC Domesday</a>, a disc that contained music, movies, and scientific papers. Then 10 years later, it was an unreadable, people forgot how to decrypt and decompile the disc. It seemed that there was no real way to preserve data long-term, and so we decided to try our own little experiment.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, all that I am writing now is very naive. I draw, and I make music, when I started doing research I didn't have the vocabulary to find what I was looking for. I didn't know what virtual machines were, I didn't know what compilers were either. I had a vague idea of what programming was. I had written Swift and Objective C, but had no conception of how it actually tied to processors. It seemed like I was learning a service, the same way I was learning "To Photoshop". It wasn't like learning a skill, you don't learn to draw when you use Photoshop, you learn how to operate within the confines of someone else's playground, and when that rug is pulled from underneath you, there's nothing you can say or do, and you never really understood how it worked in the first place so you can't really replicate it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_08.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We eventually stumbled on the words <b>virtual machine</b>. With a Super Mario brother <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> file, I knew I could put it on a computer and I could run it, I could run it on my phone, I could run it on an old computer, I could run it on a Super Nintendo, I could also run a Super Nintendo emulator running Mario on a Nintendo 64. This seemed a good way of preserving data. We decided to not give up entirely on software, and to see what could be done in that space using virtual machines.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_09.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware is extremely cheap, and because it is it's covering the world with e-waste, and all of it is there for the taking. Everyone has drawers full of old devices, Super Nintendos, Playstations, Dreamcasts, all of which are considered obsolete, people stopped developing games for them, but we thought we could give a second life to such devices. When looking into how this could be done, it led us to interesting places. We became interested in seeing how we could repurpose old electronics. There didn't seem to be any competition. If you do like everyone else, you're competing with everyone else. For example, if making iOS 10 software the marketplace is completely saturated, but if you're going be release an Atari game today, it's going to be huge. There's no one giving purpose to these devices anymore. We tried to do something completely left field. To start, our goal was to try and make games for the NintendoDS.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_10.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So looking at a VM from the outside, without having a sort of academic background, the first thing you find is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank">JVM</a>. I've never written any Java, but I would go around and tell my friends who are actual programmers, "I'm gonna make the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>! It seems like this would solve our problem!" Their response was that the JVM was so fractalized, and that this wasn't what we were looking for. We found plenty of academic papers with no software written for them.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_11.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I dabbled into the Java ecosystem, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_12.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I knew that we wanted to make playful little projects that could run on a variety of devices, on a sort of cross platform that was not Electron. Instead of always targeting the new modern thing, we thought we could make a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, or something other, that could run increasingly further back into the past.</p>

<p>There is an incredible amount of fast computers out there. The first time <a href="https://100r.co/site/donsol.html">I made an NES game</a>, I was surprised at how much stuff I could draw on the screen at 60 fps. I had somehow been convinced that modern technology was better, faster, and all the eight bit stuff had been solved problems, I thought that we had explored this problem space entirely.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_13.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It didn't seem to be the case. There were a lot of ideas in the past that were forgotten, and I made it my mission to explore this. It was <abbr title="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-2)">COVID</abbr>, everyone was confined to their homes, it was the perfect time to figure out how computers work. We're going to look into the past to see how people did it, and what ideas were forgotten.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_14.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>There was a time when computers were super playful, but now they feel cold, and have been weaponized against people. The sort of playfulness that you'd find in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob" target="_blank">Microsoft Bob</a>, I can't really find a parallel for today. I can imagine what Microsoft Bob would look like if made today, it would try to sell you all sorts of shit. I don't think we, as a society, have a system in place that would foster the creation of something as playful as this.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_15.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>A realization that I had working on something like this was that customizing your hardware, and your software, makes you care.</p>

<p>If you buy something off the shelf, like an iPhone, which you can't change, you're less likely to care for it, and it's going to end up in a drawer. Back then you could go to Radio Shack and get parts for your computer, it was possible to customize it (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800" target="_blank">Altair</a>), and then you could know it in its entirety. Devices that were customized, or built from near-scratch, are still loved, but as for your old iPhone6, you don't know where it is, and even if you did it's probably unusable. Devices like the iPhone6 can't be repaired, they are designed to fail in ways that are inscrutable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_16.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Instead of trying to make things as broadly accessible as possible, we thought we'd try to see what we could do if we designed it for just one person, a sort of personal computing that was not designed to scale.</p><p>I can see the appeal of languages like Rust, I won't be learning it, but if you're convinced that you can use computers to solve problems, then obviously this will not be relevant to you. I think that if you are forced to use a computer, there is no way that it can be playful. There was a writer who said, "if you're forced to play, you can't play."</p>

<p>I don't have a smartphone. Walking in Seattle I saw the streets lined with lime scooters everywhere, to see the menu to be allowed to use a scooter you need to scan a QR code. There's a layer of reality that's being forced onto people to use technology.</p>

<p>This is not what I'm talking about here. What we're trying to do is something that is closer to your personal computer, something that would be designed and tailored to help you play.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_17.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>When we began looking at what VMs there were, we looked into the past, and that brought us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank">Smalltalk</a>. I read this book called What the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said" target="_blank">Dormouse Said</a>, and it talked about the history of Stanford, and how people had this utopian idea of what computers could be. This is way before I even became interested in computers, learning what their vision was then made me optimistic about what could be done.</p>

<p>That was when I was first exposed to the idea of a virtual machine, or byte code. As I mentioned before, looking up information online without the vocabulary you need to find things is really difficult. There was no way I could go around learning about personal computing without spending some time learning Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_18.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Obviously, the moment that you start going that down that route, you will have people telling you that you really have to try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine" target="_blank">Lisp machines</a>. I spent time learning about Symbolics and LVP. I learned about a sort of system where the whole thing could be inspected, a system that was trying to do computing in a very personal way.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it's akin to the browser, where you can go on a website that you like, and right click to inspect. It is less and less the case now, but for a while you could inspect websites to see how it was put together. This was empowering, emblematic of the era.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_19.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>This doesn't work on a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> at all, but it's relevant because <b>Niklaus Wirth</b>, who wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Oberon</a>, wrote an entire operating system that came with a book.</p>

<p>The Oberon book is really nice, especially if you come into it with a clear mind, without prior knowledge or expectation of what programming is. The book explains how to build an operating system from scratch. It uses a language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a>, which is very easy to read, more beautiful than other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL" target="_blank">ALGOL languages</a>. One of the first things that it teaches you to do is how to draw pictures, which I thought was kind of interesting as someone who's very visually-inclined.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_20.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>In the book Niklaus Wirth mentions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine" target="_blank">P-machine</a>. I was beginning to form an idea of what virtual machines were, and he just briefly mentions it, "oh! By the way, I wrote this Pascal compiler targeting a virtual machine." I was like, "a language can target a virtual machine?! What?" And the reason why it was so easy for him to port the compiler between platforms, is that the opcodes running it were extremely simple, and very few in number.</p>

<p>I thought then, <b>this</b> is a way to do data preservation that is appealing to me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_21.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I learned Pascal.</p>

<p>Pascal is a beautiful language. In the above image, I am running it in an emulator for the Macintosh. I loved that I could have a whole operating system running in a small window that wasn't Linux, that wasn't some big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU" target="_blank">QEMU image</a>. It was a little self-contained system, which I could destroy, or start over with really quickly.  I could run it and do 3D at 60 fps by running the emulator at 128 times its speed, and thought that was cool, a testament to how fast computers are nowadays.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_22.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>That led me to learn about the history of C.</p>

<p>I migrated all my platform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Plan 9</a>. Plan 9 has its own C compiler, and it's not quite C89, it's its own thing, a no-concessions system.</p>

<p>The people who built this weren't planning to make money with it, you can really tell that it's a product of love. That made me optimistic about what personal computing could be.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_24.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Plan 9 didn't run on a VM, but it inspired another system. The lessons that they learned during Plan 9 led to the building of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Inferno</a>, which runs on a VM.</p>

<p>I think I was starting to understand what <abbr title="Virtual Machines">VMs</abbr> were. If this entire operating system runs on a vm, this is what I wanna be doing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_25.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The scale of something like Inferno is quite big, but in an afternoon I could run through the whole C code for this virtual machine. The above (image) is the opcodes that it had.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_26.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It was in part inspired from the actual hardware that ran the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton" target="_blank">Apple Newton</a>.</p>

<p>I could run it in an afternoon, and know exactly how it ran. I would look at the compiler that targeted the Dis virtual machine, and could see how they reduced the problem-space to a limited number of operations.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_27.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The people who worked really hard in the past to get away from time-sharing system would laugh, or they would cry, at how we got tricked into falling back in that situation where computers were something that was done behind a wall. You have a terminal, but that's where your power ends.</p><p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_28.jpg" loading="lazy">

</p><p>I wanted a way of doing computers that nobody could take away from me.</p>

<p>I would read people who would write entire operating system on a weekend, but I couldn't even map this idea onto things I was seeing, a bridge was missing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_29.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The modern stack doesn't really work for us, it doesn't apply to the limitations that we have on the boat. We have 180 watts of solar. We just spent the whole summer with two 6-volt batteries, which is very small. When you're going down that route, at every turn people are telling to just put more solar panels, or to buy more batteries. That is such a modern way of solving your problem. In reality, technology like this(especially high-tech) rarely solves problems. It creates a lot of other problems, which on a sailboat is very immediate. Putting more solar would mean more windage, more chance of things flying off and cutting our limbs. More batteries would mean the boat would be heavier, it would stop us from being able to run away from storms.</p>

<p>The limits of a sailboat gives us a space for creativity, and these limitations became a sort of playground for us.</p>

<p>I am not the sort of programmer who could build Plan 9, or Oberon, or Lisp machines, but I knew I could write simple NES games and port them. I couldn't write an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game inside an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game, and that was such a shame. I wanted something that was completely bootstrapped.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_30.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p> So after looking at 6502, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> emulator was extremely complex, more complex than I could grasp. It was the limit of what I think a single person could understand. It seemed like a simple system, it was just a box, but writing an emulator for it was more than a weekend project. I was looking for something that I could nail in a single weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_31.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>6502 has a lot of mnemonics. When trying to implement the 6502 as a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, it is possible to make a naive implementation in a week, or in a weekend if you don't do anything else. My knowledge of C is very limited, but luckily I had help. I wondered if this instruction set could be reduced further...</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_32.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It got me thinking about complexity, and on what simplicity means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov" target="_blank">Kolmogorov</a>, the mathematician, said that the index of complexity of any one system is the length of the program that could generate a specific string. I really like that way of looking at complexity and simplicity, because nowadays it's sort of convoluted. If you don't really know about hardware, it seems that everyone's trying to make the programmer comfortable, and not focusing on making an actual fast product.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know who are hobbyist programmers use type systems, memory safety, all sorts of <i>training wheels</i>(I'm kidding here, if you're a large team, please do use type systems for god's sake). When I work on my own, I want to reduce the problem space to as little a thing as I can make it. I don't like programming that much, and in the future I'm gonna hate it probably even more, so I want my future self to be able to reimplement my entire system at most in a weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_33.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So where does that bring me? 6502 is beyond the scope of what I was hoping to do, because having done it twice already, I don't think I'll have it in me to do it again.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_34.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Looking back at that same era with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, this was a time when people would build paper computers to teach kids to understand what a program counter was, how things moved around in the program, and how to navigate byte code.</p>

<p>No one can take a paper computer away from you. As long as you have paper and pen you can still solve problems, albeit slowly, and more painfully, but this is a form of computing that can be easily ported.</p>

<p>When I was looking at the <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s Domesday book, I noticed that Alan Kay(Small Talk) also had a project that was in line with what I was trying to do. He thought, "Smalltalk is a vm, how much of a small VM can possibly run smalltalk-72."</p>

<p>He wrote a paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2814228.2814250" target="_blank">The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015</a>, he had all these words to talk about computers that went viral. He said things like, "Lisp was the Maxwell equation of programming." As a minimalist geek I was glad to hear this, it's what I wanted, but then looking into Lisp, I thought that a language that creates garbage by design wasn't really what I was looking for. This was a bit more like it, but it was a register machine, and I didn't see how that mapped to Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_36.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So <a href="https://sr.ht/~bctnry/chifir/" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a> is not exactly what I'm looking for, but there are plenty of other ways of doing computing out there. Instantly, I fell onto one-instruction set computers, like <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/subleq.html">SUBLEQ</a>. I thought it was a disgusting tar pit, but I could implement it in 15 minutes, and I would be really kind for my future self to make a system that could run on something that I could implement in 15 minutes.</p> 

<p>The problem was that the toolchain required to write things that could actually have any purpose for it was immense. There were people who wrote C compilers down to Subleq, but this shifts the whole complexity back to the compiler, and that doesn't solve my problem. </p>

<p>There were computing paradigms which I absolutely loved, so pure, so beautiful, but at the same time they mapped so poorly to silicone that they didn't really work for me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_37.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/thue.html" target="_blank">Thue</a>(one of my favorites) is an esoteric programming language that has one operator, and only has a replacement rule. So you have an accumulator, which is a series of characters, and every rule, one for every line, is a replacement of what's on the left with what's on the right. It was very slow, but extremely powerful, and could be implemented in 30 minutes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_38.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html" target="_blank">FRACTRAN</a> was another <abbr title="One-Instruction Set Computer">OISC</abbr> system. It has one operation: multiply. Its primitives were not bytes, or shorts, but fractions. It used prime encoding, which was one of the most beautiful mathematical concept that I knew of.</p>

<p>For a while I thought I had found my bedrock, I was going to use fractions to make computers. The only issue... is that it maps poorly to silicone.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_39.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/logic.html" target="_blank">SKI calculus</a> was beautiful, it has this mathematical elegance to it. I went down that rabbit hole, and I barely emerged back alive.</p>

<p>I recommend everyone to take a Lisp detour, and then learn SKI, to read Smullyan, and to read about others like him who don't care about making products, but really want to explore software in a way that is very creative and artistic. I almost made this my bedrock, except that at the VM layer garbage collection was a bad idea.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_41.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/brainfuck.html" target="_blank">Brainfuck</a> has 7 instructions, implementing it would take 45 minutes, maybe an hour.</p>

<p>We are going up the abstraction chain here, and the pattern I was seeing was that the lesser a mnemonic or complexity that you reduced it to, the slower it got. Brainfuck was surprisingly fast, you could run a mandelbrot on a system that was quite small to implement, but that wasn't the sort of programming I wanted to do. It led me to another system...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore" target="_blank">Chuck Moore</a> never came up in my books about Stanford, he must have been some sort of outsider. FPGA is not something I was very quite familiar with, but people were trying experimental computing systems with them. It didn't matter, it was goo, you could shape it in any way you wanted.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_40.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Someone wrote an <abbr title="Field-Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</abbr> system called <a href="https://excamera.com/files/j1.pdf" target="_blank">J1</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth system</a>. It had very few opcodes, but had one of the most beautiful mapping of byte code I had ever seen. The Stack Machine primitives were implemented so you could combine them with each other, with weird combinations of bit toggles on a byte you could have really interesting esoteric stack manipulators.</p>

<p>I was smitten.</p>

<p>It's a 16-bit Forth system, the biggest literal you can have in one of those words would be like 35k fixed. The arithmetic was really beautiful, but the whole system's maximum program that it could run was four kilobytes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_42.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>What I had in mind was slightly <b>more</b> than four kilobytes, but not much more. If I could have a full addressable, 64 would be really nice. I didn't want the complexity of the 6502.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_43.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/chip8.html" target="_blank">CHIP-8</a> is an interesting system that has a rich, vibrant community of people who build things for it during game jams.</p>

<p>The spec is quite simple, it fits on maybe two pages of paper, side by side. It feels like the paper computer in ways that I like, but it was not designed to be a general purpose driving <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. It is meant to be building things in the scale of Pong. The keyboard is like a hex keyboard with just numbers on it. My plan was to build something that could build itself in it, so I'd need a keyboard, a cursor-a weird keyboard for me would not cut it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_44.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MachineForth" target="_blank">Machine Forth</a> was something I stumbled upon after. Chuck Moore wrote Forth, and then he thought it too complicated. I thought, "what do you mean it's complicated? There's like no syntax, no nothing. It's space-divided language. Implementing a Forth system is really fast." Chuck More, being himself, thought that he could do without all this 'cruft'. He reduced even further to Machine Forth which has 32, or 24 opcodes.</p>

<p>I kept seeing Forth over and over again, and couldn't really grasp, or see the beauty in it for a while. If you've just come from Lisp, you have whiplash when you fall into Forth. It has similar beauty. Lisp would be prefix, Forth would be <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/notation.html" target="_blank">postfix</a>. Following that mindset you think you could be anyone, or you could do anything, and you chose to be Algol, why?</p>

<p>Going back and forth between Forth and Lisp, I couldn't make up my mind, but I kept seeing people who would fall in love with Forth, but were really bad at selling it. With Lisp it's really hard to find any Lisp code that you can actually copy/paste in a project because everyone's using weird macros, and libraries, and nothing is portable.</p>

<p>Forth had a different problem, everyone I'd talk to would say Forth was the best, and that I should really use it, but then I'd ask them questions like, "how do I calculate the distance between two points?" I walked away from that interaction thinking, well, it seems like a lot of people like Forth, but don't write it. It was hard to find any code at all. I know Forth is not portable, but it was hard to find just actual use-case of Forth that wasn't someone trying to learn Forth by implementing Forth and then moving on back to Rust.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_46.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The way Forth works is really simple, you put stuff on a stack, it hits a token, pulls the item from the stack, etc. It doesn't have precedence rules.</p> 

<p>It seemed like a really good bedrock for the things I wanted to do.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_47.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Machine Forth was something that was going to be something close to the metal, Forth at its core is something pretty close to Assembly, but I wanted something that mapped exactly to Assembly, something that would be like, 'one token would be one byte, or one short'. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_48.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So after a while I picked a bunch of opcodes, and I'd shown them to my friends, and they were like, "these are bad." They were people I trust. If I'd been on my own, I would have likely given up and not done it, or would be writing JavaScript still. They were extremely patient with me, they understood what I was trying to do. People like Sigrid, Alderwick, and Andrew had infinite patience for my stupid questions, they would tell me, "I wouldn't do it this way, but here's something that you could use to improve your system."</p>

<p>In the end, I ended up with this napkin definition of a system that I kind of liked. My goal throughout this whole process was to make a system that could fit on a t-shirt. I might lose my computer, especially on a sailboat, but I don't want to keep preserving all the documentation.</p>

<p>When I started sailing I was doing a bit of Ruby, when came time to gather all the Ruby documentation that I would need to be self-sufficient, the amount was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Being at sea for 50 days straight (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html">busy doing nothing</a>) we don't have access to StackOverflow, our questions remain unanswered, now imagine if the site was gone forever tomorrow. At sea, without internet, if I wanted to look up how to fill a polygon, I couldn't do it, but if I had printed it? There are languages that make this more accessible, and others that make it really hard. Not having a background in C, I found it really difficult to go off sailing without my C documentation, but it is very extensive, and very clunky.</p>

<p>My thinking is that I'm probably going to lose the book at some point in the future, but if my future self had that t-shirt they'd probably be okay. I tried to reduce everything that I could do to fit onto a t-shirt, that's as much as I afforded in bandwidth.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_49.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>If you're familiar with 6502 on the left (above image), it just looks like this vertical series of instructions. The little language I made is quite similar. You can map it one to one, and the resulting size of byte code is pretty much the same.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_50.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>You might be familiar with this sort of Assembly language, reading as a big vertical column of characters, but I wanted to use the beauty of Forth and make a language that would be verbose in ways that it resembled writing a little bit.</p>

<p>Every morning when I wake up, and I open my programs, I don't hate myself for not leaving comments because the code itself is a bit more readable and self-documenting.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_51.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The first thing I tried to do was to make an assembler in that language. It was easy. The language is so simple that the assembler itself is also going to be simple. I generated a X86 application of the <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> that could run its own assembler in that language.</p>

<p>The assembler is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/drifblim/" target="_blank">3000 bytes</a>.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_52.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It's nothing like a computer, but it will run bytecode. I felt like I had reduced the problems that I was solving with computers down to 32 things, and these 32 things I could probably implement in Fractran and Subleq, other more minimal computing systems.</p>

<p>It taught me about how the little functions you would use in JavaScript to convert a string into an end, you write it in Assembly, and it dispels the magic. Sometimes people say they love magic, but in truth they don't. I don't like magic at all, especially not when things start to break.</p>
 
<p>Douglas Adams said that, "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair." This is the situation I was in with programming. I wanted to understand the whole thing, and to have it be inspectable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_53.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>From there I started to build dawing routines, etc. I started to make implementations of Basic, of games, or of other emulators.</p>

<p>I have been writing in this little language for two years.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_54.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>In a <a href="https://guide.handmade-seattle.com/c/2022/behind-crafting-interpreters/" target="_blank">sit-down talk</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/" target="_blank">Robert Nystrom</a> was encouraging everyone to make their own programming language and their own system. Many of the conference attendees share this view, but in other circles it is generally frowned upon. The first time I mentioned it to anyone I was laughed out the room. I liked to draw, and people were thinking, "what do you even know about computers?"</p> 

<p>I would love to see everyone's programming language, to meet someone new and to ask them: "show me how many opcodes you have."</p>

<p>It is telling about a person's mind.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_55.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We built this little system that is tailored to host the games we make. It'll be alien to anyone else, and that's okay, we are not trying to sell you on this idea, what we want is for everyone to try and make their own personal computer instead of piggybacking on someone else's idea that's cluttered with artifacts. I don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of what can be done with this.</p>

<p>A lot of people will try to tell you that we've tried everything with 8-bit, but by the time the <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> was out, most of the game genres that we have today didn't exist. There are immense amounts of space left to explore, but now everyone has moved on, to <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>, <abbr title="Augmented Reality">AR</abbr> or other.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_56.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I made this entire talk in black and white, and I could have done a system in black and white too, but I made it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank">four colors</a>. Imagine how much power you have with four colors.</p>

<p>One-bit can be a totally evocative, things don't have to be visually busy all the time. I think this maximalism of 'I need all these features' and 'I need to be doing this and that,' is exhausting. Learning to live without float points is actually kind of nice. There is beauty in really simple systems, trying to always scale things to fit everyone's usage is foolish.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_57.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>As a closing remark, I want to say that I don't think that my attempt is the best solution to data preservation, I'm not even sure if I'm gonna be able to use that system in five years, but at least it's one attempt at trying to preserve things.</p>

<p><a href="https://permacomputing.net/" target="_blank">Permacomputing</a> is inspired from permaculture, its goal is to build resilience. The resilience of permaculture comes from trying different ideas, and seeing what sticks. If we all jump on the same language, and the same ecosystem, it makes it really fragile when one individual can just buy the whole thing, then you're left with a system that was never truly yours.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/japans-largest-newspaper-yomiuri-shimbun-sues-perplexity-for-copyright-violations/">https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/japans-largest-newspaper-yomiuri-shimbun-sues-perplexity-for-copyright-violations/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44870895">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s largest newspaper by circulation, has <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/society/crime-courts/20250810-274484/">sued the generative AI startup Perplexity</a> for copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed in Tokyo District Court on August 7, marks the first copyright challenge by a major Japanese news publisher against an AI company.</p>
<p>The filing claims that Perplexity accessed 119,467 articles on Yomiuri’s site between February and June of this year, based on an analysis of its company server logs. Yomiuri alleges the scraping has been used by Perplexity to reproduce the newspaper’s copyrighted articles in responses to user queries without authorization.</p>
<p>In particular, the suit claims Perplexity has violated its “right of reproduction” and its “right to transmit to the public,” two tenets of Japanese law that give copyright holders control over the copying and distribution of their work. The suit seeks nearly $15 million in damages and demands that Perplexity stop reproducing its articles.</p>
<p>The three plaintiffs in the suit are the newspaper’s headquarters in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, all of which operate separately under Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings.</p>
<p>Japan’s copyright law allows AI developers to train models on copyrighted material without permission. This leeway is a direct result of a <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/ai-backlash-anime-artists/">2018 amendment to Japan’s Copyright Act</a>, meant to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/japans-new-ai-rules-favor-copycats-over-artists/">encourage AI development</a> in the country’s tech sector. The law does not, however, allow for wholesale reproduction of those works, or for AI developers to distribute copies in a way that will “unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner.”</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/society/crime-courts/20250810-274484/">sent to Yomiuri</a>, a Perplexity spokesperson said, “We are deeply sorry for the misunderstanding this has caused in Japan. We are currently working hard to understand the nature of the claims. We take this very seriously, because Perplexity is committed to ensuring that publishers and journalists benefit from the new business models that will arise in the AI age.”</p>
<p>Last fall, two News Corp–owned publishers, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, took similar <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/wall-street-journal-new-york-post-sue-perplexity-ai-c5d9554d">legal action</a> against Perplexity. Outside of the U.S., though, Perplexity has so far avoided much legal scrutiny. Competing generative AI companies, including OpenAI and Meta, have faced copyright infringement suits from major international publishers.</p>
<p>In India, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ze00ly1zo">joint copyright infringement suit</a> against OpenAI includes some of the country’s most established news publications, including The Indian Express, The Hindu, and The India Today group. In France, the country’s leading authors and publishers associations have filed suits against Meta, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-meta-artificial-intelligence-lawsuit-copyright-168b32059e70d0509b0a6ac407f37e8a">alleging economic “parasitism.”</a></p>
<p>In May, the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association <a href="https://www.pressnet.or.jp/statement/20230517_en.pdf">published an open letter</a> calling out AI companies for free riding off their copyrighted material and warning them to stop their scraping practices. The status quo “could cause huge damage to the business of news organizations,” the association wrote at the time. “If quality news content, which underpins democracy, decreases, the public’s right to know may be hampered.”</p>

            The effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, but it’s the brain that manifests our experience of thirst.        </p>
        
    </div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Water is the most fundamental need for all life on Earth. Not every organism needs oxygen, and many make their own food. But for all creatures, from deep-sea microbes and slime molds to trees and humans, water is nonnegotiable. “The first act of life was the capture of water within a cell membrane,” a pair of neurobiologists wrote in a recent review. Ever since, cells have had to stay wet enough to stay alive.</p>
<p>Water is the medium in which all chemical reactions in an organism take place, and those reactions are finely tuned to a narrow range of ratios between water and salt, another essential ingredient in life’s chemistry. The cells in your body are permeable to water, so if the water-salt balance of the surrounding fluid — blood, lymph or cerebrospinal fluid, for example — is outside its healthy range, cells can swell or shrink, shrivel or potentially burst. An imbalance can cause brain cells to malfunction, losing their ability to manage ion concentrations across their membranes and propagate action potentials.</p>
<p>Although these effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, cells themselves do not cry out in thirst. Instead, it’s the brain that monitors the body’s water levels and manifests the experience of thirst — a dry tongue, hot throat and rapid onset of malaise — which compels a behavior: acquire water.</p>
<p>“These neural circuits that control hunger and thirst are located deep in primitive brain structures like the hypothalamus and brainstem,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/zachary.knight">Zachary Knight</a>, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently co-authored <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.10.028">a review paper in <em>Neuron</em></a> on the neurobiology of thirst.</p>

    <p>Because these brain areas are difficult to study — due not only to their location, but also to their composition, with many different cell types and crisscrossed circuitry — it’s only in the last decade or so that neuroscientists have begun to understand how thirst fundamentally works. The body, researchers have found, is filled with sensors that feed clues to the brain about how much water or salt an organism needs to consume. How those sensors work, or what they even are, continues to elude scientists. Their existence offers a tantalizing insight: Water may be fundamental to life, but thirst is an educated guess.</p>
<h2><strong>Environmental Sensing</strong></h2>
<p>To understand thirst in mammals, think of it less as the body stating a fact to the brain — “I need water” — and more as the brain monitoring its environment, the body. Like an ecologist sampling a river, the brain examines blood’s chemical composition to learn what the body needs.</p>
<p>In nearly all cases, the so-called <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">blood-brain barrier</a> protects the brain from bacteria, viruses or other dangers circulating in the blood. But there are a few exceptions where the brain directly interfaces with blood, including in the circumventricular organs, deep in the brain near the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>Two of these organs — the vascular organ of lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical organ (SFO) — are sensory organs not unlike a nose or an ear. They act like scientists dipping a bucket into the body’s river of blood to test its health. The brain infers the body’s salt and water needs from that data and funnels the information to neural circuits in even deeper regions, which then can trigger what we experience as thirst — the scratchy throat, dry mouth and foggy brain that accompany desire for water.</p>
<p>The blood-testing organs don’t measure water levels but rather the concentration of salt, whose healthy range lies at almost <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2007.00311.x">exactly the same concentration</a> as that of the brackish intertidal water in which vertebrates first evolved (which is about one-third as salty as seawater). When the water-salt ratio is too low, we get thirsty. The human body is about 60% water, although that number varies from tissue to tissue (bone is 31%, the brain 73%, the lungs 83%). A change of between 1% and 3% in the blood’s water content, which is normally around 60%, is sufficient for the OVLT and SFO to initiate familiar, unpleasant feelings that motivate a behavior. If salt levels are high, the animal drinks.</p>
<p>But there is a disconnect between drinking water and correcting the water-salt balance. It takes 30 to 60 minutes for water to enter the bloodstream once it’s consumed, and the brain cannot wait that long to figure out if the body has the water it needs. It must make a decision more or less immediately; an animal can’t sit around and do nothing but drink water for half an hour.</p>
<p>So, the brain guesses. More of those mysterious sensors kick in. One roughly estimates the volume of water passing through the mouth and throat and sends an initial signal to the brain. A second signal comes from the gut — from specific cell types that respond to water, and even to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2167-2">mechanical stretching</a> of the stomach as it takes water in. Within a minute, these signals reach the brain and block the neurons in the OVLT and SFO that were activated to trigger thirst. The thirst response shuts off; the throat cools, and the mouth becomes moist again.</p>

    <p>Thirst, though, represents only one side of maintaining homeostasis. Salt — more specifically, sodium — is one of the most important things an animal consumes. Animals need sodium for neurons to fire action potentials, for proteins to keep their shape and function, and for chemical reactions to occur inside cells — the everyday business of life. We need to maintain a concentration of sodium ions in the fluids of our bodies to enable all those functions. It’s the other side of thirst.</p>
<p>“There are only a couple of things that are so important for your body that there’s a completely innate drive to get it if you fall into deficiency,” Knight said. “Oxygen, food, water and sodium.”</p>
<p>However, animals like us do not experience salt desire as a powerful, controlling drive as we do with oxygen, food and water. Sensors signal salt levels to the brain; in addition to the OVLT and SFO, sensors in the heart detect the stretching of atria and ventricles. But there is no analogous salt pang when we need it, the way a stomach churns for food or a scratchy throat cries out for water. Instead, the need to consume salt is mediated by taste and the brain’s reward pathways. “The taste of salt is bimodal,” Knight said. “It tastes good at low doses; at high doses it tastes disgusting, like drinking seawater.”</p>
<p>Imagine the urge to eat a big bag of potato chips. If the body needs salt, those chips will cause a surge of pleasurable dopamine to flood the brain. If the body doesn’t need salt, that dopamine drip disappears. “It’s pretty much reinforcement learning,” said <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/yuki-oka">Yuki Oka</a>, a neurobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who studies how the body maintains homeostasis. “More dopamine means a repeated behavior.”</p>
<h2><strong>Everyone Thirsts Differently</strong></h2>
<p>Scientists monitoring a river collect data and then have a choice about whether to act on their findings. Similarly, just because the brain measures the blood’s sodium levels doesn’t mean it has to act on that information.</p>
<p>Take Elena Gracheva’s 13-lined ground squirrels. <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/elena-gracheva/">Gracheva</a>, a neurophysiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, studies these rodents, native to North American grasslands, to understand how specific brain regions control thirst. The 13-lined ground squirrel is an ideal model for this, she said, because it hibernates for more than half the year, without eating or drinking. “They’re like monks,” Gracheva said. “They don’t go outside for eight months. They don’t have water in their underground burrow.” How do they not get thirsty?</p>

    <p>It isn’t that the squirrels don’t need water. They do. Their bodies cry out for it. But according to Gracheva’s research, during hibernation their brain ignores the body’s signals.</p>
<p>In mammals, a drop in blood water levels (which means a simultaneous rise in salt concentration, all things being equal) triggers two coupled processes. The hypothalamus pumps out the hormone vasopressin, which tells the kidneys to retain water rather than let it out as urine, and the SFO kicks off the thirst drive to direct the animal to drink. However, while ground squirrels are hibernating, their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp8358">vasopressin levels jump</a>, but the animal still doesn’t drink. “The circuit for vasopressin was normal, but thirst neurons were downregulated,” Gracheva said. “These two pathways are uncoupled.” The body is trying to retain the water it has but does not act to consume more.</p>
<p>The logic of the disrupted circuitry is extremely powerful. “Even if you wake them up in the middle of hibernation, they’re not going to drink,” Gracheva said.</p>
        
        
<p>The underlying network that Gracheva studies in squirrels is universal in mammals, up to and including humans. But that same neurological logic doesn’t lead to the same behaviors. Humans drink a glass of water when they’re thirsty. Cats and rabbits mostly get water from the food they eat. Camels can burn their fat stores for water (which produces carbon dioxide and water), but they also consume gallons of it and store it in their stomachs for when they need it later. Sea otters can drink ocean water and excrete urine that is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.204.11.1831">saltier than the water they swim in</a>; they are the only marine mammals to actively do this.</p>
<p>How each animal manages water and salt is specialized to its ecosystem, lifestyle and selective pressures. The question “What does it mean to be thirsty?” has no one answer. We each thirst in our own way.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There’s getting cozy at a Starbucks to sip a latte and catch up on emails, and then there’s lugging your printer and desktop to the coffee chain to clock into work.</p><div>



<p>Starbucks South Korea is experiencing this exact phenomenon and is now barring patrons from bringing in large pieces of work equipment, treating the cafés like their own amenity-stuffed office space.



</p><p>“Starbucks Korea has updated its policy so all customers can have a pleasant and accessible store experience. While laptops and smaller personal devices are welcome, customers are asked to refrain from bringing desktop computers, printers, or other bulky items that may limit seating and impact the shared space,” a Starbucks spokesperson told <em>Fortune</em> in a statement.



</p><p>The company said it will continue to be a “welcoming third space.” The store policy change was first <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10550038" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10550038">reported by the<em> Korea Herald</em></a>.



</p><p>Starbucks has been a fixture in Korea since <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/asia/stories/2024/starbucks-korea-reopens-first-store-location-highlighting-its-historical-significance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://stories.starbucks.com/asia/stories/2024/starbucks-korea-reopens-first-store-location-highlighting-its-historical-significance/">opening its first store</a> there, in the Edae neighborhood of Seoul, in 1999. South Korea has surpassed Japan in the number of Starbucks stores, boasting 2,050 to Japan’s 2,040 locations, despite having less than half its population.</p><p>But the coffee chain’s crackdown on <a href="https://m.koreaherald.com/article/3162147" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://m.koreaherald.com/article/3162147"><em>cagongjok</em></a>, a term referring to individuals spending prolonged periods of time working at cafés, may indicate a changing attitude toward customers who may be loyal but taking Starbucks’ burgeoning <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/01/29/starbucks-new-ceo-reveals-plans-to-overhaul-strategy-slash-menu-items-and-double-stores-in-the-u-s/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/01/29/starbucks-new-ceo-reveals-plans-to-overhaul-strategy-slash-menu-items-and-double-stores-in-the-u-s/">efforts to become a cozy third space</a> for granted. Starbucks South Korea is majority owned by retail giant E-Mart Inc. <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/asia/stories/2021/starbucks-transitions-retail-business-in-south-korea-to-e-mart-and-gic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://stories.starbucks.com/asia/stories/2021/starbucks-transitions-retail-business-in-south-korea-to-e-mart-and-gic/">as of 2021</a>. Starbucks continues to oversee its licensed business.



</p><p>For years, there have been pockets of <em>cagongjok</em> as a result of the COVID-induced remote-work boom, as well as the rise of temporary-contract jobs following the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-labor-market-policy-and-social-safety-net-in-korea-after-the-1997-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-labor-market-policy-and-social-safety-net-in-korea-after-the-1997-crisis/">1997 Asian financial crisis</a>, according to Jo Elfving-Hwang, an associate professor of Korean society and culture at Curtin University in Australia.



</p><p>“It’s quite a cheap way to work really,” Elfving-Hwang told <em>Fortune</em>. “You can just go and have a cup of coffee, work there—but people are taking it a little bit to the extreme nowadays.”



</p><h2><strong>Rising visibility of </strong><strong>cagongjok</strong></h2>



<p>Korea has a strong tearoom culture, Young-Key Kim-Renaud, professor emeritus of Korean language and culture and international affairs at George Washington University, told <em>Fortune</em>.



</p><p>“Even when they were dirt-poor, people gathered in the tearooms to discuss things [like] literature, art, politics, or whatever, and felt that they were civilized,” she said.</p><p>But <em>cagongjok</em>—a portmanteau of the Korean words for café, study, and a word for a tribe that has taken on a pejorative meaning—has gained public awareness as a result of South Korea’s labor market and remote-work shift. The pandemic caused an influx of employees needing to work remotely, but as many Koreans returned to the office, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/world-s-best-office-property-market-is-seoul-korea-with-98-occupancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/world-s-best-office-property-market-is-seoul-korea-with-98-occupancy">government redevelopment restrictions</a> limited how much space was available for businesses to set up their employees in office spaces—especially in South Korea’s capital of Seoul, where rent prices are skyrocketing as businesses fight over office spaces. Office vacancies in Seoul remained low last quarter at around 2.6%, according to April <a href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/figures/seoul-figures-q1-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.cbre.com/insights/figures/seoul-figures-q1-2025">data</a> from commercial real estate service CBRE, while rent for the offices increased on average 1.5% from the quarter before.&nbsp;



</p><p>Korean companies failing to find or afford office spaces has led some to let employees work in third-party co-working spaces or remotely, Elfving-Hwang said, leaving many to flock to cafés.



</p><p>“People just started working from home more, and [businesses] discovered that they didn’t necessarily need a space in the same way,” she said. “Part of the reason is that it’s become more of a practice that just a lot of companies discovered that they didn’t necessarily need an office of their own.”



</p><p>However, not all café owners are so sympathetic to changing labor culture, <a href="https://koreapro.org/2023/05/why-ill-will-is-brewing-between-south-korean-students-and-cafes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://koreapro.org/2023/05/why-ill-will-is-brewing-between-south-korean-students-and-cafes/">calling cagongjok </a>“<a href="https://koreapro.org/2023/05/why-ill-will-is-brewing-between-south-korean-students-and-cafes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://koreapro.org/2023/05/why-ill-will-is-brewing-between-south-korean-students-and-cafes/">electricity thieves”</a> and claiming patrons stay working at their businesses for hours while nursing just a single cup of coffee in that time.



</p><p>While the rise of remote workers in cafés marks the shift of coffee shops from a place of leisure to a place of work, Elfving-Hwang said, she said she believed it was only a matter of time before coffee shops itched to shift the balance back toward reputations of relaxation.</p><p>“I was surprised it took so long,” she said.

<p dir="auto">Tilf (Tiny Elf) is a simple yet powerful pixel art editor built with PySide6.
It’s designed for creating sprites, icons, and small 2D assets with essential tools, live preview, undo/redo, and export options.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/blob/main/assets/icon.ico"><img src="https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/raw/main/assets/icon.ico" alt="Tilf" title="Tilf"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several Pixel Art Editors that do the same things and even much more,
but many require an account registration or the insertion of an e-mail or have a certain business model.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm <em>not</em> interested in all that, my goal is to be able to create sprites freely, with (almost) zero dependencies,
zero setup time, zero installations:</p>
<p dir="auto">Tilf starts and I begin to draw what I want.</p>
<p dir="auto">It runs on Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux.</p>

<p dir="auto">I’m aware that the code quality isn’t great.
I didn’t prioritize it when writing this.
This project was something I put together during my spare time, and a lot of it could be written much better.
There's definitely room for improvement, so I'm more than happy to accept PRs from anyone willing to contribute.</p>

Publish it as an Open Source project might be interesting for others as well.</p>

That can be extended, but only if Congress passes a law authorizing it.</p><p>Although Trump has frequently complained about crime in the district, violent crime there has fallen to a 30-year low as of January, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Justice</a>.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108184187" data-test="InlineImage"><p>U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press about deploying federal law enforcement agents in Washington to bolster the local police presence, in the Press Briefing Room at the White House, in Washington D.C., U.S., August 11, 2025. </p><p>Jonathan Ernst | Reuters</p></div><div><p><a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/dailycrime" target="_blank">Statistics</a> from the Metropolitan Police Department also show that incidences of homicide, sexual abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon, robbery, and overall violent crime have dropped by double-digit percentages so far this year.</p><p>Federal <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-orders-increased-federal-law-enforcement-presence-to-make-dc-safe-again/3972307/" target="_blank">law enforcement presence in D.C. </a>has nevertheless increased in recent days.</p><p>Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who is the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives, called Trump's actions "an historic assault on D.C. home rule," and a "counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents."</p><p>"The administration is justifying the decision by misleadingly citing years-old statistics," Norton said.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108184113" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Soldiers from the U.S. Army National Guard 42nd Infantry Division walk through streets in Washington, D.C. on June 13, 2025 ahead of a parade and festival the following day celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. </p><p>Bryan Dozier | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Trump, who had recently threatened to place Washington under <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/trump-crime-washington-dc-border-.html">federal control</a>, said Monday morning that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is "taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment."</p><p>He also said that he will deploy the National Guard to "help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly."</p><p>Trump added, "You're going to have a lot of essentially military, and we will bring in the military if it's needed."</p><p>D.C.

Vitess is one of PlanetScale’s greatest strengths and contemporary Vitess is the product of our experience running at extreme scale. We have made explicit sharding accessible to hundreds of thousands of people and it is time to bring this power to Postgres.</p><p>Neki is not a fork of Vitess. Vitess’ achievements are enabled by leveraging MySQL’s strengths and engineering around its weaknesses. To achieve Vitess’ power for Postgres we are architecting from first principles and building alongside design partners at scale. When we are ready we will release Neki as an open source project suitable for running the most demanding Postgres workloads.</p><p>To stay up to date with the latest developments on Neki you can signup at <a href="https://neki.dev/">neki.dev</a>.</p></article></div>]]></description>

But this test-time scaling increases the cost of inference. Thinking models like OpenAI's o1 series allocate massive computational effort during inference itself. These models can require </span><strong>over 100x compute for challenging queries</strong><span> compared to traditional single-pass inference.</span></p><p><span>Token consumption per application grew a lot because models allowed for </span><a href="https://www.meibel.ai/post/understanding-the-impact-of-increasing-llm-context-windows" rel="">longer context windows</a><span> and bigger suggestions from the models. The combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years. Market leader Cursor introduced a $200 plan where before $20 was the default. The $200 plan has also been followed by Claude Code and others.</span></p><p>The top end of subscriptions is $200 today but power users find that they are extensively throttled if they use a lot of inference. That throttling comes in the form of rate limiting, using lower quality models, context window compression, and other techniques.</p><p>If you don't want to be throttled you need to pay for inference yourself. The open source family of coding tools (Cline, Roo, Kilo) is based on that principle: “never throttle the user”. Because the users directly see the costs these tools have also led the way in reducing costs by allowing the users to:</p><ol><li><p>Splitting work up in many smaller tasks that can each be run efficiently.</p></li><li><p>Using different modes, in Kilo we have an Orchestrator, Architect, Code, and Debug mode.</p></li><li><p>Combine closed-source models for architecting tasks (e.g. Sonnet 4) and open-source for coding (Qwen3)</p></li><li><p>Enhance the prompt with AI before submitting it</p></li><li><p>Optimize context efficiency with memory banks</p></li><li><p>Enable prompt caching</p></li><li><p>Allow termination of a running task when the model hallucinates</p></li></ol><p>Despite the efforts to reduce costs we do expect them to continue to grow for the power users.</p><p>We expect app inference costs to grow quickly. This is driven by two developments: more parallel agents and more work done before human feedback is needed.</p><p><span>People are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1kwm4gm/has_anyone_tried_parallelizing_ai_coding_agents/" rel="">experimenting</a><span> </span><a href="https://ainativedev.io/news/how-to-parallelize-ai-coding-agents" rel="">with</a><span> </span><a href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/" rel="">parallel</a><span> AI coding agents today with </span><a href="https://www.warp.dev/" rel="">Warp already having it available to people</a><span>. We expect parallel agents to become the default in the industry and look forward to introduce them in Kilo code sooner rather than later. This will greatly increase token consumption per human hour.</span></p><p>Agents are also able to work longer before needing human feedback. Because they are working more and pausing less this also increases token consumption per human hour.</p><p><span>Both effects together will push costs at the top level to $100k a year. Spending that magnitude of money on software is not without precedent, </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26658405" rel="">chip design licenses from Cadence or Synopsys are already $250k a year</a><span>.</span></p><p>While the prospect of $100k+ per year in costs is a lot it can always be worse.</p><p><span>AI costs for most engineers are approximately 1000x smaller than what is happening at the AI training stage. Here the costs for the normal 'inference engineer' is dwarfed by the thousand times bigger impact of the AI ‘training engineer’. The ‘inference engineer’ we talked about above might make $100k and use $100k to be many times more productive than an engineer before AI. A top ‘training engineer’ directs $100m in spend and is paid $100m a year. Top frontier labs spend </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/" rel="">billions on AI training</a><span> and this compute work is directed by a handful of people. Mark Zuckerberg is rumored to have offered these people ‘signing bonuses’ of </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-5c231f75" rel="">$100m</a><span> to </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-zuckerberg-ai-recruiting-fail-e6107555" rel="">$1b</a><span> with unknown contract lengths. The difference in pay between inference and training engineers is because of their relative impact. You train a model with a handful of people while it is used by millions of people.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
