<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once joined a company as a consultant - in the previous 12 months, they'd spent their entire $1,500,000 marketing budget on Google/Facebook  ads. Using Hubspot we could track leads through the funnel and look at exactly how many customers this money had generated. The answer was 0. In total, the ads brought in two leads to the website who never even booked a demo for the product. For <strong><em>$1,500,000.</em></strong></p><p>We ultimately managed to turn the ship around (more on that later in the series) but the lesson stands: marketing can be expensive and drain your runway. This is why accelerators like YC prefer cold outreach / emailing prospects during the early days of your company - it's free.</p><p>But how do you know if your business is ready to invest in marketing? To answer this question, you'll need to understand if your company have some form of product market fit - PMF. There are many ways you can define PMF:</p><pre>In 2009, Sean Ellis, also known as the founder of Growth Hacking, wrote that he identify Product-Market fit with the help of a survey. He asks the users of a product however they would be disappointed if the product would no longer be available. If at least 40% of users say they would be very disappointed, it probably means that you have Product-Market Fit.<p>Further, he adds that “Admittedly this threshold is a bit arbitrary, but I defined it after comparing results across nearly 100 startups. Those that struggle for traction are always under 40%, while most that gain strong traction exceed 40%.”</p></pre><p>There are more abstract definitions which say that PMF has been achieved when your company is drowning in demand - without time or resources to scale. I don't like this definition as much because it's only the ultimate form of PMF from a VC perspective - I've seen plenty of companies with PMF who are not in the aforementioned situation. If a kid sells lemonade on a sunny day, they can still make bank even if the line to the stand isn't running around the block.</p><p>If you don't have any PMF, don't invest money in marketing - you might end up like the examples mentioned in the introduction. The goal of marketing is to find a predictable method where if you spend e.g. $1,000 marketing dollars and expect a statistical 3x return of $3,000 in profit which should scale with your marketing budget. Marketing research can help you find customers who would be a good fit for your product, but if so it needs to be conducted in a cheap fashion (more on this later). Instead, invest your budget in product development to reach PMF.<br></p><h3>If you have product market fit</h3><p>Congratulations! You've got over the hardest part of starting a startup and can start investing in marketing.</p><p>The basis of a good marketing strategy is aligning it with your business objective(s) - no more lofty "number of likes" metrics. Start at the top - here are some examples of marketing objectives to choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Boost Customer Acquisition:</strong> Attract new customers to expand your customer base and drive revenue growth.</li><li><strong>Increase Market Share:</strong> Expand the percentage of the market your business serves, often achieved by outperforming competitors or acquiring new customers.</li><li><strong>Market penetration:</strong> If your startup is expanding to new markets, the marketing objective could be to increase market penetration in those regions.</li><li><strong>Improve Brand Awareness:</strong> Enhance the recognition and visibility of your brand among the target audience, leading to increased trust and customer loyalty.</li><li><strong>Enhance Customer Retention:</strong> Focus on strategies to retain existing customers, thereby reducing churn and fostering long-term relationships (marketing team can help with this too).</li><li><strong>Improve Employee Engagement (internal communication):</strong> Foster a positive work culture and invest in employee development to increase productivity and reduce turnover.<br></li></ul><p>This is usually agreed on a leadership level based on what can be accomplished with the soon to be approved marketing budget. For this exercise, let's imagine a SaaS business named ApiHub, targeting B2B customers looking for an API to power their e-commerce business:</p><p><strong>Company wide business objective for end of year (EOY):</strong></p><ul><li>Increase revenue by $8,000,000</li></ul><p><strong>Selected marketing objective:</strong></p><ul><li>Boost Customer Acquisition: Get 666,250 additional visitors to our website before EOY.</li></ul><p>How did we arrive at this number? As a rule of thumb, the pipeline in startup SaaS businesses usually comes from:</p><ul><li>Marketing: 40%</li><li>Cold-outreach/sales: 40%</li><li>Partnerships: 20%</li></ul><p>Hence,  $8,000,000 x 0.4 / $3,000 Annual Contract Value (ACV) = 1,066 customers before EOY.</p><p>This is where your website analytics comes in handy - e.g. last year, we know that we had 1,200,000 visitors on our SaaS website. Of them, 2,000 became paying customers - hence the conversion rate from visitor to customer is 2,000 / 1,200,000 =  0.16%. If we want to understand how many additional website visitors we need to generate 1,066 more customers, we calculate (1,066 / 16) x  10,000 = 666,250 additional visitors.</p><h3>How the heck do we get 666,250 new visitors?</h3><p>Now what? We need to dig deeper to get to specific marketing strategies and tasks to be able to execute on. Many companies use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKRs</a> to drill down sequential marketing objectives and specify key results that ladder back up to our overarching target. But I prefer a "effectiveness framework" used in many agencies instead.</p><pre>In 2005, the UK grocery chain Sainsbury's set up a big sales goal to recover profit over a period of declining sales. With a simple equation, agency BBDO calculated that the marketing portion of this sales goal would be achieved if they got each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped.<p>This led to the campaign 'Try Something New Today', encouraging each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped. Analysis had shown that customers were 'sleep-shopping' and in a rut with the things they buy and cook. By using TV, press, radio and in-store advertising, Sainsbury's gave its customers simple meal ideas, which encouraged them to try new things and spend more on their shopping. The success of this campaign has generated £550 million in sales over two years.</p></pre><p>This is a really great effectiveness case study where Sainsbury's managed to impact the bottom line using a clear marketing objective derived from their business objective. I recommend watching their short case study <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXVY7KswA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The idea of an effectiveness framework is to clearly map out what objectives you need to hit, what consumer behaviour change needs to happen and the role and tasks of comms you need to achieve.</p><p>For our API business, the beginning of an effectiveness map might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/briefmix/1df3946c-4153-4c97-b2c4-71263cde026e_Screen+Shot+2023-08-18+at+10.23.35.png?auto=compress,format" alt="Briefmix Effectiveness Map"></p><p>You can view and download this template <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uFPNbZF8--Z4wH7Y3tyWaiir66umCMPaRvgv3uVJgwk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We have also started to add KPIs next to the map which will be important to measure during the year to make sure our efforts are on track.</p><p>This is only the beginning to the map as we have yet to decide about the brand, marketing mix, tactics and channels. As we progress through the course, we will loop back to this map and fill it out further.</p><p>And there we have it! Before we can start filling out the rest of the framework with tactics, we need to have a good understanding of our brand and what we stand for. Let’s start by understanding why a third of Coca Cola's market value comes from its brand:</p><p><a href="https://briefmix.com/startup/create-new-brand">How do you define a brand? -&gt;</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have posted this to four other Tesla related subreddits only to have them removed so hopefully this one sticks..</p>

<p>I have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. </p>

<p>While I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.</p>

<p>“Not a problem.” I thought. I’d call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I’m working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. </p>

<p>This is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. </p>

<p>My father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.</p>

<p>My father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call—going so far as to yell at my father over the phone.</p>

<p>A different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.</p>

<p>Up until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. </p>

<p>The Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:</p>

<p>“I am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.”</p>

<p>Basically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank’s name rather than our own.</p>

<p>The next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. </p>

<p>No apology. No restitution. </p>

<p>My father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. </p>

<p>They then emailed back the equivalent of saying “well we did try to contact you about this.” </p>

<p>I shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. </p>

<p>Now we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. </p>

<p>And still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.</p>

<p>EDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER’S check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it’s ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.</p>

<p>UPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. </p>

<p>will probably not be updating again because i’m tired of thinking about this but we’ll see. i’m really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleven days ago, we sent these questions to Western Digital’s head of PR and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">published them publicly</a> on <em>The Verge</em>: </p><div><ul><li>Why are these drives still on sale?</li><li>Will you offer free data recovery services to affected customers? When?</li><li>Are you proactively warning customers and retailers who have already purchased these drives that significant data loss is possible?</li><li>If not, why not?</li><li>What, exactly, is going wrong with these drives?&nbsp;</li><li>How did this happen?&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><p>What’s the fuss? For months, the company has been laughably silent about how its pricey portable SanDisk Extreme SSDs <em>might lose all your data</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">It happened to my colleague Vjeran Pavic <em>twice</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-still-wiping-data-after-firmware-fix-users-say/">to <em>Ars Technica</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/08/08/sandisk-portable-ssds-are-failing-so-frequently-we-can-no-longer-recommend-them/">to <em>PetaPixel</em></a>. </p></div><div><p>Months after our inquiries, Western Digital continues to sell these drives <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued#:~:text=broken%20state%20of%20the%20internet%20means%20Western%20Digital%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20work%20very%20hard%20to%20keep%20selling%20these%20drives">due to deep discounts, fake Amazon reviews, and issues with Google Search</a> that rank favorable results far higher than warnings about potential failures.  </p></div><p>We have now received a response from Western Digital head of PR Robin Schultz, but nothing about the company’s stance has changed. Schultz repeatedly refused to answer any of our questions. Her statement doesn’t even contain an acknowledgment of the issue and has no specific timeline for any real answers. </p><p>The only reason we’re printing Western Digital’s statement is so you can see it for yourself:</p><div><blockquote><p>In response to recent reports of concerns about specific Western Digital portable SSD products, we want to assure our valued customers that we are taking all measures necessary to address any product-related issues. We understand the significance of our products to our customers and we take these matters very seriously. We are conducting a comprehensive review to gain a thorough understanding of the issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>After getting the statement, we asked Schultz three times whether Western Digital would answer our questions. Each time, she deflected. She also wouldn’t provide any idea of when the company might share its conclusions — if ever.</p><p>There <em>is</em> one possible reason Western Digital is finally speaking up and yet saying nothing: the company just got sued. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/western_digital_sandisk_ssd_lawsuit/">As <em>The Register</em> reports</a>, California resident Nathan Krum has filed a prospective class action lawsuit, citing breach of contract, fraudulent and unfair business practices, and many other claims. Krum is suing over both the SanDisk Extreme drive itself and damages for any data lost. You can read the full complaint at the bottom of this story.</p><p>And that’s just lawsuit number one: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-worthless-multiple-lawsuits-against-wd-say/">Ars Technica reports</a> there are two more. Three SanDisk SSD lawsuits in total, each seeking class-action status for the same failures. </p><div><p>Western Digital was already forced into <a href="https://www.wdrednasharddrivesettlement.com/">a class action settlement</a> over a previous questionable practice: in 2020, the company brazenly tried to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/western-digital-gets-sued-for-sneaking-smr-disks-into-its-nas-channel/">sneak SMR drives into its “WD Red” lineup</a> marketed for network-attached storage devices. The company <a href="https://www.bursor.com/result/western-digital-class-action-settlement/">paid $5.7 million</a> to settle those claims.</p></div><div><p>The company’s tricks didn’t end there: Western Digital’s NAS disks have started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759368/western-digital-three-years-warning-synology-nas">triggering warnings even if there’s nothing wrong with a drive</a>, seemingly to scare people into buying new ones simply after three years have gone by.</p></div><p>I won’t be buying a Western Digital or SanDisk product anytime soon.</p><p><em><strong>Update, 12:25AM ET: Added that there are actually three lawsuits, not just one, against WD.</strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

							<p>Have you ever wandered into an old library or dusty bookshop and paused to breathe in that familiar vanilla-coffee-grassy scent wafting off the aged tomes? That nostalgic olfactory experience is thanks to a bouquet of chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Modern books smell different because of changes in manufacturing, while old books release distinctive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) as they slowly decay. Scientists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/13/scientists-preserving-books-smell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sniffing out these VOCs</a> to reveal secrets about a book’s age, condition, and history.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry of Paper</h3>
<p>Paper is made of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cellulose-fiber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cellulose fibers bound by lignin</a>, while inks and bindings add other organic compounds. Cellulose is a polymer made of long glucose chains, while lignin is a complex polymer found in plant cells.</p>
<p>Over time, light, heat, and moisture cause the paper and compounds to break down, releasing VOCs that vaporize into the air. The manufacturing process also affects the VOCs released as the book ages.</p>
<h3>Telltale Scents</h3>
<p>An almond scent comes from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benzaldehyde</a> in the paper. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Vanillin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanillin</a>, the main compound in vanilla, is responsible for a sweet vanilla fragrance. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylbenzene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethylbenzene</a>, used in inks and paints, has a sweet plastic smell. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Ethylhexan-1-ol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-Ethyl hexanol</a>, found in solvents and scents, smells lightly floral.</p>
<p>New books use modern chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and alkyl ketene dimers, so they give off different VOCs. The VOCs can also indicate exposure to smoke, water damage, or other aging factors.</p>
<h3>Reading the Chemical Clues</h3>
<p>Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age and condition. The mix of compounds can reveal if a book came from an early print shop versus a late 19th century press. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs.</p>
<p>Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and even match orphaned books with the libraries they came from based on chemical fingerprints. It provides clues to an old tome’s origins and secrets as it aged over decades or centuries.</p>
<h3>The Life Story in a Whiff</h3>
<p>So next time you get a whiff of an old book, take a moment to enjoy that aromatic time capsule. Its scent has a story to tell, echoing the people, places, and processes that brought an ancient text to you. With each sniff, we get a little closer to understanding our bibliophilic past.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<h2>Why do old books smell the way they do?</h2>
<p>Old books release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, which give old books their distinctive scents.</p>
<h2>Do new and old books smell different?</h2>
<p>Yes, new books tend to smell more crisp and fresh, while old books have mustier, sweeter scents. This is because new book manufacturing uses different chemicals that produce different VOCs as they break down.</p>
<h2>What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell?</h2>
<p>Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral.</p>
<h2>Can scientists learn about a book’s history from its smell?</h2>
<p>Yes, analyzing the volatile organic compounds released by a book can reveal details about its age, manufacturing origins, condition, and past exposure to elements like smoke or water. This helps determine preservation needs.</p>
<h2>How does paper decomposition create VOCs?</h2>
<p>Paper is made of cellulose and lignin. Over time, heat, light, and moisture cause these polymers to break down and release VOCs, which enter the air. The specific VOCs depend on the paper production process.</p>
<h2>Do libraries and museums use VOC analysis?</h2>
<p>Libraries and museums are beginning to use VOC analysis to identify preservation needs in collections. It can also help match orphaned books by chemical fingerprint to determine their original source library.</p>

      <div><p>Amsterdam has started the fight against noisy motorcycles and cars. On Friday, the city placed electric road signs in two places to warn road users if their vehicles are too loud. The warnings will eventually be replaced by “noise cameras,” which, like speed cameras, automatically send a fine to the offending driver, Parool reports.</p>

<p>The test with the noise signs will start at the Stadhouderskade in the city center and Molenaarsweg in Amsterdam-Noord. The installation consists of a noise meter and a screen a little further on. If the meter registers too much noise, the driver will see the message “Te luid” - “Too loud” in Dutch. Later this month, more sound meters and signs will be installed on Europaboulevard in Zuid and on Tussen Meer in Nieuw-West. </p>

<p>The municipality hopes that the signs alone will already alert road users to the noise their vehicles make and prompt them to do something about it, a spokesperson told Parool.</p>

<p>Rotterdam is conducting a similar experiment in collaboration with Amsterdam. It is part of a broader approach, the municipality of Amsterdam spokesperson said. “Other measures we are taking include a simpler way of enforcement and a feasibility study by TNO into the application of the noise camera. We try to reduce noise nuisance in various ways.”</p>

<p>The noise camera consists of a box containing four microphones that can detect precisely where a sound is coming from. The box is connected to a regular speed camera, which takes a photo of the license plate to issue a fine. If the data from the current experiment proves reliable, Amsterdam and other large cities will ask the Cabinet to have the technology certified. </p>

(Sometimes the link fails right off the bat, giving you zero opportunity to read through the terms!)</p><p>So I would take advantage of that and save it, by any means necessary: screen scrape, copy-paste, print-as-PDF, take photo of screen with second device, whatever it took, because they could make it difficult!</p><p>But then I would usually end up with a copy of the contract that I could later call up and check on. So, your suggestion that analytics can determine my dwell time on the document when it's presented to me, that's not going to be indicative of how much time I really spent reading it after copying and saving it.</p><p>I've found that this is a good practice, and not for the reason you're thinking of. I've found that I'm extraordinarily bad at reading legal documents like this (including my lease, employment contract, benefits and insurance docs, you name it) because even if I think I understand, I didn't get it, and it's pointless anyway because negotiating the wording is not on the table.</p><p>But it's a good practice to save these, because of this: there are often instructions included about how to resolve disputes and claims against the company. These instructions usually follow a strict procedure and they have rules about what you can do. They also have contact info, and again, you will never ever find this contact info anywhere else ever again if you don't save the EULA at first opportunity. They will tell you what kind of arbitration or court proceedings are acceptable, they will tell you the complaints procedure from start to end, time frames, and what to expect at each point. This info is gold, and it's not going to be available when you come to have a dispute, and you're not even going to be aware of the procedure at that point, and so you will automatically be disqualified and lose any dispute because you didn't follow procedure. Have fun!

				<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of GM, has been asked to reduce its robotaxi fleet by 50% in San Francisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-robotaxi-involved-in-a-crash-with-fire-truck-one-passenger-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a crash</a> Thursday night with a fire truck.</p>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, requested the reduction in operations. The state agency said it is investigating “recent concerning incidents” involving Cruise vehicles in San Francisco. It called for Cruise to reduce its fleet by 50% and have no more than 50 driverless vehicles in operation during the day and 150 driverless vehicles in operation at night until the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>“Safety of the traveling public is the California DMV’s top priority,” the DMV said in a statement issued Friday evening, adding that it has the right, following the investigation to suspend or revoke testing and/or deployment permits if it determines there’s an unreasonable risk to public safety. “The primary focus of the DMV’s regulations is the safe operation of autonomous vehicles and safety of the public who share the road with these vehicles.”</p>
<p>Cruise told TechCrunch it is complying with the request. Cruise also <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/further-update-on-emergency-vehicle-collision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a blog post</a> giving the company’s perspective of how and why the crash occurred.</p>
<p>“Over one hundred people lose their lives every day on American roadways, and countless others are badly injured, Cruise said in a statement sent via email. “We believe it’s clear that Cruise positively impacts overall road safety, and look forward to working with the CA DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet.”</p>
<p>Cruise has had a series of snafus, including at least <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2023/08/15/driverless-cars-stall-causing-traffic-jam-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.wafb.com/2023/08/15/driverless-cars-stall-causing-traffic-jam-san-francisco/">10 of its driverless cars reportedly stalling</a> and blocking traffic, which threatens to derail its commercial plans. The string of glitches come just a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/cruise-and-waymo-win-robotaxi-expansions-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning approval</a> from the California Public Utilities Commission to expand commercial operations in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The CPUC, the agency that regulates ride-hailing operations including those involving robotaxis, approved Cruise and Waymo on August 10 for final permits that allow the companies to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, expand their fleets and charge for rides throughout the city.</p>
<p>The latest Cruise incident occurred Thursday night when a Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle crashed and left a passenger injured. Cruise said in a social media post that one of its self-driving Chevy Bolt EVs entered an intersection on a green traffic light at Polk and Turk streets when it was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/san-francisco-presses-cpuc-to-halt-waymo-cruise-robotaxi-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed motions with the CPUC</a> to pause Cruise and Waymo’s plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours. Chiu’s arguments parallel comments made by residents and other city officials during a public hearing ahead of the CPUC’s vote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the second section of the third part of our planned five part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/27/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-ii-romans-assemble/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/11/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-iiia-starting-down-the-path-of-honors/" data-type="post" data-id="20435">IIIa</a>) on the structure of the Roman Republic during the third and second centuries, the ‘Middle’ Republic.  Last week we discussed the overall structure of the ‘career path’ for a Roman politician and the first few offices along that path.  <strong>This week we’re going to look at the upper-steps of that career path, the offices of praetor and consul and the particular set of powers they possess, called <em>imperium</em></strong>, along with the pro-magistrate forms of these positions.  Now I should note at the outset that we have skipped one office on our way through, the tribunes of the plebs; we’ll get to that office <em>next</em> week to discuss its oddities and unusual powers.</p>



<p>The praestorship and the consulship are the highest Roman offices (the censorship being more of a ‘victory lap’) and the two offices that wield direct military and judicial authority.  These are also the offices where competition in the <em>cursus honorum</em> starts to get fierce, as the eight quaestors must compete for just six praetorships and those six praetors can expect to compete for just two – always two – consulships.  It is worth keeping in mind as we go through this that on the one hand <strong>these offices are largely confined to a small Roman elite, the <em>nobiles</em>, composed of families (both patrician and plebeian) that have been successful in politics over generations</strong>, but at the same time <strong>it is the popular assemblies which choose ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ from among the <em>nobiles</em></strong> by deciding who gets to proceed to the next round of the political elimination context, and who is forever going to sit in the Senate as a former quaestor and nothing more.</p>



<p>Now I am the only one of this blog who gets to have <em>imperium</em> (apparently <em>ACOUP</em> operates in the imperial where I have <em>imperium</em> and the guest-posters are my <em>legati</em>), but <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patrons at the <em>patres et matres conscripti</em></a> level can still advise me on how to use my <em>imperium</em>!  You don’t even have to have held the quaestorship!  As always, if you like this, please share it! If you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings, assuming there is still a Twitter by the time this post goes live.  I am also on Bluesky (@bretdevereaux.bsky.social) and (less frequently) Mastodon (@bretdevereaux@historians.social).</p>










<p>What connects these offices in particular is that they confer <em>imperium</em>, a distinctive concept in Roman law and governance.  The word <em>imperium</em> derives from the verb <em>impero</em>, ‘to command, order’ and so in a sense <em>imperium</em> simply means ‘command,’ but in its implication it is broader.  <em>Imperium</em> was understood to be the power of the king (Cic. <em>Leg. </em>3.8), encompassing both the judicial role of the king in resolving disputes and the military role of the king in leading the army.  In this sense, <em>imperium</em><strong> is the power to deploy violence on behalf of the community: both <em>internal </em>(judicial) violence and <em>external </em>(military) violence</strong>.</p>



<p>That power was represented visually around the person of magistrates with <em>imperium</em> through the lictors (Latin: <em>lictores</em>), attendants who follows magistrates with <em>imperium</em>, mostly to add dignity to the office but who also could act as the magistrates ‘muscle’ if necessary.  The lictors carried the <em>fasces</em>, a set of sticks bundled together in a rod; often in modern depictions the bundle is thick and short but in ancient artwork it is long and thin, the ancient equivalent of a police-man’s less-lethal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)">billy club</a>.  That, notionally non-lethal but still violent, configuration represented the <em>imperium</em>-bearing magistrate’s civil power within the <em>pomerium</em> (recall, this is the sacred boundary of the city).  When passing beyond the <em>pomerium</em>, an axe was inserted into the bundle, turning the the non-lethal crowd-control device into a lethal weapon, reflective of the greater power of the <em>imperium-</em>bearing magistrate to act with unilateral <em>military</em> violence outside of Rome (though to be clear the consul couldn’t just murder you because you were on your farm; this is symbolism).  The consuls were each assigned 12 lictors, while praetors got 6.  Pro-magistrates had one fewer lictor than their magistrate versions to reflect that, while they wielded <em>imperium</em>, it was of an inferior sort to the actual magistrate of the year.</p>

<p>What is notable about the Roman concept of <em>imperium</em> is that it is a single, unitary thing: multiple magistrates can have <em>imperium</em>, you can have greater or lesser forms of <em>imperium</em>, but you cannot break apart the component elements of <em>imperium</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-1-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20553" title="I should note here that Drogula (in <em><a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I&quot; data-type=&quot;link&quot; data-id=&quot;https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I&quot;>Commanders and Command</a></em> (2015)) understands <em>imperium</em> a bit differently than this more traditional version I am presenting (in line with Lintott&amp;#8217;s understanding).  He contends that <em>imperium</em> was an entirely military power which was not necessary for judicial functions and was not only indivisible but also, at least early on, did not come in different degrees.  In practice, I&amp;#8217;m not sure the Romans were ever so precise with their concepts as Drogula wants them to be."><sup>1</sup></a></span>  This is a real difference from the <em>polis</em>, where the standard structure was to take the three components of royal power (religious, judicial and military) and split them up between different magistrates or boards in order to avoid any one figure being too powerful.  <strong>For the Romans, the royal authority over judicial and military matters were unavoidably linked because they were the same thing, <em>imperium</em>, and so could not be separated.</strong>  That in turn leads to Polybius’ awe at the power wielded by Roman magistrates, particularly the consuls (Polyb. 6.12); a <em>polis</em> wouldn’t generally focus so much power into a single set of hands constitutionally (keeping in mind that tyrants are <em>extra</em>-constitutional figures).</p>



<p>So what does <em>imperium</em> empower a magistrate to do?  All magistrates have <em>potestas</em>, the power to act on behalf of the community within their sphere of influence.  <em>Imperium</em> is the subset of magisterial <em>potestas</em> which covers the provision of violence for the community and it comes in two forms: the power to raise and lead armies and the power to organize and oversee courts.  Now we normally think of these powers as cut by that <em>domi et militiae</em> (“at home and on military service”) distinction we discussed<a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/"> earlier in the series</a>: at home <em>imperium</em> is the power to organize courts (which are generally jury courts, though for some matters magistrates might make a summary judgement) and abroad the power to organize armies.  But as we’ll see when we get to the role of magistrates and pro-magistrates in the provinces, the power of legal judgement conferred by <em>imperium</em> is, if anything, <strong>more</strong> intense outside of Rome.  <strong>That said it is absolutely the case that <em>imperium</em> is <em>restrained</em> within the <em>pomerium</em> and far less restrained outside of it</strong>.</p>

<p>There were limits on the ability of a magistrate with <em>imperium</em> to deploy violence within the <em>pomerium</em> against citizens.  The <em>Lex Valeria</em>, dating to the very beginning of the <em>res publica</em> stipulated that in the case of certain punishments (death or flogging), the victim had the right of <em>provocatio</em> to call upon the judgement of the Roman people, through either an assembly or a jury trial.  That limit to the consul’s ability to use violence was reinforced by the <em>leges Porciae</em> (passed in the 190s and 180s), which protected civilian citizens from summary violence from magistrates, even when outside of Rome.  That said, on campaign – that is, <em>militae</em> rather than <em>domi</em> – these laws did not exempt citizen soldiers from beating or even execution as a part of military discipline and indeed Roman military discipline struck Polybius – himself an experienced Greek military man – as harsh (Polyb. 6.35-39).</p>



<p>In practice then, the ability of a magistrate to utilize <em>imperium</em> within Rome was hemmed in by the laws, whereas when out in the provinces on campaign it was far less limited.  A second power, <em>coercitio</em> or ‘coercion’ – the power of a higher magistrate to use minor punishments or force to protect public order – is sometimes presented as a distinct power of the magistrates, but I tend to agree with Lintott (<em>op. cit.</em>, 97-8) that this rather overrates the importance of the coercive powers of magistrates within the <em>pomerium</em>; in any case, the day-to-day maintenance of public order generally fell to minor magistrates.</p>



<p>While <em>imperium</em> was a ‘complete package’ as it were, the Romans clearly understood certain figures as having an <em>imperium</em> that outranked others, thus dictators could order consuls, who could order praetors, the hierarchy neatly visualized by the number of lictors each had.  This could create problems, of course, when Rome’s informal systems of hierarchy conflicted with this formal system, for instance at the Battle of Arausio, the pro-consul Quintus Servilius Caepio refused to take orders from the consul, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, because the latter was his social inferior (being a <em>novus homo</em>, a ‘new man’ from a family that hadn’t yet been in the Senate and thus not a member of the <em>nobiles</em>), despite the fact that by law the <em>imperium</em> of a sitting consul outranked that of a pro-consul.  The result of that bit of insubordination was a military catastrophe that got both commanders later charged and exiled.</p>



<p>Finally, a vocabulary note: it would be reasonable to assume that the Latin word for a person with <em>imperium</em> would be <em>imperator</em><span id="easy-footnote-2-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20553" title="Pronunication note because this bothers me when I hear this word in popular media: it is not imPERator, but impeRAtor, because that &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; is long by nature, and thus keeps the stress."><sup>2</sup></a></span> because that’s the standard way Latin words form.  And I will say, from the perspective of a person who has to decide at the beginning of each thing I write what circumlocution I am going to use to describe “magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em>,” it would be remarkably fortunate if <em>imperator</em> meant that, but it doesn’t.  Instead, <em>imperator</em> in Latin ends up swallowed by its idiomatic meaning of ‘victorious general,’ as it was normal in the republic for armies to proclaim their general as <em>imperator</em> after a major victory (which set the general up to request a triumph from the Senate).  In the imperial period, this leads to the emperors monopolizing the term, as all of the armies of Rome operated under their <em>imperium</em> and thus all victory accolades belonged to the emperor.  That in turn leads to <em>imperator</em> becoming part of the imperial title, from where it gives us our word ’emperor.’</p>



<p>That said, the circumlocution I am going to use here, because this isn’t a formal genre and I can, is ‘<em>imperium</em>-haver.’  I desperately wish I could use that in peer reviewed articles, but I fear no editor would let me (while Reviewer 2 will predictably object to ‘general’ ‘commander’ or ‘governor’ for all being modern coinages).<span id="easy-footnote-3-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-20553" title="And yes, really, I have had reviewers object to &amp;#8216;general&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;commander&amp;#8217; to mean &amp;#8216;the magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em> in the province.&amp;#8217;  There is no pleasing Reviewer 2."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>On to our first set of <em>imperium</em>-havers!</p>



<h2>Praetors  </h2>



<p>The six praetors are the junior <em>imperium-</em>possessing magistracy and though all of the praetors were elected together, by the Middle Republic the job of being praetor might vary quite a lot depending on which role you were assigned by the Senate.  You will recall that the praetorship is an old office, originally taking the place of chief magistrate which later becomes the consulship (note Livy 3.5.11-12, 7.3.5-8; Cic. <em>Leg</em>. 3.8; Fest. 249L; Gell. 11.18.8, 20.1.47; Plin. <em>NH</em> 18.12 see also Varro <em>Ling</em>. 5.80), though at some point the title of the chief magistrate shifted being consul and the praetor (just one of them) served as a junior assistant to the consuls.  We’re not well informed about the praetorship in this early form, but it seems likely it had a similar role in organizing the courts, while the consuls led the armies.  In any case the number of praetors increases rapidly in the last half of the third century, with a second added in c. 242, two more in 228 and two more in 198/7, giving the total of six.</p>



<p>Because the praetors had <em>imperium</em>, they could in theory lead armies and organize courts the same as consuls (though they lacked some of the other distinctive consular powers we’ll discuss in a moment) but in practice the responsibilities of the praetors were usually quite distinct and split into two large categories: praetors assigned a <em>provincia</em> (which again, you should read as ‘job’ not ‘province’) at Rome and praetors assigned a <em>provincia</em> outside of Rome.</p>



<p>The two praetors operating normally in Rome were terms the <em>praetor urbanus</em> and <em>praetor peregrinus</em> and their responsibility was almost entirely focused on the court system.  The <em>praetor urbanus</em> was primarily concerned with legal disputes involved two citizen parties, while any issue involving foreigners came under the jurisdiction of the <em>praetor peregrinus</em>, though the latter was sometimes also deployed out of Rome on special duties, at which point the <em>praetor urbanus</em>, who almost always remained in Rome, would handle both.  On coming into office, the <em>praetor urbanus</em> (and probably also the <em>praetor peregrinus</em>) issued the <em>edictum praetoris</em> (‘Praetor’s edict’) which set out how he intended to carry out his office.  Early on, these edicts seem mostly to have been restricted to changes in procedure or the assessment of damages, but by the first century praetorian edicts could lay out substantive law creating what later Roman jurists would term the <em>ius praetorium</em> (‘praetorian law’), which sat alongside the main law code itself, the <em>ius civile</em> (‘civil law’).  Mostly what these edicts lay out seem to be procedures or the conditions under which the praetor will grant a cause of action.  By the time the edict is fully developed, praetors seem to be seeking and getting advice from an emerging class of legal experts, <em>iuris prudentes</em> (‘men learned at law’ = ‘legal consult’) to craft what must often have been pretty formulaic edicts.<span id="easy-footnote-4-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-20553" title="To be clear, these are not <em>professional</em> lawyers, but rather generally elites who had taken a special interest in the law and thus become experts, on whom other elites holding offices might rely."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>We’ll cover the Roman legal process towards the end of this series but we may cover the praetor’s role here in brief.  When a case was raised – and Roman law understands all cases as disputes just like Greek law does, though unlike in most Greek <em>poleis</em>, some Roman magistrates seem to have had an expectation to act as quasi-public prosecutors for certain kinds of infractions – it was brought before the praetor, either <em>urbanus</em> for an issue involving citizens or <em>peregrinus</em> for an issue involving at least one non-citizen.  At this point the matter was <em>in iure</em> (‘at law’) and the praetor held a sort of preliminary hearing to determine if there was a cause of action (thus the importance of this question in the praetor’s edict) and then to assign a judge (a <em>iudex</em>) who would administer the trial and to set a formula (<em>formula</em>, gotta love Latin), which functioned rather like jury instructions, naming the relevant parties, describing their dispute and setting out the consequences should the matter be ruled in favor of one or the other (this stage of the case is <em>apud iudicem</em>, ‘before a judge’).  Note that the praetor doesn’t make a ruling, but merely lays out the formula.</p>



<p>For more serious matters that required a jury court to resolve, a potential prosecutor went before the praetor, who then assigned the case to the relevant court or assembly (as assemblies, especially early on, could act as courts) and set a date for the trial.  Interestingly, for jury trials, no <em>formula</em> was provided by the praetor.</p>



<p>What about the praetors who weren’t assigned to Rome?  As the sphere of Roman military activity expanded beyond Italy, it became necessary to have more commanders in the field, and this is where we get the additional praetors.  Because a praetor has <em>imperium</em>, they can function as a sort of ‘mini-consul.’  That said, praetors don’t tend to get assigned the sorts of jobs consuls do.  If Rome needs three major field armies, the Senate generally doesn’t send a praetor to command the third, rather it sends a pro-consul (which makes a degree of sense when you think about it; you want an experienced commander).</p>



<p>Instead, praetors in the field tend to be assigned to putative ‘quiet’ provinces or auxiliary support functions.  The standard praetorian provinces were <em>Corsica et Sardinia</em> (one province) and Sicily, later joined by the two Spains (<em>Hispania Citerior</em>, ‘Nearer Spain’ and <em>Hispania Ulterior</em>, ‘Further Spain), when they were quiet.  When a major military action flared up on this areas, the response wasn’t to send a praetor with a large army, but to assign a consul or a pro-consul to the province instead, though because these assignments are made annually that tends to mean that trouble flares up, the praetor with his smaller army tries to manage it and if he fails and is defeated, <em>then</em> a consul is sent out with a major army.</p>



<p>Now I don’t want to get entirely off-track detailing what a Roman commander does in his overseas <em>provincia</em>; I may add a supplemental post on this one describing what Roman provincial government looks like in the Republic (though for the curious, the book to read is F.K. Drogula, <a href="https://amzn.to/3qxEjh1" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/3qxEjh1"><em>Commanders and Command</em> </a>(2015); it’s a bit dry, but quite thorough).  But in brief a praetor in his overseas <em>provincia</em> is going to have command of whatever military forces are there, generally less than the standard two-legion consular army (sometimes a lot less!).  If there is no active military campaign to be done, the praetor will transit around the province.  Because he has <em>imperium</em>, he can resolve disputes as a court and in the provinces – because <em>imperium</em> is stronger outside of Rome – he can do so summarily so long as Roman citizens are not involved.  He can enforce these resolutions on non-Romans in the province because he has a Roman army and the implicit backing of the rest of the Roman state.  Note that the praetor in his province doesn’t take over day-to-day garden variety law and order issues; those are still handled by local governments, according to local laws.</p>



<p>Generally the expectation is that a praetor is going to use his mix of military force and his ability to resolve disputes and deliver judgements to keep good order in the region and to make sure that Rome’s taxes are collected.  In practice within those confines, there’s a lot of latitude, though the Senate may make certain specific demands as part of a praetor’s assignment.  The praetor is also assisted by an assigned quaestor who handles the financial side of things and is expected to consult a small council of advisors, a <em>consilium</em>, when making decisions.  Finally, beginning in 149, there is a permanent court in Rome which has the job of handling the cases of governors who exceeded their mandate in the provinces, the <em>quaestio de repetundis</em>; the name literally means ‘the court for things you need to give back’ because the primary concern was governors extorting money and taking bribes in their provinces.  So the praetor’s latitude is not infinite.</p>



<p>As the number of active <em>provinciae</em> became too large for even the larger number of praetors and the two consuls, the Senate took to having former praetors serve as ‘pro-praetors,’ a kind of pro-magistrate, but we’ll talk about them below, after we’ve discussed the most important Roman magistrate, the consuls.</p>



<h2>The Consuls</h2>



<p>The consuls, always a pair, are the senior magistrates of the Roman Republic.  While the censors, if there are any in office, may be themselves senior consulars (that is, ex-consuls), the sitting consuls are still the most powerful magistrates.  Consuls wield <em>imperium</em>, but of a greater degree than any other magistrate or pro-magistrate (save a dictator), allowing them to in theory give orders to other magistrates (though this doesn’t happen often).  The consuls also lead Rome’s primary field armies through the Middle Republic (this shifts only with Sulla’s reforms in 83).</p>



<p>While in theory the consuls’ possession of <em>imperium</em> meant they could superintend the courts, they generally didn’t (some Late Republic exceptions, like Pompey presiding over the trial of Titus Annius Milo are remarkable for being unusual).  Instead, we most often see consuls in two roles: moving major legislation and leading Rome’s main field armies.  In the former case, technically the praetors could legislate as well as the consuls, but in practice major laws tended to be proposed by either the consuls or the plebeian tribunes.</p>



<p>Each consul would also command a major field army.  The Romans do not do army-command-by-committee (unlike Athens), so under normal circumstances the consuls each had independent command over their own army.  The standard strength of a consular army was two legions (8,400 infantry, 600 cavalry) plus two <em>alae</em> of <em>socii</em> (varies but roughly the same size, with somewhat more cavalry), meaning that each consul in the Middle Republic goes to war with a chunky c. 20,000 man army.  It was only in rare circumstances that these armies would be combined and such combined ‘double consular’ armies often caused problems if the consuls couldn’t get along or agree on a strategic vision.</p>



<p>That said, how many troops a consul might have and where he would be expected to take them was largely determined by the Senate.  The Senate, as we’ll see, assigns <em>provincia</em> (again, think ‘jobs’ not ‘provinces’) – even to the consuls – and it also directs the quaestors on how resources are to be allocated.  That includes conscription (the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/06/16/collections-how-to-raise-a-roman-army-the-dilectus/" data-type="post" data-id="19439"><em>dilectus</em>) </a>and we see repeatedly that consuls do not feel they can hold a <em>dilectus</em> without the consent of the Senate; they can take volunteers without senatorial approval, but a draft, no.  Likewise, unless they can find volunteer <em>funding</em>, they are reliant on quaestors releasing funds, quaestors who are always going to do what the Senate tells them to do.</p>



<p>However, the Senate can’t come on campaign with the consuls and so once in the field, dealing with whatever problem the Senate has suggested they deal with, the consuls have a great deal of command independence and nearly limitless authority.  Whereas at Rome consular authority is constrained by laws and the plebeian tribunes (whose powers end at the <em>pomerium</em>), in the field they can implement strict military discipline and command their armies as they see fit.  That extends to considerable latitude when it comes to negotiating with foreign states (neutral or hostile), though any treaty they make must be ratified back in Rome (technically requiring approval of an assembly but in practice this depends on if the Senate approves).</p>



<p>Now with such sweeping powers the Romans were naturally concerned that the consuls might usurp the state, so they instituted a few basic checks on this.  One of these checks is simply the existence of the plebeian tribunes, but we’ll talk about those next time.  But also it was clearly established that there must <em>always</em> be two consuls.  Not one, not three.  <em>Two</em>.  If one consul dies, another must be immediately elected; this replacement consul was called a <em>consul suffectus</em> (the year was still dated from the two consuls elected at the beginning, the <em>consules ordinarii</em>).  Because only a consul had the authority to hold a consular election, you needed a system to handle situations where both consuls were indisposed at once (either both dead or one dead and one abroad with the army); the solution was a rare official, the <em>interrex</em>, who only had the authority to hold an election for the consulship.</p>



<p>Once you’ve ensured there are always two consuls, the next trick is to make sure they can check each other.  To ensure that, consuls were given some substantial powers.  The most famous of these was <em>veto</em>, Latin for “I forbid!”  Just by saying the word, a consul could block any action by any other magistrate, <em>including the other consul</em>.  The power had to be exercised in person, which limited it: if you really wanted to prevent your colleague from doing something he <em>really</em> wanted to do, you best be prepared to follow him around in person every day to keep vetoing it.  A supercharged for of veto consuls could also exercise was <em>iustitium</em>, declaring a stop to all state business; this could be used to stop any meeting of a popular assembly or of the Senate so long as the assembly had not dispersed into voting groups.</p>



<p>The final check on the consuls is pretty simple: they only serve for one year.  After which it is generally expected that there be a respectable interval (usually around 10 years) before you can run for the consulship again.  <strong>While in office, any Roman with <em>imperium</em> is immune from prosecution</strong>, but can be prosecuted immediately on leaving office for any crimes they may have done while in office.  Consequently, a consul’s freedom of action is going to be limited by their concern about potentially having to face a jury after their one-year term is complete.  Even if they aren’t worried about that, once their year is done they go back to being just another senator, so good relations with the rest of the Senate is a good idea.</p>



<p>In part because one of the <em>other</em> things the Senate decides on are…</p>



<h2>Pro-Magistrates</h2>



<p>Roman expansion put strains on all of these systems.  <strong>Fundamentally, the Roman system remained one designed for a small city-state</strong>.  Everything – military command, attending the Senate, passing legislation, using veto power – needed to be done in person by magistrates who only had a single year in office.  While Roman territory and the scope of Rome’s wars remained small, that sort of system worked fine.  As Roman territory and Rome’s wars expanded, it put all sorts of strains on that system: how to handle multi-year campaigns which kept the armies in the field?  How to handle having more commands than magistrates?</p>



<p>The solution was to extend (prorogue) a magistrate’s authority, making them a pro-magistrate (‘pro’ meaning ‘standing in for’).  It’s tricky to pin down exactly when the Romans first did this as our sources for early Rome (Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus) tend to use terms for proconsular power (<em>pro consule</em> or ἀνθύπατον ἀρχὴν) long before prorogation seems to have been used in Rome.  Generally, we think that the first genuine prorogation happens in 327 as part of the run-up to the Second Samnite War (Livy 8.23).<span id="easy-footnote-5-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-20553" title="On this, see Drogula, <em>op. cit.</em> 27."><sup>5</sup></a></span>  The problem here was two-fold: Rome’s evident shift to year-round campaigning meaning that the army needed a continous commander in the field as in this case where it was conducting a siege, combined with the greater distances – the commander, Q. Pubilius Philo, is besieging Naples – making swift changes in command difficult.</p>



<p>Prorogation becomes common and regular during the Punic Wars.  The First Punic War, taking place primarily in Sicily, demanded the use of prorogation to cover the lag time between elections in Rome and commanders arriving in Sicily, as well as to allow single commanders to conduct more complex campaigns.  By the Second Punic War, which takes place in Italy, Sicily, Gaul, Spain, North Africa and Illyria (much of that <em>simultaneously</em>) it was also necessary to prorogue commanders in order to simply get enough field commanders with <em>imperium</em> for all of the armies Rome was deploying.  Indeed, in the crazy days of the Second Punic War, at points the Senate prorogued men who had never held office before, <em>privati cum imperio</em> (private citizens with <em>imperium</em>), though this is discontinued and replaced by a system whereby prorogued commanders will have first held the relevant office at some point.</p>



<p>The expanding number of areas of Roman overseas control pushed this further as more regions meant more <em>provinciae</em> (in the sense of ‘jobs’) which demanded more <em>imperium</em>-havers to handle.  New praetors were eventually made for Sicily, Corsica-and-Sardinia and the two Spains, but by the mid-second century the Romans are regularly assigning <em>imperium</em>-havers to Gaul (Cisalpine or Transalpine), Africa, Greece and Macedonia and of course also need magistrates with <em>imperium</em> in Italy to handle the regular functions of government.<span id="easy-footnote-6-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-20553" title="Macedonia as a permanent province is added in 147, Africa in 146 and Asia in 129, followed by Gallia Narbonensis in 120.  No new praetors are created for this province; they&amp;#8217;re handled by promagistrates when things are calm enough not to require a consul."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>One of the pressures here is that by this point it was clearly locked into tradition that there were only ever two consuls.  It had not <em>always</em> been that way; back when the Romans had military tribunes with consular powers, they had three of them.  But by the third century, there were always and could only be two consuls.  But that’s a problem because even if you have spare praetors, you don’t assign praetors to <em>major</em> military commands, so if you have <em>three</em> major military commands, you don’t send a praetor, you assign a proconsul.</p>



<p>The result of all of this is that each year the most pressing military problems generally got a consul assigned to them.  Often the military problem from last year that was on-going would see its ex-consul prorogued to continue handling it.  Likewise, the new praetors would be sent out to replace the governors in quiet provinces, with the remainder who weren’t replaced prorogued to hold down the fort for another year.  Later it is going to become quite common for former praetors and consuls who had returned to Rome to be dispatched back out to the provinces to do a stint as a promagistrate, but the common use of this is really a consequence of the Sullan reforms and for the most part belongs to the first century.  Most third and second century promagistrates are having an existing command <em>extended</em> rather than being sent out fresh.</p>



<p>Extensions of this sort, I should note, were generally fairly short.  The longest run I can think of in this period is that of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus who is <em>privati cum imperio</em> <em>pro consule</em> (‘private citizen with pro-consular imperium’) from 210 to 206, mostly as a product of his father and uncle having been the local Roman commanders in Spain and Scipio having taken over when they were both killed, leading to an irregular, emergency command.  He’s then consul in 205, before having his command prorogued from 204 to 201 to complete his invasion of Africa (technically, he’s assign to Sicily with permission to invade Africa if an opportunity presented itself).</p>



<p>Far more typical for even an exceptional commander was something like Scipio Aemilianus’ experience.  Consul in 147, he is prorogued to complete the destruction of Carthage in 146.  Then, consul in 134, he is prorogued to complete the destruction of Numantia in 133.  And that was that.  The point here being that the heavy reliance on proconsuls to conduct the main effort in Roman wars, often with longer commands (most famously Caesar’s <em>eight years</em> in Gaul or Pompey’s back-to-back eastern commands from 67 to 62) visible in the Late Republic was not common practice in the Middle Republic.</p>



<p>One significant legal quirk of prorogation is that while a consul or a praetor at least notionally had <em>imperium</em> which traveled (though in practice they would be expected to focus on the <em>provincia</em> the Senate assigned them), the <em>imperium</em> of a promagistrate, who after all only ‘stood in for’ the actual magistrate of the year, was in fact restricted to their defined sphere of action.</p>



<p>My plan once we’ve gone through the whole Roman system <em>for Romans</em> is to add two more posts on this series (perhaps not coming right away), one covering how the Roman Republic interacts with the <em>socii</em> and another briefly describing the shape of Roman governance in the provinces<span id="easy-footnote-7-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-20553" title="Places, not jobs, for once."><sup>7</sup></a></span>  But for now, that’s enough on <em>imperium</em>.  Next week, we’re going to look at two very strange major offices, the tribunate and the censorship, plus discuss what we know of the key minor offices of the republic.</p>
<ol><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-1-20553"></span>I should note here that Drogula (in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I">Commanders and Command</a></em> (2015)) understands <em>imperium</em> a bit differently than this more traditional version I am presenting (in line with Lintott’s understanding).  He contends that <em>imperium</em> was an entirely military power which was not necessary for judicial functions and was not only indivisible but also, at least early on, did not come in different degrees.  In practice, I’m not sure the Romans were ever so precise with their concepts as Drogula wants them to be.<a href="#easy-footnote-1-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-2-20553"></span>Pronunication note because this bothers me when I hear this word in popular media: it is not imPERator, but impeRAtor, because that ‘a’ is long by nature, and thus keeps the stress.<a href="#easy-footnote-2-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-3-20553"></span>And yes, really, I have had reviewers object to ‘general’ or ‘commander’ to mean ‘the magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em> in the province.’  There is no pleasing Reviewer 2.<a href="#easy-footnote-3-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-4-20553"></span>To be clear, these are not <em>professional</em> lawyers, but rather generally elites who had taken a special interest in the law and thus become experts, on whom other elites holding offices might rely.<a href="#easy-footnote-4-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-5-20553"></span>On this, see Drogula, <em>op. cit.</em> 27.<a href="#easy-footnote-5-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-6-20553"></span>Macedonia as a permanent province is added in 147, Africa in 146 and Asia in 129, followed by Gallia Narbonensis in 120.

The red dots indicate sensors that recorded spikes at 10:20 pm on February 24, 2022, hours after Russian troops seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. You can see from this how far apart the sensors that spiked were (in some cases tens of miles away from each other), while other sensors near the spiked sensors showed no elevated levels — a suspicious pattern that suggested the spikes might not have been real.

Ukrainian authorities attributed it to heavy military equipment that they said was stirring up radioactive dirt that had settled in the ground following the 1986 nuclear accident at the plant and condemned Russia for creating a scenario that posed a radiological risk not only to Ukraine but also to Europe.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png" width="586" height="282.13324175824175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:701,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:586,&quot;bytes&quot;:2665582,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>CCTV footage captured the Russian military convoy passing through checkpoint Leliv, about nine miles southeast of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the afternoon of February 24, 2022.

After a group of scientists in the United Kingdom published a paper last year discounting the soil theory, someone approached Santamarta about whether it was possible the sensors had been hacked.</span></p><p><span>A few years ago, Santamarta found </span><a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Santamarta-Go-Nuclear-Breaking%20Radition-Monitoring-Devices-wp.pdf" rel="">unpatched vulnerabilities</a><span> in radiation sensors (different from the ones used at Chernobyl), that could have allowed someone to manipulate data recorded by the sensors. Intrigued by the mystery at Chernobyl, Santamarta wondered if the Chernobyl sensors might have been vulnerable in similar ways. He spent months last year studying the history of Chernobyl, digging deeply into the technology behind radiation sensors in general and more specifically the equipment setup in the CEZ, and eliminated a number of theories about what might have caused the spikes, before concluding that the data was likely manipulated.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png" width="540" height="341.2087912087912" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/adfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:920,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:540,&quot;bytes&quot;:2767102,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadfa063b-402f-4aa6-97f4-852cd99d0fc0_1700x1074.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An amalgamation of satellite imagery showing fires and other “thermal anomalies” in Ukraine (some caused naturally, some due to the war) between February 24 and July 14.

You should probably read the story first to understand the context for what I’m going to discuss here.</p><p>There are about 68 battery-powered radiation sensors at Chernobyl, called GammaTRACERs, that are spread throughout the CEZ. They’re managed by the State Specialized Enterprise Ecocenter (Ecocenter for short). These detectors continuously record ambient gamma radiation levels and calculate an average before transmitting that figure wirelessly (using a SkyLINK module) to a base station in an Ecocenter office in the town of Chernobyl. Those readings, transmitted once an hour, get analyzed by software and then are posted to the Ecocenter’s web site. </p><p>Santamarta considered a number of ways the data might have been manipulated:  Someone could have hacked individual sensors to alter the data before it was transmitted, or intercepted and altered it while it was in transit to the base station. But this would have been too much work and been inefficient. Instead, based on the patterns, he concluded that the most likely way for someone to alter the data was to write malicious code that altered it on the Ecocenter’s server, after it was aggregated from all of the sensors. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png" width="524" height="297.989010989011" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:828,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:524,&quot;bytes&quot;:320671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Model of a GammaTRACER radiation detector.</figcaption></figure></div><p>During the period in question, forty-two sensors spiked, most of them simultaneously in clusters.

If the spikes had truly been caused by trucks stirring up radioactive dirt, the radiation levels would not have dropped so quickly.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png" width="312" height="531.75" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1418,&quot;width&quot;:832,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:312,&quot;bytes&quot;:174547,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F961e2627-d0cc-4a59-a052-267c1b629209_832x1418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A second set of ten sensors spiked at 9:50 pm.

But in the 9:50 pm spike cluster, two of the sensors increased twenty-seven and fifty-five times normal levels.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Anyone who looks at the data and maps showing the spikes in the CEZ would likely think something was amiss. Aside from the geographical distance between spiking sensors, it should have been obvious something was wrong with the data when  sensors that spiked quickly returned to normal levels.</p><p><span>In fact, a number of people outside Ukraine were expressing doubt about the authenticity of the data — including a radiation expert in France who told a reporter the data </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-nuclear-agency-reports-higher-chernobyl-radiation-levels-due-heavy-2022-02-25/" rel="">might have been hacked</a><span>. </span></p><p>Yet officials in Ukraine, and at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna — the United Nations body that monitors nuclear facilities around the world — didn’t investigate or even notice something was wrong with the data. Why?</p><p>The war was raging, Ukrainians were in a fight for their lives and country and were uncertain if money and military equipment would come from abroad. And staff at the Chernobyl plant were being held hostage by Russian troops. These are all good reasons why neither Ukrainian officials nor the IAEA would have taken time to notice or investigate the suspicious data patterns when they occurred. And if the IAEA suspected the data was false, this would be another reason not to become alarmed and hurry an investigation.</p><p>Yet its public statements indicated the IAEA believed the data was accurate. So why not, once Russian soldiers departed Chernobyl at the end of March, conduct an investigation then?</p><p><span>The IAEA sent experts to do a radiological survey in the CEZ in April, but their focus wasn’t on determining the cause of the spikes. Investigators instead wanted to determine if Russian soldiers who dug trenches in a small section of the CEZ had released dangerous levels of radiation in that area that could have sickened the soldiers or anyone else who passed through that area. (The IAEA determined the radiation levels from trench-digging could not have made the soldiers ill.) Three months later, the Ukrainian government invited Greenpeace to conduct its own radiological survey of the areas where Russian soldiers had camped, and they also did not look into the cause or veracity of the February spikes. (They concluded that the radiation levels where the soldiers camped were three times what the IAEA reported and </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/54762/greenpeace-investigation-challenges-nuclear-agency-on-chornobyl-radiation-levels/" rel="">accused the IAEA of being untrustworthy</a><span> because IAEA Deputy Director Mikhail Chudakov, a Russian, is a long-term official with ROSATOM, Russia’s state atomic corporation.) </span></p><p>It seems strange, Santamarta told me, that both the IAEA and Greenpeace would put effort into determining if Russian soldiers were endangered from digging trenches in one small part of the CEZ and not be concerned about much higher radiation levels that sensors had recorded in other parts of the CEZ — including parts where Chernobyl staff were working.</p><p>One can understand on the surface why the IAEA might not have investigated — the agency had issued a statement after the spikes occurred saying the radiation levels had only reached 9 µSv/h, a level that posed no danger to the workers at Chernobyl or the public. But as I note in the WIRED story, the IAEA was basing this assessment on incomplete information Ukraine provided. In fact, the spikes had already reached more than 90 µSv/h by the time the agency released its statement, but the IAEA never mentioned this in its statement. </p><p>Tero Karhunen, senior inspector with Finland’s radiation and nuclear safety authority, known as STUK, told me that if ambient dose rates rise above 100 µSv/h for more than 48 hours, this normally triggers an evacuation of the affected region. The data from Chernobyl was all posted to the Ecocenter web site for everyone to see, including the IAEA, yet the agency ignored the higher numbers. Why?</p><p>Did the IAEA know or suspect the spikes were false and therefore wanted to calm the public by citing only the lower numbers? The agency wouldn’t answer any questions I sent. </p><p>The implications, if it knew or suspected the data was false and didn’t investigate, are concerning. The implications if it believed the data was accurate and told the public the radiation posed no danger to the public, when in fact 90 µSv/h did potentially pose a danger, are also concerning.</p><p><strong>Why Did Sensor Data Stop Getting Updated?</strong></p><p>The spikes occurred over a 14-hour period, with a number of the sensors spiking multiple times throughout this time. With some sensors that spiked more than once, the second spike was lower than the first. But other sensors that spiked more than once showed dramatic increases with the second spike — including two sensors that spiked to nearly 100 µSv/h. These two sensors, known as DGS-2 and HZHTO, initially spiked at 9:50 pm on the night of February 24 and then again at 10:40 am the next morning. </p><p>DGS-2 (which normally recorded a radiation dose level of 7.67 µSv/h) spiked to 58.8 µSv/h at 9:50 pm on February 24th, and then to 93 µSv/h at 10:40 am the next morning. And HZHTO (which normally recorded a radiation dose level of 2.98 µSv/h spiked to 65.5 µSv/h at 9:50 pm and then to 93 at 10:40 am the next morning.</p><p>Both DGS-2 and HZHTO got very close to 100 µSv/h — the level which Karhunen says generally triggers an evacuation if it lasts for 48 hours. Given the upward trajectory of the spikes between 9:40 pm and 10:50 am, it’s possible they would have climbed higher with subsequent spikes. We’ll never know if they would have reached higher levels, however, because the Ecocenter’s online map stopped updating data after 10:50 am on February 25th. This meant nuclear experts outside Ukraine, and others who were monitoring the Ecocenter web site to track the radiation levels in the CEZ, were suddenly blind to what was occurring there.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png" width="374" height="517.3946188340807" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1234,&quot;width&quot;:892,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:374,&quot;bytes&quot;:157054,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Image showing the two sensors — DGS-2 and HZHTO — whose ambient dose rates were nearing 100 µSv/h before the Ecocenter’s web site stopped updating data from all of the sensors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s not clear why the data suddenly stopped, but there are a couple of possibilities. The following is speculation.</p><ol><li><p>Ukraine was experiencing intermittent internet and electricity outages on the day of the invasion, and it’s possible the Ecocenter’s internet service went out. In this case, the radiation sensors in the CEZ would still have recorded radiation levels (they are battery operated after all) and they still would have transmitted the data to the Ecocenter base station. With the internet out, however, the data could not get posted to the Ecocenter’s web site. But once internet connectivity was restored, data held in reserve should have posted. Indeed, data from the sensors all came back online the following Monday, February 28 (at this point they were all reporting normal radiation levels again). The sensors all went offine again by March 3, however, and remained that way until long after Russian soldiers ended their occupation of the Chernobyl plant and CEZ. </p></li><li><p>But there’s an alternate theory. If internet outages didn’t prevent the data from getting uploaded to the Ecocenter web site, and the sensors themselves were still recording and transmitting data, there is a possibility that someone pulled the plug on the Ecocenter server that was used to process and upload the data to the web site. Ukrainian authorities say that Russian soldiers at the Ecocenter’s office in Chernobyl stole the hard drive from the server used to process the radiation data, but couldn’t say when that occurred — on March 3 when the web site stopped posting data or later as the soldiers were departing Chernobyl. If they stole it on March 3, this could explain why the data stopped updating. But if they stole it later than this, then this doesn’t explain why data stopped updating to the web site. And it suggests that somene intentionally stopped the data from posting — possibly because they knew the data was false and feared that radiation levels higher than 100 µSv/h would get posted to the web site and cause panic.</p></li><li><p>There’s another mystery, however. Ordinarily the Ecocenter’s system automatically transmits the sensor data to the IAEA around the same time it’s posted to the Ecocenter’s online map. But at some point on February 24, the IAEA stopped receiving this direct data transmission, even though data continued to get updated to the Ecocenter’s web site until February 25th, and then again on the 28th when all of the sensor data came back online. Did someone know the data was false and halt the transmission to prevent the IAEA from acting on false data if the levels increased to 100 µSv/h? There are a lot of unanswered questions.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png" width="518" height="386.02547770700636" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:1256,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:518,&quot;bytes&quot;:1693272,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The GammaTRACERs store data in their memory. This data could be used to verify if the data the Ecocenter posted to its web site was accurate. If someone had altered the data on the Ecocenter server, it wouldn’t match the data stored in the memory of the sensors. The memory of these devices only hold so much data, however, before it’s overwritten, and it’s not clear if the data from February 2022 still remains in them.</p><p>In addition to the digital GammaTRACERs that measure energy produced by ionizing radiation, some of the sensor stations also have an aerosol filter that measures ambient dose levels in the air. These filters are much more sensitive to radiation changes than the digital sensors and therefore are more accurate in detecting radiation dose levels. The filters would have been a great way for Ukraine to verify that the levels recorded by the GammaTRACERs were accurate.</p><p>Prior to the invasion, Chernobyl workers would collect these filters once a week to test them in a lab. But during the occupation of Chernobyl, it appears workers were prevented from collecting and testing the filters. Once Russian soldiers left Chernobyl and the CEZ, however, it would have been a great time for workers to collect the filters and test them. Unfortunately, according to a nuclear expert from Greenpeace who entered the CEZ a few months after the Russians left, there were landmines littered throughout the CEZ and it would have been dangerous for workers to collect the filters. It’s unclear if the filters have been collected since then.  </p><p>One other way to verify the accuracy of the sensor data — either after the Russians left or today — would be to do a forensic investigation of the sensors themselves and the Ecocenter server used to process and publish the data online. Unfortunately, the Ecocenter server — or its hard drive — is gone. According to Ukrainian authorities, the Russians took it.

The Ukrainians say that Russian soldiers absconded with the entire server when they left Chernobyl.

Perhaps the answer is as simple as space. They didn’t have enough space in their military vehicles to carry entire computer towers back to Russia, so they just took the hard drives. But why take the hard drives?</p><p>If the radiation data at Chernobyl was manipulated, this raises questions about who had the means to do it and why.

But once Russian soldiers had control of the Ecocenter facilities, why remove the hard drives? To remove evidence of Russia’s manipulation?</p><p>If Ukraine was responsible for manipulating the data and falsifying the radiation spikes — to alarm the West or control the movement of Russian soldiers at Chernobyl, as I discuss in the WIRED story — the scenario becomes more interesting. If workers at Chernobyl created the spikes, and someone in authority realized the implications of deceiving the IAEA and the public with false data and ordered them to stop, this could explain why the data suddenly stopped transmitting to the IAEA and stopped being updated to the Ecocenter web site. Alternatively, Russia could have realized that Ukraine was falsifying the data to drum up support from Europe and the US by showing that the invasion had created a dangrous nuclear risk and ordered soldiers at Chernobyl to seize the Ecocenter hard drives to halt the Ukrainian disinformation campaign. Who knows?</p><p>Without an investigation, we may never know the truth. </p><p>Shevchuk told me in an email that his agency would consider investigating the radiation spikes if merited, but would do so only after the war has ended. With the Ecocenter hard drives missing, and the unlikelihood that any 2022 data in the memory of the GammaTRACERs would still remain at the end of the war, it’s not clear an investigation would even be possible. </p><p>The mystery of Chernobyl may remain a mystery.</p><p><em>Thank you for reading.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/17/health-ceo-salaries-compensation/">https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/17/health-ceo-salaries-compensation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37182600">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>T</span></span>he health care industry didn’t just provide a safe haven for jittery stock investors in 2022, a year defined by inflation and higher interest rates. It also provided a stable stream of wealth for top executives, who collectively pocketed billions of dollars in what was otherwise a rough patch for the economy.</p>
<p>By almost every measure, 2022 was a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-u-s-stocks-2022-is-a-year-with-almost-no-record-highs-11672443247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad year</a> for the stock market. But health care stocks <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/healthcare-stocks-defensive-buy-51672951649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell significantly less</a> than other companies as the amount of care received and prescriptions filled returned closer to pre-pandemic norms.</p>
<p>As a result, the CEOs of more than 300 publicly traded health care companies combined to make $4 billion in 2022, according to a STAT analysis of financial filings. That amount of money could buy Costco memberships for more than 66 million people, and it’s equivalent to the entire economic output of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sierra Leone</a>.</p>
<p>That CEO haul was down 11% from the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/07/18/health-care-ceo-compensation-2021/">$4.5 billion recorded in 2021</a>. But the sizable paydays highlight how every niche of health care — from Covid-19 vaccines and obscure technology to orthopedic implants and providing coverage to the nation’s poor — continued to supply its leaders with substantial sums of money even as more people struggled to afford food, housing, and, yes, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/468053/record-high-put-off-medical-care-due-cost-2022.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care</a>.</p>
<p>“No matter how you slice it, the people at the top — the CEOs of these companies — are making enormous gains every year compared to ordinary Americans,” said John McDonough, a health policy professor at Harvard who has studied health care for nearly four decades. “This is the bitter fruit that we reap from telling the health care industry to act more like a business.”</p>
		
		
<p>No CEO made more than Moderna’s Stéphane Bancel, who took in <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/17/moderna-stephane-bancel-compensation/">nearly $400 million</a> after governments around the world quickly bought the biotech company’s Covid-19 shot. Bancel is in the process of donating a vast majority of his income to charities. The 10 highest-paid CEOs — a list that also includes the CEOs of Thermo Fisher and McKesson — made a combined $1.4 billion, or about a third of the total studied. That amount is roughly what the National Institutes of Health spends annually to <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/budget-information/fiscal-year-2024-budget-information-congressional-justification-national-institute-drug-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study drug abuse and addiction</a>.</p>
<p>The irony with health care’s massive payouts, according to experts, is how the industry praises itself for attempting to find ways to lower costs. But health care still represents more than 18% of the U.S. economy — similar to what it was before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Individual companies’ incentive is not to bring system costs down,” McDonough said.</p>
		
		
<p>Similar to last year, STAT analyzed executive compensation found in the annual proxy filings of more than 300 companies across all health care sectors — drugmakers and biotech firms, health insurers, hospitals, other providers, medical device firms, health tech companies, suppliers, and more. The analysis focused on companies that were worth at least $1 billion in March, based on data from financial database provider AlphaSense.</p>
<p>The data offer a detailed view of how top executives are incentivized, like how stock continues to comprise most of their compensation and how that drives the wide pay disparities between those in charge and those who work on the ground, like nurses, home health aides, and others. The analysis also highlights outliers within each sector, such as one biopharma CEO who made more than $90 million — all of which came from so-called “management fees.”</p>
