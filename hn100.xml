<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/">launched OpenAI in 2015</a> as <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a nonprofit research lab</a> that they said would involve society and <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a#.1mz74bfmo">the public</a> in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI’s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules.</p><p>But when WIRED requested those records last month, OpenAI said its policy had changed, and the company provided only a narrow financial statement that omitted the majority of its operations.</p><p>"We provide financial statements when requested,” company spokesperson Niko Felix says. “OpenAI aligns our practices with industry standards, and since 2022 that includes not publicly distributing additional internal documents.”</p><p>OpenAI’s abandonment of the long-standing transparency pledge obscures information that could shed light on the recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-boardroom-drama-sam-altman-could-mess-up-your-future/">near-implosion</a> of a company with crucial influence over the future of AI and could help outsiders understand its vulnerabilities. In November, OpenAI’s board <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-out-after-losing-confidence-of-board/">fired CEO Sam Altman</a>, implying in a statement that he was untrustworthy and had endangered its mission to ensure AI <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“benefits all humanity.”</a> An employee and investor revolt soon forced the board to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-back/">reinstate Altman</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">eject most of its own members</a>, with an overhauled slate of directors <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowing</a> to review the crisis and enact structural changes to win back the trust of stakeholders.</p><p>Access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy could show what power the new board really has over Altman and his outside pursuits, which include personal investments in numerous startups pursuing AI projects and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-ceo-altman-says-davos-future-ai-depends-energy-breakthrough-2024-01-16/">a nuclear reactor maker</a>. His day job and personal projects intermingling played some role in board members’ distrust, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it. In 2019, while Altman was at the helm, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-buy-ai-chips-startup-sam-altman/">OpenAI signed a nonbinding letter of intent</a> to buy $51 million of AI chips from Rain, a startup in which he has invested more than $1 million, WIRED reported last month. OpenAI hasn’t moved forward with a purchase. Felix says Altman is transparent with the board about his investments and follows a process for managing potential conflicts.</p><p>Some sunlight on OpenAI’s governing documents could reveal whether it has made revisions to stabilize an unusual corporate structure and potentially pacify backers such as Microsoft. The company’s founding bylaws, <a href="https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y">publicly available</a> via its 2016 application to the Internal Revenue Service for <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tax-exempt status</a>, indicate how a fraction of the board could take control and push out Altman. OpenAI’s filings to the IRS through 2022 reported that no “significant changes” had ever been made to its governing documents. But the company almost certainly made updates after Altman’s return to allow it to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">give a nonvoting seat</a> on the nonprofit board to Microsoft, whose CEO, Satya Nadella, complained publicly that he had been blindsided by Altman’s firing. Any additional changes made at that time remain a secret.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>WIRED’s request for the documents promised in OpenAI’s IRS filings fell to the counsel for its nonprofit to decide on. Their denial and new policy of withholding those documents extends an existing trend of dwindling openness at a project founded on transparency. OpenAI once published extensive detail about its AI inventions but has more recently guarded the technical details and data behind its most famous tool, ChatGPT. Felix, the company spokesperson, says San Francisco-based OpenAI discloses all the material required by the IRS and California’s attorney general and that it regularly publishes information about <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its research and safety work</a>, while also making its research freely available in the form of tools such as ChatGPT.</p><p>OpenAI’s declining openness has been most notable since 2019, when the nonprofit <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/">created a for-profit subsidiary</a> to house most of its AI development and draw outside investment. That opened the way for OpenAI to hitch its future to the largesse of Microsoft, one of the tech giants it was founded to challenge, and also to shroud its finances. OpenAI cofounder turned <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-elon-musks-xai-chatgpt-hallucinating/">competitor</a> Elon Musk <a data-offer-url="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37&quot;}" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said at a <em>New York Times</em> event in November</a> that his former company should be called Super-Closed-Source-for-Maxiumum-Profit-AI.</p><p>Closely Held</p><p>OpenAI’s original nonprofit organization—and its board—retain ultimate control of OpenAI’s activities and technology. Like all US nonprofits, it must publicly share upon request a copy of its annual report to the IRS and indicate in those submissions whether any additional documents like its bylaws or similar or related documents such as a governing constitution or conflict of interest policy were also available to the public during the last year.</p><p>Some notable nonprofits do that, like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which publishes its <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bylaws</a> and rules <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on conflicts</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">workplace relationships</a>, but it’s not standard practice.</p><p>“It is not common for organizations to make their governing documents or internal policies public,” says Rick Cohen, chief operating and communications officer for <a data-offer-url="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/&quot;}" href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Council of Nonprofits</a>, an advocacy group.</p><p>Yet for seven consecutive years, from its founding through 2022, OpenAI stated in its <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541">annual IRS filings</a> that it made those submissions as well as other files available “upon request.” It’s unclear if anyone ever took OpenAI up on the invitation in the years through 2022—OpenAI won’t say.</p><p>Last month, after two days of waiting on OpenAI communications staff to fulfill an emailed request for its governing documents, conflict rules, and financial statements, WIRED rang the doorbell outside OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters on December 14 asking to see all those documents. A receptionist said over an intercom that wouldn’t be possible, hung up, and didn’t reengage. OpenAI’s IRS filing for 2023 that would reflect it has changed its previous policy isn’t due until later this year.</p><p>To <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">encourage oversight</a> of nonprofits, <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US tax law requires</a> them to at least make their annual reports to the IRS, form 990s, available for public inspection <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at their offices the same day they were requested</a> if they are not posted on an organization’s website.

That’s accurate for the nonprofit, but OpenAI overall reportedly generated <a data-offer-url="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama&quot;}" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of dollars in sales last year</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt&quot;}" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spends even more</a> on high-end computers and top-flight researchers.</p><p>Investors in OpenAI’s for-profit arm and employees of the company likely have access to some of the records the company now declines to share publicly, though they are bound by nondisclosure agreements covering internal files. Because OpenAI’s nonprofit takes in virtually no public support, it lacks the incentive that some nonprofits have to be more transparent so as to loosen the purse strings of donor or grant makers.</p><p>OpenAI might win more loyalty from its customers or trust from regulators by opening up, but Altman has said the company didn’t lose any clients during its two weeks of high drama and generally has been greeted warmly by political leaders. The company may feel that the ongoing board review into OpenAI’s governance and what is shared from its findings will be enough.</p><p>Without a reversal in OpenAI’s policy and a follow-through on its promises, so much about an increasingly influential organization may never become publicly known, like whether the new board amends the conflict-of-interest policy to better wrangle Altman and other executives. Back in 2022, it may have been possible to get the answer with just the ring of a doorbell.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In November 2022, we set ourselves a challenge: make a real-time animation that looks like a standard short animated movie, with the constraint that it should fit in 8 kilobytes. The goal was to have decent graphics, animations, direction and camera work, and the matching music… Yes, 8 kilobytes, less than half of this post, for everything. It wasn’t clear how much was actually feasible, so we had to try it.</p>



<p>In April 2023, after months of work, we finally released <a href="https://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/the-sheep-and-the-flower/">The Sheep and the Flower</a>. You can run it by yourself (<a href="https://aduprat.com/pub/The_Sheep_and_the_Flower.zip">download link</a>), or see a YouTube capture of the program running:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Sheep and the Flower - Razor 1911 &amp; Ctrl-Alt-Test (8kB demo)" width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dNqYrP3QHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Many people asked how we were able to create something like this. This article will explain the technical details and design constraints behind this production. We’ve also made the <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton">source code public on GitHub</a>.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>The result is a Windows executable file. It’s a single .exe file that generates everything. It requires no resource file, no external depency, except for Windows and up-to-date drivers. </p>



<p>Here’s the quick summary of what we used. We’ll explain the details in the rest of the post.</p>



<ul>
<li>All the visuals are computed in real-time on the GPU, using GLSL shaders. This includes the timeline information, camera setup, etc.</li>



<li>The rendering is done with raymarching.</li>



<li>The shaders are minified using my own tool, <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/shader_Minifier">Shader Minifier</a>.</li>



<li>The music was composed using <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang">4klang</a> synthesizer, which generates an assembly file able to replay the music. The instruments are described procedurally, while the list of notes is simply compressed.</li>



<li>The code was written in C++ using Visual Studio 2022.</li>



<li>To get started with the compiler flags and initialization, we used the <a href="https://github.com/armak/Leviathan-2.0/">Leviathan</a> framework.</li>



<li>The final output was compressed using <a href="https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler">Crinkler</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Genesis</h2>



<p>One day, I saw a message from a former colleague, who shared a video he made a long time ago, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khWXdkryBE4">Capoda</a>. I immediately loved the concept. The content is simple, yet it manages to tell a story efficiently.</p>



<p>I shared the link with some friends and thought it could be a good example of a story suitable for size coding. I was about to add this concept to the list of cool things I’ll probably never do, when Anatole replied:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Looks like a perfect fit for 8kb ! Will you do it? I have always dreamed of making a prod like this, but I’m waiting for the “good and original idea”.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was excited by the project because I wanted to do more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demos</a> with story-telling and animations. At the same time, I was intrigued by the challenges of making something in 8kB: I usually <a href="https://64k-scene.github.io/">target 64kB</a>, which is a completely different world, with a different set of rules and challenges. For the music, I knew I could count on my old friend CyborgJeff. Anatole had a lot of experience with 4kB. With him, the project was much more likely to be successful. And that’s how we started working together. I was not certain it would be feasible to fit everything in 8kB, but there’s only one way to know, right?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Why specifically 8kB? In the demoscene, there are multiple size categories, with 4kB and 64kB being very common. I’ve always enjoyed the techniques used in 4kB intros (an intro is a demo with a tight size limitation), but it always feels too limited for proper storytelling. Revision, the biggest demoparty in the world, added an 8kB competition a few years ago, so it was a good opportunity to try it.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Rendering Worlds with Two Triangles</h2>



<p>People familiar with the demoscene already know it, as this is <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/nvscene2008/rwwtt.pdf">a standard approach</a> since 2008: we draw a rectangle (so, two triangles) to cover the full screen. Then, we run a GPU program (called a shader) on the rectangle using the GLSL language. The program will compute a color for each pixel and each frame. All we need is a function that takes coordinates (and time) as input, and returns a color. Simple, right?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iQtWmNMHz0rgSV0z-HMtrOHo8vhG1GKz_DNnKAgqdyFf3p2rLQfUQC4YmTBGTAapBcxCEJ7l7-KBbYvWcjh7gsS5Z0aXvR_OOF1r9QJIAoWg5kIZe0gj67bBcwTkx2z4P7Li3ulRo6pe8Y0yOPNgGUc" alt=""><figcaption><br>“Please draw me a sheep!” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, the big question is: how do we write a function that draws a sheep?</p>



<p>Let’s split the problem in two parts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Represent the scene as a signed distance field.</li>



<li>Use raymarching to convert the distance fields into pixels.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Signed Distance Fields (SDF)</h3>



<p>A distance field is a function that computes the distance between a point in space to the nearest object. For every point in space, we want to know how far the point is to the object. If a point is one the object’s surface, the function should return 0. This is a “signed” function, meaning that it will return a negative number for points inside the object.</p>



<p>In the most basic cases, the function is simple to write. For example, the distance between a point and a sphere is trivial to compute. For a cube, you can also do it in a couple of lines (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-pRVZuS5c">The SDF of a Box</a> for explanations). Lots of other building blocks have been documented. Inigo Quilez has a <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/">nice collection of simple reusable shapes</a> and the Mercury demo group also <a href="https://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/">provides a great library</a>.</p>



<p>The true power of distance fields emerges when you combine them. To get the union of two objects, you can simply pick the minimum of the two distances, while the maximum gives the intersection. When crafting organic shapes, mathematical unions may appear coarse, but alternative formulas like the <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/">smooth unions</a> can create more organic looks.</p>



<p>Once you have a toolset with building blocks, it feels like playing with legos to create an object or a scene. Thus we made our sheep by assembling simple shapes (for example a cone, a sphere) and merging them, while the body and wool consist of a 3D noise function.</p>



<p>The next task will be to actually render the distance function to the screen.</p>



<h3>Raymarching</h3>



<p>To draw the 3D scene on the screen, we use raymarching. Raymarching is a rendering technique that leverages SDFs to trace rays through a 3D scene. Unlike traditional ray tracing, which mathematically computes the intersection point, raymarching works by marching along the ray’s path. The SDF tells us how far we can walk without colliding with the scene. We can then move the ray origin and compute the new distance. We repeat the operation until the distance is 0 (or close to it).</p>



<p>In the image below, imagine that the ray origin is the camera. It is looking in a certain direction. After multiple iterations, we find the intersection point with the right wall.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iaS66-fRMghoTXo-4spMNYhZl4iXq8mtt1lnNlSojpy_Ut-KCLIEZd5tiMBcBU7yp5ySH47Z_HJhJ2rH9N8sR8fydb43aa5J0hSrPVNZCLCjL0kqQoTZydu3ovgq91QbNtUS8FnGCjUfIt7Usfn1QKU" alt=""><figcaption>For more information, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#Sphere_tracing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#Sphere_tracing</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once we have the intersection point, we know if the current pixel should be a part of the sheep, the sky, or any other object. For the lighting, we need to know at least the surface normal, which we can <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/normalsSDF/">estimate by computing the gradient in the same area</a>. To compute shadows, we can send another ray for the point to the sun and find if an object is in between. Many techniques exist to improve the rendering quality beyond this basic idea.</p>



<p>To better understand the technical details, the tutorial “<a href="https://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/">Ray Marching and Signed Distance Functions</a>” is a good start. If you have more time, the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pdSjBPH3zM">Live Coding “Greek Temple”</a> is a wonderful in-depth example with detailed explanations.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5a2r0IZxVgs4yLDfSoqmE56uIf0RIKD9Zubweu_PCWaPBgF9JdfopuYMYhhvUI1F6M0Weorsh42mnRF_GdDPTD3qqwLdN0wbJN6pAtC8Maj94oLBbS9u4e6wj-Xgn8ggP5PkAn20MuPIwctLyggvIZs" alt=""><figcaption>Early rendering</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Direction</h2>



<p>Imagine that you have to tell a story, but there is only one character, with no voice or written text, and that character is barely animated. It can only walk (but not turn!), move the head and the eyes. With only this, how would you tell a story and convey emotions?</p>



<p>When creating a demo with such a small size limit, it’s critical to know what is important. We avoided anything that didn’t serve that story. For example, we originally imagined the sheep walking in a desert. It wouldn’t be hard to generate dunes and a sky, but the story didn’t actually need it. We decided to keep the pure white background. We also skipped the textures, except for a few that convey a meaning (like the signs and the eyes).</p>



<p>Keeping the scope of the work relatively small allowed us to focus on things that might not be obvious at first: the details and the polish, the camera work, the editing, and the synchronization. Each shot was manually crafted, each animation was adjusted and went through many iterations to make sure the flow feels right. Not only did we need to make sure the flow felt right (adjusting the length of the shots and the sequencing), but it had to match the music.</p>



<p>To ensure that the narrative resonates with the audience, we employed a number of storytelling techniques, often with redundancy for emphasis. For example, to show the sheep’s excitement, we used cartoonish 2D effects, accelerated the walking pace, accentuated tail movements, exaggerated head swings, and added a dramatic shift in the music. This approach allowed us to convey a spectrum of emotions throughout the story.</p>



<p>The camera itself is also a storytelling tool. We used a wide shot to evoke a sense of solitude when the sheep wanders for hours; an extreme closeup on its eyes to capture the moment of realization when it notices the sign; and a slow zoom on the head to intensify the focus when the sheep stares at a sign.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_jompACpAOizuHB2jEm7xIxqBx42TzshyggyYVHMv-lh4uqNDRZfsCcXcbmHyrqVP2md7scB-HLOwym-TZUJ2BpPwiqf4gKo3eDsF5ZGa2C2Kbvcu5LYkYk8MJakX8Ln2S92EaDHSco7EoBKbF0frxo" alt=""><figcaption>A 2D animated background was used to communicate the appeal of the flower.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>Development process</h2>



<p>You may notice that the source code contains a large number of hard-coded constants. The challenge was to determine these values — how large should the sheep’s eyes be? How fast should the camera move? How long should each shot last? What colors should the flower have?</p>



<p>Given this uncertainty, each constant went through numerous iterations. To iterate quickly and have a short feedback loop, shaders come in handy: we recompile them at runtime to update the graphics within a second.</p>



<p>The other requirement was to have a player: something that allows us to control the time with pause and replay commands. This proved to be invaluable when working on animations and camera control, as we could see the result instantly after a live-reload of the shader. Additionally, music support was a must, so that we can perfectly synchronize the animations to the music.<br>We designed our early prototypes in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>, but we later transitioned to <a href="https://hexler.net/kodelife">KodeLife</a>, and finally moved the code to our own project (in C++, using a small framework called <a href="https://github.com/armak/Leviathan-2.0/">Leviathan</a>).</p>



<h2>Music</h2>



<p>Music is a critical component for storytelling. To fit the story, the music needed multiple parts, with different moods and transitions at specific points in time. We decided to use the same tools as we would in a 4kB intro, while allocating more space to allow a more intricate composition.</p>



<p>To compose the music, I asked my Cyborgjeff, a friend familiar with demoscene techniques, whose musical style resonated with our vision. His tool of choice was the <a href="https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang">4klang synthesizer</a>, an impressive piece of software developed by Gopher. 4klang comes with a plugin usable from any music software and it has an export button that generates an assembly file. This file is then compiled and linked with the demo. When the demo runs, the synth will run in a separate thread, procedurally generate the wave sound, and send it to the soundcard.</p>



<p>Creating a small music comes with a lot of constraints. The first version of the music was bigger than expected. Imagine telling a musician “Your music is too big, can you reduce it by 500 bytes?” Well, that’s just normal in the demoscene.</p>



<p>We studied the output of 4klang to understand how it packs the data. With advice from Gopher, Cyborgjeff was able to iterate on the music to make it smaller. We made multiple adjustments:</p>



<ul>
<li>The number of instruments was reduced from 16 to 13.</li>



<li>The ending theme was recomposed to align with the tempo of the overall music.</li>



<li>The composition used more repetitions so it compresses better. For example, adjusting the length of a note in the background may be imperceptible to the ear while improving the compression ratio.</li>
</ul>



<p>This allowed us to save some space on the music, while keeping its overall structure, with a minimal loss in terms of quality. For more information on the music, Cyborgjeff wrote a blog post: <a href="https://www.studio-quena.be/cyborgjeff/blog/2023/04/11/8000-octets-un-mouton-et-une-fleur/">8000 octets, un mouton et une fleur</a>.</p>



<h2>Animation &amp; Synchronization</h2>



<p>Everything in the demo is re-evaluated at each frame as nothing is precomputed or cached. While this is really bad for the performance, this is a blessing for animations: anything can depend on the time and vary through the demo.</p>



<p>The demo consists of around 25 manually crafted camera shots. When creating a shot, we describe how each of <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.vert#L5-L22">18 parameters</a> varies over time, such as the position of each object, the state of the sheep, the position of the camera, the focal, what the camera is looking at, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a single line of code describes the camera during the shot:</p>



<pre><code>camPos = vec3(22., 2., time*0.6-10.);</code></pre>



<p>And we get a linear translation. Here “time” represents the time since the beginning of the shot so that we can easily insert, remove or adjust a shot without affecting the rest of the demo. Absolute times are avoided for code maintenance.</p>



<p>A note of caution on linear interpolations: while functional, they often look poor or robotic. In many cases, we apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">smoothstep</a> function, which leads to a smoother, more natural animation. Smoothstep is an S-shaped smooth interpolation that helps avoid sharp edges and sudden movement changes.<br>The code for the timeline is <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.vert#L53">in the vertex shader</a>. You may notice that each shot is defined in a similar way, and the code may seem redundant. It’s not a problem, as redundancy leads to better compression.</p>



<h2>Textures &amp; Materials</h2>



<p>In a traditional renderer, textures are 2D images that are applied on a 3D model. One difficulty with the textures is how to compute the texture coordinates and map each pixel in the texture to the 3D surface. With our raymarching approach, we can’t easily compute texture coordinates. Instead, we compute on the fly 3D textures. Once the raymarcher finds the 3D position of the point to render, we pass the 3D coordinates to the corresponding texture function.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the traffic signs. They use some math to compute a triangle or a square to serve as a border, then the inner content of the sign is achieved by <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.frag#L624">combining multiple functions</a>. For example, the restaurant symbol is created with 4 black oval-like shapes, and 2 white shapes are added to create the dents.</p>



<p>To make the visuals more interesting, we wanted to have not just textures, but also different materials. Parameters of the lighting equation depend on the material. For example, the sheep hooves have a different reflection (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">fresnel coefficients</a>).</p>






<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6OnCIvQ8M6ONMZRRomTCB2pSDJnxt9zeO4Is3oXyVNMuulGoQUQ7KKMT6B-xTnMDDgh0zv93Avi9IhlRMkND7tu91mTol28XbK9AXt2N3c7Kqo4JxCfbtHWPGmM5cSmBSGQsu2__9o1NyCcwVcOQfHA" alt=""></figure></div>


<h2>Eyes</h2>



<p>For a long time during the development, the eyes looked dull and lifeless. I believe eyes are a big part of the character design. This was one of the first things that we animated, and it was very important as a tool for story-telling. Eyes help show feelings and they enable many transitions.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QGyZLSEmC5EVpGPhOyH1W17dZBkbGqI106q_RYkEOPZsIEhp3IuSI5k1ILwOUqzjx68DswWkgaFM3geC_fsQpluilmWmGbYIGi_vfHYPsKdR8wNKBZY-2sY6ERgVMfNR6cYT83w2pxdLGqDK6EX-yDc" alt=""><figcaption>Early rendering</figcaption></figure>



<p>After searching for reference images on the Internet, I found that most of the cartoon characters have an iris, but the iris doesn’t seem to be strictly required.&nbsp; I’ve also noticed that the pupil is always big. If there’s an iris, the pupil will be big compared to the iris.</p>



<p>But the important part to get sparkling eyes is to have some reflections of the light in the eyes. With the standard lighting equations we used, we couldn’t get a reflection (unless the sun and the camera were at very specific positions). An input of the lighting equations is the normal vector of the surface. Our trick was to modify the vector to increase the probability of getting some reflections from the sun.</p>



<p>On top of that, we created an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping">environment mapping</a>. This technique is commonly used in video games: instead of computing perfect reflections in the scene in real time, we can look up in a texture (that simulates the environment). Usually, people use environment mapping to optimize the code as the texture can be a simplification of the real environment. We did the opposite: our environment world is actually a perfect white, but we used a texture to fake and add details.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/beQPbrggllClDp6K168goj9fwyz_WQKed1Gc2cZBWC1lZfNCPj904WZ1xrMRg2BZayoZIGDGdrOD63gcfuci6c-nNATQ-wIiS4VdyD5dmbJkF-CQy_6gc4JMIPpdBmpdyzW_QD8UK2Au0YzKdnOH8Hk" alt=""><figcaption>Final result</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reflections in the eyes (both the white and the pupils) are much more complex than they should be in an empty world. There are multiple fake sources of lights, as well as a gradient (to mimic a darker ground and a blue-ish sky).</p>



<h2>Post-processing</h2>



<p>Once everything is done, the final visual touch defining the mood is the post-processing.</p>



<p>Despite being subtle, it helps have a good image quality and set the tone for the story.&nbsp; We used:</p>



<ul>
<li>color grading;</li>



<li>gamma correction;</li>



<li>a bit of vignetting;</li>



<li>finally, a two-pass FXAA filter to avoid aliasing (but you won’t notice it if you only watched the YouTube capture)</li>
</ul>



<p>We also implemented some of the effects in the post-processing step, such as the stars in the eyes or the ending screen effect. Those are made as pure 2D and don’t exist in the 3D world.</p>



<p>Finally, we experimented with other alternative styles. At some point, we tried to give an old-cartoon look, and we implemented contour detection to simulate a hand-drawn image, with a monochrome rendering, grain, and noise. The result looked like this:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l8g7w28ukmvnB9lO6UauAk76tzbtbgv_uwRjEiAouIcA4KDgwCeVYhTeVeAcsjSXK7FN6kJVtA7r3Ka7dPMJGeY3zB4Xvg4z1WGnPovluXJZ9D9iC1QLW5mp8DXywamC2zHaJv_T_RAnILcbDoFXRbg" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bG6HYJcungIAKm9LFHBNJCIYlCtGCL1zI2pOLX2Hfc7IP0mUOst90cRbXCZQABuAUXKyxZrpbSILNHwzMIaUoqXOGISLV-rafoX2SMHDrN0se6gCpouoR7JFuctXRo66zRr-LvK1nZP--NqESc9OKIQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>After discussions, we decided to give up on this experiment and focus on the cleaner, modern look.</p>



<h2>Compression</h2>



<p>So far, we’ve seen how we made most of the demo. The main idea is to avoid storing data, instead we use code to describe how to generate the data. For the music, we store a list of notes to play, as well as a list of instructions for each instrument. All of this is relatively small, but does it really fit in 8kB?</p>



<p>Part of the magic comes from <a href="https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler">Crinkler</a>, a compression tool specifically designed for the demoscene and intros between 1kB and 8kB. As the executable needs to be self-extractible, Crinkler includes some very small and clever assembly code that can decompress the rest of the executable. It’s optimized for size at the expense of other things: the compression algorithm takes a while, the decompression is relatively slow and uses a lot of RAM (hundreds of megabytes).</p>



<p>Crinkler is an impressive tool, but it doesn’t do everything. We have a total of <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/tree/main/Intro/src/shaders">42kB of shader source code</a> and we need one last ingredient to fit it in the binary.</p>



<h2>Minification</h2>



<p>As the shader source code is included in the final binary, we have to make it as small as possible. It would be possible to minify the code by hand, but then it would cause maintenance issues. It was critical for the success of our project to be able to iterate quickly, without worrying about low-level size optimizations. So we needed a tool to minify the shader.</p>



<p>I have written such a tool, <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier/">Shader Minifier</a>, which has been a side project of mine since 2011. It removes unneeded spaces and comments, it renames variables and can do more. It has been the most popular shader minification tool in the demoscene for many years, but this was not sufficient for us: an 8kB intro contains much more code than a 4kB does, and new problems arise from the larger code size.</p>



<p>I stopped working on the demo for one month to implement all the missing features we needed from Shader Minifier. While it’s easy to write a simple minifier, you need to write a compiler if you want to get good minification — a source-to-source compiler, similar to what Closure Compiler does.</p>



<p>The full <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier/?tab=readme-ov-file#transformations">list of transformations</a> supported by Shader Minifier is getting quite long, but here are a few:</p>



<ul>
<li>Renaming of variables and functions</li>



<li>Inlining of variables</li>



<li>Evaluation of constant arithmetic</li>



<li>Inlining of functions</li>



<li>Dead code elimination</li>



<li>Merging of declarations</li>
</ul>



<p>These transformations reduce the size of the output, but it’s not enough. We need to make sure that the output is compression-friendly. This is a hard problem: it can happen that a transformation reduces the size of the code, while increasing the size of the compressed code. So we constantly need to monitor the compressed size, as we iterate on the demo.</p>



<p>New improvements to Shader Minifier have saved around 600 bytes on the compressed binary. To help review and monitor what exactly goes in the final binary, we store <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/shaders.inl">the minified output</a> in the repository. This proved useful to identify new optimization opportunities. At the end, once minified and compressed, the 42kB of shader code fits in about 5kB, which gives just enough space for the music and the C++ code.</p>



<p>Anyway… you could say that I had to write a compiler in order to make this demo. :)</p>



<h2>The War Between the Sheep and the Flowers</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? […] Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he’d doing – that isn’t important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that’s enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself ‘My flower’s up there somewhere…’ But <strong>if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it’s as if, suddenly, all the stars went out</strong>. And that isn’t important?”</p>



<p>— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As you’ve seen, there are lots of advanced and fascinating techniques needed to make this kind of demo. But we didn’t invent everything. We’re building on top of what other people did. The amount of work and research that was done by other people is incredible, from the raymarching techniques, to the music generation software and the compression algorithms. Hopefully the new features added to Shader Minifier will help other people create better demos in the future. The 8kB category is fun and offers more possibilities than the 4kB category; let’s hope it will become more popular.</p>



<p>P.S. For comparison, the text of this article contains around 21,000 characters, so it would take 21kB.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-is-now-open-source/open-source-F1.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>We're excited to announce that Zed is now an open source project. The code for Zed itself will be made available under a copyleft license to ensure any improvements will benefit the entire community (GPL for the editor, AGPL for server-side components). GPUI, the UI framework that powers Zed, will be distributed under the Apache 2 license, so that you can use it to build high-performance desktop applications and distribute them under any license you choose.</p>
<h2 id="motivations"><span data-br=":Rlquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Motivations</span></h2>
<p>Why are we doing this? Most importantly, we believe that making Zed open source will make it the best product. Our mission is to build the world's most advanced code editor and get it into the hands of millions of developers. There's a ton of surface area on that problem, and we'll need all the help we can get. Considering that all of Zed's users are programmers, it makes the most sense sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent.</p>
<p>On a more selfish level, we also think going open source will be a lot more fun. One of our favorite aspects of software is connecting with people. We're not only proud of <em>what</em> we've built, but also of <em>how</em> we've built it. We want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you, and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-fireside-hacks"><span data-br=":R1dquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Introducing <em>Fireside Hacks</em></span></h2>
<p>Motivated by our desire to connect with you all on a human level, we're launching a new Zed feature called Zed Channels, which will make it easy for developers anywhere in the world to write code together in real time just by sharing a link.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, we'll be using Channels to run a new program called <em>Fireside Hacks</em>, in which we'll be streaming into a public channel regularly we work on Zed live with whoever shows up. We'll be experimenting with different formats, but we're hoping these regular sessions give us all an opportunity to get to know each other better, beyond what's possible in a static pull request. Come join the experiment to ask questions, make suggestions, and code with us in real time. We're looking forward to meeting you!</p>
<h2 id="wait-doesnt-cash-rule-everything-around-me"><span data-br=":R25quuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Wait... Doesn't Cash Rule Everything Around Me?</span></h2>
<p>We strongly believe that the best way to build and maintain the world's best editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model. It's the only way we can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead development. Some may wonder whether making Zed open source undermines this objective. We've thought about this a lot, and we don't think that openness is at odds with commercial success.</p>
<p>Rather than selling you a proprietary editor, we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your editor to make you and your team more productive. Zed Channels is one example of such a service. It's free for anyone today, but we intend to begin charging for private use after a beta period of experimentation. Providing server-side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme we're seeing getting traction.</p>
<p>Today, we're open sourcing 100% of the code we've written so far. In the future, however, we may still offer proprietary products targeting commercial and enterprise use cases, though we always intend for proprietary code to be a tiny fraction compared to the code we open source. We also intend to ensure our need to generate revenue never interferes with your need to write software. We're never going to show you a banner ad in your code editor, and if we do, you can always build Zed from source.</p>
<p>We believe in the principle of creating more value than we capture. Going open source is a bet that if we can build a huge movement around Zed, our company will find opportunities to capture some of the value we create.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-10"><span data-br=":R3dquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">The Road to 1.0</span></h2>
<p>So what's next? To some extent, that's up to you! But it's also true that we're still a small team. We want to massively grow adoption in 2024 so that more developers can benefit from Zed, and we've put together a public roadmap based on user feedback that we think can help us get there. If your contributions help us make progress toward completing that roadmap, especially items near the top, we'll be more likely to make time for them.</p>
<p>That said, we're going to figure this out as we go, and we welcome anyone who is excited to contribute and learn. If you'd like to get involved, check out our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guide</a>, and come say hello at an upcoming Fireside Hack if you have the time. Developers everywhere need a better code editor, and we're excited for you to join us on our mission to advance the state of the art. See you in the codebase!</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The wait is over: we finally have data to back up the benefits of developer experience (DevEx).</p>
<p>We’ve always known that providing a good DevEx is a smart business move, as it enables developers to solve complex tasks, collaborate with peers, and unleash their creativity. We hear this from customers all the time.</p>
<p>But despite the benefits, DevEx conversations usually end when execs ask for hard data on what their business will gain by improving it. While we have anecdotal evidence, we haven’t had the data to satisfy this question—until now. New research we just published uses statistical analysis to pinpoint how key DevEx factors—<a href="https://github.blog/2024-01-22-how-to-get-in-the-flow-while-coding-and-why-its-important">flow state</a>, cognitive load, and feedback loops—impact individual, team, and organizational outcomes by improving productivity and innovation.</p>
<p>To conduct this research, we partnered with <a href="https://getdx.com/">DX</a>, which helps teams measure developer experience, to leverage their insights and expertise. Using work design theory, we created a set of research hypotheses, developed questions, and surveyed more than 20 industry-diverse companies. We ran rigorous statistical analyses to see which measures were validated and significant. We also documented our survey questions so others could reuse our work and provided step-by-step guidance on advocating for DevEx and measuring the results.</p>
<p>The result is the following body of evidence-based outcomes and advice—detailed in the summary below and a new report—that business leaders everywhere can use to make the case for investing in DevEx.</p>

<h2 id="boosting-flow-state">Boosting flow state<a href="#boosting-flow-state" aria-label="Boosting flow state"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3639443">research</a> is clear: <strong>developers who carve out significant time for deep work enjoy a 50% productivity boost</strong>. Minimizing distractions, which can be everything from Slack messages to meetings to peers asking for help is paramount for high-value work. Granted, it’s not always easy to reserve blocks of time, especially in distributed teams across multiple time zones. However, providing your developers an atmosphere where they can maximize their flow state can pay high dividends.</p>
<p>“To optimize building code, you need the right environment,” says Dr. Eirini Kalliamvakou, staff researcher at GitHub and co-author of the study. “Implementing practices that enable your developers to enter and stay in the flow is a winning move.”</p>
<p>Adobe is an example of a company that recognizes the value of providing an effective working environment for developers. CJ Dotson, senior PM of developer productivity at Adobe, notes that “when technology is what you sell, investments in DevEx are not optional. Adobe’s investment in DevEx leads to higher developer satisfaction and better business outcomes.”</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>developers who find their work engaging feel 30% more productive</strong>, according to the DevEx study. This stat should help your organization rethink the distribution of tasks. Do you have the same developers working on less desirable projects that could lead to burnout? Are your teams regularly engaging in tasks they find boring or divorced from the company’s mission? If you want to optimize their work, ensure that your teams are excited about the projects on their plate, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>“Providing deep work and exciting, engaging projects are some of the biggest things companies can do to improve productivity,” says Dr. Nicole Forsgren, partner researcher at Microsoft and co-author of the study.</p>
<h2 id="reducing-cognitive-load">Reducing cognitive load<a href="#reducing-cognitive-load" aria-label="Reducing cognitive load"></a></h2>
<p>It’s a familiar pattern: <strong>developers who report a high degree of understanding of their code feel 42% more productive than those with low or no understanding</strong>. Low understanding can come from various factors, including poor or outdated documentation, lack of onboarding, or the sheer pace of innovation with AI.</p>
<p>“Every developer has experienced the frustration of not understanding their code or its surrounding context well,” Forsgren says. “Because so much of our code is interconnected and developed by multiple people, understandability is part of why having a good DevEx is so important.”</p>
<p>Kalliamvakou also notes that this is where good tooling comes in: “Certain technologies like <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> can help developers better understand their code and future-proof their productivity.”</p>
<p>Additionally, it should be no surprise that intuitive, easy processes can boost innovation, while cumbersome processes can sink time and create frustration. <strong>Our research shows that developers who have intuitive processes feel they are 50% more innovative.</strong></p>
<p>“And it’s not always about the technology,” Forsgren adds. “If you can find ways to remove friction and blockers for developers, you’ll unlock so many things.”</p>
<p>Dermot Russell, director of engineering at Etsy, agrees: “Etsy’s enablement initiatives have improved developers’ day-to-day experience while also enabling rapid software delivery as our organization has grown.”</p>
<h2 id="improving-feedback-loops">Improving feedback loops<a href="#improving-feedback-loops" aria-label="Improving feedback loops"></a></h2>
<p>In the world of development, efficient feedback loops are critical. According to the research, <strong>developers who report fast code turnaround times feel 20% more innovative than developers who don’t.</strong> “Getting fast feedback allows you to move along quickly while maintaining your curiosity and drive,” Kalliamvakou says. “It allows developers to stay in the flow and create the next great thing.”</p>
<p>Focusing on improving feedback loops can benefit the organization’s overall effectiveness and developer satisfaction. For example, UKG’s VP of developer acceleration, Thomas Newton, says, “it’s a virtuous cycle: by reducing friction and waste from developers’ daily work, developers are able to ship high-quality software faster, while also improving happiness and engagement.”</p>
<p>There’s another benefit to quick feedback loops: <strong>teams that provide faster responses to developers’ questions report 50% less technical debt.</strong> In other words, good documentation pays off. Documenting common developer questions and putting tooling in place that enables them to easily find the responses they need, allows developers to increase their agility.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, nimble developers beget nimble teams and organizations.</p>
<p>“So often, if you’re a developer, you have to wait for feedback,” Forsgren adds. “You get interrupted. You’re constantly stalled. You have to figure out a cumbersome process. But if, instead, you can collaborate quickly, have no interruptions, use intuitive technologies, and stay in the flow—that’s when you can problem-solve, be creative, and get work done, which will benefit the team and entire organization.”</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward">The path forward<a href="#the-path-forward" aria-label="The path forward"></a></h2>
<p>Software creation is critical for innovation. Across all industries, companies need to build and maintain high-quality software to meet their goals. As such, investing in DevEx is a must.</p>
<p>“If you’re a business leader who’s focused on being profitable and innovative, enabling a good DevEx is one of the key levers at your disposal,” Kalliamvakou says. “The research we published finally gives us the solid data and evidence we need to make the case to the larger community.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer.html">https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39118349">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>I love raytracers; in fact I’ve written <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/02-basic-raytracing.html">half a book</a> about them. Probably less known is my love for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, the 1982 home computer I grew up with, and which started my interest in graphics and programming. This machine is so ridiculously underpowered for today’s standards (and even for 1980s standards), the inevitable question is, to what extent could I port the Computer Graphics from Scratch raytracer to a ZX Spectrum?</p>
<p>The ZX Spectrum has a 3.5 MHz Z80 processor (1,000 times slower than current computers) that can’t multiply numbers (!!!), 48 KB of RAM (1,000,000 times smaller), and a 256x176 graphics mode (~200 times lower resolution) capable of displaying 15 colors (1,000,000 times fewer – and with some unusual quirks). This is an interesting setup for a CPU-intensive graphics application!</p>
<p>My plan was to implement this in Sinclair BASIC, the built-in programming language of the Spectrum. This is not just BASIC, but an ancient, very limited dialect of BASIC. For example, the only control structures are <code>FOR</code> and <code>IF</code> (and <code>IF</code> has no <code>ENDIF</code>); all variables are global; there are no function calls, only <code>GO TO</code> and <code>GO SUB</code>; etc. It’s also interpreted, so super slow. But at least it implements multiplications in software! I could always rewrite the raytracer in assembler if I cared about performance.</p>
<p>I set up a minimal environment: I write BASIC code using VS Code, compile it using <a href="https://github.com/speccyorg/bas2tap">BAS2TAP</a>, and run it on the <a href="https://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/">FUSE emulator</a>. This gave me a pretty decent iteration speed.</p>
<p>As an aside, I hadn’t written BASIC in something like 30 years, and I was surprised at how quickly it all came back. I was between 4 and 10 when I was doing this, so I guess it sticks in the brain like anything you learn at that age, like languages and accents. Now let’s get coding like it’s 1984!</p>

<p>My first iteration was pretty straightforward: I ported the <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/02-basic-raytracing.html#rendering-our-first-spheres">starter CGFS raytracing code</a> to BASIC without much tweaking, outputting a 32x22-block image, and to my surprise, it worked well:</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-1.png"></p>
<p>The number in the upper left corner, 879.76, is the time it took to render this image, in seconds. Yes, that’s almost 15 minutes. Here’s the same scene rendered by the CGFS raytracer in about a second, using the same scene and feature set:</p>

<p>The structure of the code should look familiar if you’re familiar with raytracers in general, and with the CGFS raytracer in particular, despite being written in an ancient dialect of BASIC. I’ll still walk through the code to point out the quirks of the Spectrum.</p>
<p>First, line numbers. Every line had to have a number, so you could use <code>GO TO</code> or <code>GO SUB</code>. Lines supported multiple statements separated by a colon – especially useful for the <code>IF ... THEN</code> statement, considering there’s no <code>END IF</code>!</p>
<p>You’ll notice the line numbers are all over the place. The Spectrum BASIC editor was line-oriented, so while it was possible to change line numbers, it was very time-consuming. So you’d number your lines in multiples of 10, so you had “space” to add lines in between if needed.</p>
<p>We start with this:</p>
<pre>1 BRIGHT 1: CLS</pre>
<p>The Spectrum has a pretty quirky graphics mode. I’ll get into the details in the next section. For now, let’s just say that <code>BRIGHT 1</code> chooses the bright version of the color palette, and <code>CLS</code> clears the screen. So we’re ready to start drawing something.</p>
<p>Then comes the main loop of the rayrtacer:</p>
<pre>  5 LET ROX = 0
  6 LET ROY = 0
  7 LET ROZ = 0
  8 LET TMIN = 0
  9 LET TMAX = 10000

 10 FOR X = 0 TO 31
 20   FOR Y = 0 TO 21

 30     LET RDX = (X - 16) / 32
 31     LET RDY = (11 - Y) / 32
 32     LET RDZ = 1

 40     GO SUB 1000

 50     PAPER COL
 51     PRINT AT Y, X; " "

100   NEXT Y
105   GO SUB 3000: PRINT AT 0, 0; TIME
110 NEXT X

120 STOP</pre>
<p>Lines 5 to 9 set some of the parameters that are constant throughout the main loop. BASIC had arrays but they were pretty inconvenient to use, so using them to represent points and vectors was a non-starter. So the ray origin <code>RO</code> is represented by the three variables <code>ROX</code>, <code>ROY</code> and <code>ROZ</code>.</p>
<p>Lines 10 to 110 form the main loop, iterating over the canvas (32x22 squares). After each pass of the inner loop, rendering a column of squares, line 105 does the equivalent of a function call: <code>GO SUB 3000</code> transfers control flow to the <em>subroutine</em> at line 3000:</p>
<pre>3000 REM ===== Get timestamp in seconds =====
3001 LET TIME = (65536*PEEK 23674 + 256*PEEK 23673 + PEEK 23672) / 50
3002 RETURN</pre>
<p>Line 3000 starts with <code>REM</code>, short for “remark”. We call them “comments” these days, but the ZX Spectrum is British, the brainchild of mad genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Sinclair">Sir Clive Sinclair</a>. So this line is just a comment.</p>
<p>The magical incantation in line 3001 reads the current timestamp in seconds. How? <code>PEEK</code> takes a memory address and returns its contents. All this line does is read a 24-bit number stored in memory, representing the internal <code>FRAME</code> counter; this counter is incremented every 20ms, so we divide it by 50 to convert it to seconds, and store it in the variable <code>TIME</code>.</p>
<p>Every variable in the program is global, so <code>RETURN</code> in line 3002 just returns flow control to the caller, and the “return value” of the function is implicitly the <code>TIME</code> global variable. This <code>GO SUB</code> / <code>RETURN</code> mechanism is very similar to <code>CALL</code> / <code>RET</code> in assembly.</p>
<p>Finally, line 120 terminates the program.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the inner loop. Lines 30 to 32 convert canvas coordinates to viewport coordinates (<code>CanvasToViewport</code> in CGFS). The ray direction is represented by <code>(RDX, RDY, RDZ)</code>.</p>
<p>Line 40 does another “function call”, this time to the equivalent of <code>TraceRay</code>. When it returns, the variable <code>COL</code> will contain the color of whatever the ray hit.</p>
<p>Lines 50 and 51 finally draw the block. This is done by setting the <code>PAPER</code> (background) color and drawing a space (more on this later).</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at <code>TraceRay</code> starting at line 1000. It starts with a comment block documenting the implicit inputs and outputs:</p>
<pre>1000 REM ===== TraceRay =====
1001 REM Params: (ROX, ROY, ROZ): ray origin; (RDX, RDY, RDZ): ray direction; (TMIN, TMAX): wanted ranges of t
1002 REM Returns: COL: pixel color</pre>
<p>Because there are no function arguments or return values, everything is global, implicit, and by convention. In this case, the inputs are <code>(ROX, ROY, ROZ)</code>, <code>(RDX, RDY, RDZ)</code>, <code>TMIN</code> and <code>TMAX</code>, and the return value is in the variable <code>COL</code>. This represents an index into the fixed color palette of the ZX Spectrum.</p>
<p>Line 1010 initializes the values we need to keep track of the closest intersection found so far, and the color of the sphere at the intersection:</p>
<pre>1010 LET COL = -1: LET MINT = 0</pre>
<p>Then we start the “for each sphere” loop:</p>
<pre>1100 RESTORE 9000
1101 READ NS
1102 FOR S = 1 TO NS
1110    READ SCX, SCY, SCZ, SRAD, SCOL</pre>
<p>Line 1100 resets a “data pointer” to line 9000, which contains the scene data:</p>
<pre>8998 REM ===== Sphere data =====
8999 REM Sphere count, followed by (SCX, SCY, SCZ, SRAD, COLOR)
9000 DATA 4
9001 DATA  0, -1, 4, 1, 2
9002 DATA  2,  0, 4, 1, 1
9003 DATA -2,  0, 4, 1, 4
9004 DATA  0, -5001, 0, 5000, 6</pre>
<p>The <code>READ</code> statement in line 1101 reads the first value (the number 4 in line 9000) into the variable NS. Then line 1102 starts the “for each sphere” loop, and the first thing we do in line 1110 is read the 5 values defining a sphere into variables. After that first batch of <code>READ</code> statemends the data pointer is now at the first value of line 9002, ready to be read during the next iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>Lines 1200 to 1300 solve a straightforward <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/02-basic-raytracing.html#ray-meets-sphere">ray-sphere intersection equation</a>, with lines 1250 and 1300 keeping track of the closest intersection:</p>
<pre>1200    LET COX = ROX - SCX
1201    LET COY = ROY - SCY
1202    LET COZ = ROZ - SCZ

1210    LET EQA = RDX*RDX + RDY*RDY + RDZ*RDZ
1211    LET EQB = 2*(RDX*COX + RDY*COY + RDZ*COZ)
1212    LET EQC = (COX*COX + COY*COY + COZ*COZ) - SRAD*SRAD

1220    LET DISC = EQB*EQB - 4*EQA*EQC
1230    IF DISC &lt; 0 THEN GO TO 1500

1240    LET T1 = (-EQB + SQR(DISC)) / 2*EQA
1241    LET T2 = (-EQB - SQR(DISC)) / 2*EQA

1250    IF T1 &gt;= TMIN AND T1 &lt;= TMAX AND (T1 &lt; MINT OR COL = -1) THEN LET COL = SCOL: LET MINT = T1
1300    IF T2 &gt;= TMIN AND T2 &lt;= TMAX AND (T2 &lt; MINT OR COL = -1) THEN LET COL = SCOL: LET MINT = T2</pre>
<p>We finish the loop checking if there were no intersections, in which case we set the color to 0 (black), and return:</p>
<pre>1999 IF COL = -1 THEN LET COL = 0
2000 RETURN</pre>
<p>And that’s all there is to it. We get our super slow, super low-res output:</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-1.png"></p>
<p>I still find it pretty impressive that this only takes 50 lines of relatively straightforward code in an underpowered early 80s machine!</p>
<p>But this is just a start. Why stick to 32x22 when the usable pixel dimensions of the screen are 256x176?</p>
<h2 id="second-iteration-higher-resolution-and-handling-attribute-clashes"><a href="#second-iteration-higher-resolution-and-handling-attribute-clashes">Second iteration: higher resolution, and handling attribute clashes</a></h2>
<p>You might think that increasing the resolution of this raytracer is as simple as changing the outer loop to 256x176 instead of 32x22 and drawing individual pixels using <code>PLOT</code> instead of chunky squares using <code>PRINT</code>. This would be 64 times slower (16 hours instead of 15 minutes) but it would work – except in the quirky graphics mode of the ZX Spectrum!</p>
<p>The first version of the ZX Spectrum had a grand total of 16 KB of RAM, so memory efficiency was absolutely critical (I had the considerably more luxurious 48 KB model). To help save memory, video RAM was split in two blocks: a bitmap block, using one bit per pixel, and an attributes block, using one byte per 8x8 block of pixels. The attributes block would assign two colors to that block, called <code>INK</code> (foreground) and <code>PAPER</code> (background).</p>
<p>So you could use <code>PLOT</code> to set or clear the bit corresponding to a pixel, which would then take one of the two colors assigned to that block. <strong>This means each 8x8-pixel block can show one or two different colors, but never three or more</strong>.</p>
<p>This all worked great for text-based applications, since characters were also 8x8 blocks, but for anything graphic, especially games, it was super limiting. This limitation gives Spectrum games its very characteristic aesthetic, because artists had to work around this, usually by designing screens and sprites aligned to a 8x8 pixel grid, or going full monochrome, or accepting that attribute clash was a fact of life.</p>
<p>Back to the raytracer. Increasing the resolution is easy. Dealing with attribute clash, not so much.</p>
<p>There’s no perfect solution: no matter what I do, each 8x8 block can show up to two colors. So what I did was implement an approximation algorithm. I collect the colors present in the 8x8 block, find the most common and second most common, and draw every pixel using one of the two.</p>
<p>The outer loop changes a bit to reflect the higher resolution and the processing on 8x8-block chunks:</p>
<pre> 10 FOR X = 0 TO 255 STEP 8
 20   FOR Y = 0 TO 175 STEP 8

...

500   NEXT Y
505   GO SUB 3000: PRINT AT 0, 0; TIME
510 NEXT X
520 STOP</pre>
<p>Then we trace the 64 rays, collecting the colors in an array:</p>
<pre> 30      DIM C(64)
 31      LET CI = 1
 32      DIM A(8)

120     REM --- For each 8x8 block, collect the pixel colors and their counts ---
125     FOR U = X TO X+7
126       FOR V = Y TO Y+7

130         LET RDX = (U - 128) / 256
131         LET RDY = (V - 88) / 256
132         LET RDZ = 1

140         GO SUB 1000
141         LET C(CI) = COL
142         LET CI = CI + 1
143         LET A(COL+1) = A(COL+1) + 1

160       NEXT V
161     NEXT U</pre>
<p>Line 30 <code>DIM</code>ensions the variable <code>C</code> as a 64-element array. Array indexes start at 1, so line 31 initializes <code>CI</code> (<code>C</code>-index) to 1. Line 32 creates another array <code>A</code> which will hold the color counts.</p>
<p>Lines 140 to 143 call <code>TraceRay</code> and store the results: the pixel color in <code>C</code>, and the updated color count in <code>A</code>. Colors go from 0 to 7 but indexes go from 1 to 8, so we need to use <code>COL+1</code> as the index.</p>
<p>Next we need to find the most and second-most frequent colors:</p>
<pre>199     REM --- Find the most and second most frequent colors in this 8x8 block ---
201     LET MFC = 0
202     FOR C = 1 TO 8
203       IF A(C) &gt; MFC THEN LET MFC = A(C): LET MFI = C
204     NEXT C
205     LET FCOL = MFI - 1

207     LET II = MFI: LET MFC = 0: LET MFI = 0
208     FOR C = 1 TO 8
209       IF C &lt;&gt; II AND A(C) &gt; MFC THEN LET MFC = A(C): LET MFI = C
210     NEXT C
211     LET SCOL = MFI - 1</pre>
<p>Time to draw some pixels. If all the pixels are the same color, just paint the block:</p>
<pre>259     REM --- If there's only one color, paint the whole block --
260     IF SCOL &lt;&gt; -1 THEN GO TO 300
270     POKE 22528 + X/8 + 32*(21-Y/8), 64 + FCOL * 8
280     GO TO 500</pre>
<p>That <code>POKE</code> requires an explanation. <code>POKE</code> puts a byte in a memory address. The first parameter is the address of this 8x8 block in the attributes block. The second parameter, the byte representing the INK and PAPER values, is the combination of the INK color shifted left 3 bits, plus a bit to turn on the BRIGHT attribute.</p>
<p>If not all pixels are the same color, we need to plot them individually. The PAPER color of the block is set to the most frequent color (so there’s fewer pixels to plot), we go over the array, and any pixel that isn’t the most frequent color is drawn with INK color set to the second most frequent color:</p>
<pre>300     REM --- Otherwise set the PAPER to the most frequent color, and draw everything else in the second most frequent color --
301     LET CI = 1
310     FOR U = X TO X+7
311       FOR V = Y TO Y+7

320         IF C(CI) &lt;&gt; FCOL THEN PLOT INK SCOL; PAPER FCOL; U, V
321         LET CI = CI + 1

350       NEXT V
351     NEXT U</pre>
<p>This works pretty well!</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-2.png"></p>
<p>Attribute clash still happens. Look at this magnified part:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-2-clash.png">
</center>
<p>With a grid overlaid to show block boundaries, the problem is easier to see. The two blocks that look “wrong” should have three colors: black, yellow, and either green or red. But the Spectrum can’t do that, so this is what the algorithm above ends up doing.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer-2-src.html">full source code for this iteration</a>.</p>
<p>The next thing to notice is that it’s just ridiculously slow - over 17 hours! Even on the emulator hitting 20,000% speed, it takes a while to render. Can we do better?</p>
<h2 id="third-iteration-performance-improvements"><a href="#third-iteration-performance-improvements">Third iteration: performance improvements</a></h2>
<p>I went for an optimization pass. Here’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For each 8x8 block, trace rays for the 4 corners, and if the color is the same in all, paint the whole block. Most of the time this does 4 rays per block instead of 64, so by itself it speeds up rendering by 16x. Of course if there were small objects that fell fully inside a block, the raytracer would miss them; but for this test scene, it feels like it’s a fair approximation.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid multiplications and divisions at all costs. The Z80 can’t do multiplication in hardware (let alone division), so BASIC implements it in software, and it’s <em>slow</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardcode some constants based on assumptions. Notably, the ray origin is always (0, 0, 0), <code>t_min</code> is always 0, and <code>t_max</code> is always <code>+inf</code>, so that saves some computation.</p></li>
<li><p>Precompute values when possible. Why store the spehre radius as data and square it, when it can be stored squared to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p>Move computed values to outer loops when possible. For example, values related to X are constant for every Y, and can be computed fewer times.</p></li>
<li><p>Inlined the “most frequent color” subroutine, and specialized the first case to not ignore any color.</p></li>
<li><p>Tweaked the line numbers to make sure <code>GO SUB</code> didn’t land on a <code>REM</code> line; believe it or not, processing a line that contains a comment takes time!</p></li>
<li><p>Used shorter variable names. This BASIC is interpreted, so every time you reference a variable, it’s looked up by name…</p></li>
<li><p>I also tried some optimizations that didn’t work, like reading the <code>DATA</code> into an array first, or putting certain expressions into variables. I have the vague feeling that the <em>order</em> in which variables are defined is important – I need to read more about this.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s some optimizations that help marginally, but hinder readability, so I chose not to implement them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the result is pretty good. The image is pixel-identical, but the runtime is down to 2 hours and a bit:</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-3.png"></p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer-3-src.html">full source code for this iteration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-iteration-light-just-the-one"><a href="#fourth-iteration-light-just-the-one">Fourth iteration: light (just the one)</a></h2>
<p>Initially I had stopped myself here; given the limitations of the environment, I felt like there wasn’t much more that could be done.</p>
<p>The obvious next step is to implement lighting. The <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/03-light.html">lighting equations and algorithms</a> are relatively straightforward, but the main problem is the very limited set of colors the ZX Spectrum can represent. To recap, it’s a fixed set of 7 colors, in normal and bright versions, plus black:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-colors.png">
</center>
<p>Even if I had the light intensity value at every pixel, I can’t just multiply it by the sphere color to get the shaded color, like I can do trivially in RGB. What to do?</p>
<p>Tradeoffs, that’s what. I can simulate shades of a color by alternating the color and black in the right amounts. I can do this on a 8x8 block basis, setting the <code>INK</code> to the color, <code>PAPER</code> to black. The tradeoff is that there will be attribute clashing.</p>
<p>How to decide whether to plot a pixel or leave it black? My first idea was to use the light intensity, a real number between 0.0 and 1.0, as the <em>probability</em> that a pixel would be plotted with the color (and left black otherwise). This worked, but it looked ugly. There’s something better, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">ordered dithering</a>. The idea is to have a matrix of thresholds, one per pixel, that helps determine whether to plot the pixel. The thresholds are arranged in such a way that they produce repeatable, pleasing patterns of pixels for any intensity level. There’s a 8x8 dithering matrix, which fits perfectly the 8x8 color blocks I’m processing, so it was surprisingly easy to implement.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, I decided to have just one directional light. Even with ordered dithering, there are not enough shades I can display that will adequately represent the nuances of multiple lights illuminating the same object. For the same reason, I went for diffuse lighting only, no specular component.</p>
<p>So the goal was to render something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-4-cgfs.png">
</center>
<p>How close could I get to that on a humble ZX Spectrum?</p>
<p>Here are the relevant changes I made to the code:</p>
<p>I could no longer use the 4-rays-per-8x8-block trick, because the light intensity at each pixel could be different. Could have computed one intensity per block, but I didn’t want to lose light resolution. So performance took a big hit compared to the previous iteration. The exception is if the 4 corners of the 8x8 block are black, in which case I can safely ignore it.</p>
<p>The lighting part is pretty simple: in the <code>TraceRay</code> subroutine, I needed to keep track of the index of the closest sphere (so I also had to load the sphere data into an array <code>S</code> at the start of the program). After the sphere loop, if the ray hits any sphere, I compute the intersection between the ray and the sphere, the normal at that point in the sphere, and finally the illumination at that point:</p>
<pre>1601 LET NX = DX*MT - S(CS, 1): LET NY = DY*MT - S(CS, 2): LET NZ = DZ*MT - S(CS, 3)
1610 LET PL = AI
1615 LET NL = (NX*LX + NY*LY + NZ*LZ)
1620 IF NL &gt; 0 THEN LET PL = PL + DI * NL / SQR(NX*NX + NY*NY + NZ*NZ)</pre>
<p>In that fragment, <code>CS</code> is the index of the Closest Sphere; <code>PL</code> is a new output variable representing Pixel Lighting; (<code>LX</code>, <code>LY</code>, <code>LZ</code>), <code>DI</code> and <code>AI</code> are set elsewhere, and represent the direction of the light, its intensity, and the intensity of the ambient light, respectively. For performance reasons, <code>LX</code>, <code>LY</code>, <code>LZ</code> represent a normalized vector, so I can skip the <code>SQR</code> and the division in line 1620.</p>
<p>I don’t need to find the second most frequent color in each 8x8 block anymore, because each block will only display the most frequent color and black.</p>
<p>I added some code to load the Bayer ordered dither matrix into an array:</p>
<pre>   3 GO SUB 7000

<p>And finally, before plotting a pixel, I compare its light intensity with the corresponding threshold in the Bayer matrix:</p>
<pre>320 IF C(CI) &gt; 0 AND H(CI) &lt;= L(CI) THEN PLOT U, V</pre>
<p>I ran this iteration, and honestly, I stared at it in disbelief for a good minute:</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-4.png"></p>
<p>First of all, <em>it works</em>!</p>
<p>It’s pretty slow compared to the previous iteration, mostly because the missing 4-rays-per-block trick, plus the additional lighting calculations. But it’s not <em>that bad</em>.</p>
<p>Attribute clashing is still there, and it’s a lot more obvious now. Could this be improved? Maybe. The yellow/red clashes look like could be improved by making the blocks red and yellow, and forgoing the shading detail (because there would be no black). For green/yellow and blue/yellow, looks like black/yellow, blue/yellow and again black/yellow would make it look better. Hmmmm. Maybe I’ll get back to this.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer-4-src.html">full source code for this iteration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fifth-iteration-shadows"><a href="#fifth-iteration-shadows">Fifth iteration: shadows</a></h2>
<p>At this point I’m feeling pretty comfortable with the environment, I’m coding like it’s 1984, so I want to see how far I can take this. Next step: shadows.</p>
<p>Most of the pieces are already in place. <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/04-shadows-and-reflections.html#shadows">The theory</a> is relatively simple: before computing lighting for a point, need to figure out whether there’s an object between the point and the light, blocking it (i.e.&nbsp;casting a shadow). I just had to implement a specialized version of <code>TraceRay</code> that traces from the intersection of the primary ray and a sphere, in the direction of the directional light, and returns as soon as it finds any intersection:</p>
<pre>2090 REM ----- Specialized TraceRay for shadow checks -----
2091 REM Params: (IX, IY, IZ): ray start; (LX, LY, LZ): ray direction (directional light vector)
2092 REM Returns: H = 1 if the ray intersects any sphere, H = 0 otherwise
2093 REM Optimizations: (TMIN, TMAX) hardcoded to (epsilon, +inf)

2100 LET A = 2*(LX*LX + LY*LY + LZ*LZ)

2110 FOR S = 1 TO NS

2111    LET CX = IX - S(S,1): LET CY = IY - S(S,2): LET CZ = IZ - S(S,3)
2120    LET B = -2*(CX*LX + CY*LY + CZ*LZ)
2130    LET C = (CX*CX + CY*CY + CZ*CZ) - S(S, 4)

2140    LET D = B*B - 2*A*C
2150    IF D &lt; 0 THEN GO TO 2210
2160    LET D = SQR(D)

2170    LET T = (B + D) / A
2180    IF T &gt; 0.01 THEN LET H = 1: RETURN
2190    LET T = (B - D) / A
2200    IF T &gt; 0.01 THEN LET H = 1: RETURN

2210 NEXT S
2220 LET H = 0: RETURN</pre>
<p>This is called right before computing illumination:</p>
<pre>1600 LET IX = DX*MT: LET IY = DY*MT: LET IZ = DZ*MT
1601 LET NX = IX - S(CS, 1): LET NY = IY - S(CS, 2): LET NZ = IZ - S(CS, 3)
1610 LET PL = AI

1612 GO SUB 2100: IF H = 1 THEN RETURN

1615 LET NL = (NX*LX + NY*LY + NZ*LZ)
1620 IF NL &gt; 0 THEN LET PL = PL + DI * NL / SQR(NX*NX + NY*NY + NZ*NZ)</pre>
<p>And here’s what comes out…</p>
<p><img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-5.png"></p>
<p>Compare with the output of the CGFS raytracer:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/zx-rt-5-cgfs.png">
</center>
<p>Pretty slow due to the extra computation (back to 17 hours), but definitely worth it!</p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer-5-src.html">full source code for this iteration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-next"><a href="#what-next">What next?</a></h2>
<p>The obvious next step would be to implement reflections. But it would be practically impossible to blend colors together in a meaningful way. So objects would be either fully reflective or not reflective at all, and it would just look weird. Recursion would be an interesting problem: the Spectsum supports it, but because there are no local variables, each recursive call would overwrite the global variables, so I’d have to manage my own stack. Doable, but doesn’t sound worth the effort.</p>
<p>Another axis is performance. I could rewrite the whole thing in assembly and see how fast can I make it go. I could control how much precision I need, so maybe fixed-point math would do it (or a less precise version of <code>SQR</code>). Maybe some other time!</p>
<p>Finally, the attribute clash at object boundaries still bothers me. I have a couple of ideas that might improve the situation, although the limitations of the Spectrum are such that it will never be 100% fixed.</p>
<h2 id="nostalgic-rant"><a href="#nostalgic-rant">Nostalgic rant</a></h2>
<p>This was a fun weekend project. Entirely pointless, but fun!</p>
<p>It was nice to write Sinclair BASIC after 30 years. Even though the language is the same, I’m not – I found myself thinking higher-level concepts and then translating them to BASIC. I don’t know whether this is because modern languages give me a better vocabulary to think in, that I can then translate to BASIC, or because I’m not 10 anymore. Could be both.</p>
<p>Specifically, this program makes judicious use of <code>GO TO</code>, which as everyone knows, it’s Considered Harmful™. Back in the day it was pretty much all we had: no function calls, only subroutines using <code>GO SUB</code>; no <code>WHILE</code> or <code>REPEAT</code>; <code>IF</code> doesn’t have <code>END IF</code>; <code>FOR</code> doesn’t have <code>BREAK</code> or <code>CONTINUE</code> (the keywords exist, but they don’t do what you think they do). So using <code>GO TO</code> is unavoidable. And sure, it can lead to spaghetti code, but it doesn’t <em>have to</em>; my own code here, although admittedly simple, is structured cleanly.</p>
<p>I also missed the immediacy and the simplicity of the environment. No frameworks, no dependencies, barely any abstractions (even multiplication is implemented in software!). The ZX Spectrum was fully <em>knowable</em>. The whole Z80 instruction set, the quirks of the ROM and the ALU, everything fits in your head pretty easily. You could reason about peformance down to the processor cycle level – no caches or pipelines or anything else to make your life difficult. I miss all that. Kids These Days™ will never get to experience an environment like this, and that makes me sad.</p>

<div id="article-body">
<p>The United States Department of Defense (DoD) wants to declassify more space programs in order to boost the nation's military edge in space.</p><p>As the world's superpowers continue to invest in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-force-space-flag-simulated-orbit-combat" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/space-force-space-flag-simulated-orbit-combat">militarization of space</a>, some leaders at the Pentagon believe it's time to declassify some of the secretive space programs in the United States' portfolio. To that end, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks recently approved a new policy that will reduce the classification level of some highly secret space programs and technologies.</p><p>The policies that have prohibited sharing this information are outdated and are holding back the U.S. when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/darpa-space-weapons-superiority-technologies" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/darpa-space-weapons-superiority-technologies">superiority in space</a>, according to DoD Assistant Secretary for Space Policy John Plumb. "What the classification memo does, generally, is it overwrites — it really completely rewrites — a legacy document that had its roots 20 years ago, and it's just no longer applicable to the current environment that involves national security space," Plumb said last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/01/dod-completely-rewrites-classification-policy-for-secret-space-programs/" target="_blank" data-url="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/01/dod-completely-rewrites-classification-policy-for-secret-space-programs/">according to Breaking Defense</a>.</p><p>The policy does not mean that these programs and technologies will now be fully unclassified and revealed to the public; instead, it will lower their classification levels in order to share some technologies and programs with private industry and international allies to help the U.S. build an "asymmetric advantage and force multiplier that neither China nor Russia could ever hope to match," Plumb said in a DoD <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3649094/space-policy-official-details-approach-to-maintaining-us-edge/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3649094/space-policy-official-details-approach-to-maintaining-us-edge/">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-command-conflict-in-space-deterrence-kathleen-hicks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/space-command-conflict-in-space-deterrence-kathleen-hicks">Space is now 'most essential' domain for US military, Pentagon says</a></p><p>The move would allow each branch of the U.S. armed services to decide their own classification levels, rather than&nbsp;spread a blanket DoD policy over all military space programs and technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the key issues driving this policy change is the use of what are known as Special Access Programs (SAPs), security protocols that severely restrict the sharing of highly sensitive and classified information. Some of these SAPs are acknowledged, meaning their existence is known to the public but their details haven't been revealed. Others, however, are unacknowledged, meaning their mere existence is even a secret.</p><p>Plumb argued that the new policy will remove SAP status from some of the Pentagon's most valuable space programs, giving the U.S. military an edge in what the Department of Defense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-command-conflict-in-space-deterrence-kathleen-hicks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/space-command-conflict-in-space-deterrence-kathleen-hicks">now considers the "most essential domain"</a> in terms of national security.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="A white rocket with side boosters lifts off from a seaside launch pad" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp;

                    <p>Back in 2001, immunologist Pere Santamaria was exploring a new way to study diabetes. Working in mice, he and his collaborators developed a method that uses iron oxide nanoparticles to track the key immune cells involved in the disorder.</p><p>But then Santamaria, who is at the University of Calgary in Canada, came up with a bold idea. Maybe he could use these particles as a therapy to target and quiet, or even kill, the cells responsible for driving the disease — those that destroy insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. It seemed like a far-fetched idea, but he decided to try it. “I kept doing experiment after experiment,” he says. Now, more than two decades later, Santamaria’s therapy is on the cusp of being tested in people.</p><p>It’s not alone. Researchers have been trying for more than 50 years <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/507418a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/507418a" data-track-category="body text link">to tame the cells that are responsible for autoimmune disorders</a> such as type 1 diabetes, lupus and multiple sclerosis. Most of the approved therapies for these conditions work by suppressing the entire immune response. This often alleviates symptoms but leaves people at elevated risk of infections and cancers.</p><p>But for decades, immunologists have hoped to restore what’s known as tolerance — the immune system’s ability to ignore antigens that belong in the body while appropriately attacking those that don’t. In some cases, that means administering the very antigens that the rogue cells are trained to attack, a strategy that can deprogram the cells and dampen the autoimmune response. Other researchers are trying to selectively wipe out the problematic cells, or to introduce suppressive immune cells that have been engineered to target them. One approach that relies on engineered immune cells was used <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03968-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03968-6" data-track-category="body text link">to treat 15 people with lupus</a> or other immune disorders with surprising success<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. One participant has been symptom-free for more than two and a half years.</p><p>If more trials in people show positive results, it could change lives, says Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who specializes in autoimmune disorders. “The therapies that we have for these diseases are terrible,” he says. They don’t always work, and even when they do, the improvement is often modest. Talking about therapies that could provide a cure is “almost blasphemy”, Konig says. Now, with some of the results coming in, curative treatments seem possible. “The only question is, what is the best approach?” he asks.</p><h2><b>Self awareness</b></h2><p>The immune system is known for its role in attacking pathogens. But it has another, equally important job: knowing when to stand down. If immune cells see the body’s own tissues as a threat, they can cause harm.</p><p>The arm of the immune system engaged in targeted attacks consists of cells called lymphocytes that differentiate to form T cells, which typically recognize and attack foreign or diseased cells, and B cells, which produce antibodies and support the immune system in other ways. Early in their development, these cells undergo a process to weed out those that target the body’s own tissues. But this process, known as central tolerance, is “leaky”, says Jeffrey Hubbell, a chemical engineer at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Some cells slip through.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The body has a backup system, a mechanism known as peripheral tolerance. This eliminates or deactivates wayward cells, or turns them into what are known as regulatory T cells, which suppress the immune response by preventing other cells from attacking.</p><p>In autoimmune diseases, both central and peripheral tolerance break down for reasons that are not entirely understood, and the immune system starts attacking antigens found on the body’s own cells and tissue. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00024-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00024-9" data-track-category="body text link">multiple sclerosis</a>, the body attacks the myelin sheath that insulates nerves. In coeliac disease, gluten triggers the immune system to attack the intestinal lining.</p><p>If scientists could calm or eliminate the malfunctioning cells — restoring tolerance to specific antigens — they could treat the disease without hampering the immune system’s ability to respond to real threats. Early efforts focused on administering large quantities of the problematic antigen in an attempt to exhaust or deactivate the immune cells that recognize it. Many groups have tried this form of desensitization, with varying levels of success. The antigen must be introduced in just the right way, to boost tolerance rather than activate immunity, says Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist and chief executive and co-founder of Sonoma Biotherapeutics in South San Francisco, California. “That’s the whole field of antigen-specific therapy.”</p><h2><b>Flipping the switch</b></h2><p>Picking the right antigen is tricky. Some autoimmune diseases are caused by a reaction to just one. But for many conditions — multiple sclerosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few — the body develops an immune response against several antigens through a phenomenon called epitope spreading. Researchers could try to work out all the antigens involved, Bluestone says. But that’s a tall order, especially because the list might vary from person to person. Another possibility is to search for a master switch that, when flipped, turns off the autoimmune response while leaving the immune system intact.</p><p>Santamaria thinks that he has found such a mechanism. His team’s nanoparticles — which he calls navacims — are decorated with proteins called major histocompatibility complex molecules that jut off the surface of the particle like spikes. These spikes are meant to mimic those found on immune regulatory cells known as antigen-presenting cells, which mop up antigens all over the body and then take them to T cells, telling the cells whether to attack or ignore them (see ‘Pathways to tolerance’). Santamaria likens them to T-cell bait.</p><figure>

</figure><p>After Santamaria discovered how to use the navacims to track T cells, he began working out how to use them as a therapy. He suspected that the nanoparticles might cause the cells to die or go dormant.</p><p>At the time, Santamaria was working with a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, a disease in which epitope spreading is known to occur. So, he developed a cocktail of particles carrying eight different antigen fragments, or epitopes. For a control, he used a nanoparticle carrying a single epitope, surmising that one wouldn’t have any effect because T cells recognize thousands of epitopes in diabetes. Surprisingly, however, both the control and the experimental nanoparticles reversed diabetes symptoms. “It totally didn’t make any sense,” Santamaria says.</p><p>It took him years to work out what was going on, but now he thinks he understands<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. The nanoparticles prompt T cells to multiply and morph into regulatory T cells, which travel to the site of inflammation. There, they bind and deactivate antigen-presenting cells that carry not only the antigen that these cells recognize, but thousands of other antigens that are important in diabetes. So these cells can no longer activate the immune cells that fuel the disease. In a sense, the nanoparticle-fused antigen works as a master switch. “It sounds too good to be true sometimes,” Santamaria says.</p><p>And it might be. The strategy hasn’t been tested in the clinic yet. Santamaria has founded a company called Parvus Therapeutics in South San Francisco; it should begin its first trial in people this year, starting with an autoimmune disease that affects the liver.</p><h2><b>A key in the liver</b></h2><p>The liver is where all the blood carrying foreign antigens from the gut gets filtered. It is also the destination of all the cellular debris left behind when cells and tissues die. It, therefore, has an important role in establishing immune tolerance. Hubbell and his colleagues discovered that cellular debris carries a special sugar tag that directs it to the liver. By adding this sugar tag to other proteins, they realized, they could direct just about any molecule they wanted to the liver, including antigens such as the myelin proteins that activate the immune system in multiple sclerosis. In work published in 2023, they showed that this strategy works to reverse symptoms of a multiple-sclerosis-like disease in mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>What was so exciting about this paper, Hubbell says, is that the animals had advanced disease, meaning that their immune systems were probably reacting against a variety of antigens. Yet, treatment with just one antigen worked to reverse paralysis.</p><article data-label="Related">
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00169-7/d41586-024-00169-7_24096670.jpg"><p>Your brain could be controlling how sick you get — and how you recover</p></a>
 </article><p>A company called Anokion in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which Hubbell co-founded, is working on a similar strategy. It has tested it in a phase I trial in people with multiple sclerosis to assess its safety, and is currently enrolling participants in a phase II trial, in which it will start to assess the efficacy. The firm’s chief executive, Deborah Geraghty, won’t say exactly how the therapy works after the antigen travels to the liver. “We haven’t disclosed a lot of that publicly,” she says, but she adds, “We believe we’re driving a strong T-regulatory component.”</p><p>Bluestone has decided on a different approach. He and his colleagues at Sonoma Biotherapeutics take T cells from patients’ blood, extract the regulatory cells, and engineer them to express an antigen that will direct the regulatory T cells to the site of disease when they are re-injected. There, they should be able to calm all the angry T cells in the vicinity, not just those that recognize the specific antigen they carry.</p><p>Sonoma has tested regulatory T cells in clinical trials, but not those cells engineered to express a specific antigen, yet. It plans to give the first dose to a person with rheumatoid arthritis in early 2024.</p><p>Bluestone thinks that the approach is less risky than dosing people with antigens that might further exacerbate autoimmunity. And regulatory T cells produce tissue-repair factors, which might help to reverse some of the damage wrought by disease. But cellular therapies also come with challenges, including a high cost and potential side effects. “These are living drugs,” Bluestone says. How do you determine a dose for cells that, once infused, begin replicating in the body? “There’s a lot we still need to learn.”</p><h2><b>B cells in the spotlight</b></h2><p>While researchers such as Bluestone and Hubbell are working to prod the immune system towards tolerance, others are developing therapies to directly kill the immune cells that contribute to the disease.</p><p>One team in Germany is trying an approach commonly used to treat blood cancers that equips T cells with what’s known as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Clinicians take T cells from the patient’s body and engineer them to express this specialized synthetic receptor on their surface. They can create a CAR that binds to CD-19, a protein found on all B cells. Clinicians then infuse the CAR T cells into the body, where they start attacking B cells.</p><article data-label="Related">

The first participant in the study, who had lupus, passed the 1,000-day mark in December with no sign of disease. Konig agrees that the results are “incredible”:“Most people would not have predicted the degree of durability.” But, he adds, “I don’t think we can expect that the disease will stay gone forever in every patient.” The T cells that help to drive lupus are still there.</p><p>CAR-T therapies target and kill all B cells, which might make it a stretch to consider the approach a way of restoring tolerance. But for most autoimmune diseases, only a small fraction of B cells are the trouble makers. Aimee Payne, a dermatologist at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, wanted to find a way to target just those cells. She studies a rare skin disease called mucosal pemphigus vulgaris. In people with this disease, the immune system makes antibodies against a protein in the skin called desmoglein 3. “It’s responsible essentially for holding your epithelial cells together,” she says. “The cells fall apart and you get blisters all throughout the mucosa [and] on the skin.”</p><p>The standard therapy for pemphigus, a monoclonal antibody, works by destroying B cells. With the B cells gone, the antibodies against desmoglein 3 disappear, and people go into remission. “Our current therapies are really a blunt weapon,” Payne says.</p><p>Payne realized that she might be able to develop a more focused weapon by tweaking the CAR-T approach. Rather than engineering a T-cell receptor that would bind to all B cells, she could engineer the T cells to express the desmoglein 3 protein, which would bind to the desmoglein 3 antibodies sticking off the surface of only the rogue B cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. This therapy is known as CAAR (chimeric autoantibody receptor) T cell. “It’s like a laser,” she says, “targeting the autoreactive B cells that are causing disease, but leaving the healthy B cells alone.”</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Payne founded a company called Cabaletta Bio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is currently testing these cells in people with pemphigus and another autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis that causes muscle weakness.</p><p>B cells are emerging as a promising target in many autoimmune diseases, says Payne. In some of the most common disorders, B cells have complex roles. They don’t just produce antibodies but also churn out signals that trigger inflammation and present antigens to T cells, helping to fan the flames that keep autoimmune diseases burning. In immunology, “everybody focused on T cells because they were the smart ones and B cells were just like the poor cousin”, Payne says, but “maybe B cells really are like the key”.</p><p>Steinman is careful not to be too optimistic. He has invested decades in approaches directed at immune tolerance. “Every time these are taken to the clinic, including some of my own efforts, they fall short of getting a drug approval,” he says. At this point, he adds, “I would want to hedge my bets.”</p><p>Santamaria suggests that many past failures stem from a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. “I think they fail because they’re going to into clinical testing before we actually know what the hell we’re doing,” he says. Now, 18 years into his research on navacims, he thinks that his team has a good shot at success.</p><p>Konig favours approaches that involve B-cell depletion. That’s the strategy that his team is working on, so he accepts that he might be biased. “The beauty is that eventually we’ll learn from the data what the right approach is.”</p>

"Therefore, the incident was not a result of 23andMe's alleged failure to maintain reasonable security measures under the CPRA." The CPRA — otherwise known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prop-24-privacy-california-data-tracking-facebook-google-2020-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>California Privacy Rights Act</u></a> — strengthened security measures for consumers to stop businesses from sharing their personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/23and-me-hack-data-breach-personal-data-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>hackers initially got access to around 14,000 accounts</u></a> using previously compromised login credentials, but they then used a feature of 23andMe to gain access to almost half of the company's user base, or about 7 million accounts, the company previously told Business Insider.&nbsp;</p><p>One 23andMe customer impacted by the breach told TechCrunch that it's "appalling that 23andMe is attempting to hide from consequences instead of helping its customers."</p><p>The legal parties representing the victims aren't thrilled with the company's response either. "Rather than acknowledge its role in this data security disaster, 23andMe has apparently decided to leave its customers out to dry while downplaying the seriousness of these events," Hassan Zavareei, one of the lawyers representing the victims who received the letter from 23andMe, told TechCrunch. He and 23andMe did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.</p><p>Following the breach, the company asked all its users to reset their passwords and set up additional security measures like two-factor authentication, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>according</u></a> to its website. It also noted that it now requires all new and existing customers to log in to their accounts using two-step verification.</p><p>In October, the company said the results of its preliminary investigation showed no indication of a data security incident within its systems. The company has reiterated that through the investigation. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The CEO of Alaska Airlines said new, in-house inspections of the carrier's Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the wake of a near-disaster earlier this month revealed that “many” of the aircraft were found to have loose bolts.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello, Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci&nbsp;discussed the findings of his company's inspections so far since the Jan. 5 incident, in which a panel on one of its Max 9 jets blew out midair on a flight carrying 177 people. </p><p>“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed,” he said. “I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people. And — my demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house.”</p><p>Following the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all Boeing Max 9 planes grounded and launched a safety investigation. The agency also <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-increasing-oversight-boeing-production-and-manufacturing" target="_blank">announced</a> an audit of Boeing's Max 9 production line and suppliers "to evaluate Boeing’s compliance with its approved quality procedures." It is also subjecting Boeing, as well as its third-party suppliers, to additional increased monitoring.</p><p>The incident also prompted lawmakers to question whether Boeing's quality control systems are adequate.  </p><p>“Given the previous tragic crashes of Boeing 737 Max aircraft, we are deeply concerned that the loose bolts represent a systemic issue with Boeing’s capabilities to manufacture safe airplanes,” Sens. Ed Markey, J.D.

          <p>We introduce Lumiere -- a text-to-video diffusion model designed for synthesizing videos that portray realistic, diverse and coherent motion -- a pivotal challenge in video synthesis. To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model. This is in contrast to existing video models which synthesize distant keyframes followed by temporal super-resolution -- an approach that inherently makes global temporal consistency difficult to achieve. By deploying both spatial and (importantly) temporal down- and up-sampling and leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, our model learns to directly generate a full-frame-rate, low-resolution video by processing it in multiple space-time scales. We demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results, and show that our design easily facilitates a wide range of content creation tasks and video editing applications, including image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylized generation.</p>

In the relationship between product management and engineering the opposing ends of the spectrum are “debate and question everything, build nothing” all the way to “just tell me what to build and I’ll build it.”</p><p>Some of you are shaking your heads – “no way Adam, no company falls into one of those two extremes.” Others are nodding so enthusiastically that their heads are about to detach from their necks.</p><p><strong>If you’re in the second group, today’s newsletter is for you. I’ve been this person too.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Whether you are a product or engineering leader, a product manager, or an IC engineer read on to learn:</p><ul><li><p>How a company gets to one of these extremes</p></li><li><p>How to shift out of a “debate everything” culture</p></li><li><p>How to shift out of a “just tell me what to do” culture</p></li></ul><p>On the “debate vs. do” spectrum, neither one of the extremes are a good or healthy place to be.&nbsp; Cultures that debate and challenge everything, even the smallest of considerations, without ever reaching resolution never manage to ship anything. Cultures that absolve themselves of debate entirely end up disempowered from the end outcome (and also don’t ship anything meaningful, even if they ship a lot from a volume perspective).</p><p><span>In order to get some advice on how to effectively get to the culture you want I talked to a handful of trusted engineering partners – </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darinswanson/" rel="">Darin Swanson</a></strong><span> (New Relic, Gatsby), </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgreenberg/" rel="">Matt Greenberg</a></strong><span> (Credit Karma, Reforge and Handshake), </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffdwyer/" rel="">Jeff Dwyer</a></strong><span> (Prefab, ezCater, Hubspot), and </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisbennett/" rel="">Louis Bennett</a></strong><span> (Trulia, Intercom, VSCO, and Humanitec). I also got advice from one of my favorite, tell-it-like-it-is, product leaders: </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erika-warren/" rel="">Erika Warren</a></strong><span> (Change.org, WyzAnt)</span></p><p><span>In life, the only constant is change. While many people have co-opted this statement in different contexts, its origins can be credited to the </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus" rel="">Greek philosopher Heraclitus</a></strong><span>. Is this the first reference to Greek philosophy in an article about product development? </span><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=product+development+and+greek+philosophy&amp;sca_esv=600555583&amp;gbv=2&amp;sei=aPyuZaP8O_CQur8P2Z-lyA0" rel="">Definitely not</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p>While he probably wasn’t thinking about building companies when he said this, it’s equally true in its application to company and culture building. In startups, the only constant is change. And change is at least one reason that companies find themselves in one of these extremes.</p><p>In my conversation with Darin Swanson, I thought he summed this up quite elegantly:</p><blockquote><h4><span>“The companies I have partnered with over the last 6 plus years go through cycles of product definition and decision. Transition from founder(s) / CEO leading the product strategy, to the early team leading the experiments and iterations towards product market fit (PMF), to specific roles / individuals. In rapidly growing companies this can be moving back and forth every 3-4 months as PMF ebbs and flows. Particularly if you are</span><strong><span> </span><a href="https://www.saastr.com/when-you-fall-out-of-product-market-fit/" rel="">going slow</a></strong><span>, roles change, or the company grows or shrinks.</span></h4><h4>These transitions can be clunky, slow, and frustrating if left to happen organically and osmotically. In an interesting and common pattern, things get slow and clunky after a growth spurt where new roles and people are added to the team without the team taking the time to codify exactly how the new people and roles are going to maximize their impact within the company and how you’ll work together.</h4><h4>Often a company will settle into two, less than optimal states: debate everything or wait to be told.”</h4></blockquote><p>The second way that companies and cultures end up in this position is through the incentive structure (or lack thereof) within a company.</p><p>Jeff Dwyer:</p><blockquote><h4>“When people give you a list of all the reasons it can't be done and debate on all the details, it's because their connection and incentive to achieve the actual results has gotten severed someplace. We can end up in a place where we can get in trouble for doing it wrong, but don't have enough information to really do it right. So we spend more time debating how not to get in trouble.”&nbsp;</h4></blockquote><p>On the flip side, when companies find themselves in “just tell me what to do” culture it’s often due to an imbalance in expectations between product and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><span>First, the same root cause of being disconnected from the outcome can lead to a culture of “just do what I’m told.” It’s a self-perpetuating problem; if you don’t expect engineers to be engaged in the outcome then you won’t </span><em>hire</em><span> people who are.</span></p><p>The second root cause of “just do what I’m told” is related to fear of failure. If engineers are consistently blamed or called out for getting something wrong then eventually they won’t feel comfortable getting anything wrong anymore or having an opinion at all. If they just do what they’re told then that blame shifts to someone else. It’s not my fault, I was just doing what I was told.</p><p><span>So it’s all well and good that we want to avoid creating the systems that perpetuate these two extreme development cultures, but I imagine for a lot of people reading this newsletter they’re already in it.</span><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>So what do you do?!?</strong></p><p>If you find yourself endlessly debating the work and never moving past that point, you can try the following to break free:</p><ol><li><p>Help people operate in the “gray area”</p></li><li><p>Introduce the FG scale</p></li><li><p>Incentivize outcomes</p></li><li><p>Evaluate how decisions are made and who makes them</p></li></ol><p>One of the reasons that people can get stuck in endless debate is if they don’t truly understand the decisions being made. Most decisions are not binary and the nuance can make many people uncomfortable.</p><p>But Adam, if people don’t understand the decisions aren’t they more likely to just blindly follow them? I realize this sounds counterintuitive, but no.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Matt Greenberg describes a scenario he found himself in at Credit Karma:</p><blockquote><h4>“The best product and engineering collaborations are when they can agree on an approach to a problem that gets maximum impact for minimal work. This is a tough nut to crack. We had this challenge with the Credit Team at Credit Karma. Upstream teams never understood the complexity of the stuff they were asking for because the bureaus and credit data are so nuanced and complex. We’d often be locked in debates for days or even weeks about how to approach a problem, especially ones that seemed simple but were unrealistic. Eventually teams would find fake compromise, kind of a spiritual alignment, but no details. This would lead to late stage blowups and disappointments. Which would make the next round worse. It was a cultural death spiral.”</h4></blockquote><p>Matt solved this problem by creating a “rotational program” designed to build empathy and understanding between PMs and Engineers – especially understanding of complexity around credit bureaus and data:</p><blockquote><h4>“We eventually solved it (mostly) with a rotational program for both Eng and somewhat PM. Trying to build empathy and understanding. Teams would embed 2 or 3 people per project for a quarter and then reverse it the next quarter.”</h4></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif" width="366" height="406.8482142857143" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:448,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:366,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Frankly My Dear GIF - Frankly My Dear I Dont Give A Damn GIFs&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Frankly My Dear GIF - Frankly My Dear I Dont Give A Damn GIFs" title="Frankly My Dear GIF - Frankly My Dear I Dont Give A Damn GIFs" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F286659f3-de3b-4515-b047-9ef85aa37094_448x498.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>For those of you who are sensitive to language, I apologize in advance. Both Jeff and Erika called out the importance of the “Fucks Given” scale. To put it simply, when you’re mired in debate just ask everyone how much they care about the decision on a scale of 1 to 10.&nbsp;</p><p>From Jeff,</p><blockquote><h4>“I really, really like the FG scale, which is of course "Fucks Given.” I've used this a lot and it is truly effective. When you get into a situation where there is endless debate just ask everyone to give their FG score 1-10. Most often I get a lot of 2s and 4s, maybe one 7. You can have the 2s and 4s say their piece and then they can leave. Typically they'll say something like, ‘here's what I would do and here's why, but I'm a 3 out of 10 and I trust you.’”</h4></blockquote><p>And Erika,</p><blockquote><h4>“One tactic I've done within the product is similar to Jeff's FG scale. That is to encourage the option of ‘I don't care or I defer to the group’.&nbsp; I've seen people argue for things on principle but really not have much invested in the decision.&nbsp;And when you have a culture of consensus and lots of debate, it snowballs into a place where that's the norm.&nbsp;I think it's helpful to create the opt-out for people to not feel expected to engage when they may not care. It's also a helpful signal as a manager because if someone is always ‘defer / don't care’ maybe there's something else to dig into on performance or motivation.”</h4></blockquote><p><span>The goal of product development is to build valuable products for customers that make sense to them and to us as a business. Endless debate can occur when teams lose sight of that goal. Without making it abundantly clear that the outcome is what matters you’ll get teams who focus more on being right or managing to their own careers than delivering something valuable, especially if PMs are handing down rigid requirements (this is another reason I believe </span><strong><a href="https://www.fishmanafnewsletter.com/p/-hot-take-alert-1-prds-are-the-worst" rel="">Briefs &gt; PRDs</a></strong><span>).</span></p><p>As Jeff says,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4>“Good engineers have to have an extreme pedantry streak. We spend a lot of our day with systems that punish us brutally if we aren't exactingly specific. We can spend hours crying and tearing our hair out because of a small misspelling. If you push a task or a feature (or even worse a ‘requirement’) down to engineering then we're going to analyze and argue about the intricacies of it. If you push down a proper goal and give us flexibility about how to get there, we'll argue about the fastest way to get there and we'll disagree and commit because our eyes are on the real prize.”</h4></blockquote><p>And Matt,</p><blockquote><h4>“What you measure is what you get. The biggest challenges come when the different orgs measure different things; e.g. if product leadership gives credit for shipping and engineering gives credit for complexity. If you only get to staff software engineer by working on things of necessary complexity then you are incentivized to find complexity. Many times in engineering orgs, engineers are siloed in what counts. If you think back through the teams you are on, some eng managers are more focused on tech debt, developer experience, platform challenges, but most of the time that's because there isn't a clear incentive tied to a business outcome for them.”</h4></blockquote><p>Darin reminded me of the quote (often attributed to Winston Churchill):&nbsp; “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all others.”</p><p>Darin takes it one step further: “Democracy is the best system, but also the slowest.”</p><p>A critical piece of avoiding endless debate is to know who makes the final decision and how it gets made. Consensus-seeking leads to endless debate.</p><p>From Darin,</p><blockquote><h4>“When companies are smaller, by necessity everyone plays multiple roles and the number of people involved is limited so you can solicit input in a timely way. But almost every company has a phase where we start to hear ‘I don’t feel listened to anymore’ or ‘I don’t feel part of the decision making.’ [This can actually result in more people trying to involve themselves in decisions that they’re not a part of.] A test I like to have: for any project, meeting or proposal – can you point me to the document that indicates who will make the decision and how and when that decision will be made and published.”</h4></blockquote><p>This is further helped by the idea of defining explicit timelines and how input is considered — you can use a simple framework like Listen, Decide, Communicate as a tool for breaking through endless debate.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Listen</strong><span>: This stage involves gathering information, understanding different perspectives, and considering various viewpoints.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Decide</strong><span>: After collecting and analyzing the necessary information, the leader must make a decision.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Communicate</strong><span>: Once a decision is made, effectively communicate it to the relevant parties. This includes explaining the rationale behind the decision, the expected outcomes, and any actions that need to be taken.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p>As Darin says,</p><blockquote><h4>“Importantly, this does not give you license to ignore the smart and insightful people on your team. It makes it imperative that you make it explicit on how long or if you will seek input and how you will seek input. Listened, considered, rejected is a perfectly valid response to any input. Everyone on the team needs to take this in stride and understand being listened to does not mean always having their input incorporated. Including the “why” on the rejection is a great way to ensure you have really thought about the input.”</h4></blockquote><p>Nowhere is this more challenging now than in a more remote and distributed world.&nbsp;</p><p>Darin again,</p><blockquote><h4>“I have seen this amplified with us working more remote and more distributed. Everything can move to taking at least 1 business day to gather input…a week or more is not unusual! This really gets in the way of urgency and velocity. Time is the luxury we don’t have. Instead, move to 1) publishing the proposal, 2) establishing the ceremonies for input on the proposal (which can include no solicitation for input…but at your peril), 3) completed staff work critique or iteration on the proposal within the teams set and agreed timelines, 4) the owner makes the decision and we move forward.&nbsp;</h4><h4>The owner by the nature of the role and expertise and expectation is the best informed and best enabled to keep things moving. If no input or feedback comes within a timely manner, the default is to move forward. Not wait. Not ask again for input. The window has closed and it is time to move forward.”</h4></blockquote><p>Finally, it’s important to be really clear about what is up for debate and what is not. As Louis Bennett says,</p><blockquote><h4>“A successful shop needs to establish the ground rules of what's up for debate, and what's not. For example, having an opinionated and established take on the languages and frameworks the team will use helps move things forward. Ditto for establishing clarity and a default process for when and how to have a debate on the smaller things. Logistically, things usually end up in a point where a CTO/VPE needs to create "engineering values" which guide the debate and often decide the un-debate-able items.”</h4></blockquote><p>I think this is the more common culture that teams find themselves in and it’s harder to break out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>As Erika says,</p><blockquote><h4>“I think “do culture” is harder to pivot away from then "debate.”&nbsp; You can lose a lot of great engineers (or PMs) who don't want to just "do".&nbsp; And once you train an org to take orders, it's hard to rebuild the trust and psychological safety required to have a culture where debate and mistakes are ok.”</h4></blockquote><p>If you do find yourself in this position, here are three approaches you can use to break free:</p><ol><li><p>Incentivize outcomes and feedback</p></li><li><p>Provide context and a venue for discussion</p></li><li><p>Codify the expectations across engineering and product</p></li></ol><p>Just as with the endless debate culture, being clear about what the outcomes are (and getting engineers engaged in the outcome) is a key to the cultural shift away from “just tell me what to build.”</p><p>From Matt,</p><blockquote><h4>“Engineers have often been burned building things that nobody cared about. They often don't feel heard and are under-developed to debate outcome merits with a PM when they aren't as familiar with the data or customer. I think to break through it you need to be able to re-align the incentives and show you care about the feedback.”</h4></blockquote><p><span>One way that I’ve handled this in the past as a PM is by creating and engaging engineers around team goals via the </span><strong><a href="https://www.fishmanafnewsletter.com/p/why-okrs-exist-how-to-do-okrs-well-hot-take" rel="">OKR process</a></strong><span>. It’s not a “product” goal or an “engineering goal,” it’s our goal.&nbsp; Shared goal setting within a product development team allows everyone to internalize and feel connected to the results that you’re trying to deliver.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There are plenty of product managers who treat engineers like their sole purpose is to strike keys on a keyboard until software is delivered. But this relegates engineers to code monkey status. Don’t be that product manager. Remember that if people feel connected to the goal they’ll feel connected to how to get there.</p><p>If you’re a product manager, your job is to continuously provide context and encourage discussion (with an end point as outlined above).&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how Matt like to see this,</p><blockquote><h4>“Engineers often have a lot less context on the business side. It's important to have a room or venue to share concise summarized context, whether sync or async, so that when it comes to the conversation they aren't heavily penalized for not knowing things. You need to provide the space to actually debate, especially with fewer constraints (both time and otherwise). I think people want debate and also load problems with so many constraints that they only see or allow one path through and don't have time to really think and discuss. They’ll say things like ‘we have to figure this out in the next hour’ and the growth and opportunity can't come from there.”</h4></blockquote><p><span>To avoid what Matt has identified, I like to bring my engineering counterparts into the earlier stages of discovery—record and share summaries of customer conversations with them (or invite them to watch), highlight interesting data and research, and specifically </span><em>ask for feedback</em><span>. You’d be amazed how quickly a team member gets engaged when you approach them by asking for their advice and input after they’ve received the appropriate context.</span></p><p>Matt again,</p><blockquote><h4><span>“I think doing things like </span><a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" rel="">design sprints</a><span> are ways to teach all the aspects of behavior you want to happen continuously with more room, time, and structure.”</span></h4></blockquote><p>Much with the expectations around collecting feedback and ending debate (to avoid an endless cycle) you can also set expectations around contributing feedback in the first place.</p><p>As Darin says,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4>“Past the stage of senior software engineer there’s no real credit for the code anymore. It becomes the baseline. The strategy impact, the coordination, and the understanding and contributing to the team, company and customer success is part of your responsibility. A demo is the currency of completion and all demos start with a narrative on the ‘why’ behind the work in terms of customer value. Decreasing the perceived value of the how and increasing the emphasis on the why increases engagement.”</h4></blockquote><p>In other words, as an engineering leader or product counterpart you have to encourage the contribution.</p><p>Darin has a very direct take on how engineering leaders should approach their team:</p><blockquote><h4>“If you just want me to tell you what to do then your time is not valuable. In the not too distant future, you will be replaced by automation. Practice bringing the higher value now.”</h4></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:189362,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a42f0-a613-4397-a0a9-7da6f51cd9da_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I’ve worked in both cultural extremes—where it felt like we couldn’t get anything done because every last detail needed to be debated or where every time I sought out feedback for a customer problem or solution I was met with silence.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Have you ever tried to compile a helloworld Rust program in <code>--release</code> mode? If yes, have
you <em>seen its binary size</em>? Suffice to say, it’s not exactly small. Or at least it wasn’t small
until recently. This post details how I found about the issue and my attempt to fix it in Cargo.</p>

<h2 id="binary-size-analysis">Binary size analysis</h2>
<p>I’m a member of the (relatively recently established)
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#Binary%20size%20working%20group">#wg-binary-size</a> working group,
which is trying to find opportunities to reduce the binary size footprint of Rust programs and libraries.
Since I also maintain the <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html">Rust benchmark suite</a>, my main
task within the working group is to improve our tooling that measures and tracks the binary size of Rust programs.</p>

<p>As part of that effort, I recently added a new <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1772">command</a> to
the benchmark suite, which allows examining and comparing the sizes of individual sections and symbols of a Rust
binary (or a library) between two versions of the compiler.</p>

<p>The output of the command looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://kobzol.github.io/assets/posts/cargo-strip-release-binaries/binary-size-analysis.png" alt="Output of the binary analysis command"></p>

<p>While testing the command, I noticed something peculiar. When compiling the test binary in release mode
(using <code>--release</code>), the analysis command showed that there are (DWARF) debug symbols in the binary. My
immediate reaction was that I have a bug in my command and that I have to be compiling in debug mode by accident.
Surely Cargo wouldn’t add debug symbols to my binary in release mode by default, right? Right?</p>

<details>
  <summary>My reaction to Cargo's behavior</summary>

  <p><img src="https://kobzol.github.io/assets/posts/cargo-strip-release-binaries/cargo-meme.jpeg" alt="Anakin/Padmé meme about Cargo and debug symbols"></p>

</details>



<p>I spent maybe 15 minutes looking for the bug before I realized that there is no bug in my code. There <em>are</em> debug
symbols in each Rust binary compiled in release mode by default, and this has been true for a <em>long time</em>. In fact,
there is an <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4122">old Cargo issue</a> (almost 7-year-old, to be precise) that
mentions this exact problem.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h2>
<p>This is consequence of how the Rust standard library is distributed. When you compile a Rust crate, you don’t also
compile the standard library<sup id="fnref:build-std" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:build-std" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It comes precompiled, typically using Rustup, in the <code>rust-std</code> component.
To reduce download bandwidth<sup id="fnref:reduced-size" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reduced-size" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, it does not come in two variants (with and without debug symbols), but only in the
more general variant with debug symbols.</p>

<p>On Linux (and also other platforms), the debug symbols are embedded directly in the object files of the library itself
by default (instead of being distributed via
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#split-debuginfo">separate files</a>). Therefore, when you link
to the standard library, you get these debug symbols “for free” also in your final binary, which causes binary size
bloat.</p>

<p>This actually contradicts Cargo’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug">own documentation</a>,
which claims that if you use <code>debug = 0</code> (which is the default for release builds), the resulting binary will not contain
any debug symbols. But this is clearly not what happens now.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, Cargo was putting the debuginfo of the Rust standard library into your program by default.
It was <em>not</em> including the debuginfo of your own crate in release mode by default.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-a-problem">Why is it a problem?</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the binary size of a Rust helloworld program compiled in release mode on Linux, you’ll
notice that it has about ~4.3 MiB<sup id="fnref:rustc-version" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rustc-version" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. While it’s true that we have a lot more disk space
today than in the past, that’s still abhorrently much.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that this is a non-issue, because anyone who wants to have smaller binaries simply strips them.
That is a good point - in fact, after stripping the debug symbols from the mentioned helloworld binary<sup id="fnref:strip-cmd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:strip-cmd" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>,
its size is reduced to merely <code>415 KiB</code>, only about 10% of the original size. However, the devil is in the <del>details</del>
defaults.</p>

<p>And <strong>defaults matter!</strong> Rust advertises itself as a language that produces highly efficient and optimal code, but this
impression isn’t really supported by a helloworld application taking more than 4 megabytes of space on disk. I can
imagine a situation where a seasoned C or C++ programmer wants to try Rust, compiles a small program in release
mode, notices the resulting binary size, and then immediately gives up on the language and goes to make fun of
it on the forums.</p>

<p>Even though the issue goes away with just a single <code>strip</code> invocation, it is still a problem in my view. Rust tries to
appeal to programmers coming from many different backgrounds, and not everyone knows that something like stripping
binaries even exists. So it is important that we do a better job here, <em>by default</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the size of the <code>libstd</code> debug symbols is around 4 megabytes on Linux, and this size is constant, so even
though for helloworld it takes ~90% of the size of the resulting binary, for larger programs its effect will be smaller.
But still, four megabytes is nothing to sneeze at, since it is included in every Rust binary built everywhere by default.</p>

<h2 id="proposing-a-change-to-cargo">Proposing a change to Cargo</h2>
<p>After I have realized that this is the default behavior of Cargo, I have actually remembered that I have just
rediscovered this exact issue perhaps for the third time already. I have just never really acted upon it before and then
always managed to forget about it.</p>

<p>This time, I was determined to do something about it. But where to start? Well, usually it’s not a bad idea to just
ask around on the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/">Rust Zulip</a>, so I did <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Setting.20.60strip.3Ddebuginfo.60.20by.20default.20when.20.60debug.3D0.60">exactly that</a>.
It turns out that I wasn’t the first person to ask that very same question, and that it came up multiple times over the years.
The proposed solution was to simply strip debug symbols from Rust programs in release mode by default, which would remove
the binary size bloat problem. In the past, this used to be blocked by the stabilization of <code>strip</code> support in Cargo,
but that has actually already happened back at the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-159-2022-02-24">beginning of 2022</a>.</p>

<p>So, why wasn’t this proposal implemented yet? Were there any big concerns or blockers? Well, not really. When I
have asked around on Zulip, pretty much everyone thought that it would be a good idea. And while there were some
earlier attempts to do this, they haven’t been pushed through.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, it hasn’t been done yet because no one had done it yet :) So I set out to fix that. To test
if stripping by default could work, I created a PR to the compiler and started a perf benchmark. The binary size
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e004adb5561b724ac18f5b24584648ca4e42b6ad&amp;end=9d280f70157edca19af117734c1223f5dd0dcd52&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;tab=compile">results</a> (for tiny crates) looked pretty good, so that gave me hope that the approach of stripping by default
could indeed work.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, this change also made compilation time of tiny crates (like helloworld) up to
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e004adb5561b724ac18f5b24584648ca4e42b6ad&amp;end=9d280f70157edca19af117734c1223f5dd0dcd52&amp;stat=instructions%3Au&amp;tab=compile">2x faster</a>
on Linux! How could that be, when we’re doing more work, by including stripping in the compilation process? Well,
it turns out that the default Linux linker (<a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_5.html"><code>bfd</code></a>)
is brutally slow<sup id="fnref:bfd-speedup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bfd-speedup" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, so by removing the debug symbols from the final binary, we actually reduce the amount
of work the linker needs to perform, which makes compilation faster. Sadly, this has an observable effect only for really
tiny crates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an ongoing effort to use a faster linker (<code>lld</code>) by default on Linux (again, defaults matter <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20">). Stay tuned!</p>

<p>After showing these results to the Cargo maintainers, they have <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Setting.20.60strip.3Ddebuginfo.60.20by.20default.20when.20.60debug.3D0.60/near/408965413">asked</a>
me to write down a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4122#issuecomment-1868318860">proposal</a>
on the original Cargo issue. In this mini-proposal, I have explained what change to the Cargo defaults I want to make,
how it could be implemented, and what are other considerations of the change.</p>

<p>For example, one thing that was noted is that if we strip the debug symbols by default, then backtraces of release builds
will… not contain any debug info, such as line numbers. That is indeed true, but my claim is that these have not been useful
anyway. If you have a binary that only has debug symbols for the standard library, but not for your own code, then even
though the backtrace will contain some line numbers from <code>stdlib</code>, it will not really give you any useful context (you
can compare the difference <a href="https://gist.github.com/Kobzol/27ad8fa8aae1ccb7642925ab99ca8897">here</a>).
There were also some implementation considerations, for example how to handle situations where only some of your target’s
dependencies request debug symbols. You can find more details in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4122#issuecomment-1868318860">proposal</a>.</p>

<p>After I wrote the proposal, it went through the <abbr title="Final Comments Period">FCP</abbr> process. The Cargo team members <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4122#issuecomment-1868371491">voted</a>
on it, and once it was <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4122#issuecomment-1891039373">accepted</a> after a
10-day waiting period designed for any last concerns (the <abbr title="Final Comments Period">FCP</abbr>), I could <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257">implement</a>
the proposal, which was actually surprisingly straightforward.</p>

<p>The PR has been <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257#issuecomment-1892589315">merged</a>
a week ago, and it is now in nightly! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>The TLDR of the change is that Cargo will now by default use <code>strip = "debuginfo"</code> for the <code>release</code> profile
(unless you explicitly request debuginfo for some dependency):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[profile.release]</span>
<span># v This is now used by default, if not provided</span>
<span>strip</span> <span>=</span> <span>"debuginfo"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In fact, this new default will be used for <em>any profile</em> which does not enable debuginfo anywhere in its dependency
chain, not just for the <code>release</code> profile.</p>

<p>There was one unresolved concern about using <code>strip</code> on macOS, because it seems that there can be some
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11641">issues</a> with it. The change has been in nightly for a week and
I haven’t seen any problems, but if this will cause any issues, we can also perform the debug symbols stripping selectively,
only on some platforms (e.g. Linux and Windows). Let us know if you find any issues with stripping using Cargo on macOS!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, this was yet another case of “if you want it done, just do it”, which is common in open-source projects :)
I’m glad the change went through, and I hope that we won’t find any major issues with it and that it will be stabilized
in the upcoming months.</p>
