<p>One of my pet peeves is when command-line tools look for user configuration
files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> when running on macOS. In addition to
offering poor ergonomics for users, I believe this behavior is <em>incorrect</em>
according to the documentation which is cited to justify it. Instead,
command-line tools should implement the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>
and look for configuration files in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, which defaults to
<code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, when a program looks for configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, it’s not because of an intentional design decision. Instead, the
author delegated that decision to a library, and several popular libraries for
determining platform-specific configuration directories use
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> as the default configuration directory on
macOS, including <a href="https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/">Python’s <code>platformdirs</code> package</a> (<a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/platformdirs">242
million downloads / month</a>), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-paths">JavaScript’s
<code>env-paths</code></a> (95 million downloads / month), <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/dirs">Rust’s <code>dirs</code>
crate</a> (4.8 million downloads / month), and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/adrg/xdg">Go’s <code>adrg/xdg</code>
package</a> (used in 913 packages). While <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>
may be the correct configuration directory for <em>GUI apps</em> which manage their
configuration files for the user automatically, the vast majority of
applications using these libraries are command-line utilities whose
configuration belongs in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>The main reason I dislike programs looking for dotfiles in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is that it’s <em>unexpected.</em> As <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/893#issuecomment-1736736555">Ashlin Eldridge
explained on GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a new user, it’s extremely surprising to me to that a modern tool like
<code>nu</code> would put config files under Application Support on macOS. It’s even
more surprising to see that some people are
<a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/discussions/5279">actively</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33425312">against</a> adopting the XDG
standard.</p>
<p>The origins of XDG no longer matter at this point. No one really cares what
the X, D, and G stand for. The fact is that
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.jp/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">hundreds</a> of tools
support it (including Git, Emacs, Neovim, Tmux) and users have come to expect
support for it. It’s the closest thing we have to a standard that allows
users to control the placement of their config files (which facilitates
users’ ability to source control their files) and it also includes support
for files that shouldn’t be source controlled such as cache and data files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a user explains that they found a program’s behavior surprising, many
engineers will respond by telling the user that their expectations were wrong.
However, I find that the reason users form an incorrect mental model of a
program’s behavior is usually because the program’s design violated an
established convention from some broader context. In accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">the
Principle of Least Astonishment</a>, I prefer to change the program to
behave how users expect rather than futilely attempt to change what users
expect.</p>
<p>Users expect macOS CLI tools to look for configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> is
because <strong>that’s what almost every other program does.</strong> Your program should
probably not disagree with Bash and Vim and Git about where configuration files
are supposed to go!</p>
<p>These conventions help us explore unfamiliar systems by letting us apply
knowledge about one part of the system to other parts of the system.
Consistency is predictability. When every tool works the same except for a
small handful, users get justifiably annoyed at the exceptions for wasting
their time.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-dotfile-managers-do"><a href="#what-do-dotfile-managers-do" aria-label="Link to section what-do-dotfile-managers-do">#</a>What do dotfile managers do?</h2>
<p>Many engineers use (or maintain) some sort of dotfile manager to handle
tracking these configuration files. If configuration files are really supposed
to go in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, we would expect dotfile managers to
put configuration files there by default when running on macOS. After all, the
whole point of a dotfile manager is to simplify managing configuration files
across multiple machines and platforms. Let’s take a quick survey to see how
some popular dotfile managers behave on macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/">chezmoi</a> (14.3k stars) makes no effort to link
configuration to <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, despite including
<a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/machines/macos/">documentation for using chezmoi on macOS
specifically</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">dotbot</a> (7.3k stars) ignores
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. Despite including macOS-specific
configuration files in the examples, the README shows a configuration for VS
Code that will be completely ignored on macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm">yadm</a> (5.5k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. The example configurations include
macOS-specific portions but also do not reference <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm">rcm</a> (3.2k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a> makes (unsurprisingly) no
effort to support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these tools are <em>able</em> to link configuration files to
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> if you ask them to explicitly (although macOS
will regularly replace your symlinks with copies of the destination files), but
the fact that they don’t bother to do so by default is revealing. Users only
want this behavior for specific misbehaving programs.</p>
<h2 id="an-appeal-to-logic"><a href="#an-appeal-to-logic" aria-label="Link to section an-appeal-to-logic">#</a>An appeal to logic</h2>
<p>Perhaps “consistency” isn’t a good enough reason for you to place your
program’s configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> like everybody else. Maybe you
think that programs should follow the platform guidelines, even if they don’t
match developer expectations. <a href="https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs/issues/47#issuecomment-478337412">@soc on GitHub</a> phrases it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general advice for macOS devs: If you are developing on their platform,
do what the platform owners tell you. They are the lords, you are the
share-croppers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/12103#issuecomment-1982144513">Reilly Wood rebukes</a> a user asking if there would “be any
downside to just not using <code>Application Support</code> ever” by saying that “[Nushell
would] no longer be following the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard Directories
guidelines</a>.”</p>
<p>We’ll read through those guidelines in a minute, but it’s not entirely clear to
me that they’re relevant in the first place. The <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory
Specification</a> mentions Unix a few times but lists no carveouts for macOS
or any other operating system. If <code>~/.config</code> is accepted as the standard
location for configuration files on Unix-like operating systems, then surely it
would be the standard location on macOS as well, given that macOS is a Unix by
way of BSD.</p>
<p>But suppose we accept that the XDG specification only applies to <em>some</em> Unix
operating systems, despite making no mention of this. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard
Directories</a> documentation starts by stating that
“[w]hether provided by the system or created by your app, every file has its
place in macOS”, and honestly we could stop reading right there, because <strong>a
command-line tool is not the system or an app.</strong></p>
<p>While this might seem like a pedantic nitpick, in reality it’s <em>critical</em> to
correctly interpreting this documentation! I suspect that many of the
developers who cite these guidelines do not know very much about macOS and
think that “app” is just what macOS calls executables, but that’s not true. A
couple screens down, the same page says that <code>/bin</code> “[c]ontains essential
command-line binaries”, so we can be sure the authors aren’t conflating apps
and command-line tools. Apps on macOS are installed in <code>/Applications</code> and are
subject to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution">a number of additional requirements</a>, from a bundle ID
(a unique reverse-DNS identifier for an app, like <code>com.apple.Preview</code> for
<code>Preview.app</code>) to application icons, launch screens, code signing,
notarization, app sandboxing, and runtime hardening. Needless to say, none of
the developers shipping command-line utilities are following any of <em>these</em>
guidelines.</p>
<p>Moving on, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/MacOSXDirectories/MacOSXDirectories.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH10-SW1">the documentation for <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></a> says that it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contains all app-specific data and support files. These are the files that
your app creates and manages on behalf of the user and can include files that
contain user data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, command-line tools do not have <em>any</em> app-specific data because they are
not apps. Further, dotfiles are usually written by hand and not managed <em>on
behalf of</em> the user.</p>
<p>The next paragraph makes it very clear that <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is
for apps only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By convention, all of these items should be put in a subdirectory whose name
matches the bundle identifier of the app. For example, if your app is named
<code>MyApp</code> and has the bundle identifier <code>com.example.MyApp</code>, you would put your
app’s user-specific data files and resources in the <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.example.MyApp/</code> directory. Your app is responsible for creating
this directory as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Command-line tools do not have a bundle identifier, including many command-line
tools shipped with macOS by Apple (such as <code>ls</code> or <code>vim</code>). And even though
<a href="https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix/issues/515">Apple feels very comfortable shipping command-line tools that behave in a
subtly different manner from their equivalents on other modern Unix-descendent
operating systems,</a> the macOS variants of <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, <code>git</code>, and
<code>vim</code> all look for their configuration files in the same place: <code>~/.config</code>.
Unless your tool is installed in <code>/Applications</code>, there’s no reason for its
configuration to live in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-use-library-application-support"><a href="#when-should-you-use-library-application-support" aria-label="Link to section when-should-you-use-library-application-support">#</a>When <em>should</em> you use <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></h2>
<p>With the guidelines and conventions listed above in mind, your application
should store its configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> instead
of <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> if both of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a GUI application installed in <code>/Applications</code> or <code>~/Applications</code>.</li>
<li>It manages its configuration files automatically on behalf of the user,
rather than expecting the user to write their configuration in a text file
themself.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr" aria-label="Link to section tl-dr">#</a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Users do not expect command-line tools to look for configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. Dotfile managers do not place
configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. The most
commonly-cited justifications for placing configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> are not meant to apply to command-line tools at
all. Even command-line tools like <code>bash</code> and <code>git</code> shipped by Apple look for
their configuration files in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Please, please, <em>please</em> just use the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">minute-long clip of a Will Smith concert</a> is blowing up online for all the wrong reasons, with people accusing him of using AI to generate fake crowds filled with fake fans carrying fake signs. The story’s blown up a bit, with coverage in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/will-smith-ai-crowd-tour-video-1235415353/">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/will-smith-accused-of-creating-ai-fans-in-new-tour-video-3887232">NME</a>, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">The Independent</a>, and <a href="https://consequence.net/2025/08/will-smith-ai-crowds-video/">Consequence of Sound</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And it definitely looks terrible! The faces have all the characteristics of AI slop, with familiar artifacts like uncanny features, smeared faces, multiple fingers/limbs, and nonsensical signage. “From West Philly to West Swig̴̙̕g̷̤̔͜y”?</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-300x169.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-768x432.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>It gets worse the more you look at it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But here’s where things get complicated.</p>



<p><strong>The crowds are real. </strong>Every person you see in the video above started out as real footage of real fans, pulled from video of multiple Will Smith concerts during his recent European tour.</p>







<p>The main Will Smith performance footage in the clip is from the Positiv Festival, held last month at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMx76OzMdxO/">Théâtre Antique d’Orange</a> in Orange, France. (Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLQ-fARByI">phone recording</a> from the audience of the first half of the performance.) It’s intercut with various shots of audiences from Gurtenfestival and Paléo in Switzerland, the Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, among others.</p>



<p>From this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMfgAkXRSyF/">slideshow of photos</a> from the Paléo festival in Nyon, Switzerland, you can see professionally-shot photos of the same audience from the video. </p>



<p>The signs, previously distorted, can now be read, like this one which actually reads “From West Philly to West Swizzy.” (Short for Switzerland, if you’re wondering.)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="662" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-1024x662.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-768x496.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-800x517.jpg 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1024x678.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-768x509.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-2048x1357.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-800x530.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>One of the most egregious examples is the couple holding the sign thanking Will Smith for helping them survive cancer which — <em>if it was AI-generated slop</em> — would be pretty disgusting: a gross attempt to drum up sympathy with fake people.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">article</a> posted by <em>The Independent</em> today, music editor Roisin O’Connor points to the couple as clear evidence of AI generation: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Another shot shows a man’s knuckle appear to blur along with his sign, which reads ‘You Can Make It’ helped me survive cancer. THX Will.’ Meanwhile, the woman in front of him is seemingly holding his hand, but the headband of the woman behind her is somehow over her wrist.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But the couple is real</strong>. There’s two good photos of them on Will Smith’s Instagram in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVPEtPscFM/?img_index=5">slideshow</a> of photos and videos from Gurtenfestival in Bern last month.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="636" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1024x636.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1024x636.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-300x186.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-768x477.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1536x953.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-2048x1271.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-800x497.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can see them in this video from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMT6bldoD2G/">Will Smith’s Instagram post</a>, which I clipped below.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Two Levels of AI Enhancement</h2>



<p>So if these fans aren’t AI-generated fakes, what’s going on here?</p>



<p>The video features real performances and real audiences, but I believe they were manipulated on two levels:</p>



<ol>
<li>Will Smith’s team generated several short AI image-to-video clips from professionally-shot audience photos</li>



<li>YouTube post-processed the resulting Shorts montage, making everything look so much worse</li>
</ol>



<p>Let’s start with YouTube.</p>



<h2>YouTube’s Shorts “Experiment”</h2>



<p>Will Smith’s team also uploaded this same video to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNQsphpxgrg/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/739450732135683">Facebook</a>, where it looks <em>considerably</em> better than the copy on YouTube, without the smeary sheen of uncanny detail.</p>



<p>I put them side-by-side below. Try going full-screen and pause at any point to see the difference. The Instagram footage is noticeably better throughout, though some of the audience clips still have issues.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Will Smith Concert Footage - YouTube Shorts vs. Instagram" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bx5GzIsmEBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For the last <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/08/youtube-shorts-ai-upscaling/683946/">two months</a>, it turns out that YouTube was quietly experimenting with post-processing YouTube Shorts videos: unblurring and denoising videos with often-unpleasant results.</p>



<p>I first heard about this ten days ago, when guitarist Rhett Shull <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nhP8tvbLY">posted a great video</a> about the issue, which now has over 700k views.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>Five days ago, YouTube finally confirmed it was happening. YouTube’s Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467">posted on X</a> about the experiment.</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-300x211.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-768x541.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-800x563.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15.png 1298w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<blockquote>
<div><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958241868736815311">followup reply</a>, Ritchie clarified the difference, as he saw it:</p><p>GenAI typically refers to technologies like transformers and large language models, which are relatively new. Upscaling typically refers to taking one resolution (like SD/480p) and making it look good at a higher resolution (like HD/1080p). This isn’t using GenAI or doing any upscaling. It’s using the kind of machine learning you experience with computational photography on smartphones, for example, and it’s not changing the resolution.</p></div>

<p>On Friday, Alex Reisner wrote about “<a href="https://archive.is/JjXn9#selection-581.0-586.0">YouTube’s Sneaky AI ‘Experiment’</a>” in <em>The Atlantic</em>, and got another official statement from Google:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I asked Google, YouTube’s parent company, about what’s happening to these videos, the spokesperson Allison Toh wrote, “We’re running an experiment on select YouTube Shorts that uses image enhancement technology to sharpen content. These enhancements are not done with generative AI.” But this is a tricky statement: “Generative AI” has no strict technical definition, and “image enhancement technology” could be anything. I asked for more detail about which technologies are being employed, and to what end. Toh said YouTube is “using traditional machine learning to unblur, denoise, and improve clarity in videos,” she told me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I agree with Reisner that it’s likely that a diffusion model is at work here and Google is trying to split hairs over the definition of “generative AI” because of how divisive it is. </p>



<h2>Will Smith’s Generated Videos</h2>



<p>That explains why the entire YouTube Shorts video has that smeary look to it that isn’t present throughout the copy posted on Instagram, but <em>both</em> versions have those terrible audience shots with AI artifacts and garbled signage.</p>



<p>After looking at it, I believe that Will Smith’s team was using a generative video model, but not to create entirely new audience footage, like most people suspect.</p>



<p>Instead, they started with photos shot by their official tour photographers, and used those photos in <a href="https://academy.runwayml.com/gen4/gen4-image-to-video">Runway</a>, <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/veo-3-fast-image-to-video-capabilities-now-available-gemini-api/">Veo 3</a>, or a similar image-to-video model to create a short animated clip suitable for a concert montage.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to the crowd photo from Paléo in Switzerland:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-225x300.png 225w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-800x1067.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16.png 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure>



<p>I believe this is the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> photo that the crowd shot in the video was generated with. Here it is as a two-frame animation, with the first frame from the AI video overlaid on the original photo.</p>

<p>Here’s another example. The photo below was taken at Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNBJHKmx75j/?img_index=14">posted to Will Smith’s</a> Instagram three weeks ago.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png 819w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-240x300.png 240w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-768x960.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-800x1000.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px"></figure>



<p>And here’s the AI-generated clip that it was turned into.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" controls="" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fresh_prince.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Virtually all of the commenters on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22will+smith%22+ai&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=top&amp;t=week">Reddit</a>, and X believe this was fake footage of fake fans, generated by Will Smith’s team to prop up a lackluster tour. </p>



<p>Like the faces in the video, the truth is blurry. </p>



<p>The crowds were real, but the videos were manipulated: first by Will Smith’s team, and then without asking, by YouTube.</p>



<p>We can debate the ethics of using an image-to-video model to animate photos in this way, but I think it’s meaningfully different than what most people were accusing Will Smith of doing here: using generative AI video to fake a sold-out crowd of passionate fans.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-08-25/us-retail-giants-raise-prices-and-seek-new-import-sources-due-to-tariffs.html">https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-08-25/us-retail-giants-raise-prices-and-seek-new-import-sources-due-to-tariffs.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45021955">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>Four of the main retail groups in the United States — including the country’s and the world’s largest, Walmart — have highlighted in their respective second-quarter earnings presentations the complexities their businesses face due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html">tariffs imposed by the Trump administration</a>. These tariffs have been the main topic of discussion for Walmart, Home Depot, Target, and Lowe’s — listed retailers that are already feeling, to a greater or lesser extent, the effects of this trade policy.</p><p>As for results, the impacts have been cushioned by the companies’ swift reaction, which involved applying various price increases, as well as activating efforts to achieve greater cost efficiencies. As Walmart’s president and CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged: “We’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.” Target’s CEO, Brian Cornell, echoed this sentiment: “The straight cost impact of tariffs will be with us as long as the tariffs are with us.”</p><p>All eyes were on Walmart. The global retail giant had already warned, in its first-quarter earnings release, that it could not absorb all the cost pressures resulting from tariffs, given the company’s — and the industry’s — thin margins. Even U.S. President Donald Trump pressured the company to absorb those expenses against its margins.</p><p>“We’re doing what we said we would do,” Doug McMillon explained last week. “We’re keeping our prices as low as we can, for as long as we can,” he added, reflecting the constant pressure on costs that continue to rise. “As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.” </p><h3>Protecting margins</h3><p>According to its financial disclosures, Walmart has acted surgically on its pricing to protect its margins. The group increased its revenues in the first half of the year by 3.7%, compared with a 3.6% increase in procurement costs, allowing it to hold steady and even gain a tenth of a point in gross margin. The same pattern is seen in the second quarter alone: sales grew by 4.75%, while costs rose by 4.7%.</p><p>“We’re focused on the customer, kind of the fundamentals of the business, whether it’s pricing or inventory management,” McMillan explained. On the latter point, tariffs are also making themselves felt. In Walmart’s case, inventory value rose in the first half of the year by $2.1 billion, up 3.7% from a year earlier, “due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html">higher import costs.</a>”</p><p>The retail giant clarified that most of its purchases are made in the U.S., while one-third come from abroad — mainly China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada. In the case of China, it is facing the looming threat of a 145% tariff, up from the current 30%.</p><p>Diversification of import sources is now a key concern for U.S. retailers. “Our teams have done an incredible job partnering with our vendors to diversify product sourcing,” Home Depot’s executive vice president, Billy Bastek, said last week. “We will continue to work with our vendors to ensure that we have the right products at the right value in stock.” He specified that 50% of its merchandise is not subject to tariffs since it is sourced within the U.S.</p><p>Home Depot — the world’s largest home improvement retailer — acknowledges that there will be “modest price movements for some categories” because current tariffs “are significantly higher than last quarter,” according to Bastek. He also announced a reduction in promotional activity for part of its offerings.</p><p>Like Walmart, Home Depot has fine-tuned its pricing strategy, especially in the second quarter. During that period, its revenues grew 4.86%, while procurement expenses increased 4.84% — enough to support its margin.</p><h3>Exposure to foreign markets</h3><p>Two other major U.S. retailers are more exposed to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html">high levels of imports</a>. Lowe’s — which also specializing in home improvement products — sources 60% of its merchandise outside the U.S., with 20% coming from China. “It wasn’t that way seven years ago,” said Lowe’s chairman and CEO, Marvin R. Ellison, last week. “We have done, in my estimation, an excellent job of working cross functionally relative to looking for diversification.”</p><p>Like the rest of the sector, Lowe’s is also applying price increases with a category-specific approach. “Specific to pricing, we said [...] we would be pricing competitive [...] That’s what we’re continuing to do,” said Ellison. “Prices in retail will always be dynamic. Your prices will fluctuate up and down through various categories based on competitive responses, internal algorithms.” The company’s sales rose 1.6%, while procurement costs increased by 1% — another case of protecting margins.</p><p>Target, meanwhile, acknowledged that, “as one of the largest importers in the country, the prospect of higher tariffs meant we were facing some major financial and operational hurdles,” said Cornell, who will step down as CEO next year. The company’s trajectory is further complicated by “multiple changes in tariff policy that have been announced and implemented as the year has progressed,” he added.</p><p>For this reason, the supermarket chain has adopted various mitigation strategies, including “diversifying” production and sourcing countries. “We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort,” said Target executive vice president, Rick Gomez, last week.</p><p>The company — one of the benchmarks in traditional retail — has posted declining sales for three consecutive years, a trend that continued into the first half of this year. Sales fell 1.9% in that period, though the decline eased to 0.9% in the second quarter. Its inventory rose 2%, “reflecting higher product costs than a year ago, driven by tariffs and other pressures.”</p><p>Of the four companies analyzed, Target was the only one whose gross margin worsened in the second quarter. It declined by one percentage point, after merchandise costs increased 0.5% while sales fell 0.9%. The company expects to complete its recovery in 2026.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i> to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/">https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45021078">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Lately I’ve been trying to find (and understand) the limits of time
syncing between Linux systems. How accurate can you get? What does it
take to get that? And what things can easily add measurable amounts of
time error?</p>
<p>After most of a month (!), I’m starting to understand things. This is
kind of a follow-on to <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/04/10/improving-ntp-accuracy/">a
previous post</a>, where I walked through my setup and goals, plus <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/15/time-syncing-101/">another
post</a> where I discussed time syncing in general. I’m trying to get
the clocks on a bunch of Linux systems on my network synced as closely
as possible so I can trust the timestamps on <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces">distributed
tracing</a> records that occur on different systems. My local network
round-trip times are in the <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2024/12/18/networks-still-awe-me-sometimes/">20–30
microsecond (μS) range</a> and I’d like clocks to be less than 1 RTT
apart from each other. Ideally, they’d be within 1 μS, but 10 μS is
fine.</p>
<p>It’s easy to fire up <a href="https://chrony-project.org/">Chrony</a>
against a local GPS<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Technically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation">GNSS</a>,
which covers multiple satellite-backed navigation systems, not just the
US GPS system, but I’m going to keep saying “GPS” for short.</span></span>-backed time source and see it claim to be within X
nanoseconds of GPS, but it’s tricky to figure out if Chrony is right or
not. Especially once it’s claiming to be more accurate than the
network’s round-trip time<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>20 μS or so.</span></span>, the amount of time needed for a single CPU cache
miss<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>50-ish nanoseconds.</span></span>, or even the amount of time that light would take to span
the gap between the server and the time source.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>About 5 ns per meter.</span></span></p>
<p>I’ve spent <em>way</em> too much time over the past month digging
into time, and specifically the limits of what you can accomplish with
Linux, Chrony, and GPS. I’ll walk through all of that here eventually,
but let me spoil the conclusion and give some limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPSes don’t return perfect time. I routinely see up to 200 ns
differences between the 3 GPSes on my desk when viewing their output on
an oscilloscope. The time gap between the 3 sources varies every second,
and it’s rare to see all three within 20 ns of each other. Even the best
GPS timing modules that I’ve seen list ~5 ns of jitter on their
datasheets. I’d be surprised if you could get 3-5 GPS receivers to agree
within 50 ns or so without careful management of consistent antenna
cable length, etc.</li>
<li>Even small amounts of network complexity can easily add 200-300 ns
of systemic error to your measurements.</li>
<li>Different NICs and their drivers vary widely on how good they are
for sub-microsecond timing. From what I’ve seen, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/211608/intel-ethernet-network-adapter-e810xxvda4t/specifications.html">Intel
E810 NIC</a>s are <em>great</em>, Intel X710s are very good, Mellanox
ConnectX-5 are okay, Mellanox ConnectX-3 and <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/07/connectx-4-and-linuxptp/">ConnectX-4</a>
are borderline, and everything from Realtek is questionable.</li>
<li>A lot of Linux systems are <em>terrible</em> at low-latency work.
There are a lot of causes for this, but one of the biggest is random
“stalls” due to the system’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_BIOS">SMBIOS</a>
running to handle power management or other activities, and “pausing”
the observable computer for hundreds of microseconds or longer. In
general, there’s no good way to know if a given system
(<em>especially</em> cheap systems) will be good or bad for timing
without testing them. I have two cheap mini PC systems that have
inexplicably bad time syncing behavior,<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>1300-2000 ns.</span></span> and two others with inexplicably <em>good</em> time
syncing<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>20-50 ns</span></span>. Dedicated server hardware is generally more
consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I’m able to sync clocks to within 500 ns or so on the
bulk of the systems on my network. That’s good enough for my purposes,
but it’s not as good as I’d expected to see.</p>
<p>Now, it’s <em>certainly</em> possible to do better than this in
specific cases. For examples, see <a href="https://chrony-project.org/examples.html">Chrony’s examples
page</a>, where they get &lt;100 ns of error over the network for a
specific test case. <em>In general</em>, though it’s going to be hard to
do much better than 200 ns consistently across a real network without a
lot of careful engineering.</p>
<p>I’ll explain my conclusions in a bit, but first some background and
context.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>For the sake of testing time, I’m using 8 different (but identical)
servers as time clients and 5 different GPS-backed time sources, all
local.</p>

<h3 id="time-sources">Time Sources</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>ntp1</code>: an older LeoNTP GPS-backed NTP server. In the
garage, connected to its own outdoor GPS antenna. Only has a 10/100 Mbps
Ethernet connection, but this hasn’t mattered in practice.</li>
<li><code>ntp2</code>: identical hardware to <code>ntp1</code>. Sitting
on my desk and connected to a different Ethernet switch. Connected to a
<a href="">GPS antenna splitter</a> and an outdoor antenna.</li>
<li>My desktop. A 32-core AMD Threadripper 5975WX with a ConnectX-6 NIC
(2x40 Gbps) for network traffic and an Intel E810-XXVDA4T (using 2x10
Gbps, one to each switch) with a GPS receiver and hardware timing
support. Shares the antenna with <code>ntp2</code>, <code>ntp4</code>,
and <code>ntp5</code>.</li>
<li><code>ntp4</code>:<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>Where is NTP3 you ask? I ran out of antenna ports, and
anyway the system that I dubbed <code>ntp3</code> only supports PTP, not
NTP.</span></span> a Raspberry Pi CM5 with a Timebeat GPS module including
PPS timing straight to the NIC. Connected via 1 GbE.</li>
<li><code>ntp5</code>: a Raspberry Pi CM5 with a Waveshare GPS module
with GPIO PPS but no working Ethernet PPS. Connected via 1 GbE.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="test-devices">Test Devices</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eight identical servers (<code>d1</code> through <code>d8</code>)
running Ubuntu 24.04 with identical Chrony configs. The servers are <a href="https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/c05069171">HPE M510 blades</a> with
16 Xeon-D cores in a pair of <a href="https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/c05211200">HPE EL4000
enclosures</a>. Each enclosure is connected to both of the core
switches, giving each of the 8 servers 2 dedicated 10 GbE links via a
built-in Mellanox ConnectX-3 NIC. <a href="https://github.com/SuperQ/chrony_exporter">Chrony metrics</a> are
collected every 10 seconds and stored in <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> for analysis.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://siglentna.com/product/sds1204x-e-200-mhz/#">Siglent
SDS1204X-E Oscilloscope</a> connected to the PPS outputs from
<code>ntp2</code>, <code>ntp4</code>, and my desktop. It can show
relative differences in PPS times within about a nanosecond.<span><label for="sn-7"></label><span>The oscilloscope only has 200 MHz bandwidth but
captures 1 billion samples per second, so I’d expect it to be able to
show differences between PPS sources to somewhere between 1 and 5
nanoseconds. In any case, the observed differences are much larger than
this, see below.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="network">Network</h3>
<p>The core of the network is a pair of <a href="https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Datasheets/7050QX-32_32S_Datasheet_S.pdf">Arista
7050QX-32S</a> switches. These are 32-port 40 GbE switches with hardware
support for PTP. They’re older, but very solid.</p>
<p>Linux systems with multiple network connections (the 8 test servers
and my desktop) are connected to each with a /30 link per interface and
then run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First">OSPF</a>
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing">ECMP</a>
to provide redundancy. Devices with a single network interface
(Raspberry Pis and LeoNTP devices in this example) are connected to
layer 2 switches which are then connected to the core switches via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-chassis_link_aggregation_group">MLAG</a>
links. This means that there are multiple possible paths between any two
devices through the network, as both ECMP and LAG use a mix of source
and destination addresses to decide which link to use. So the path
between <code>d1</code> and <code>ntp1</code> may be almost completely
different from the path between <code>d2</code> and <code>ntp1</code>,
even though <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> are sitting less than an
inch from each other and share all of the same physical network links.
Even more entertaining, the path <em>back</em> from <code>ntp1</code> to
<code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> may or may not be the same as the
forward path. This only matters when nanosecond-level timings are
involved, as we’ll see in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-error">Sources of Error</h2>
<p>So — finally — I have multiple NTP servers, presumably synced to GPS
satellites as accurately as possible, and multiple servers, all synced
to the NTP servers over a relatively low-latency network. How accurately
are my servers syncing to GPS time? And where is that going wrong?</p>
<h3 id="chronys-claims">Chrony’s claims</h3>
<p>So, if you’re trying to see how accurate Chrony’s time syncing is,
the easiest place to start is with Chrony’s own metrics. In this case,
Chrony claims that it’s had a median offset of 25–110 ns over the past
day:</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t the best metric for a number of reasons, but it’s a
start. It says that Chrony thinks that it’s synced to within 110 ns of
<em>something</em>, but it doesn’t really tell us anything about what
it’s synced to or how accurate it actually is. So, let’s dig in a bit
deeper.</p>
<h3 id="gps-error-and-drift">GPS error and drift</h3>
<p>First, the GPS receivers in my NTP time servers aren’t perfectly
accurate. Even top-tier GPS receivers will still have ~5 ns of timing
noise, and lower-tier ones will be 20–60 ns (or possibly higher).<span><label for="sn-8"></label><span>Datasheet links: the <a href="https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/ZED-F9T-10B_DataSheet_UBX-20033635.pdf">ublox
ZED-F9T</a> in my desktop claims 5 ns of accuracy and 4 ns of jitter.
The <a href="https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/documents/NEO-LEA-M8T-FW3_DataSheet_UBX-15025193.pdf">ublox
NEO-M8T</a> in NTP5 (not graphed here) claims 20-500ns of accuracy,
depending on the antenna. And <a href="https://www.leontp.com/firmware/LeoNTP-InstructionManual-Latest.pdf">LeoNTP</a>
claims 30ns of RMS accuracy and 60ns of 99-th percentile accuracy.</span></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is relatively easy to measure, at least when the
devices are within a few feet of each other. You can connect an
oscilloscope to their PPS outputs and directly view the differences
between them. Here’s the result for <code>ntp2</code>,
<code>ntp4</code>, and my desktop:</p>
<figure>

Timecard Mini Essential</a> is on top in yellow, then the LeoNTP in
purple, and an Intel E810 on the bottom in blue. Animated; each update
covers 1 second of real time.</p>
</small>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that (a) they don’t all agree and (b) they move around
relative to each other. In this sample, there’s about a 200ns difference
between NTP4 (top, yellow) and my desktop (bottom, blue). Some of this
is due to cable length differences (my antenna and PPS leads aren’t all
identical-length, so there’s probably ~20ns in difference there alone),
but that doesn’t explain all of it.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the NTP4, there’s ~25ns in variance between
<code>ntp2</code> (purple, middle) and my desktop (blue, bottom). Notice
that they move relative to each other over time in a bit of a
pattern.</p>
<p>In general, offsets can <em>mostly</em> be compensated for, either in
Chrony or directly on the GPS device, but jitter is trickier.</p>
<p>Depending on how you look at things, I’m seeing a <em>minimum</em> of
25 ns of error at this level, and potentially up to 200ns.</p>
<p>When you give Chrony multiple time sources that are all equivalently
good, then it’ll generally average its time across the whole set of
sources. So adding one time source with 200 ns of offset to 2 other
mostly-identical time sources should only add ~67 ns of error at most,
and possibly no error at all, if Chrony decides that the 200 ns source
is too far off to be used.</p>
<h3 id="network-error">Network error</h3>
<p>Chrony tries to compensate for network delays when it syncs to NTP
sources over the network, but it has to make some assumptions that
aren’t always true. It assumes that network delays are symmetrical (that
is, if it takes 30 μS for network traffic to get from the client to the
server and back, then it takes 15 μS each way). This isn’t generally
true, but for a lot of networks it’s close enough.</p>
<p>Apparently it’s not particularly true for my network.</p>
<p>One of the things that I’m monitoring with Chrony and Prometheus is
the current offset for each time source on each Chrony client. I have
data for my 8 test servers (<code>d1</code> through <code>d8</code>)
tracking the relative offsets for <code>ntp1</code> and
<code>ntp2</code>. I was expecting to see that either <code>ntp1</code>
or <code>ntp2</code> was consistently ahead of the other one, given
cable lengths, network delays, antenna differences, and so forth.</p>
<p>Instead, half of the servers see <code>ntp1</code> as running faster,
while half show <code>ntp2</code> as running faster:</p>

<p>The servers can’t agree on whether <code>ntp1</code> runs faster than
<code>ntp2</code> or not — 4 of the 8 see <code>ntp1</code> as faster,
while 4 see <code>ntp2</code> as faster, with the servers in two bands
around +100ns and -300ns. This has been consistent for weeks.<span><label for="sn-9"></label><span>To be clear, since half of the <code>d*</code> servers
are in one enclosure and half are in another: the timing differences are
basically random, and don’t follow which chassis they’re in or which
network cables they use. Of the 4 physical servers in each enclosure, 2
think <code>ntp1</code> is faster and 2 think <code>ntp2</code> is
faster, but <em>which</em> two aren’t even consistent between
enclosures.</span></span></p>
<p>Presumably this is caused by asymmetric traffic paths in my network.
If you look back to the network diagram above, you’ll see that the test
servers each have a link to each core switch, and that the L2 switches
that the NTP servers use are each connected to both core switches. Any
time you have redundant links like this, <em>something</em> has to
decide which path any given packet is going to take over the network. In
general network people <em>really</em> dislike just picking paths at
random, largely because that’d mean that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_delivery">packets could
arrive out of order</a>, and a lot of TCP stacks hate out-of-order
traffic. So, generally, traffic is assigned to a path using a hash of
source and destination addresses.<span><label for="sn-10"></label><span>The exact implementation varies widely and is
frequently configurable on higher-end devices. For L2 links most devices
just hash the source and destination MACs, while for L3 links the hash
<em>usually</em> includes the source and destination IPs and may include
the TCP/UDP port numbers or other easy-to-locate data.</span></span></p>
<p>Presumably one of the possible paths between servers and time sources
on the network is faster than the others, and paths that hash onto the
faster path consistently skew the results in one direction or the other.
A less complex (and less redundant!) network would have less of this
sort of error, but asymmetric round trip times show up
<em>everywhere</em> in networking when you’re counting nanoseconds. At
some level, this isn’t avoidable.</p>
<p>So, on my network, this seems to cause a minimum of 200ns of
potential error, as various paths take different amounts of time, and
Chrony isn’t able to compensate automatically.<span><label for="sn-11"></label><span>Chrony has a per-source setting for adjusting latency
asymmetry, so I could probably hand-adjust all 16 (<code>d*</code> -&gt;
<code>ntp*</code>) config lines to minimize the error if I
<em>really</em> cared about ~200 ns of error, but it’s unlikely that
it’d buy me much useful accuracy.</span></span></p>
<h3 id="cross-server-synchronization">Cross-server synchronization</h3>
<p>As an experiment, I told all 8 of my test servers to use each other
as time sources. I added them using Chrony’s <code>noselect</code> flag,
so they wouldn’t try to use each other as authoritative; they’d just
monitor the relative offsets between servers and record them over
time.<span><label for="sn-12"></label><span>I’m actually measuring time <em>really</em>
aggressively between <code>d*</code> servers. I’m polling every 250 ms
and averaging across 5 samples to try to minimize noise. Flags from
<code>chrony.conf</code>:
<code>server xxx noselect xleave presend 9 minpoll -2 maxpoll -2 filter 5 extfield F323</code></span></span></p>
<p>Here’s the median<span><label for="sn-13"></label><span>Note that the median isn’t really the best way to look
for offsets <em>in general</em>, but since Chrony maintains its own view
of time and slowly adjusts it time relative to its sources, so a few
wildly inaccurate responses won’t really change Chrony’s time much, if
at all.</span></span> offset between servers, in nanoseconds, over 4 hours:</p>

<p>Notice that they’re all within 207ns of each other, but the timings
aren’t particularly consistent. For instance, looking at the timings
between <code>d2</code> and <code>d3</code> show that they’re 29 ns
apart when you query one direction and 23 ns apart when you query in the
other direction, but they’re both off in the <em>same</em> direction. If
network error wasn’t a factor, then I’d expect to see one number be
positive and the other be negative; that’s not always the case here.</p>
<p>In general, this aligns nicely with the 200-300ns of error seen in
the previous section, but it shows that there’s a serious limit to how
accurately Chrony can measure nanoseconds on this hardware.</p>
<h3 id="observed-offsets-across-all-sources">Observed offsets across all
sources</h3>
<p>Earlier, I discussed the difference between <code>ntp1</code> and
<code>ntp2</code>, and how each server had a different view of the
difference between them. On average, <code>ntp1</code> seems to run
50–150 ns ahead of <code>ntp2</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that my big goal here is less <em>accurate</em> time and
more <em>consistent</em> time. This 50–150 ns of inconsistency isn’t a
big deal, but when I started adding additional time sources, I
discovered that some of them were even further away from
<code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code>, and I wanted to minimize the
total time spread. I’d really like it if adding additional NTP sources
to the mix didn’t make things even less consistent.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about the LeoNTP time servers, but
configurability <em>isn’t</em> one of them. There’s no way that I can
see to add an offset between GPS time and the NTP time that they export.
On the other hand, the 3 Chrony-based time servers (my desktop,
<code>ntp4</code>, and <code>ntp5</code>) <em>can</em> be adjusted to
control the offset between GPS time and NTP time. And, in fact, you
<em>can’t</em> really run with a 0-second offset because GPS time is
based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">TAI</a>
and NTP time is usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>,<span><label for="sn-14"></label><span>Strictly speaking, it’s usually a weird mutant that
<em>mostly</em> ignores leap seconds, look up “<a href="https://developers.google.com/time/smear">leap smear</a>” for the
ugly mess.</span></span> and the two are currently 37 seconds apart.<span><label for="sn-15"></label><span>Leap seconds make life hard.</span></span></p>
<p>Originally, I discovered that time from my desktop was around 1 μS
when compared with <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code> by
<code>d*</code> servers, and time from the Raspberry Pi-based
<code>ntp4</code> was almost 38 μS off! To mitigate this, I graphed the
average offset between each time source across all 8 servers and then
adjusted offsets on my desktop and <code>ntp4</code> to be as close as
possible to the median of <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code>. To do
this, I changed my desktop’s TAI offset from <code>-37</code> to
<code>-36.999999160</code> and the offset of <code>ntp4</code> to
<code>-37.000033910</code>.</p>
<p>Now, all 4 sources are basically in unison:</p>

</details>
<p>Why were times so far off? For my desktop, it’s probably a mix of
multipath weirdness and delay in the network stack. 840 ns isn’t a huge
amount of time, although it’s bigger than what I’ve seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m less sure what’s going on with <code>ntp4</code>. It was
originally seeing over 50 μS of error, but reducing the Ethernet
coalescing limits on <code>eth0</code><span><label for="sn-16"></label><span><code>ethtool -C eth0 tx-usecs 0 rx-usecs 0</code></span></span> helped quite a bit. I’m going to have to keep poking at
this for a while.</p>
<h3 id="observed-ntp-jitter-across-all-sources">Observed NTP jitter
across all sources</h3>
<p>I can compare the jitter of 4 of my GPS time sources across all 8
<code>d*</code> servers. To calculate jitter in this case, I’m looking
at the difference between the 1st and 99th percentile of each source’s
offset from Chrony’s best estimate of the current time. I’m calculating
the percentiles over 15 minute windows, subtracting the 1st percentile
from the 99th, and then averaging those results across all 8
servers.<span><label for="sn-17"></label><span>It’s not the best way to do this statistically, but
there’s a limit to what you can do with Prometheus easily.</span></span></p>

<p>So, my desktop (with a fast NIC and a very good GNSS module) has the
least jitter. The two LeoNTP boxes are next, with a bit more, and the
Raspberry Pi has 2x the jitter of my desktop. Since Chrony averages out
offsets across sources and over time, jitter isn’t <em>necessarily</em>
a big deal as long as it’s under control.</p>
<p>Which brings up <code>ntp5</code>, which I’d excluded from the
previous graph. Here’s why:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/jitter2.png">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I still haven’t figured out why this loses accuracy every 2 hours,
but there are other weird things about <code>ntp5</code>, so I’m not all
that worried about it overall.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-hurt-syncing">Things that hurt syncing</h2>
<p>Along the way, I’ve found a bunch of things that hurt time syncing. A
short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network cards without hardware timestamps. Realtek, for
instance.</li>
<li>Tunnels. I had 3 servers who were sending traffic to the network
with <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN">VxLAN</a>
originally, and their time accuracy was terrible. I suspect that the
NICs’ hardware timestamp wasn’t propagated correctly through the tunnel
decapsulation. Plus, it made network times even less symmetrical.</li>
<li>NIC packet coelescing. On Raspberry Pi CM5s especially, I had to
disable NIC coelescing via <code>ethtool -c</code> or I had terrible
accuracy.</li>
<li>Software in general. I get the best results on NTP servers where the
GPS’s PPS signal goes directly into the NIC’s hardware, completely
bypassing as much software as possible.</li>
<li>Running <code>ptp4l</code> and <code>Chrony</code> on the same
ConnectX-4 NIC, or potentially ConnectX-3 or -5 NICs. Intel seems
perfectly happy under the same situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So, in all, I’m seeing time syncing somewhere in the 200–500 ns range
across my network. The GPS time sources themselves are sometimes as far
as 150 ns apart, even after compensating for systemic differences, and
the network itself adds another 200–300 ns of noise.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, it’d be cool to see ~10 ns accuracy, but it’s not
really possible at any level with this hardware. My time sources aren’t
that good, my network adds more systemic error than that, and when I try
to measure the difference between test servers I see a couple hundred
nanoseconds of noise. So 10 ns isn’t going to happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I’m almost certainly accurate to within 1
μS across the set of 8 test servers most of the time, and I’m
<em>absolutely</em> more accurate than my original goal of 10 μS.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>MacOS has shipped with a collection of “utility” apps since the prehistoric era of classic Mac OS. A good rule of thumb what makes an app a “utility” is that it’s a tool for doing something <em>about</em> your computer. Ever since Mac OS X 10.0, most of these apps have been neatly filed away in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em>. Others — some because they’re obscure (e.g. Ticket Viewer), some because they’re effectively deprecated (e.g. DVD Player, whose copyright date in MacOS 15 Sequoia is 2019), and some because they present themselves, when launched, not as apps but as system-level features (e.g. About This Mac) — are tucked away in <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/</em> or <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115089810537348465">Basic Apple Guy posted a screenshot to Mastodon</a> comparing the current MacOS 15 icons for four of these utilities (Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility) to their new icons in MacOS 26 Tahoe, beta 7 (click to enlarge for detail):</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg" alt="Screenshots of the MacOS 15 and MacOS 26 (beta 7) icons for Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility." width="500"></a></p>

<p>I don’t think the old icons for these apps from MacOS 15 were particularly good — Apple has mostly lost its “icons look cool” game. But the new ones in MacOS 26 Tahoe are objectively terrible. The only one of this bunch that’s maybe sort of OK is Wireless Diagnostics. They all look like placeholder icons made by a developer who would be the first to admit that they’re not an artist. Disk Utility, which is an important app, doesn’t even look like it involves a disk. That icon just says “Fix something Apple related.” On an Apple computer, that could mean anything.</p>

<p>These new icons all use the same “wrench” motif, which is a lazy, limiting concept to start with. Tahoe, at the system level, enforces a squircle shape on all application icons. Apps that haven’t been updated with Tahoe-compliant everything-fits-in-a-squircle icons are put in “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/08/macos-tahoe-fix-gray-box-icons/">squircle jail</a>” — their non-Tahoe-compliant icons are shrunk and placed atop a drab gray Tahoe squircle background, to force them into squircle compliance. But these Apple utility apps have an entire sub-motif — inside their base squircle shape is a large wrench fitted against a bolt. Only inside the bolt — which is inside the wrench’s forks, which wrench is inside the squircle — goes the part of the icon that identifies app itself. So maybe like 10 percent of the area of the icon is the area where the app can show something that identifies its purpose.</p>

<p>So the entire concept for these icons sucks. But the conceptual execution sucks too. The wrench is incredibly stupid-looking. Whoever drew it has obviously never used a crescent wrench because the forks on the wrench head are <em>way</em> too thin. They’d break off under any significant torque. Just look at a photo of real-life wrench, or — just look at the wrenches in the older MacOS icons.</p>

<p>Individually the icons mostly suck too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disk Utility — a very important app — has an icon that’s just an Apple logo (inside the bolt that’s inside the wrench that’s inside the squircle). Not a hard drive, not an external drive, not an SD card. Just an Apple logo. If I just showed you this icon without telling you which app it represented, how in the world would you guess what it is? Even if you know the “Apple utility app icon” motif of the big dumb wrench and bolt, the best you could guess is “a utility app for something Apple-related” which, for an Apple computer, could be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansion Slot Utility — This app only runs on Mac Pros because Mac Pros are the only Macs with expansion slots. So the old icon naturally shows a Mac Pro. The new icon shows ... three rectangular empty sockets?</p></li>
<li><p>AppleScript Utility — A fine concept for this icon (within the confines of the terrible wrench-and-bolt utility icon concept). Everyone who knows AppleScript knows the scroll that represents AppleScript scripts. So just put the iconic AppleScript scroll in the bolt in the wrench in the squircle. But here, the placement of the scroll is botched — it’s rotated a few degrees counterclockwise. It makes the scroll look like it’s falling over. Here’s how the scroll is canonically oriented, via the glyphs in SF Symbols:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/applescript-icons-sf-symbols.png" alt="The “applescript” and “applescript.fill” icon glyphs from the SF Symbols font."></p>

<p>and via the default icon for a script application (with a line added showing the center):</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-15-script-application-icon.png" alt="The default application for an AppleScript “script application”, with a vertical orange line showing the center." width="440"></p>

<p>But here’s a close-up of the Tahoe AppleScript Utility icon, with a center line added:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-applescript-utility-icon-drunk.png" alt="Close-up of the MacOS 26 Tahoe icon for AppleScript Utility, with a center line added to show that the script “scroll” is tilted incorrectly."></p>

<p>It’s wrong. From Apple, of all companies.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the not the work of carpenters <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">who care about the backs of the cabinets</a> they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers. The whole collection looks like the work from someone with no artistic ability <em>nor</em> an eye for detail. From <em>Apple</em>, of all companies.</p>

<p>Is it a big deal in the grand scheme of things that the icons for these seldom-used utility apps have gone to shit? No. But consider the proverbial canary in a coal mine. The problem isn’t that one little bird has died. The problem is that the bird might be dead because the whole mine is filling with deadly carbon monoxide or highly flammable methane gas. The icons in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em> in MacOS 26 Tahoe represent a folder full of dead canaries. </p>

<p dir="auto">For robust WiFi sensing, we recommend using a USB adapter based on the <strong>Realtek RTL8812AU</strong> chipset. This adapter supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, monitor mode, and packet injection. It is widely used for WiFi security research and is compatible with Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Kali, and Parrot.</p>

<p dir="auto">
  I built <strong>WiFi-3D-Fusion</strong> because I couldn’t stand the silence.<br>
  The world is full of invisible signals, oceans of information passing through us every second yet most people never even notice. Researchers publish papers, companies whisper promises, but almost nobody shows the truth.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  I wanted to tear the veil.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  This project is not just software. It’s proof that what we call “air” is alive with data that the invisible can be sculpted into form, movement, presence.<br>
  It’s not about spying. It’s not about control.<br>
  It’s about showing that technology can reveal without violating, sense without watching, protect without chains.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  Why? Because there are places where cameras fail, dark rooms, burning buildings, collapsed tunnels, deep underground. And in those places, a system like this could mean the difference between life and death.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  I experiment because I refuse to accept “impossible.”<br>
  I build because the world needs to see what it denies exists.<br>
  WiFi-3D-Fusion is not a product, it’s a signal flare in the dark.

<div><p>Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life.</p><p>If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming.</p><p>Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU</a>. 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours.</p><p>Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power.</p><p>All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing.</p><p>&gt; If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.</p><p>It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023243"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023243" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023243&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p><i>&gt; All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing.</i></p><p>A good demonstration is the Android kernel. By far the biggest difference between it and the stock Linux kernel is power management. Many subsystems down to the process scheduler are modified and tuned to improve battery life.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023368"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023368" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023368&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Macbooks are more like "phone/tablet hardware evolved into desktop" mindset (low power, high performance). x86 hardware is the other way around (high power, we'll see about performance).</p><p>That being said, my M2 beats the ... out of my twice as expensive work laptop when compiling an arduino project.

<div><p>On efficiency side, there's big difference on OS department. Recently released handheld Lenovo Go S has both SteamOS (which is Arch btw) and Windows11 versions, allowing to directly compare efficiency of a AMD's Z1E chip under load with limited TDP. And the difference is huge, with SteamOS fps is significantly higher  and and the same time battery lasts a lot more.</p><p>Windows does a lot of useless crap in the background that kills battery and slows down user-launched software</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45022635"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45022635" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45022635&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>They're big, expensive chips with a focus on power efficiency. AMD and Intel's chips that are on the big and expensive side tend toward being optimized for higher power ranges, so they don't compete well on efficiency, while their more power efficient chips tend toward being optimized for size/cost.</p><p>If you're willing to spend a bunch of die area (which directly translates into cost) you can get good numbers on the other two legs of the Power-Performance-Area triangle. The issue is that the market position of Apple's competitors is such that it doesn't make as much sense for them to make such big and expensive chips (particularly CPU cores) in a mobile-friendly power envelope.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45022981"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45022981" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45022981&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Per core, Apple’s Performance cores are no bigger than AMD’s Zen cores. So it’s a myth that they’re only fast and efficient because they are big.</p><p>What makes Apple silicon chips big is they bolt on a fast GPU on it. If you include the die of a discrete GPU with an x86 chip, it’d be the same or bigger than M series.</p><p>You can look at Intel’s Lunar Lake as an example where it’s physically bigger than an M4 but slower in CPU, GPU, NPU and has way worse efficiency.</p><p>Another comparison is AMD Strix Halo. Despite being ~1.5x bigger than the M4 Pro, it has worse efficiency, ST performance, and GPU performance. It does have slightly more MT.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023281"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023281" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023281&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Yet when you put them side by side Intel and AMD feel so slow and sluggish in multi task scenarios while M series feels smooth. And unlike windows and Linux you don’t feel like it needs to be rebooted every few hours.</p><p>I had macOS but the whole experience is just superior than any Linux distro. And both windows and Linux are trash at battery life.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023141"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023141" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023141&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>A lot of insightful comments already, but there are two other tricks I think Apple is using: (1) the laptops can get really hot before the fans turn on audibly and (2) the fans are engineered to be super quiet.

<div><p>I tend to think its putting the memory on the package. Putting the memory on the package has given the M1 over 400GB/s which is a good 4x that on a usual dual channel x64 CPU and the latency is half that of going out to a DRAM slot. That is drastic and I remember when the northbrige was first folded into the CPU by AMD with the Athlon and it had a similarly big improvements in performance. It also reduces power consumption a lot.</p><p>The cost is flexibility and I think for now they don't want to move to fixed RAM configurations. The X3D approach from AMD gets a good bunch of the benefits by just putting lots of cache on board.</p><p>Apple got a lot of performance out of not a lot of watts.</p><p>One other possibility on power saving is the way Apple ramps the clockspeed. Its quite slow to increase from its 1Ghz idle to 3.2Ghz, about 100ms and it doesn't even start for 40ms. With tiny little bursts of activity like web browsing and such this slow transition likely saves a lot of power at a cost of absolute responsiveness.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45022834"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45022834" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45022834&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

There is a level of polish that I haven’t seen on any x86 laptop, which makes it really hard for me to venture outside of Apple’s sandbox.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023120"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023120" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023120&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I recently upgraded from an M1 mac book pro 15", which I was pretty happy with, to the M4 max pro 16". I've been extremely impressed with the new laptop. The key metric I use to judge performance is build speed for our main project. It's a thing I do a few dozen times per day. The M1 took about four minutes to run our integration tests. I should add that those tests run in parallel and make heavy use of docker. There are close to 300 integration tests and a few unit tests. Each of those hit the database, Redis, and Elasticsearch. The M4 Pro dropped that to 40 seconds. Each individual test might take a few seconds. It seems to be benefiting a lot from both the faster CPU with lots of cores and the increased amount of memory and memory bandwidth. Whatever it is, I'm seriously impressed with this machine. It costs a lot new but on a three year lease, it boils down to about 100 euros per month. Totally worth it for me. And I'm kind of kicking myself for not upgrading earlier.</p><p>Before the M1, I was stuck using an intel core i5 running arch linux. My intel mac managed to die months before the M1 came out. Let's just say that the M1 really made me appreciate how stupidly slow that intel hardware is. I was losing lots of time doing builds. The laptop would be unusable during those builds.</p><p>Life is too short for crappy hardware. From a software point of view, I could live with Linux but not with Windows. But the hardware is a show stopper currently. I need something that runs cool and yet does not compromise on performance. And all the rest (non-crappy trackpad, amazingly good screen, cool to the touch, good battery life, etc.). And manages to look good too. I'm not aware of any windows/linux laptop that does not heavily compromise on at least a few of those things. I'm pretty sure I can get a fast laptop. But it'd be hot and loud and have the unusable synaptics trackpad. And a mediocre screen. Etc. In short, I'd be missing my mac.</p><p>Apple is showing some confidence by just designing a laptop that isn't even close to being cheap. This thing was well over 4K euros. Worth every penny. There aren't a lot of intel/amd laptops in that price class. Too much penny pinching happening in that world. People think nothing of buying a really expensive car to commute to work. But they'll cut on the thing that they use the whole day when they get there. That makes no sense whatsoever in my view.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023000"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023000" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023000&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>powertop helps a lot, I went from 3-4 hours to 6-7 hours on a ThinkPad. That said, it's not something you would want to bother a regular user with. E.g. enabling powertop optimizations will enable USB autosuspend, this will add a delay <i>every darn time</i> you didn't touch your USB keyboard or mouse for a second. So, you end up writing udev rules that excludes certain HID devices (or using different settings for when a laptop is on power or not), etc.</p><p>These are the kinds of optimizations that macOS does out of the box and you cannot expect most Linux users to do (which is one of the reasons battery life is so bad on Linux out-of-the-box).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023226"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023226" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023226&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I may be out of date or wrong, but I recall when the M1 came out there was some claims that x86 could never catch up, because there is an instruction decoding bottleneck (instructions are all variable size), which the M1 does not have, or can do in parallel.

<div><p>ARM instructions are fixed size, while x86 are variable.

The Zen4/5 chips, for example, source the vast majority of their instructions out of their uOp trace cache, where the instructions have already been decoded. This also saves power - even on ARM, decoders take power.</p><p>People have been trying to figure out the "secret sauce" since the M chips have been introduced. In my opinion, it's a combination of:</p><p>1) The apple engineers did a superb job creating a well balanced architecture</p><p>2) Being close to their memory subsystem with lots of bandwidth and deep buffers so they can use it is great. For example, my old M2 Pro macbook has more than twice the memory bandwidth than the current best desktop CPU, the zen5 9950x.

<div><p>In my opinion AMD is on a good way having at least comparable performance to MacBooks copying Apples architectural decisions. Unfortunately their jump on the latest AI Hype Train did not suit them well for efficiency. Ryzen 7840U was significantly more efficient than Ryzen AI 7 350 [1]</p><p>However, with AMD Strix Halo aka AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (PRO) there are Notebooks like the ZBook Ultra G1a and Tablets like the Asus ROG Flow Z13, that come close to the MacBook power / performance ratio[2] due to the fact, that they used high bandwidth soldered on memory, which allows for GPUs with shared VRAM similar to Apple's strategy.</p><p>Framework did not manage to put this thing in notebook yet, but shipped a Desktop variant. They also pointed out, that there was no way to use LPCAMM2 or any other modular RAM tech with that machine, because it would have slowed it down / increased latencies to an unusable state.</p><p>So I'm pretty sure the main reason for Apple's success is the deeply integrated architecture and I'm hopeful that AMD's next generation STRIX Halo APUs might provide this with higher efficiency and hopefully Framework adapts these chips in their notebooks. Maybe they just did in the 16?! Let's wait for this announcement: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw</a></p><p>Regarding the deeply thought through integration there is a story I often tell: 
Apple used to make iPods. These had support for audio playback control with their headphone remotes (e.g. EarPods), which are still available today. These had a proprietary ultra sonic chirp protocol[3] to identify Apple devices and supported volume control and complex playback control actions. You could even navigate through menus via voiceover with longpress and then using the volume buttons to navigate. Until today with their USB-C-to-AudioJack Adapters these still work on nearly every apple device published after 2013 and the wireless earbuds also support parts of this. Android has tried to copy this tiny little engineering wonder, but until today they did not manage to get it working[4].

<div><p>M1’s efficiency/thermals performance comes from having hardware-accelerated core system libraries.</p><p>Imagine that you made an FPGA do x86 work, and then you wanted to optimize libopenssl, or libgl, or libc. Would you restrict yourself to only modifying the source code of the libraries but not the FPGA, or would you modify the processor to take advantage of new capabilities?</p><p>For made-up example, when the iPhone 27 comes out, it won’t support <i>booting</i> on iOS 26 or earlier, because the drivers necessary to light it up aren’t yet published; and, similarly, it can have 3% less battery weight because they optimized the display controller to DMA more efficiently through changes to its M6 processor and the XNU/Darwin 26 DisplayController dylib.</p><p>Neither Linux, Windows, nor Intel have shown any capability to plan and execute such a strategy outside of video codecs and network I/O cards. GPU hardware acceleration is tightly controlled and defended by AMD and Nvidia who want nothing to do with any shared strategy, and neither Microsoft nor Linux generally have shown any interest whatsoever in hardware-accelerating the core system to date — though one could theorize that the Xbox is exempt from that, especially given the Proton chip.</p><p>I imagine Valve will eventually do this, most likely working with AMD to get custom silicon that implements custom hardware accelerations inside the Linux kernel that are both open source for anyone to use, and utterly useless since their correct operation hinges on custom silicon. I <i>suspect</i> Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony already do this with their gaming consoles, but I can’t offer any certainty on this paragraph of speculation.</p><p>x86 isn’t able to keep up because x86 isn’t updated annually across software and hardware alike. M1 is what x86 could have been if it was versioned and updated <i>without</i> backwards compatibility as often as Arm was. it would be like saying “Intel’s 2026 processors all ship with AVX-1024 and hardware-accelerated DMA, and the OS kernel (and apps that want the full performance gains) must be compiled for its new ABI to boot on it”. The wreckage across the x86 ecosystem would be immense, and Microsoft would boycott them outright to try and protect itself from having to work harder to keep up — just like Adobe did with Apple M1, at least until their userbase starting canceling subscriptions en masse.</p><p>That’s why there are so many Arm Linux architectures: for Arm, this is just a fact of everyday life, and that’s what gave the M1 such a leg up in x86: not having to support anything <i>older</i> than your release date means you can focus on the sort of boring incremental optimizations that wouldn’t be permissible in a “must run assembly code written twenty years ago” environment assumed by Lin/Win today.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45021889"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45021889" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45021889&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

Systemically excluded from access to capital and distribution, Black folks leverage creativity to make social media platforms their “own” without ever having true ownership. </span><strong>Decentralization, through technology like the AT Protocol, offers a new path forward.</strong></p><p><span>Consider a non-technological example of decentralized, interoperable standards (where two or more differently designed systems can work together): the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_key" rel="">Allen wrench</a><span>. Probably every piece of furniture I’ve put together comes with and is compatible with one.

The technology, developed by Bluesky, makes new kinds of global, self-governed communities possible that weren’t before. One of the best examples of the power of this technology is Blacksky, which began as a custom feed and has always been a collective effort between myself, close collaborators, and the broader Black userbase. It began as an experiment in designing an algorithm that centered Black voices, prioritizing community safety and self-governance. </span><strong>We’ve since scaled from 0 to two million users with $0 spent out of pocket and 100% organic growth. </strong><span>Decentralization has made that possible.</span></p><p>Most of the billions of people using social media today interact with closed source, proprietary, centralized social media applications.

We codify our rules in an internal SOP document after we reach consensus.</span></p><p>Our moderation tech stack currently consists of a few things:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation" rel="">Ozone</a><span>: We self-host an instance of this open source software, where our mods can label and tag posts, and take down accounts on our PDS (where user data is stored), and email accounts</span></p></li><li><p>rsky-labeler: An automated labeler service that scans every post, username, and profile that’s created or updated to identify anti-Black slurs and alert our team for manual review</p></li><li><p>Alerting system: A queue-based email alert (normal report, post showing in Blacksky feed, etc.)</p></li><li><p>“Ban From TV”: A feature that prevents known abusers from being able to view the Blacksky feeds at all</p></li><li><p>The “Green List”: AT Protocol allows us to create and share block lists, which users can subscribe to and automatically block bad actors on the list, like those harassing Black users</p></li><li><p><a href="http://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/SAFEskies" rel="">SAFEskies</a><span> app: Our way of allowing moderators to reorder and remove posts from the feed(s) without seeking admin approval, giving them more agency and control over the Blacksky algorithm.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz/docs" rel="">Documentation</a><span>: A site with user-friendly descriptions of Blacksky’s infrastructure</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In the early days of Bluesky, Black users felt they were being pushed off. Blacksky became a platform for Black users to feel heard and seen. To create Blacksky, we wrote our own implementation of AT Protocol (called </span><a href="https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky" rel="">“rsky”</a><span> and pronounced “risky”). An underlying premise of Blacksky’s rsky is to not only “seize the means of production,” as well as the distribution, but to also act as a “dual power” structure.</span></p><p><strong>Blacksky’s rsky guarantees our community a seat at the table, and ensures that we can leave and easily make our own table if we need to</strong><span>. That’s the true promise of decentralized social media.</span></p><p>Clearly I think that decentralization is great, not only for the problems it prevents, but also the new possibilities it creates. But if everyone’s running their own servers, apps, and moderation teams, how do we do global social media? That’s where our vibrant open source developer community comes in.</p><p><span>Blacksky runs our own global relay at </span><a href="https://atproto.africa/" rel="">https://atproto.africa</a><span>, which we built from scratch. Every day, our relay stores its own copy of the hundreds of gigabytes of data of all known AT Protocol accounts — 36 million and counting. We also developed what we call our “moderation relay,” which lets us know about all of the moderation decisions ever made by all mod teams globally.</span></p><p>This helps us combine efforts with other community moderators, keeping our feeds free of things like transphobia or unwanted sexual content, in addition to anti-Blackness.</p><p>We do this because it ensures the independence of Blacksky, and it builds in some redundancy that makes the whole AT Protocol ecosystem more resilient overall and less reliant on the company running Bluesky. Otherwise, the whole ATmosphere could end up becoming too similar to a centralized app with an API, like a client app connected to Instagram.</p><p><span>Because of our relay, you can create a post on Bluesky, using a Bluesky hosted account, and it will be able to show up in the Blacksky feed, on the Blacksky Community app. For network governance purposes, it’s important to the future of the ecosystem that other independent organizations create and maintain global services like this.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The changes will affect all <a href="https://www.android.com/certified/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certified Android devices</a> once live, though the global rollout will be more gradual.</p>

<p>The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can’t distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users’ personal data. </p>







<p>According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023.</p>

<p>Initially, Google will allow interested developers to sign up for early access starting in October 2025 to test the system and provide feedback. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally.</p>

<p>Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy’s sake. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Services Act</a>&nbsp;(DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their “trader status” to submit new apps or app updates for distribution.</p>

<p>Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.</p>

<p>The changes could have a significant impact on the Android app ecosystem and app distribution, as Google works to cut down on the security issues and malware that have typically plagued its platform. </p>

<p dir="auto">Fenster /ˈfɛnstɐ/ -- a German word for "window".</p>
<p dir="auto">This library provides the most minimal and highly opinionated way to display a cross-platform 2D canvas. If you remember Borland BGI or drawing things in QBASIC or <code>INT 10h</code>- you know what I mean.

<li>Single application window of given size with a title.</li>
<li>Application lifecycle and system events are all handled automatically.</li>
<li>Minimal 24-bit RGB framebuffer.</li>

<li>Cross-platform mouse events (X/Y + mouse click).</li>
<li>Cross-platform timers to have a stable FPS rate.</li>
<li>Cross-platform audio playback (WinMM, CoreAudio, ALSA).</li>
<li>Simple polling API without a need for callbacks or multithreading (like Arduino/Processing).</li>

<p>To combat malware and financial scams, Google announced today that only apps from developers that have undergone verification can be installed on certified Android devices starting in 2026.</p>



<p>This requirement applies to “certified Android devices” that have Play Protect and are preloaded with Google apps. The Play Store implemented similar requirements <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/11/09/google-play-more-app-testing/">in 2023</a>, but Google is now mandating this for all install methods, including third-party app stores and sideloading where you download an APK file from a third-party source.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Think of it like an ID check at the airport, which confirms a traveler’s identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google wants to combat “convincing fake apps” and make it harder for repeat “malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down.” A recent analysis by the company found that there are “over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.”</p>



<p>Google is explicit today about how “developers will have the same freedom to distribute their apps directly to users through sideloading or to use any app store they prefer.”</p>	
	



<p>This new requirement sees Google create a new Android Developer Console for those that only distribute outside of Google Play. Students and hobbyists will get a separate workflow that differs from commercial developers.&nbsp;</p>




	<p>Those that distribute via Google Play “likely already met these verification requirements through the existing Play Console process,” with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">D-U-N-S</a> number for organizations needed.</p>



<p>The first Android app developers will get access to verification this October, with the process opening to all in March 2026.</p>



<p>The requirement will go into effect in September 2026 for users in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Google notes how these countries have been “specifically impacted by these forms of fraudulent app scams.” Verification will then apply globally from 2027 onwards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At this point, any app installed on a certified Android device in these regions must be registered by a verified developer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google notes “supportive initial feedback” from government authorities and other parties:</p>



<hr>



<ul>
<li>…with Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs praising it for providing a “balanced approach” that protects users while keeping Android open.</li>



<li>…Thailand’s Ministry of Digital Economy and Society sees it as a “positive and proactive measure” that aligns with their national digital safety policies.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html">https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016794">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        <p>Recently, Socket.dev published <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/60-malicious-ruby-gems-used-in-targeted-credential-theft-campaign">research</a> highlighting malicious gems
designed to steal social media credentials. We wanted to use this as an
opportunity to share more about how RubyGems.org security operates, how
we proactively handled this incident (and others), and the work our team
is doing each day to keep the ecosystem safe.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-detect-malicious-gems">How We Detect Malicious Gems</h2>

<p><strong>RubyGems.org security uses a proactive and multi-layered approach:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Automated detection:</strong> Every gem upload is analyzed using both
static and dynamic code analysis, including behavioral checks and
metadata review. Much of this capability comes from Mend.io’s
supply chain security tooling (originally built by our own Maciej
Mensfeld, a maintainer on the RubyGems team).</p>

<p><strong>2. Risk scoring:</strong> Each package is given a score. Higher-risk gems
are escalated for manual review by a member of our security team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Retroactive scanning:</strong> As detection techniques improve, older
packages are automatically rescanned, which allows us to catch
threats that may have slipped through in the past. (This is how we
found the threat actor that Socket.dev later investigated.)</p>

<p><strong>4. External sources:</strong> We sometimes receive alerts from vulnerability
databases, industry partners, and cross-registry collaborations,
which help us identify patterns across ecosystems.</p>

<p>Through steps 1 - 3, our team detects the majority (roughly 70-80%) of
malicious packages before they are ever reported to us or the public.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-we-flag-a-gem">What Happens When We Flag a Gem</h2>

<p><strong>Once a gem is flagged, we:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Verify:</strong> A RubyGems security engineer reviews the code to confirm
malicious intent (about 95% of flagged packages prove to be
legitimate).</p>

<p><strong>2. Double-check:</strong> When there’s any doubt, we seek a second opinion
within the team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Remove:</strong> Confirmed malicious gems are removed via a standardized
process in our admin panel.</p>

<p><strong>4. Document:</strong> Every action is logged with reasoning for
traceability.</p>

<p><strong>5. Protect further:</strong> In some cases, we preemptively block suspicious
gem names (for example, ones mimicking company internals) to
prevent possible abuse.</p>

<h2 id="this-incident">This Incident</h2>

<p><strong>This is the timeline of the actions our team took concerning the
incident reported by Socket.dev:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 20, 2025 –</strong> Our systems flagged suspicious gems, and the
team confirmed malicious credential-stealing behavior. We would
like to specifically credit RubyGems maintainer Maciej Mensfeld
for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 23–28 –</strong> We removed nearly all of the affected packages
and terminated the associated accounts. We would like to
acknowledge again Maciej Mensfeld for his security work here, as
well as Josef Šimánek, who provided a second opinion and helped
with package removal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>August 7 –</strong> Socket.dev published their report and notified us of
16 additional gems from related accounts, which we also removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In total, we removed all malicious packages from this threat actor,
including two not covered in the original report.</p>

<p>Socket.dev has also <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/follow-up-on-malicious-ruby-gems-campaign">published an updated accounting</a> of this incident
after talking directly with our team and clarifying key details about
our response.</p>

<p><strong>It’s also important to note:</strong> this campaign involved a small number
of gems. Widely used and trusted packages were not affected.</p>



<p>We welcome and encourage researchers and community members to work with
us by reporting issues through these channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> You can also reach us at
<a href="mailto:security@rubygems.org">security@rubygems.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slack:</strong> Join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/bundler/shared_invite/zt-1rrsuuv3m-OmXKWQf8K6iSla4~F1DBjQ">Bundler
Slack</a>
to connect with the RubyGems.org team and community of committers
and developers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once we receive reports, we acknowledge them, review them quickly, and
follow up with the person who made the report. We are grateful for every
contribution that helps keep RubyGems and the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<h2 id="the-reality-of-supply-chain-security">The Reality of Supply Chain Security</h2>

<p>RubyGems.org is smaller than ecosystems like
<a href="https://github.com/npm">npm</a> but malicious activity is
still a serious threat. On average, we remove about one malicious or
spam package per week, though that number can spike higher.</p>

<p>This work is resource-intensive. Most of our efforts are currently
supported by sponsors, including <a href="http://mend.io/">Mend.io</a>
and <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/">Alpha-Omega</a>, but a
significant portion of time comes from contributions by volunteer
maintainers. Many of these maintainers have personally dedicated over a
decade to this critical work, driven by their passion and commitment to
keeping the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<p><strong>If your company depends on RubyGems.org, consider supporting its
maintenance and security directly through our <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/rubygems-org-funding-model-a-new-path-for-community-led-growth/">RubyGems Supporter
Program</a>.</strong>
Community funding enables us to continue to invest in the people,
infrastructure, and security work that keep RubyGems safe and keep
RubyGems.org a community-led service.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>

<p><strong>This recent incident shows our security systems working as intended:</strong>
threats were detected, removed, and contained before they could cause
widespread harm.</p>

<p>Security in open source will always be a shared effort. We want to thank
Socket.dev for their research, as well as the broader community for
continuing to report issues.</p>

<p>You are welcome to reach out to us through the above channels if you
have any additional questions.</p>

The company has continued to develop and advance their cooling designs since. Their current liquid cooling solution is designed for datacenter scale, with liquid cooling loops spanning racks rather than being contained within servers. Racks of six CDUs, or Coolant Distribution Units, perform a role analogous to the radiator+pump combo in an enthusiast water cooling loop. The CDUs use flexible hoses and quick disconnect couplings to ease maintenance and reduce tolerance requirements. A CDU rack can provide adequate cooling capacity with five CDUs active, allowing maintenance on one unit without downtime.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" width="1456" height="828" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:828,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1064929,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>CDUs exchange heat between coolant liquid and the facility-level water supply.

That mirrors delidding in the enthusiast world, where PC builders with especially strong stomachs remove heatspreaders (lids) to gain the higher heat transfer efficiency that bare die cooling can provide. For Google’s part, TPUv4 needs such an approach because it has 1.6x higher power draw compared to TPUv3.</p><p>Beyond moving heat off chips, liquid cooling helps reduce cooling-related power requirements. Google found the power consumption of liquid cooling pumps was less than 5% of fan power associated with an air cooling solution. Because Google uses water-to-water heat transfer to get heat off the coolant, the bulk of cooling power comes from pumps. Enthusiast setups don’t realize this potential advantage because they use liquid to move heat from chips to a more optimal location for air cooling. Usually, that’s a radiator with a fan mounted at a case intake. In theory, a PC builder could try exchanging heat to a toilet tank, allowing for highly efficient cooling with each flush. But fan and pump power in a water cooled PC is quite low in absolute terms, especially compared to the high RPM fans typically found in a server. Thus there’s little reason for an enthusiast to tackle cooling-related power.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1216356,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Finally, maintenance is a concern. PC enthusiasts are familiar with water cooling challenges like microbial growth and leak risk. The same concerns apply to datacenter-scale water cooling solutions. Both worlds share some mitigating measures, like quick disconnect fittings. But datacenters have to address those challenges without taking down a substantial portion of compute capacity. PC builders with an open loop have to power down their machine before draining the loop and replacing components. Google’s extra CDU, mentioned earlier, allows maintenance with zero downtime. But Google takes measures beyond that, because a small problem with one machine can translate to a maintenance nightmare at scale.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" width="1456" height="725" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:725,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:572413,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Google extensively validates components with leak testing, uses alerting systems to discover problems like leaks, and takes preventative measures like scheduled maintenance and filtration.

But datacenter approahces diverge from there, and driven by scale and reliability requirements. Plenty of water cooling hardware is already visible on the first day of Hot Chips 2025. Nvidia has a GB300 server on display, with external water cooling connections clearly visible. It also uses flexible tubing, and curiously deploys fans as well.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg" width="1456" height="969" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:238392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idPo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedbd2ae-652a-4b80-85ce-699280614d41_2000x1331.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Seen at the Rebellions AI stand, showing people there installing a water block connected to a chiller for their demo</figcaption></figure></div><p>Rebellions AI, a South Korean company demo-ing a new ML accelerator, also has a water cooling setup.

									<h2>Temporary Suspension of Acceptance of Mail to the United States Due to Changes in U.S. Customs and Regulations</h2>
									<!-- タイトル end -->

				<!-- 日付 start -->
				<p>August 25, 2025</p>

				<!-- 内容 start -->
				<p>On July 30, 2025, the U.S. government issued an executive order titled “Termination of De Minimis Treatment for All Countries” regarding mail to the United States.</p>

				<p>Under this executive order, starting August 29, 2025, mail containing goods imported for personal use (taxable mail) will no longer be eligible for duty-free treatment, and tariffs will be imposed. On August 15, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced new guidelines regarding the elimination of de minimis rules, which require that transport operators pay customs deposits to CBP and prepare customs declarations. The procedures that transport operators and postal operators in each country must follow to comply with these guidelines are not clear, however, making implementation difficult.</p>

				<p>Therefore, starting August 27 (Wed.), in line with other national postal operators, we will temporarily suspend the acceptance of postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) to the United States that contain the following items:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Individual gifts with a content value exceeding 100 US dollars</li>
					<li>Goods intended for sale for consumption</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, we will continue to accept letters, postcards, printed matter, EMS (documents), and postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) containing gifts between individuals with a value of less than US$100.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to the above suspension of acceptance, our international courier service, UGX (U-Global Express), can handle shipments in compliance with U.S. customs regulations:</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/UGX/index_en.html">UGX (U-Global Express)</a></p>

				<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><hr><p>Over the past couple of years I’ve been experimenting with MiniPCs, and the more I do, the more I’m convinced this is
the future I want to invest in.</p><h2 id="the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">The Many Advantages Of MiniPCs
<a href="#the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">#</a></h2><p>Before I ramble on about how great something I like is, first let me assure you that I know they’re not perfect either,
and might not be what some people want.
Nevertheless, here are my own reasons and explanations for how I came to be swayed in this direction, why I think it’s a
good idea, and why I would recommend this to others.</p><h3 id="cheap-and-replaceable">Cheap and Replaceable
<a href="#cheap-and-replaceable">#</a></h3><p>MiniPCs are all-in-one, factory built, shipped as-is products.
The converged supply chain and economy of scale usually leads to MiniPCs being cheap, or at least with very high bang
per buck all things considered.</p><p>However, because of these same reasons, they are usually not repairable, and theoretically produce more E-waste.
I don’t worry about this too much: they are fully solid state machines, running on low power and low-ish temperatures,
thus making their rate of degradation much slower than some beefy machine churning 24/7.</p><h3 id="small-and-compact">Small and Compact
<a href="#small-and-compact">#</a></h3><p>It’s called mini because it is.
These adorable devices don’t take up space, and in a pinch, are portable as well!
If you need lots of computers around the house, this is the way to go.</p><p>Need a living room HTPC to browse the internet and such on a big screen at social gatherings?
Get a MiniPC and chuck it behind the TV.
No one will even notice it.</p><p>Have a small desk nook where you do some light work?
Connect the monitor, mouse, and keyboard to a MiniPC.
It looks like a dock, but it’s actually the entire computer!</p><h3 id="power-efficiency">Power Efficiency
<a href="#power-efficiency">#</a></h3><p>Most MiniPCs are based on low-voltage hardware.
The power draw can vary in peak usage based on how beefy it is, but they are the kings of idle power consumption.
You can expect average power draws of 20-50W in usage and 6-12W in idle.</p><p>Put that in perspective with high-end machines with hardware concerned with performance and not power draw, that can
easily idle at 100W.</p><p>Things that need to run 24/7 but aren’t actually in use 24/7 are great beneficiaries of running on MiniPCs.
And in the long run, your electricity bill will be lowered using several MiniPCs versus a big bad box.
If the actual price doesn’t seem that much to you, at least take solace in knowing you’re going greener and consume
less.
If that’s not important either, then you’re hard to please, aren’t you?</p><p>How about we allow ourselves to ponder a little on the not so distant future?
The current hardware is generally still <code>x86_64</code>, but in future we’ll have ARM, or dare I dream, RISC-V?
We’ll get less power consumption for the same level of compute or more compute for the same level of power consumption.
Ok, Apple already has this with the M4s, and that’s exactly my point, look how well it works!
And there’s also a handful ARM based boards out there, it’s just a matter of time till they reach general availability.</p><h3 id="versatile-through-specializations">Versatile Through Specializations
<a href="#versatile-through-specializations">#</a></h3><p>You cannot use a MiniPC do to everything, but everything you need to do can be done by a MiniPC.
By mixing and matching different types of MiniPCs, you can cover all your computing needs!</p><ul><li><p><strong>General Compute</strong>:
The first one you think of, run-of-the-mill MiniPCs are usually just this, laptop-grade hardware in custom PCBs in a
different form factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Networking</strong>:
You can find MiniPCs with 4-6 ethernet ports too, making them an ideal platform to run custom firewalls, routers, or
simply a personal VPN connected 24/7 to your network.
They are more powerful and smaller than your average routers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Storage</strong>:
You can get MiniPCs with 4-6 internal M.2 slots that are great for building a NAS with.
That is, of course, if you don’t need mass storage <em>(≤20TB)</em>, and you don’t mind the higher cost per GB of flash
storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personal Cloud</strong>:
Take a beefy general compute MiniPC, install Linux on it, and make it a convenient container hoster.
Storage? What for? We can keep that on the NAS. We just do compute here.
If you’re demanding and want resiliency too, why not get multiple computers and build a mini cluster?</p></li><li><p><strong>Dammit Apple</strong>:
If you’re like me and want your main station to be Linux, but also have apps and other use-cases that require macOS,
good news, Apple makes MiniPCs too, and quite powerful ones at that.</p></li></ul><h3 id="monoliths-are-hard-to-build">Monoliths Are Hard To Build
<a href="#monoliths-are-hard-to-build">#</a></h3><p>Let’s imagine you want to build a homelab with the first four use-cases mentioned above.
You will need a motherboard with good I/O, an extra decent network card, a case with many drive bays for storage, lots
of RAM for ZFS, and the services you run, along with a CPU with enough PCI lanes and cores to keep up with all that.</p><p>Usually for this, consumer components don’t offer <em>exactly</em> what you need.
You might find yourself scouring the web for weird deals on Amazon or second hand markets.
Suppose you find everything, but they don’t ship at the same time.
Suppose you made a mistake, and you need to return something but because you had to wait to find out about the
incompatibility, you’re out of the return grace period.</p><p>Okay, maybe that’s a little too contrived of an example, but the point I’m making is generally good hardware for a
single desktop to handle everything is hard to come by, and also not very lenient towards you having an easy time.</p><p>And I’m fairly certain you will get the same utility for a lower or equal price, with much less manual work needed, if
you shop for a few MiniPCs instead.</p><h3 id="no-need-for-virtualization">No Need For Virtualization
<a href="#no-need-for-virtualization">#</a></h3><p>Virtualization is amazing and useful, but also annoying.
That is not to say MiniPCs can’t do it, in fact they make a good Proxmox host.
But if you use MiniPCs you don’t <em>need</em> to use VMs in the first place.</p><p>For the NAS + Personal Services example, let us imagine we were on a monolith PC with TrueNAS on bare metal, and we
would like a VM for the media PC connected to a nearby TV, and one container to run Jellyfin.
We want them both hardware-accelerated, and we have two GPUs, great so… <em>WHOOPS!</em>
We can’t pass both of them because TrueNAS insists on keeping one for the host, and it’s really a pain to circumvent.</p><p>If instead we had a MiniPC being just a NAS, one being just a service host, and one being just an operating system for
the TV, we wouldn’t need to even make any of these considerations.
Everything is already compartmentalized.</p><p>In a sense, <em>you</em> become the virtualization host.
Do you need another VM? Buy a MiniPC and add it to the network.</p><h3 id="avoiding-single-points-of-failure">Avoiding Single Points of Failure
<a href="#avoiding-single-points-of-failure">#</a></h3><p>Imagine the next conversation when a friend comes to visit.</p><p>— Hey dude, I’m trying to use the bathroom but the light switch isn’t working.</p><p>— Remember last week we were watching that movie on my living room PC thing?
Well actually, the PSU just died couple days ago, I’m waiting for a replacement.</p><p>— That’s unfortunate, but what’s the connection?</p><p>— Oh yeah, my bad, those are smart home bullshit. The switch doesn’t actually go anywhere it sends messages to my
HomeAssistant, which then is supposed to tell the bulbs to turn on.</p><p>— Home what? Oh…, cool I guess? So why ain’t it working?</p><p>— That used to run on the PC, so while that’s down I can’t use it.</p><p>— So you mean to tell me you’ve been using your torch to take a shit this last week because your light bulbs don’t work
without the PC you watch Netflix on?</p><p>— Yep… uh… <em>yep</em>. I guess in hindsight I would’ve done it differently.</p><p>There’s a reason why people recommend getting a separate Raspberry Pi for that!
Hardware failures are unpredictable and unavoidable.
But at least you should try and minimize the inconvenience such events bring.</p><h3 id="less-stressful-fun-to-tinker">Less Stressful, Fun To Tinker
<a href="#less-stressful-fun-to-tinker">#</a></h3><p>This one is simply a personal observation on how I’ve had a mentality shift working with MiniPCs.
Because of the decentralized, isolated nature of their hardware within my home network, I am generally much braver when
tinkering with it.</p><p>Taking the container service compute out of my NAS and into a separate MiniPC allowed me to confidently do whatever to
it, because it’s separate.
I couldn’t accidentally screw up my NAS by working on the homelab server.
Even if that was technically true in a virtualized environment inside the NAS, this is about subjective feeling.
This placebo of bravery and confidence is very fun and rewarding.</p><p>Same thing with having the M4 Mini on my second desk.
In the rare event that I do something that temporarily incapacitates my main PC, I am at least relieved I have a backup
computer ready to use if I have important tasks and responsibilities.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2><p>MiniPCs are a <em>great idea</em> if you’re just looking into starting a homelab.
They scale with you, around you, and aren’t a big upfront investment.</p><p>It’s indeed a far cry from the initial fantasies I had when first getting into homelabs and self-hosting, namely big
beautiful racks <em>(of server hardware!)</em> I’d hide locked in a ventilated closet.
I, for one, am extremely satisfied with the modest but very useful setup I ended up having.</p><p>There are many resources and communities online you can look up if you want to learn more.
You should give it a try!</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<h2>Building the Mouse Logitech Won't Make</h2>
<p>2025.08.24 · 5 min read</p>

<p>My absolute favorite mouse is the MX Ergo from Logitech. It's a trackball mouse with a good number of buttons and a comfortable, ergonomic tilt. It clicked with me as soon as I tried it, and I've been using one since they came out back in 2017.</p>
<p>However, it's not without its issues. There are 3 main areas where the sheen of perfection wears off:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses a micro-USB port to charge.</li>
<li>The switches are a little loud and clicky.</li>
<li>The software is bloated.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 8 years waiting for an updated model from Logitech, I decided to stop waiting and see if I could tackle these issues myself.</p>
<p><em>After first publishing this article a helpful commenter let me know Logitech released the MX Ergo S in late 2024, with quieter switches, USB-C, and a $20 price increase. Let's just pretend I wrote this article a year ago! Still, at least this project let me avoid some e-waste.</em></p>
<h2>The Fixes</h2>
<div>
<p>General Disclaimer</p>
<p>These mods could mess up your mouse and will definitely void your warranty. Rechargable batteries can cause fires if handled improperly!</p>
</div>
<h3>Adding USB-C Charging</h3>
<p>I went in apprehensive - how much of a hassle would it be to swap a port? The easiest solution would be to get a short adapter plug and leave it in the mouse, but that felt like it would be a constant reminder of my lack of ambition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I soon found this incredible <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a> on how to seamlessly replace the existing port. The port sits on a small PCB under the mainboard. The author of the guide reverse-engineered that PCB, then modified it to accommodate a USB-C port. He made the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Logitech_MX_Ergo_USB_C_PCB_replacement_89459dce.html">designs</a> available through PCBWay, and while you can export the design files and send them anywhere you'd like, I opted to stay with PCBWay to manufacture the boards for my project (I ended up ordering 10 so I had spares).</p>
<p><img alt="PCB Mid-Assembly" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/pcb-mid-assembly.jpeg"></p>
<p>Balking at the $50+ charge for turnkey assembly, I opted to take the financially responsible route and pay $200+ for a hot-air rework station to solder it myself. I transferred as many components from the Logitech board as I could. That meant I only needed to source the new port, some resistors, a replacement ribbon cable connector, and a switch.</p>
<p>Getting spare PCBs and components saved me a lot of hassle, as it gave me the opportunity to practice soldering some of the trickier components (the USB-C port turned out to be especially finicky). After some initial trial and error I was able to successfully assemble the new board! </p>
<p><img alt="Fitting the assembled PCB into the mouse" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/assembled-pcb.jpeg"></p>
<p>Some quick modifications to the case with a rotary tool provided enough clearance for the larger port. After reassembling the mouse, I was left with a pretty seamless result!</p>
<p><img alt="Finished Mouse with New Port" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/mouse-new-port.jpeg"></p>
<p>Overall I spent $45 for the PCBs and around $10 for the required components, making this a reasonably pricey mod. You could probably find an intro discount from a PCB manufacturer to lower the prices a bit! If you're interested in trying this out for yourself, I'd recommend reading through Solderking's <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Silent Switches</h3>
<p>The one mouse that nearly pulled me away from the MX Ergo was the MX Master 3S, also from Logitech. It uses some fantastic silent switches for the left and right clicks, which I found I much preferred over regular mouse switches. </p>
<p>I wanted to replicate that experience as much as I could for the MX Ergo. I started by disassembling the mouse and measuring each switch used so I could find alternatives I might prefer.</p>
<p>The left and right clicks use standard microswitches, and I struck gold with the first alternatives I tried! The <a href="https://lethal.gg/products/huano-silent-2-pcs?_pos=11&amp;_sid=74aa60c1a&amp;_ss=r">Huano Silent</a> switches are exactly what I was looking for. They are almost completely silent, with a soft but satisfying tactile bump when pressed. </p>
<p><img alt="Huano Switch Close-up" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/huano-close-up.jpeg"></p>
<p>The scroll-wheel clicks use <code>6x6x4.3mm</code> through-hole switches, while the other buttons use <code>5.25x5.25x1.5mm</code> surface-mount switches. I wasn't as sure about how to find options that might suit me better, as these are essentially commodity products. I ended up ordering a few different options, and settled on the Omron <code>B3F-1002</code> for the scroll-wheel clicks and the Alps Alpine <code>SKQGABE010</code> (see below, left is the new switch and right is the old) for the other buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="SMD Switch Old and New" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/old-new-smd.jpeg"></p>
<p>After desoldering and removing the old switches, soldering in their replacements, and reassembling the mouse I could finally try out new switches in actual use. The Huano Silent switches were a huge improvement for me and only cost $2.99! If I were to make one mod this would be it (I ended up ordering a bunch more of them just so I have spares for future mice). While I did notice the change from the other switches, the difference was more minimal and I would probably skip them next time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying this for yourself, I'd recommend following a guide like <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Logitech+G603+Switch+Replacement/165937#s349713">this one from iFixit</a> on how to desolder and replace a mouse switch. While the mouse is different the soldering technique is the same!</p>
<h3>Software Upgrade</h3>
<p>I really dislike Logitech's peripheral configuration software (Logi Options+). I find it to be bloated, buggy, and <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/">occasionally malware-like</a>. In 2024 I started using <a href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>, and I haven't looked back. It's super lightweight, it can do everything I need it to, and most importantly it just works. I mainly use it to configure the thumb and side buttons to move me between desktop spaces. While it does cost $20, it adds a lot of customization and it works with many other peripherals.</p>
<p><img alt="Steermouse Demo" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/steermouse.png"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I'm really happy with how this project turned out. I highly recommend swapping in the Huano Silent switches, while the other switch changes are probably overkill. The USB-C port swap isn't super necessary, but it was a fun project and a great introduction to surface-mount soldering. Moving to SteerMouse is easy and boring but it's a much better experience!</p>
<p>More generally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had tweaking the objects we use every day to our liking. Aside from a great mouse, this project has given me a bunch of ideas for things to try next.</p>

<p><strong>FORT GARLAND —</strong> In the sandy hills scattered with piñon pine and spiky yucca, hundreds of people have relied on a water supply that is so much a part of the local culture that Costilla County residents describe it as a way of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drilling for water is a pricey gamble on the high desert where many live off the grid at 7,500 to 10,000 feet of elevation. A well could cost $25,000 with no guarantee that water will spring, even after digging hundreds of feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, many people in the poorest county in the state have opted for cisterns, reservoirs buried underground and covered with a plastic lid or cement slab. To fill them, residents drive 20 minutes or so to town, often weekly, with tanks in their pickup trucks or on their trailers to buy water at 10 cents a gallon, or they have it delivered for an extra fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time-consuming, tedious and steeped in routine. And in Fort Garland, the system was abruptly cut off this month — without warning or notice.</p>

<p>The fight over the water has pitted residents of Fort Garland who have plumbing and pay for metered water against those living outside the city limits with cisterns. The board of the Fort Garland Water and Sanitation District — which cut off water sales to rural residents Aug. 1 in a 3-2 vote that wasn’t even on its meeting agenda — has devolved into shouting matches and dysfunction. Board members have referred to disgruntled residents as an “angry mob,” and one city resident shushed the water district administrator as she explained the deficiencies of the town water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>People who relied on Fort Garland water to fill their cisterns have been left dry. In the heat of summer, some have gotten water from neighbors who have wells, though well-sharing is illegal. Some are driving two hours to Pueblo to buy water. Many have been getting water in the town of Blanca, where officials offered — only as an emergency solution until the end of August — to let people fill up water tanks from a hose connected to a fire hydrant.</p>

<p>The water crisis has forced older residents to contemplate selling their dream homes, where they had planned to retire. Others are wondering whether to scrap plans to build on their property, leaving home for showers and limiting their toilet flushes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underneath it all is a deep concern about whether this is a preview of the water wars ahead as the West deals with <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/21/colorado-river-forced-water-cuts-state-official-plan/">unprecedented drought</a> and its residents compete for a resource that is finite yet essential to life.</p>

But since the Fort Garland Water &amp; Sanitation District ended bulk water sales to people living outside town limits, the couple has been scrambling to fill their cistern with water.

<h2 id="h-water-was-never-guaranteed">Water was never guaranteed</h2>

<p>Most of those affected live in the Sangre de Cristo Ranches, a 44,000-acre residential area that once was the <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/multimillionaire-sells-historic-ranch-to-billionaire/73-343274758#:~:text=FORT%20GARLAND%20(AP)%20%2D%20Multimillionaire,fund%20manager%20Louis%20Moore%20Bacon.&amp;text=The%20Forbes%20family%20had%20held,of%20Denver%2C%20for%20four%20decades.">Forbes Trinchera Ranch</a>. The dwellings range from multistory homes with sweeping decks facing Blanca Peak, the standout of the mountain range, to modest one-room houses and campers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some residents have wells. But hundreds of people in the county of about 3,700 rely on cisterns to drink, cook and bathe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is most dire for those who are older or have physical disabilities. Many were paying a private business, Wood &amp; Water, to deliver water purchased from the Fort Garland filling station to their cisterns. The local couple who operated the water and firewood service in the San Luis Valley <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090129622788">closed within days</a> of the Fort Garland water board vote.</p>

<p>Amanda Ellis and Paul Branson live off a dirt road, no neighbors within sight. They run an apothecary and a wildfire mitigation business, grow vegetables and herbs, use solar power, and have a cistern buried under the sandy earth near their driveway. The water in the cistern is piped to their faucets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Losing their water source has caused daily stress and deep-seated worry.</p>

<p>When water isn’t available, finding it becomes all-consuming. “Hauling water is your water for everything — lifestyle, dishes, consumption, the whole bit,” said Branson, who for years worked in emergency management. “So not having that immediate option is of great concern. It’s stressful.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s unnerving, to the point that Branson has wondered whether cutting off water to rural residents is a step in the San Luis Valley’s hazardous mitigation plan for drought. “It seems like locking down on water availability is possibly a theme here, which begs the question, why?” he said. “Here are some things we’ll do should its ugly head start to rise and impact people, right?”</p>

She relies on water from a cistern buried on her property. (Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Ellis bought the house five years ago after traveling the country in a van as a freelance journalist. “I was always drawn to the mountains when I was traveling around the country and, to be honest, it was affordable,” she said. “It was off grid. It had a structure. It was away from people. The view is incredible. There’s climbing, hiking. It was somewhere I could afford and have land in Colorado.”</p>

<p>Having water was never a “guarantee,” she knows, but the way county residents were cut off with no warning, no time to prepare, was unethical, she said. Many residents had no idea how tenuous the water supply actually was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Realtors are selling homes with (cistern) permits saying that there’s the availability to get water hauled in,” Ellis said. “It was never guaranteed. Apparently, they are not and never have been obligated to sell water outside of city limits. They’ve just done that for a very long time.”</p>

<h2 id="h-water-pump-broke-water-restrictions-stirred-up-anger">Water pump broke, water restrictions stirred up anger</h2>

<p>The trouble began when the pump broke in Fort Garland’s water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Salina Pacheco, who is the manager of the town water district and training to become a water system operator, knew it was coming. She had been talking to the five-member water board about it for two years and had helped secure a $105,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs to upgrade the water system, which was suffering from “extreme water hammer” because water traveling through the pipes in opposite directions was colliding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pump failed in June, before the system’s planned overhaul. Townspeople were asked to use the “bare minimum” of water — flush the toilets, but don’t water the lawn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frustrations grew, culminating in about 10 people showing up at the Aug. 1 water board meeting to demand action. They wanted the town to stop selling what’s called “bulk water” to residents of unincorporated Costilla County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the meeting intensified, with people “hollering” and cutting off each other’s sentences, board members called for a vote, even though the issue was not on their agenda, Pacheco recalled. One man held up a hand in her face as she tried to explain why she didn’t think selling water to rural residents was impacting the town’s water system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These men were brought in because I had put them on a water restriction schedule,” Pacheco said in an interview. “They are upset they can’t water their lawns while people can’t have water to actually live.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fort Garland uses 120 acre-feet of water per year — that’s 120 acres covered by 1 foot of water. Sales to people in cisterns account for about 1 acre feet per year, Pacheco said. Revenue for the water sales to rural residents totaled $43,000 per year, about 15% of total revenue.</p>

<p>Still, board president John Sanchez and two other members voted to shut down bulk water sales. Customers found out on Facebook after rural residents went to buy water and were turned away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sanchez did not return a request for comment. Pacheco alleged he is trying to get the board to fire her.</p>


<p>Pacheco said she has brought in attorneys to train board members on meeting rules, including how to listen to public comment and not fight back or take immediate votes on issues raised by the audience. Some of the board members “have been trying to move past the craziness,” she said. “I’ve told all of the board members, ‘I need you to understand your positions.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the board president, she said: “Somebody needs to shut him down.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Hopefully we can come together as a community,” Pacheco said. “This could bring us together instead of creating them and us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water board member Anthony Neville was among the three to vote to shut off water sales. He told The Sun he did it because he understood why townspeople were angry about the water restrictions and that they “pay religiously” for their metered water. The water district’s bylaws do not say that it must sell water to people outside of Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Now that we don’t want to sell water, they think we are obligated to sell water,” Neville said. “No, we are not.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get that everybody needs water. There are kids up there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Anthony Neville, <em>member of Fort Garland water board</em></p>

<p>But Neville said he would vote in the future to restore water sales to rural people.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The water pump is fixed now. He’s hoping Sangre de Cristo Ranches residents will sign a petition that could result in another board vote and that the rest of the board “would have a heart.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I get that everybody needs water,” he said. “There are kids up there.”&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="h-when-water-seems-scarce-long-time-residents-blame-the-newcomers">When water seems scarce, long-time residents blame the newcomers</h2>

<p>John and Debi Marks bought property in the ranches two years ago with plans to build a retirement home and live off the grid among the pines. For now, the couple in their 50s are living in a camper, parked near the markers that stake out the outline of their future home. The plan is to power with solar and grow food in a small greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They opted for a cistern instead of a well, bought the $500 permit and had it buried on their property. They were among the customers of Wood &amp; Water until it went out of business.</p>

<p>The Marks’ plans for their next chapter were going smoothly — maybe minus the rattlesnakes seeking shade under their camper. Then their water source evaporated.</p>

<p>Since then, they’ve been on a disciplined mission to fill their 1,750-gallon cistern to the top and conserve water as strictly as possible. They’ve made the most of the town of Blanca’s offer of emergency water on Tuesdays and Thursdays 8 a.m. to noon. The Marks are squeezing in two trips each morning to fill the 275-gallon tank in the back of their pickup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They figure a full cistern is enough to last them six months in the camper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We wanted to be as independent as possible, and so we searched all over the state for property that would fit our needs, and this fit the bill,” Debi Marks said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They love it in the valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides, but they have felt resentment from some of the longtime residents, the accusation that they showed up “unprepared” to live out here. When a necessity for life like water seems scarce, people turn on each other.</p>

<p>“I think a lot of what we’re dealing with are small-town politics,” John Marks said. “We all have a common need that is a valuable, sacred resource that we’re clamoring for, and we just want to be part of a community, to kind of help make things better for us all. So work with us. Please don’t work against us.”</p>

(Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Elaine, who did not want her full name used because she is a 79-year-old widow who lives alone on a rural dirt road, moved with her late husband to Costilla County full time about 20 years ago. Her in-laws had purchased the property in the 1970s, site unseen, from an ad in Forbes magazine, the owner of which also owned Forbes ranch. When presented with the option of drilling a well or buying water tanks and a cistern, they opted for a cistern.</p>

<p>“That was part of the deal with Forbes, that there would always be water available to those who bought property in the ranches, and so there was no need for us to drill a well,” she said, sitting on her deck last week under a huge blue sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first, the Forbes Ranch offered water service. Residents just had to call the ranch headquarters when their tanks were low, and a water delivery would arrive, for a fee. When the ranch sold, that arrangement ended, and Elaine and her husband started making regular trips to Fort Garland to fill their water tanks. After he died two years ago, after 60 years of marriage, a friend began helping her with the task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since moving to her dream home where she looks at the mountains and watches the swarms of hummingbirds on her deck, she is thinking of moving away, perhaps closer to her children and grandchildren. She has started calling well drillers and was quoted from $18,000 to $25,000 with no guarantees. The wait list is about a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Knowing that when the water in her tank runs out, she may not get more, has made Elaine vigilant about usage. Like many of her neighbors, she started taking showers at the community center instead of her home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You count the times you flush the toilet,” she said. “I know that it takes 13 gallons to wash a load of clothes. I know that it takes 6 gallons to do my dishwasher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’ve lived a long life, and we worked hard to have this, and it’s not right at my age that I have to do all that. It’s fine if they want to say, ‘OK, we’re not going to do water anymore,’ but with no notice, no reason? To me, it’s inhumane. It’s not morally right either. Where’s your compassion? They forgot about the people.”</p>

<h2 id="h-solution-pitched-to-county-commissioners">Solution pitched to county commissioners</h2>

<p>Residents recently brought their concerns to a meeting of the Costilla County commissioners. The most compelling public comment came from a new resident who brought a detailed project pitch for creating a county water station that would serve all the residents who’ve been buying water in Fort Garland, Blanca and the Wildhorse Mesa community. Commissioners responded quickly, with a plan to discuss the off-grid water situation during an emergency work session next week and to take it up at their meeting in early September.</p>

<p>The pitch was to open a metered bulk water filling station on county property modeled after <a href="https://www.canoncity.org/494/Bulk-Water-Station">one in Cañon City</a> and using the pre-paid account model similar to the one used by <a href="https://www.suitutil.com/bulk-water-fill-station/">Southern Ute Utilities</a> in southwestern Colorado. The project would cost from $120,000 to $240,000 to build, about $15,000 per year in operating costs and $25,000 per year in water costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The county is likely to qualify for grants to cover much of the cost, and could net from $95,000 to $120,000 a year, according to the proposal from Sangre de Cristo Ranches resident Wesley Barnett, a former oil field worker from Texas who has dealt with water issues in the oil patch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside, though, is that it would take about a year to put it together, he said. “There’s still a gap,” Barnett said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more immediate solution is a potential plan to have a private company bring a water tanker to county-owned property in Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until there is a solution, rural residents are meticulously tracking their gallons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marks stopped flowing water through their camper, instead hauling in 6 gallons at a time, so they can better track what they use. “It’s just that difficult,” John Marks said. “We’re hand-washing, filling bowls of water. We’re not sure about the future, so we’re just trying to be conservative.”</p>

<p>Doai Eki, situated right by the border between Gunma and Niigata prefectures, is one of the most unique stations you’ll come across in all of Japan. Serving the Joetsu Line, the station seems relatively normal to any passengers travelling southbound in the direction of Tokyo. As with most stations in rural Japan, it appears to be a non descript building with no attendants, no ticket gate and a few vending machines to get you through the 45 minute wait between trains.</p>

<p>However, if travelling northbound in the direction of Niigata, the station takes on a vastly different character. The northbound platform is a 15 minute walk away from the main station building. A majority of this walk consists of a 70m descent down almost 500 steps into the Shin-Shimizu tunnel. The descent is terrifying, with little vision of what awaits you at the end as you venture further and further into the depths. Water from the nearby rivers can also be heard trickling into the tunnel at a faster and faster rate as you near the bottom.</p>

<p>Finally arriving at the northbound platform, you’ll find yourself in a sinister cavern deep within a neighboring mountain. As such, Doai has aptly been named “Japan’s no 1 station for moles.” The tunnel is dark and dank and it’s noticeably harder to breathe while you wait for your train. The only semblance of life is a small waiting room that’s littered with photos and scrap paper/pens for visitors to leave notes. While I imagine this is meant as a fun way to pass the time, the anonymous notes and random photos on the wall add an eerie, Silent Hill-esque touch to the cavernous space.</p>

<p>Adding to the overall spookiness of the station is the fact that it’s deep within a mountain that neighbors Mount Tanigawa - known as Death Mountain due to its treacherous climb. Over 800 people have died trying to reach the top of Tanigawa with one climbing group in 1943 going missing for 30 years before their corpses were eventually discovered.</p>

  <!--<b>How To Fix Firefox's Find-in-Page for Keyboard Navigation</b>-->
<b>A Small Change To Improve Browsers for Keyboard Navigation</b>
<br>
by <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a> (<a href="https://h.43z.one/">hompage</a>)
<br>
<pre><i>We choose to use Firefox, not because it's easy but because it's hard.
~ jfk probably</i>

(This problem applies to Chrome too though)

If you want to navigate websites with the keyboard you can make use of the ' search feature (aka "quick find for links") in Firefox. Just press ' and start typing. Any link with the anchor text you type will get highlighted. Once you press enter, firefox will navigate to the link under the highlighted anchor text.

Too bad most websites nowadays don't use links for navigation and actions. They have buttons and divs and once you click them stuff happens. 

And here lies the limitation with the other two build-in find features. Though the / (quick find) and the ctrl+f (find in page) search will highlight any text (not just links), nothing will happen if you press enter on that highlighted text
(once you dismissed the search dialog with escape).

<p>Test it for yourself.
Hello this is a link to my <a href="https://h.43z.one/">homepage</a>
and this a link with javascript:alert(1)<br>
here a button with an  handler.<br>
and here a <span onclick="alert(3)">span with an onclick handler</span>
</p>

Wouldn't it be great if firefox would just, like you know, <i>click</i> on the
highlighted text (browser created a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection">selection</a>) whenever I press enter?!

YES IT WOULD and that's why I created this little <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/click-on-selection-with-enter/">extension</a>.
All it does is inject these lines.
<code>addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {
  if(event.key !== 'Enter')
    return

  // more cases that should not hook enter are to be discovered...
  if(event.shiftKey)
    return

  const elementWithSelection = getSelection()?.anchorNode?.parentElement

  if(!elementWithSelection)
    return

  elementWithSelection.click()
  getSelection()?.removeAllRanges()
})
</code>
The code just gets the node that has the current <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getSelection">selection</a>.
Then looks for the parent html element of that node and clicks it.
Afterwards removes the selection.

This tiny hack makes keyboard navigation just so much better ~ <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Unlikely Revival of Nuclear Batteries"><p><strong>In 1970, surgeons in</strong> Paris implanted the first nuclear-powered pacemaker, and over the next five years, at least 1,400 additional people received the devices, mostly in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/france">France</a> and the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>. Encased in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/titanium">titanium</a>, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope—typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238—and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker’s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-energy">Department of Energy</a> for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/plutonium">plutonium</a> recovery. But often, that didn’t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one’s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"> <img alt="Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive" data-rm-shortcode-id="5e7c338237fd9b5fad3a61814e5a47e3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980" height="2984" id="cea8b" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980" width="3000"> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Medtronic’s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/pacemakers">pacemakers</a> with plutonium-238. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos" target="_self">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/drones">drones</a>, sensors, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/solar-farms">solar farms</a>, as well as spacecraft and biomedical <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/implants">implants</a>.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who’s going to buy them? I’ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here’s what I’ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery’s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I’ve ever seen in my career, and that’s good for the field—it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term “nuclear batteries” may evoke images of tiny <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-reactors">nuclear reactors</a>, but that’s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don’t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radiation">radiation</a> that’s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nickel">nickel</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes’ nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/thermoelectric">thermoelectric</a> devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So “radioisotope power source” is a better descriptor than “nuclear battery,” but for ease of language, I’ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p> <img alt="A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents " data-rm-shortcode-id="0ac3d60e7253b6de5ea95009da720df5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980" height="620" id="7d529" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980" width="1115"> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity.

Last year, <a href="https://www.infinitypower.energy/" target="_blank">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find—if they can be commercialized—will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/solar-power">Solar power</a> works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/jupiter">Jupiter</a>, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-fission">nuclear fission</a> and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fission">Fission</a> is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1" target="_blank">like NASA’s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/thermoelectric-generator">thermoelectric generator</a>, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA’s two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/voyager">Voyager</a> missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238.

They initially produced 157 watts of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-power">electric power</a>, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><p><img id="607f2" data-rm-shortcode-id="71cf1dc40be3b7c479d367502adafb39" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980" width="2700" height="3541" alt="Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room"><small><p>Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) provide onboard power for NASA’s Voyager missions by converting heat generated by the decay of plutonium-238.</p></small><small>JPL-Caltech/NASA</small></p><div id="rebelltitem13" data-id="13" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-13" data-basename="particle-13" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755884071" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/soviet-union">Soviet Union</a> deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/russia">Russia</a> to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/space-exploration">space exploration</a>, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries—imagine a wireless tire <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/pressure-sensor">pressure sensor</a> that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, “Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale”). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem11" data-id="11" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-11" data-basename="particle-11" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755884071" data-use-pagination="False"><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers—something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers’ missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative—potentially 1/100 the weight—due to their higher <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/energy-density">energy density</a> relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539" target="_self">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let’s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that’s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel—that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gamma-rays">gamma rays</a>, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electromagnetic-waves">electromagnetic waves</a> that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They’re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755634855" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles—typically around 5 MeV—and can’t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sulfur">sulfur</a>, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see “Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries”). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope’s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you’ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery’s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p></div><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755621580" data-use-pagination="False"><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery’s power density—such as for an insect-size microdrone—then you’ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-density">power density</a> of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microdrone">microdrone</a> that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that’s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it’s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href="https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm" target="_blank">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery’s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/particle-accelerators">particle accelerators</a>. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/spent-nuclear-fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It’s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source—that is, a voltage—that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/high-voltage">high voltage</a> (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device “betavoltaic.”</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755634855" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a “hole” that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/diodes">diodes</a> have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-carbide">silicon carbide</a>, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597" target="_blank">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/low-power">low-power</a> option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it’s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mars-rovers">Mars rovers</a> and over <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you’ve seen the movie <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/the-martian">The Martian</a></em>, you may recall how Matt Damon’s character, trapped alone on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mars">Mars</a>, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what’s known as the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, “Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity”), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see “Table 2: Who’s Developing Nuclear Batteries”). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there’s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href="http://www.betavolt.tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-µW battery that’s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years. The company is working with betavoltaics using nickel-63, tritium, promethium-147, and strontium-90, and a diamond semiconductor to convert the energy to electricity.</p></div><p>Beijing Betavolt last year announced plans to commercially launch a 1-W version in 2025, but as of press time, it was still seeking a license and funding to do so. Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearable-devices">wearable devices</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mems">MEMS</a> systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt’s device has a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/conversion-efficiency">conversion efficiency</a> of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p>To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there’s been a dearth of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/patents">patents</a> in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed. The company says its conversion efficiency exceeds 60 percent—about six times as efficient as the best radioisotope power generators.</p><p>In Infinity’s design, the isotope is dissolved or suspended in a proprietary liquid electrolyte. The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14’s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country’s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery’s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/china">China</a> published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors" target="_blank">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electromagnetic-radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>, to mimic a beta source, which emits <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrons">electrons</a>, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/startups">startups</a> offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

It was created at Twitter because Twitter wanted a way to allow third-party apps to post tweets on users' behalf. Take a second to imagine designing something like that today. How would you do it? One way would just be to ask the user for their username and password. So you create an unofficial Twitter client, and present the user a login screen that says "log in with Twitter". The user does so, but instead of logging into Twitter, they're actually sending their data to you, this third-party service which logs into Twitter for them.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" width="509" height="362" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:509,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Bad way – giving a third party your password&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Bad way – giving a third party your password" title="Bad way – giving a third party your password" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is bad for a lot of reasons.

In this post, we’re going to look at a typical OAuth flow.</p><p>The example I'm going to use is YNAB. If you haven't used it, YNAB is like a paid version of Mint. You connect it to a bank account, and then it pulls all your transactions from that account, and shows them to you with very pretty charts. You can categorize your spending, and then it tells you for example, hey, you're spending too much on groceries. It helps you manage your finances. So, I want to use YNAB, and I want to connect it to Chase Bank, but I don't want to give it my Chase password. So instead, I'm going to use OAuth.</p><p><span>Let's look at the flow first, and then let's understand what's going on. We're actually going to look at the flow </span><em>twice</em><span>, because I think you need to look through an OAuth flow at least two times to understand what's going on.</span></p><p>So to start, I'm at YNAB, and I want to connect Chase as a source. The OAuth flow looks like this:</p><ol><li><p>YNAB redirects me to Chase.</p></li><li><p>At Chase, I log in with my username and password.</p></li><li><p>Chase shows me a screen saying "YNAB wants to connect to Chase. Pick what accounts you want to give YNAB access to". It'll show me a list of all my accounts. Let's say I pick just my checking account, to give YNAB read access to this account, and hit OK.</p></li><li><p>From Chase, I'm redirected back to YNAB, and now, magically, YNAB is connected to Chase.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png" width="1024" height="598" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:598,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;flow illustrated&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="flow illustrated" title="flow illustrated" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is the experience from a user's perspective. But what happened there? What magic happened in the background, so that YNAB somehow has access to my data on Chase?</p><p><span>Remember, </span><em>the end goal of OAuth is for YNAB to end up with an access token</em><span>, so it can access my data from Chase.

I'll spoil the surprise by telling you </span><em>how</em><span> it got the access token, and then I'll walk you through what happened in more detail.</span></p><p>How does Chase give YNAB the access token? When you were redirected from Chase back to YNAB, Chase could have just added the access token in the URL.

End of OAuth flow.

Well, if the client ID isn't valid, the request is invalid right away. If the client ID is valid, the authorization server needs to check the redirect URI. Basically, since the client ID is public, anyone could go get the YNAB client ID, and create their own OAuth flow that hits Chase, but then returns the user back to, let's say, evildude.com. But that's why when you register your app, you have to tell Chase what a valid redirect URI looks like. At that point, you would tell Chase that only YNAB.com URIs are valid, thus preventing this evildude.com scenario.</p><p>If everything is valid, the authorization server can use the client ID to get the app name, maybe the app icon, and then show a user consent screen.</p><p>The user will click which accounts they want to give YNAB access to, and hit okay.</p><p>Chase will redirect them back to the redirect URI that you gave, lets say ynab.com/oauth-callback?authorization_code=xyz.</p><blockquote><p>Side note: you might be wondering, what is the difference between URI and URL? Because I'm kind of using both. Well, a URL is any website URL that we know and love. URI is more general. URL is a type of URI, but there are many other types of URIs.</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png" width="959" height="453" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:453,&quot;width&quot;:959,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><span>The reason I'm saying redirect URI instead of redirect URL is because mobile apps won't have a URL.

You send that authorization code to the Chase authorization server, along with your client secret. Why include the client secret? Because again, the authorization code is in the URL. So anyone can see it and anyone could try to exchange it for the access token. That's why we need to send the client secret, so Chase's server can say "Oh yes I remember I had generated this code for this client ID, and the client secret matches. This is a valid request."</p><div><p><span>And then it returns the access token. Note how in every step of the OAuth flow, they have thought through how someone could exploit the flow, and added safeguards*. That is a big reason why it's so complicated.</span></p><p><em>*I'm reliably informed by a friend in security that the OAuth designers learned a bunch of lessons the hard way, and that is another reason why it is so complicated: because it had to be patched repeatedly.</em></p></div><p>The other big reason is because we want the user to be involved. That makes it complicated because all the user stuff has to be frontend, which is insecure, because anyone can see it. And then all the secure stuff has to be on the back end.</p><p>I keep saying frontend and back-end, but in the OAuth docs, they say front-channel and back-channel instead. Let's talk about why.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png" width="728" height="515" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:728,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!okWy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13d949d-d028-4c24-aa97-b226d9702b59_728x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So, OAuth doesn't use the terms frontend and back-end, it uses front-channel and back-channel. Front-channel means GET requests, where anyone can see the parameter in the URL, and back-channel means POST requests, where that data is encrypted (as part of the POST body). The reason OAuth doesn't use frontend or backend is, because you could make POST requests using JavaScript! So, theoretically, you could exchange your authorization code for an access token right on the frontend, in JavaScript, by making a POST fetch request.</p><p><span>Now, there is a big problem with this, which is you also need the client secret to make that request. And of course, once the secret is on the frontend and accessible in JavaScript, it's not secret anymore. Anyone can access it. So, instead of using the client secret, there's a different way to do it called </span><strong>PKCE</strong><span>, spelled P-K-C-E, pronounced “pixie” (seriously). It's not as secure as doing it on the backend with the client secret, but if backend is not an option for you, you can do it using PKCE. So just know that if you have an app without a back-end, you can still do OAuth.</span></p><blockquote><p>I may cover PKCE in a future post, as it is now recommended for the standard flow as well, since it helps protect against auth code interception.</p></blockquote><p>Same problem for mobile apps. Unless you have a mobile app that has a backend component, like a backend server somewhere, if you're putting your client secret in a mobile app, well, anyone can get that because there are tons of tools to extract strings from mobile apps. So, instead of including your client secret in your app, you should again use PKCE to get that access token.</p><p><span>So those are two other terms that are good to know: </span><strong>front-channel</strong><span> and </span><strong>back-channel</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png" width="222" height="233" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:233,&quot;width&quot;:222,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>At this point, you've seen what the OAuth flow looks like from the user's perspective, and from the developer's perspective, and you have seen the components that make it secure.</p><p>One last thing I want to mention is OAuth can look like a lot of different ways. I covered the main recommended OAuth flow above, but some people may do OAuth by passing back an access token in the redirect instead of the authorization token (doing that is called the "implicit flow"). Some people may do it using PKCE. There's even a way to do OAuth without the user consent part, but that really is not recommended. </p><p>The other part of OAuth we didn't cover is that tokens expire and you need to refresh them. And that happens through a refresh flow. Also, OAuth is all about authorization, but some workflows use OAuth to log in, such as when you use a “sign-on with Google” feature. This uses OpenID Connect, or OIDC, which is a layer on top of OAuth that also returns user data instead of just an access token. I'm mentioning this here because when you look for OAuth on the web, you'll see a lot of different flows, and you may be confused as to why they're all different. And the reason is, OAuth is not straightforward like HTTP, OAuth can look a lot of different ways.</p><p>Now you're good to go out and do your own OAuthing.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        <em>Solar still needs storage cheap enough to move energy between seasons. I have been working on a startup to do this for the last two years.</em>
    </p><div>
<h2>The Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is the company I've been leading for the last ~2 years.</p>
<p>The purpose of Standard Thermal is to make energy from solar PV available 24/7/365 at a price that is competitive with US natural gas.</p>
<p>Our technology works by storing energy as heat in the least expensive storage material available - large piles of dirt. Co-located solar PV arrays provide energy (as electricity) and are simpler and cheaper than grid-connected solar farms. Electric heating elements embedded in the dirt piles convert electricity to heat. Pipes run through the pile, and fluid flowing through them removes heat to supply the customer. The capital cost, not including the solar PV, is comparable to natural gas storage at less than $0.10/kilowatt-hour thermal and 1000x cheaper than batteries.</p>
<div><p>These are the customer archetypes we can save the most money for right now:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solar developers with oversized arrays greater than 300 kilowatts and heat demand at the location. Our system can store the summer excess production for winter thermal demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>Isolated energy users forced to use propane or fuel oil, typically using more than 50,000 gallons of propane per year.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The storage system can provide hundreds of megawatts of thermal demand as long as land is available (you can check land usage using <a href="https://www.standardthermal.com/estimator">our estimator</a>). The technology requires some scale to be cost-effective, hence the minimums.</p>
<p>Our medium-term goal is to repower coal power plants to supply electricity during seasonal lows. Repowering means the stored heat creates steam on demand for the turbines instead of burning coal.</p>
<p>We have been continuously prototyping designs at our 100-kilowatt test site in Oklahoma since last fall and are nearing our modular commercial form factor. It will be built and tested in the next several months, then it will be ready for copying and pasting at customer sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcasciences.com/">Orca Sciences</a> is incubating our company. We plan to spin out and close on fundraising early in 2026.</p>
<p>Read on if you'd like to know more!</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Raw solar PV direct current output has become cheaper than fossil fuels in many places in the last few years. But ultra-cheap energy from solar PV only means so much if it's not in the correct form or available when its needed. The shift in costs makes it the correct time to develop technologies that were irrelevant when fossil fuels were the cheapest source of energy everywhere.</p>
<p>Batteries will handle much of the daily electricity storage and firming. But several other technologies are required for solar PV to reach its full potential. One of those is a very inexpensive, reasonably efficient storage system that can hold a few months' worth of energy to flatten seasonal differences in solar production (a niche usually served by fuels). We believe thermal storage is the way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/expandingenergy.html">companion post</a> called "Expanding the Marginal Energy Source," which further details how solar PV needs can become the dominant energy source.</p>
<h2>The Standard Thermal Idea</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is about abundance. Eli Dourado and I published a paper titled <a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/energy-superabundance/">"Energy Superabundance: How Cheap, Abundant Energy Will Shape Our Future"</a> in 2022, which details the benefits humanity would enjoy with more access to cheap energy. Standard Thermal is one part of making that a reality.</p>
<p>In the Standard Thermal system, solar PV provides the energy. It is already the cheapest source of energy in much of the world. Our thermal storage is affordable and scalable enough to allow 24/7/365 supply without overbuilding the solar array.</p>
<p>A typical site is a factory, power plant, or town with a large earthen mound at the edge. The mound might be the size of a house for a smaller factory, and up to many football fields for a large power plant. Surrounding the earthen mound will be high-density, low-profile solar arrays.</p>
<p>Electricity from the solar arrays flows to heating elements in the earthen mound, building up heat. The storage temperature is 600 °C or higher. The outer mass of the mound, plus a favorable volume-to-area ratio, insulates and minimizes heat loss. Pipes embedded in the mound carry fluid that delivers heat to users.</p>
<div><p>Both heat and electricity are expensive to move. The heat storage must be near the customer, and the solar array must be near the storage to achieve real cost reductions. The design is also modular. Individual blocks of solar PV can be copied and pasted, and dozers can push more dirt. That repeatability reduces development costs and risk.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/mounddrawing.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>The Standard Thermal Storage System</em></p></div>
<p>A significant portion of human energy demand is for heat, whether that is for factories or heating buildings. Thermal storage is very efficient at delivering heat to these users. There is an efficiency penalty converting back to electricity; round-trip efficiency is 40%-45%, but sometimes the steady supply of electricity is worth it.</p>
<p>Harvesting sunlight with solar PV panels and storing it in a widely available material enables low-cost energy virtually everywhere on Earth.</p>
<h2>Markets We Want to Serve</h2>
<h3>Isolated Energy Users</h3>
<p>Some rural heat users are away from the existing energy infrastructure, and rural delivery systems can't meet their demand. They must migrate to more expensive fuels that are easier to transport, like propane or fuel oil.</p>
<p>Examples in this category are mining and agriculture. These customers have open land nearby and suffer from high energy costs. A solar PV array and Standard Thermal storage system can be cheaper today. Roughly 10 to 40 gigawatts of solar PV capacity might satisfy US demand, requiring more than $10 billion in investment.</p>
<p>From a more global perspective, most humans and their endeavors are isolated energy users. Co-located solar and cheap thermal storage can provide costs comparable to today's cheap energy. Typical steam process heat categories without access to affordable gas or coal require a few terawatts of solar to meet demand today and more in the future as the world becomes richer.</p>
<h3>High Latitude Solar Developers</h3>
<p>Solar arrays might produce 5x-6x more electricity in summer than in winter in high latitude regions. Batteries are too expensive to move excess electricity between seasons. But, solar panels are inexpensive, and it is common to oversize a solar array to meet basic electricity needs (lights, etc.) during non-summer months. The panels still produce electricity when it is cloudy or the sun is lower in the sky, but just not as much as in summer. The extra solar capacity covers many more days.</p>
<p>An obvious trade is to store the excess summer electricity from oversized arrays as heat to provide winter heating. The economics look very attractive because the electricity is “free” to utilize. And winter fuel is often expensive in these places, especially in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The concept could provide a generalized solution for seasonal solar PV variation. A town could have a solar array on the edges of town to provide electricity nearly year-round. It would fill storage with the summer excess to power its district heating system in winter. The energy demand for existing district heating systems would require 3 to 5 terawatts of solar to satisfy it (several times cumulative global solar installation).</p>
<h3>Repowering Thermal Power Plants</h3>
<p>Seasonal electricity storage is the sexiest (and largest) application. Powering turbines from existing coal power plants by producing steam from thermal storage is the most economical path to electricity storage. Power plants are expensive, and there are plenty of existing ones. It could take up to ~25 terawatts of solar to convert them all.</p>
<p>Thermal storage can make these power plants operate more efficiently. Exhaust air scrubbers with high fixed and variable operating costs aren't necessary. Thermal efficiency improves because heat isn't lost up the stack, in solids, or running scrubbers. Facilities can start faster, making them more relevant in electricity markets. The cost and operating profile emulates a natural gas power plant.</p>
<p>The ideal number of plant conversions is a trickier question because of the difficulty in predicting how much other generation sources, like solar PV linked with batteries, will supply.</p>
<p>Some countries with growing electricity demand might want facilities to run in a more "baseload" configuration in the short term. The math is simple: Is solar PV heat cheaper than coal plus coal's inefficiencies? The numbers might favor solar over coal imports, but mine-mouth power plants will take longer to cross over.</p>
<p>There are many ways to model the long-term question, and <a href="https://findingspress.org/article/141340-thermal-energy-storage-in-dirt-for-repowering-decommissioned-coal-plants">a recent paper</a> I co-authored with several Stanford researchers is one entry. Most results converge around a technology like inexpensive thermal storage providing steady power on days when solar output is poor and electricity prices are higher. Thermal storage might supply around 10% of the total electricity supply in this configuration. Beating coal becomes much easier in this scenario because lower coal plant capacity factors hurt the economics.</p>
<p>Coal supplies around one-third of global electricity today, and electricity demand should keep growing. A substantial share of plants could undergo conversion in the most optimistic scenarios.</p>
<h2>Why is Thermal Storage a Good Option?</h2>
<h3>Available Storage Materials</h3>
<p>Requirements always determine what engineering choices are available. A constraining goal narrows the options.</p>
<p>Matching natural gas storage costs is a good constraining goal. Storing natural gas in depleted reservoirs is absurdly cheap, with a capital cost of $0.05-$0.10/kWh. For reference, batteries getting under $100/kWh is exciting, a 1000x higher cost per unit of storage. There are only a few materials that are even viable to match that cost. They are energetic chemical reactions, water, air, and dirt/rock.</p>
<p>Chemical storage works very well; that is what natural gas and other hydrocarbons are. They will always be favorable in some applications. But, extra steps and conversions raise the cost of producing or mining them. Cheaper options, even if they can't do everything a fuel can, would be nice.</p>
<p>Chemical fuels are so hard to beat because they carry so much energy per unit of mass, and the cost of that mass is very low compared to most products humans produce. By default, storing energy using less mass-efficient methods requires nearly free mass to be competitive.</p>
<p>Water and air are nearly free, so they are worth consideration. Unfortunately, both are forms of gravity/pressure storage, which have very low density, roughly 100x worse than thermal storage. Water and air are cheap, but managing their containers and movement is not. Air has the added issue of being compressible, so pressurizing it and recovering energy are more expensive and less efficient than water.</p>
<p>Thermal storage could also be attractive. A significant portion of human energy usage is in the form of heat. Conversion losses for these applications can be small. Conversion back into electricity is 40%-45%, which is not perfect, but better than many alternatives. The surface footprint is also very good, roughly an order of magnitude better than batteries because dirt piles a lot higher and closer together than shipping containers of batteries. A pile that could run a large power plant for months would look small in comparison to the cooling water reservoir.</p>
<h3>Simple Thermal Storage Cost Analysis</h3>
<p>There are two adjustable cost metrics: the cost of the storage material and the heat stored per unit. Most thermal storage is sensible storage, meaning heat changing the temperature of the material stores or releases heat rather than phase change or reaction. The material needs to be very inexpensive and subjected to high temperature swings to achieve acceptable $/kWh figures.</p>
<p>Dirt and rocks are practically free where they are, but moving, sorting, and processing the dirt adds cost very quickly. Giant mounds or embankments using nearby material cost ~$1/ton. Trucking sand or gravel costs $20-$50/ton. Refractory bricks made from purified dirt are ~$500/ton.</p>
<p>Dirt's thermal properties are similar to refractory bricks. It is composed of similar materials, like silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide. These oxides can handle very high temperatures exposed to air. Bricks have a more uniform structure than dirt, but piled-up dirt doesn't need fracture toughness or consistent thermal expansion. Dirt is an excellent value at one hundredth the cost per unit of storage.</p>
<p>Dirt stores around 20 kilowatt-hours thermal per ton for each 100 degrees Celsius of temperature change. A 400-degree Celsius swing would store 80 kilowatt-hours per ton and have a capital cost $0.013/kilowatt-hour, assuming $1/ton dirt moving costs. That is very competitive with natural gas storage, but selecting an inexpensive storage material is a tiny part of the battle. The heat addition and removal systems within the dirt mound can't cost more than $0.05-$0.08 per kilowatt-hour thermal. Standard Thermal has had to put in a lot of effort to reach costs in this range. Thermal storage systems are much more challenging to build than the material costs let on.</p>
<h2>Engineering Cheap Storage</h2>
<p>Beating natural gas storage costs requires several paradigm changes and adjustments to keep costs from ballooning to irrelevance.</p>
<h3>The Challenges of Rapid Charge and Discharge</h3>
<div><p>There is an anchoring to the idea that alternative energy storage technologies need to charge and discharge quickly. Rapid cycling is an incredible disadvantage for thermal storage for two reasons:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat Transfer is Slow</strong></p>
<p>Materials that are inexpensive and tolerate high temperatures while exposed to air tend to be oxides that are insulators (dirt, sand, rocks, bricks, etc.). The thermal conductivity is poor, and it is difficult to withdraw heat from more than a few centimeters within minutes or hours.</p>
<p>A block of hot mass with dimensions in tens of meters can take years to fully cool. Dry rock geothermal electricity generation calls for giant fracture networks between two wells to overcome the heat transfer limitation.</p>
<div><p>Regenerative heat exchangers at steel mills are one of the few scaled thermal storage applications. They use special "honeycomb" bricks that maintain high surface area-to-volume ratios to handle ~25 cycles per day.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/checker-brick.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/nMzoXhBNKrFja8CKA">Source</a> Hot Blast Stove Checker Bricks</em></p></div>
<p>Attempts to get around the heat transfer deficiency tend to be complicated. Pumping molten salts was a popular idea for a time. The Department of Energy has a concept that conveys sand through heaters and stores it in a silo until it drops through a heat exchanger to export heat. Other designs pump oil or molten salt through gravel. Several startups use graphite in an inert container to get higher thermal conductivity while preventing oxidation.</p>
<p>Any heat storage design must carefully consider heat transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature Cycling is Damaging</strong></p>
<p>Heated materials undergo transformations. They tend to expand as they heat and contract as they cool, but there are also break points where the basic structure can change. Highly engineered or ordered materials become disordered and fall apart when exposed to thermal cycling.</p>
<div><p>Most heat storage concepts require engineered systems to achieve charge/discharge rate goals, making for a very severe techno-economic challenge.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, there is little market reasoning for rapid cycling. We don't have to fight physics.</p>
<h3>The Case for Slow Discharge</h3>
<div><p>Charge and discharge rates on the order of months are fine.</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Many Customers Use Energy Steadily</strong></p>
<p>More than 10% of world energy consumption is industrial process heat. Almost all these facilities run 24/7 or in defined daily cycles. The energy usage in any one day compared to the cumulative storage needed to shift summer excess to winter usage is tiny. Models project 1500 megawatt-hours of storage for every 1 megawatt of output capacity in a typical US location. Charging with solar requires higher rates than satisfying demand because it delivers the same amount of energy at a lower capacity factor. The charging pace is still leisurely and benefits from electricity's ability to provide high charging temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existing Winter Seasonal Storage is Slow</strong></p>
<div><p>Winter demand is an application that already uses seasonal storage. The clearest example is natural gas. US consumption is less than supply in summer and shoulder seasons, but greater in winter. The industry stores large amounts of gas near customers for winter consumption. Many of these storage sites are depleted gas fields. They can't fill or empty faster than on a timescale of months. Adding more extraction and injection wells is expensive, and there is no need for it.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/naturalgasstorage.gif" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>The natural gas storage seasonal cycle. Source: EIA</em></p></div>
<p>Thankfully, people don't use their entire winter allotment of heating fuel over 1-2 days. They use energy much more regularly, and daily usage is small compared to the total stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batteries Solve Fast Cycling In Electricity Markets</strong></p>
<p>I'm well into the 99th percentile of battery optimists, which is unusual for someone working on alternative storage technologies. The improvement in battery technology over the last twenty years has been incredible. They are already the least expensive way to add grid peaking capacity, and they will move a growing share of daily electricity generation.</p>
<p>People underestimate batteries. There is still significant room to drop costs in cells, packs, and construction/integration. Sub-$100/kWh installation costs are already present in much of the world and should come even to the US in time (tariffs, permitting, and the electrical code are the obstacles). These costs are transformative even in simplistic models, but the various revenue streams for batteries are also underappreciated. They can arbitrage prices across time, provide ancillary services, and arbitrage transmission constraints. The lower installation costs and multiple revenue streams mean that the daily spread between the high and low electricity prices will be much tighter, more like a few tens of dollars per megawatt-hour. That tight spread disadvantages technologies that take advantage of daily volatility with rapid charging or discharging.</p>
<div><p>Instead, markets will send signals to generation sources with low fixed costs that can provide a steady supply over days when solar, wind, or gas are constrained. Batteries will still be too expensive to arbitrage these seasonal differences effectively. Thermal electricity storage is orders of magnitude cheaper for storage, but worse at daily cycling. It can act as a complement to batteries and fill the market niche.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we accept slower charge and discharge rates, then engineering becomes much simpler. Insulation and other factors benefit from the low thermal conductivity of insulating oxides. The thermal mass doesn't need to be highly engineered; it can be regular dirt piled up with some extraction pipes thrown in.</p>
<p>Spending more on electric heaters or heat transfer surface area to improve charge/discharge isn't necessary for the vast majority of applications. Dirt-cheap mass is the main advantage of thermal storage, and it is important to lean into that and take advantage of truly "seasonal" energy shifting.</p>
<h3>Energy From the Sun</h3>
<p>Even free storage isn't helpful if the cost of energy from the solar arrays is more than natural gas. Lazard's yearly report is the industry benchmark for solar's cost per megawatt-hour. The 2025 edition pegs the best-case US cost at $38/megawatt-hour, equivalent to more than $11/MCF of natural gas. The trading hub price for natural gas has been $3-$4/MCF in 2025 (and many years before that), exposing a significant problem for our thesis.</p>
<p>A closer look reveals the issue. The operating cost of a solar farm is very low at $4/megawatt-hour, but the capital cost comes in at $1150/kilowatt in the US, contributing $34/megawatt-hour. Commodity solar panels cost $80/kilowatt globally and $200-$250/kilowatt in the US, meaning there is a lot of waste (and opportunity) in today's solar farm capital cost.</p>
<p>The first slash at these costs comes from co-locating the solar array with the storage system. More than $300/kilowatt of cost comes from preparing electricity for export or connecting to the grid. These items include inverters, medium-voltage transformers, switchgear, substations, high-voltage transformers, power lines to the grid, and all the project management overhead to build these systems.</p>
<div><p>The next phase is to simplify the arrays themselves. Almost all US utility-scale systems use trackers that keep panels faced towards the sun throughout the day. These are expensive, add a lot of mechanical complexity, and cover more land to keep rows from shading each other. Instead, the array can use fixed racking where the panels lie nearly flat. These structures are very lightweight and simple because wind loads are lower. The total area is 2x-3x smaller than the tracking arrays because the panel spacing is tight. Operating costs even fall because there is less to break and less land to mow or pay rent on.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/solararray.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>Our Test Site Solar Array</em></p></div>
<p>The financial implications of the racking change are profound. Install labor and direct racking costs fall, operating costs nearly halve. The electrical wiring decreases 50%, making wiring runs without increasing voltage much more practical. The reduced area opens up land constrained sites. The supply chain shortens dramatically because there are fewer unique parts and longer lead time items. The arrays are simple enough that an outside EPC firm isn't required, knocking off another chunk of cost. Each panel produces less electricity without trackers, but panels are relatively inexpensive, and the other benefits are well worth the penalty.</p>
<p>The result of these changes is that the installation cost for the solar array is the panel cost plus $100-$150/kW. A US array would be $300-$350/kWh, and the levelized cost falls to as low as $16/megawatt-hour, or $4.70/MCF of gas. An array with free market module prices would be equivalent to $3/MCF.</p>
<p>These costs put us within the range of US natural gas prices, and well in the money in most international markets. The consideration is what the end customer actually pays rather than the hub price. There are some large gas consumers, think of a giant ammonia plant, located near gas fields that might pay less than the trading hub price. These will take some time for economic crossover. In most of the US, customers pay 1.5x to 3x the trading hub price to cover transportation, storage, and distribution. Or power plants might be paying 100x the normal price for gas during power crunches. A fixed energy supply cost via co-located solar would be a big advantage for a converted power plant. Even with high US module prices, there is an opportunity to be competitive in many regions.</p>
<h2>Progress and Commercialization</h2>
<p>There was little doubt that a technology like this was technically possible. All the risk is in achieving the incredulously low costs. One of the most critical questions was how engineered the system needs to be. Pure and engineered materials can help make things predictable and reliable, but they are expensive. Ultra-low cost requires using them sparingly. Another concern is unknown costs. Typically, projects miss cost estimates not because a category is poorly estimated but because entire line items are left out. Constructing an end-to-end system became one of the overriding priorities to test these hypotheses.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Built a 100-kilowatt solar array to power testing.</strong></p>
<p>We completed the array within 6 months of saying "Go," including permitting, order lead times, and construction (which was a few weeks at the end). Part of that speed was the simplicity and lack of interconnection, and part was clever (and lucky) planning. We completed all the engineering, procurement, and construction ourselves to prove its feasibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10 Months of Destructive Heater Testing</strong></p>
<p>The biggest cost miracle is the heating elements. Ordering package systems from existing vendors can easily cost hundreds of dollars per kilowatt, even though the resistor material itself is $1-$2/kilowatt. Structure, insulation, controls, and assembly have astronomical costs. The extras are there because heating elements need to last years, but can literally die in one second in conditions outside their boundary. There are only a few materials that are even acceptable as resistors.</p>
<p>Our cost goal for the heaters is $10/kW, close to the cost of the resistor material. A goal so ambitious obviously requires designing and building our own heaters. We have large piles of dead heaters, and now know about every way one can die. Our latest testing suggests we will achieve our cost and reliability goals, and the effort to get there has been incredible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rearchitecting Solar PV Electrical Integration and Safety</strong></p>
<p>Another unpleasant surprise was that the entire solar industry relies on one narrow regulatory pathway that involves inverters and AC interconnection. The equipment needed to satisfy the electrical code for an off-grid DC solar array doesn't exist at any scale without going to grid-forming inverters (we had to buy some discontinued equipment on eBay to complete the test site). Companies usually embed these systems in a grid-tied inverter, which we don't have.</p>
<p>Solar array safety is challenging compared to wiring in a house or factory due to the direct current and constant current nature of solar modules. We've had to design our own controllers and safety systems to have a chance at deploying a commercial project. These are usually "outsourced" to very specialized inverter manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moving Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Building an inexpensive dirt pile is one thing, but embedding pipes and heaters while keeping it cheap is another. We've gone through at least a half dozen configurations before finally settling on a viable construction method.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/moundpicture.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>One version of the mound.</em></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heating Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Lab-scale tests of heating dirt are easy. But, heat flow in a large mound can be more complex with much longer diffusion paths, especially during the early phases (heating the first time is like making bricks in situ). Heating in a test mound has been critical for developing models that are reliable at scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We are now an army of three permanent employees. Jimmy Williams joined in the summer of 2024 to focus on solving the heater cost and reliability challenge. Brian Pal joined more recently to tackle final systems engineering hurdles and refine our prototypes into more robust and replicable commercial designs.</p>
<p>We also have a horde of capable contractors who help with construction or provide specialized engineering and regulatory services.</p>
<p>Working with this team has been a wonderful experience, and their abilities and extremely specific experience has shaved years and tens of millions (or hundreds of millions?) of dollars off the development process.</p>
<h3>The Constant Pressure of Cost and First Customer Systems</h3>
<p>Cost tries to balloon at every turn. Almost every system component has undergone at least one cost crisis, if not many, where that single component could blow the entire project budget. Having a component that costs anything to buy and install is a problem when everything has to be practically free.</p>
<p>Balance-of-system and soft costs are the most challenging, like the heater example. Theoretically, many things can be very cheap, but only under extremely narrow conditions. Any perturbation quickly requires a slew of mitigations that increase the cost and complexity. Rarely do these narrow windows for different subsystems align.</p>
<p>Working out the details has been the most extreme global optimization problem I've worked on. I've had to develop a detailed understanding of solar cells, the electrical code, unsteady state heat transfer, and many other topics in between (My blog output decreased because I had to study at night instead of writing blog posts). We now know what we need to build and will be finalizing the commercial design over the next few months.</p>
<p>The goal is to build the first customer systems in 2026. We are working with several potential customers to ensure our system can successfully integrate with their energy usage (designing a universal, copy-and-paste system that can integrate easily with different customer facilities is another tricky part of the global optimization). Our first system can offer savings for fuel oil, propane, and higher-priced natural gas users. Follow-on systems, especially those larger than a few megawatts, can match the sub-$0.10/kWh natural gas storage cost. Matching energy cost depends on the location and the solar panel cost.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Competitive Edge</h2>
<h3>Differentiation from Existing Thermal Storage Startups</h3>
<p>I would not be working on this problem if I agreed with the development path of other firms in the space.</p>
<p>Every other serious effort is a highly engineered system that has a day to a few days' worth of heat storage. That means competing head-on with batteries, whose cost is already below that of many thermal storage hopefuls.</p>
<p>The Standard Thermal system has months of storage capacity, a cost per kilowatt-hour several orders of magnitude lower than highly engineered systems, and is scalable with a fraction of capital and human resources.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>"What is the moat with a dirt pile?" is a common question. Most sites will have drainage moats, but that usually isn't the answer people are looking for.</p>
<p>The main differences between energy projects like this and software are the difficulty of scaling and customer stickiness. The technology itself is far from enough to achieve scale due to thickets of regulations, permits, certifications, cost pressures, and financing hurdles that add friction to growth. However, the on-site nature of the projects ensures a long-term relationship with the customer. The project size unlocks low customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>There is a well-worn path for scaling infrastructure technologies. Expensive capital builds the first examples. Then there might be debt financing available to borrow against an operating project. Then the debt for new construction. And finally, someone else pays for new projects.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this path is scale and capital efficiency. Developing projects is demanding, and one firm can only take on so many before the overhead and risk become crippling. Each rung up the strategy ladder reduces capital requirements and company risk.</p>
<p>There might be dozens of renewable energy developers with a market cap of more than a billion dollars. No single player can dominate due to the friction and barriers in each project. Each project having a pseudo-monopoly over that particular location also maintains the value of existing systems. The size of the company is related to the size of its projects - big companies have big projects. The same pattern holds in other industries, like oil and gas, where the leading companies operate the most productive fields and focus on megaprojects. Even within the shale industry, the most successful players found the most extensive high-return plays. The company with an all-encompassing vision of being in every play, Chesapeake, declared bankruptcy while its founder died an untimely death.</p>
<p>Another unusual feature of ultra-cheap storage is that the actual storage is a relatively small portion of the cost. But project revenue and viability are solely reliant on it. Lenders must evaluate the risk based on the storage system performance, not low-risk solar arrays or customers with good credit.</p>
<div><p>A multi-phase strategy emerges from these realities:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Initial Projects</strong></p>
<p>The first projects need to validate the technology, provide some revenue, and create a track record for future financing. There is no "chasm of death" as both the off-grid solar and storage systems can scale down to a few megawatts without massive penalties. The diversity of energy users is enough that potential customers with expensive energy exist in this range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale Up Size and Financing</strong></p>
<p>Projects in the tens of megawatts have cost benefits and conserve corporate overhead, allowing faster growth. The track record of the initial projects should open up financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push Lending Rates and Cost Down</strong></p>
<p>Several trends work to make the technology viable in more locations. Solar panels are a significant portion of CAPEX, and continued cost decreases have a disproportionate impact on the levelized cost of heat delivered. Improving solar panel efficiency reduces the land required and saves money on racking and labor. Other custom components, like electrical safety systems and controllers, decrease in cost with scale. Interest rates for borrowing against projects decrease, which has an outsized impact on project breakeven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide Value No One Else Can</strong></p>
<p>The technology can only continue scaling by enabling many project development firms to deploy it. Becoming some version of an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm is a necessity. The bankability and turn-key system can create an excellent buyer surplus by decreasing the overhead and levelized cost of energy for the entire project. Offering a fair price plus friction from patents leaves little opportunity for new entrants and preserves the long-term maintenance and operations relationship.</p>
<p>Many of the necessary components to replicate the system require time (testing, certifications, etc.). Our system costs will continue to fall and become more bankable. That increases the free cash flow hole and time-to-market a new entrant has to weather. It will be much easier to make money by buying the thermal storage system and developing projects rather than trying to copy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Further Upsize Projects and Repeat</strong></p>
<div><p>Larger projects enable the firm to grow without choking on overhead. These projects will almost certainly be power plant conversions or entire city district heating, which are often 10x-100x larger than typical process heat applications. The same follow-on move to EPC unlocks global scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementation of the plan requires excellent execution, but this is always the case with startups. Each rung on the ladder unlocks durable value. Falling short could easily mean being a unicorn project developer instead of being zeroed out.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Handling high seasonal solar variation, dealing with the last 10% of electricity generation in renewables-dominated grids without fossil fuels, and reducing the burden of energy costs in fuel-poor regions have been classified as near-impossible problems at various times.</p>
<p>It is rare to work on something that has the potential to be so impactful and also benefits from my passions for energy and engineering minutiae or low-level global optimization. I'm grateful for that. There is an enormous amount of work ahead to make the impossible possible, and I'm more motivated than ever to see it through and scale the technology.</p>

  <p>At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit
installer for Windows 11 weights <strong>687,230,424 bytes</strong>. After
installation, the program includes 'AI' (of course), an auto-updater,

'new' and 'old'.</p>
<p>For comparison, the size of SumatraPDF-3.5.2 installer is 8,246,744
