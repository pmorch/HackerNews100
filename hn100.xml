implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s). I show GPT-4o the problem as images and in various ascii representations.</p><p><span>My approach is similar in spirit to the approach applied in </span><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AlphaCode</a><span> in which a model generates millions of completions attempting to solve a programming problem and then aggregates over them to determine what to submit.</span></p><p>Actually getting to 50% with this main idea took me about 6 days of work. This work includes constructing few-shot prompts, building better text representations of these grids, iterating against the train set, and implementing various other tweaks to improve performance.</p><p><span>I started on this project a few days before Dwarkesh Patel recorded the recent </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/francois-chollet" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">podcast</a><span> with Chollet. This was inspired by Dwarkesh talking to my coworker Buck about ARC-AGI, and then Buck being like “come on, surely you can do better than current SOTA using LLMs”. Then, I tested GPT-4o a bit and it seemed to get what was going on. I’ve recently been doing some research that involved getting Claude 3 Opus to do reasoning right at the edge of its capabilities, and thought I might have an edge based on my experience from that project.</span></p><p>At a high level, the method I use is:</p><ul><li><p>Provide the ARC-AGI problem to GPT-4o, with both an image representation and with various text representations for each grid in the problem. The text representations include showing which cells are occupied by different connected components of colors and showing diffs between the input and output (in cases where the grid shapes are the same).</p></li><li><p>Instruct GPT-4o to reason about what the transformation is, reason how to implement the transformation as code, and then finally actually implement the transformation in code.</p></li><li><p><span>Use a few-shot prompt with several carefully handwritten examples of step-by-step reasoning</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-6-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">6</a></span><span> to actually get GPT-4o to do this reasoning somewhat effectively. The resulting prompt is usually around 30k tokens long including images.</span></p><ul><li><p>We actually have a pair of few-shot prompts: one prompt for when the grid size changes (in any of the examples) and one for when it doesn’t.</p></li><li><p>We also ensemble over multiple pairs of few-shot prompts. This doesn’t help much, but I already had the samples in the cache.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Sample vast, vast numbers of completions (~5,000 per problem) from GPT-4o.</p></li><li><p>Take the most promising 12 completions for each problem, and then try to fix each by showing GPT-4o what this program actually outputs on the examples, and then asking GPT-4o to revise the code to make it correct. We sample ~3,000 completions that attempt to fix per problem in total across these 12 starting implementations.</p><ul><li><p>We use a few-shot prompt for revisions with step-by-step reasoning.</p></li><li><p>We also have a text representation which shows the diff between the actual output and the expected output.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Then, we select 3 submissions</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-7-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">7</a></span><span> to make based on a majority vote over programs which get the examples correct. (In the case where we don’t have 3 distinct submissions from programs which get the examples right, we apply some heuristics to pick a submission, but this doesn’t matter much.).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In addition to iterating on the training set, I also did a small amount of iteration on a 100 problem subset of the public test set. All the results I presented here were computed on a different subset of the public test set that does not overlap.&nbsp; The train and test set are not IID, and the test set is both much harder and somewhat qualitatively different (I think), so using a subset of the test set for iteration was useful for quickly getting a better sense of how things change with difficulty. It's unfortunate that these sets aren’t IID: it makes iteration harder and more confusing.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-8-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">8</a></span></p><p><span>More of the details of my approach and a bunch of tricks I use to improve performance, can be found at the bottom of this post.

(It does show a simple ascii grid like 8|0|3 where 8, 0, 3 are the colors of that row.)</p></li><li><p>V1 - 1024 samples/pb: 27%. This variant splits into two buckets and uses the spreadsheet style ascii representations (when in the equal image size bucket). It uses different few-shot prompt examples (though the examples overlap with V0).</p><ul><li><p>V1.1 - 1024 samples/pb: 28%: This is just a variant with somewhat arbitrarily different prompts for diversity and because I thought these prompts might be better. (They aren’t really better.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>V2 - 1024 samples/pb: 30%. This variant includes the ascii diff between the input and output and again includes different examples.</p></li><li><p>V2 - 2048 samples/pb: 34%</p></li><li><p>V0 (1024) + V1 (1024) + V1.1 (1024) + V2 (2048): 37%.</p><ul><li><p>This performance is the same as what I would expect from 4096 samples from V2, so the diversity doesn’t seem to help more than the downside of V0/V1/V1.1 being worse than V2.</p></li><li><p>To reach 37% with just V0, I would need around 43,000 samples! (Based on the fit I show below.) So, using better prompting and representations makes a big difference.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Final version (Revision step (3040 / pb with most problems selected) + V0 (1024) + V1 (1024) + V1.1 (1024) + V2 (2048)): 50%</p><ul><li><p>To reach 50% with just samples from V2, I would need 100,000 samples! So the revision is doing a huge amount of work.

I think 70% is probably similar to the performance of typical people on MTurk on the test set, though no number is known.</p><p>GPT-4o is limited by failures other than reasoning, such as:</p><ol><li><p><strong>GPT-4o’s vision is terrible on grids</strong><span>. When asked to describe what is in a somewhat large grid, it often fails to “see” the input correctly, and states wrong facts about what colors are in some location or what shapes are present.</span></p><ol><li><p>In particular, it totally fails to extract the colors of cells from an image for images &gt;12x12 and is quite bad at 8x8.</p></li><li><p>If humans had visual abilities as poor as GPT-4o, it would often take them quite a bit of effort to solve even simple ARC-AGI problems. (If you want a frustrating time, try solving some ARC-AGI problems without using vision other than reading: that is, try to do them without ever drawing out the grids in 2d, forcing yourself to instead just interact with a textual representation of the data. For hard mode, you could try doing this blindfolded, with a friend allowing you to dictate Python lines of code to run on the image. I think this would be quite hard.)</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>GPT-4o isn’t that good at coding</strong><span> (especially not for these sort of geometric manipulation problems), and makes simple mistakes like off-by-one errors extremely often.</span></p><ol><li><p>We don’t do multi-round debugging because it’s probably cheaper and more effective to just get more samples in the current regime.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>GPT-4o is worse at using long contexts</strong><span> than other models:</span></p><ol><li><p>I think the long context for GPT-4o is quite bad and starts taking a big hit after about ~32k to 40k tokens (based on my qualitative impression), which limited my ability to use longer prompts with more examples and more detailed representations.</p></li><li><p>It doesn't seem to respect my few-shot prompt and often does somewhat worse stuff than what it should do based on the few-shot examples. For instance, it systematically responds with much shorter completions than it is supposed to (even if I give it very specific instructions to do otherwise!).</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Not having flexible prefix caching substantially limits approaches</strong><span>. With the n option in the OpenAI api, but without more flexible prefix caching, efficient approaches are limited to just drawing lots of samples rather than efficiently having a large number of reasoning traces which diverge, proceed in parallel, and receive outputs from code (while sharing a few-shot prompt). This massively increases costs for approaches which focus more on doing multi rounds of revision and iteration on all or most implementations rather than just doing a large number of 1-step revisions on one implementation (or a small number of implementations).</span></p></li></ol><p>Removing these non-reasoning weaknesses would improve the performance of my solution by a significant amount.

Maybe prior work on this benchmark scales well with compute and would have gotten higher accuracy with higher resources.</p></li><li><p>There is a broad distribution of problem difficulty even in the test set. For example, some of the problems have a difficult-to-guess component which only has a few sensible options (e.g. pick which of two possible colors to use in some location), and the evaluation metric is top-3 accuracy. Therefore, the gap between our solution’s performance and human performance in the test set may be larger than you would expect when just looking at the numbers.</p><ul><li><p>In practice, changing to top-2 accuracy only affects performance by a tiny amount.

They're actually extremely obvious for human [sic]</p><p>Even children can do them but LLMs cannot. Even LLMs that have 100,000x more knowledge than you do still cannot. The only thing that makes ARC special is that it was designed with this intent to resist memorization. This is the only thing. This is the huge blocker for LLM performance.</p><p>If you look at LLMs closely, it's pretty obvious that they're not really synthesizing new programs on the fly to solve the task that they're faced with.</p></blockquote><p>Contra Chollet, I think that current LLMs are well described as doing at least some useful learning when doing in-context learning.</p><p>In particular, given my results you have to reject one of the following claims:</p><ol><li><p>Getting modest performance on ARC-AGI (e.g. 50%+ on test) requires at least a little runtime "learning" on each problem.</p></li><li><p>Program selection on only a moderate (e.g. 6,000) number of programs (like the way I do it) doesn't count as "learning" in the typical way people think of learning.</p></li><li><p>Current LLMs never "learn" at runtime (e.g. the in-context learning they can do isn't real learning).</p></li></ol><p>Claim 1 seems likely true to me for a reasonable notion of “learning”. I think François Chollet agrees here. Most of my doubts about this claim are concerns that you can basically brute force ARC-AGI without interestingly doing learning (e.g. brute-force search over some sort of DSL or training on a huge array of very similar problems). These concerns apply much less to the kind of approach I used.</p><p>Claim 2 seems true to me: the distribution of programs you are searching over has to be pretty close to the right program for Best-of-6k to work at all: if you did best-of-6k for random python programs, this would not work! Perhaps François Chollet disagrees here, but I think this view would be unreasonable.</p><p><span>Therefore, I think Claim 3 is false: </span><strong>I think LLMs actually do some relevant “learning” when doing in-context learning. </strong><span>Overall performance is very weak (otherwise I wouldn’t have needed to draw thousands of samples in my solution), but it’s some learning nevertheless. (Though there are various obstacles to GPT-4o performing well other than reasoning and learning ability such as vision and coding limitations.)</span></p><p>(One caveat is that this could be false if a substantial fraction of GPT-4o’s performance comes from dataset contamination. This seems very unlikely to me.)</p><p>It’s worth emphasizing that GPT-4o’s learning within a single context seems much less competent than typical human learning. But it is learning nonetheless. My view isn’t that GPT-4o is smart relative to humans in the typical way we mean smart, but I do think it has something which is well described as intelligence.</p><p>Progress has not stalled. I think ARC-AGI will be one benchmark among many that just gets solved by scale, and that as LLMs are scaled up, we should expect them to be able to solve tasks of increasing complexity when used with the appropriate tools, resources and prompting/scaffolding.

And every time you get evidence that indicates that scaling might be dangerously powerful (and I hope this post provided some), you should update appropriately in favor of more caution.</span></p><p><span>ARC-AGI probably isn't a good benchmark for evaluating progress towards TAI: substantial "elicitation" effort could massively improve performance on ARC-AGI in a way that might not transfer to more important and realistic tasks. I am more excited about benchmarks that directly test the ability of AIs to take the role of research scientists and engineers, for example those that </span><a href="https://metr.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">METR</a><span> is developing.

(There is an open leaderboard which has no such constraints.) I expect that SOTA LLMs will be pushing the frontier of progress in ARC-AGI based on these results and general views about what will happen with SOTA LLMs in the next few years. Higher limits on runtime compute seem important for advance warning: if an approach currently costs 10x human labor costs but can do a task, then it will probably cost way less in a few years (or less time) as further optimizations accrue. For instance, substantially optimizing the runtime compute used by my approach seems doable.</span></p><p>Overall, I appreciate the approach of ARC-AGI and I appreciate that Chollet and Knoop have made strong and relatively specific claims. (Some of which now seem to be contradicted!) Nonetheless, I think there are substantially better ways to benchmark progress toward transformative AI.</p><p>I use a bunch of tricks to improve performance:</p><ul><li><p>I split problems into two buckets: problems where the grid is the same size in the input and the output (in the examples) and problems where the size differs on any example input. I use a different prompt for these two cases. I use different examples and I also use a more extensive ascii representation in the case where the grids are the same size, as this representation is more useful in this case. I also use different prompts when having GPT-4o fix attempted implementations.</p></li><li><p>I use various ascii representations (in the case where grids are the same size) to make it easier for GPT-4o, which is very bad at this type of vision, to analyze the grid. Few-shot examples use these representations when reasoning. We show:</p><ul><li><p>The grid as a 2d array where each location has both the color and that location is spreadsheet/chess style notation (e.g. A7, B3, etc.)</p></li><li><p>The list of all locations (in spreadsheet style notation) at which a given color occurs. We split this up into connected components to make shapes easier to understand.</p></li><li><p>A normalized view of connect components (shapes) which shows the spreadsheet notation with shapes translated to have minimum row and column at 0. This makes it easier to compare shapes without getting confused by offsets.</p></li><li><p>A “diff” between the input and output represented as pairs of distinct colors and the locations at which the input has the first color and the output has the second color (e.g., black changes to green).[^diffonly] This is only used in a subset of examples (see below about ensembling over few-shot prompts).</p></li><li><p>When revising implementations, I also show an ascii diff between the expected and actual output for each of the examples. This is shown regardless of whether the input/output grid for the examples are the same size. (Though it can only be shown if the expected and actual output have the same shape.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I do a bit of local search to optimize prompts (on different subsets of the data from the subsets where I report performance!). Mostly, this looks like deciding which few-shot examples to include and which to put at the start/end of the prompt (which the model probably pays more attention to).</p></li><li><p>I use a few-shot prompt for the revision operation rather than just asking the model to revise. In the few shot prompt, I include some cases where revision is both reasonably doable and the model failed to successfully revise (on a prior version of the prompt on the train set).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I use a somewhat non-trivial hamming distance approach for picking which implementations to revise though I don’t think details here matter much (based on my testing). I end up selecting 12 solutions which are ranked in closeness to the output and then using 3040 samples split over these solutions. I allocate the samples by reducing the samples by 25% for each successive item (the first item gets 384 samples, the second gets 288, the third 224 (I round to the closest 32), and so on).&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>I use the geometric mean of the hamming distance ranks to each of the outputs in the examples. (That is, I get the distances for each implementation, I rank them based on these distances, and then I take the geometric mean of these ranks across examples.) I also encourage slightly more diversity by penalizing for being too close to the solutions I’ve already selected. I only revise implementations that produce valid grids. I also skip implementations that produce a grid with a size that doesn’t match the expected output for problems where the size shouldn’t change (based on the examples).</p></li><li><p>I somewhat arbitrary upsample completions from better prompts, in particular the V2 prompt described above is upsampled. I just guessed at a constant offset to add for V2 to to remove for V0 based on some eyeballing of the typical geometric mean and what I thought might make sense. I didn’t optimize these values.</p></li><li><p>I only do revision on problems with fewer than 32 solutions that are correct on the examples with the idea being that we probably got the other solutions correct and thus don’t need to run this. I filter out solutions which are correct on the examples (as it's unclear what revision should do in this case).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I ensemble over several few-shot prompts. I think this somewhat improves performance over more samples with a fixed few-shot prompt (the diversity improvement is larger on the test distribution than the train distribution I think) and I already had a bunch of these samples from prior runs.</p></li><li><p>To pick what to submit, I do a majority vote and pick the top-3. First, I do a majority vote over the implementations which are correct on the training set. If this doesn’t produce three outputs (because there are less than 3 distinct outputs from implementations which are correct on the training set), I do a majority vote over implementations where I weight implementations based on how close they are to the expected output on the examples. In particular, I use the same geometric mean of hamming distance ranks metric discussed above where the weight for the majority vote is the reciprocal of this geometric mean.</p><ul><li><p>I don’t think the details of this matter much (and it isn’t optimized), I just thought something like this would be a good idea.</p></li><li><p>I also reject outputs which are equal to the test input. There are no cases in ARC-AGI where the test output is equal to the test input. This is more important than you might have thought because implementations which make no changes sometimes do well according to the hamming distance metric but are surely wrong. (If there are multiple test inputs, we reject if any are the same.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I use the n option from the GPT-4 API to make more samples cheaper.</p></li></ul><p>Some tricks I don’t use that might improve performance:</p><ul><li><p>I currently spend the same number of samples on each problem. You could terminate early on problems which are consistently solved. I think this might reduce cost by perhaps 25-35%.</p></li><li><p>In the OpenAI API, I use n &lt; 128 (typically 32 or 16) because n=128 typically errors from what I’ve seen. Currently it seems like about half of my cost is input tokens, so going to n=128 would roughly halve the cost.</p></li><li><p>It would probably help to divide the problems into substantially more categories and then build specialized prompts and tools for each category. This somewhat defeats the point of ARC-AGI though and I’m not sure what these categories would be.</p></li><li><p>Doing a second or third revision round could help substantially. (Relative to spending these samples elsewhere.)</p></li><li><p>Further extending the debugging/revision process could help substantially.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning of GPT-4o to better understand the representations I use (and be able to see) would surely help a bunch (though it would be expensive).</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<p>             Stop Using Fandom
                2024-06-16

     fandom is a wiki website (allegedly)

if you are unfortunate enough to browse a fandom wiki
without an ad blocker, you will experience what i like
to call "attention assault"

upon opening a fandom page (for me, it was the hollow
knight wiki), you will note the very subtle aroma of a
1/3 page banner ad, placed ever so daintily at the top of
the page.

my ad was for furniture - ah yes, just what i wanted.
a multi-thousand-dollar furniture purchase to go with my
video game bug lore.

i have been using fandom for 1 second

and i already want to leave

...

as i scroll down, i'm assaulted by an auto-playing video
ad for dog food.

i do not have a dog.

in the top-left corner of the video sits a little "1/2",
indicating the presence of a second ad. another dog food
ad. actually, exactly the same dog food ad.

this "content" is in the middle of the hollow knight
fandom wiki. when i scroll down, the video shrinks into
the bottom-right corner of my screen and stalks me
around the website, begging for attention.

after the ads finish playing, a 60 minute video called
"honest trailers" starts. this must be the actual video
that i've been sitting through ads to witness.

"honest trailers" is not hollow knight related - it's two
guys vaping &amp; reviewing the new mario movie trailer.
they're arguing about whether chris pratt is a good FIT
to voice act MARIO

after about 5 seconds (no, i'm not kidding), another ad
break occurs.

it's the same dog food ad. AGAIN.

...

scrolling further down, i reach the end of the wiki page,
and there are two banner ads waiting, as if to bid me
farewell after my arduous journey through this shit-ass
website.

- one 1/3 page footer ad for Ubisoft+
- one 1/4 page sidebar ad for sunscreen

i don't need sunscreen. i need fandomscreen.

          some fandom history

from the very beginning, fandom was about profit:
  2004: jimmy founds wikicities
  2006: wikicities renamed to wikia
  2006: random venture capital firms invest $4M
  2006: amazon.com invests $10M
  2012: venture firms + amazon invest $11M
  2014: venture firms invest $15M
  2016: wikia renamed to fandom
  2018: enormous private equity firm acquires fandom

  grand total: $40M

and what, dear readers, do venture capitalists want when
they invest $40M into something?

returns. at all costs.

let the enshittification begin.

&gt; but wait, what does fandom actually _do_?

what valuable service does fandom provide to the world?

fandom generates enough money to retain a staff of 300+,
and rent several offices, including a very beautiful
building in downtown san francisco.

as far as i can tell, this is fandom's business model:
  1. users write wiki content on fandom
  2. fandom displays your content on a wiki page
  3. pelt fandom visitors with ads
  4. $$$$$$$$ YUM YUM YUM, MONEY!! $$$$$$$$$


many fandom communities noticed fandom degrading.

at first, it was the ads. huge, annoying, irrelevant ads
embedded directly in the content.

obtrusive ads obviously suck, but hey, adblockers are a
thing, so maybe ours users could j...

INTRODUCING:
  THE MCDONALD'S GRIMACE SHAKE PROMOTION CONTROVERSY!

in 2023, mcdonald's paid fandom an unknown[1] amount of
money to temporarily replace the mcdonald's wiki main
page + grimace article with advertisements promoting the
grimace shake.

the grimace shake.

i can't make this shit up.

fandom set the precedent that companies could pay them
and make user content go *poof*

          fandom shall burn

wikis aren't quite like other websites.

  - wiki software is largely open source
  - wiki content authors are often technical
  - users don't care where wikis are hosted

three simple ingredients. one predictable outcome.

              mass exodus.

the runescape[2] and minecraft[3] communities acted
first, migrating their treasured wikis to their own
domains.

many other wikis followed.
  hollow knight (yay bugz!)
  terraria
  animal crossing
  stardew valley
  EVE Online
  Factorio
  dota2
  ...
  AND MANY, MANY MORE[4]

over 300 wikis have migrated away from fandom, and i can
only hope that this trajectory accelerates. nothing makes
me happier than passionate communities showing everyone
that a better world is possible.


if you want to help,

  1. download Indie Wiki Buddy

     indie wiki buddy tells you when a fandom page has an
     alternative community-led wiki. it's a great plugin
     that will help you support and discover independent
     wikis.

  2. if you must use fandom, turn on your ad blocker
  3. if you own a wiki on fandom, move it off!

my offer: if you are a fandom wiki owner &amp; you would
          like to move your wiki content elsewhere, i
          will offer you my expertise at $0/hour. i know
	  lots about servers, software, and maintenance.
	  just email me - let's get you out of fandom's

<p>The Belgian EU Council presidency seems set to have bulk Chat Control searches of our private communications greenlighted by EU governments on Wednesday 19 June. This confirms concerns that <strong>the proponents of Chat Control intend to exploit the period shortly after the European Elections during which there is less public attention and the new European Parliament is not yet constituted.</strong> If Chat Control is endorsed by Council now, experience shows there is a great risk it will be adopted at the end of the political process.</p>



<p>The good news is that <strong>many EU governments have not yet decided whether to go along with this final Belgian push for Chat Control </strong>mass surveillance, among them </p>



<ul>
<li>Italy, </li>



<li>Finland, </li>



<li>the Czech Republic, </li>



<li>Sweden, </li>



<li>Slovenia, </li>



<li>Estonia, </li>



<li>Greece and </li>



<li>Portugal.</li>
</ul>



<p>Only Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland are relatively clear that they will not support the proposal, but this is not sufficient for a “blocking minority”.</p>



<p><strong>So you need to take action now.</strong> More than ever, the resistance of civil society against Chat Control is crucial. There are many things you can do. The three most important steps are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Contact your government and tell it to vote against Chat Control on Wednesday, 19 June (find contact details below).</li>



<li>Ring the alarm bells online. You can use <a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk">campaign sharepics and explanatory videos in all languages</a>. Don’t let the Council presidency get away with pushing this through silently now.</li>



<li>Meet at least one person offline and plan to take action together. For example involve non-governmental organisations, academics, companies or the media in your country, organise open letters or opinion articles in the media or even protests (some protests are currently being organised for Tuesday, 18 June).</li>
</ol>



<h3>Contact your government</h3>



<p>It is crucial we demonstrate that civil society is alert now. You can either contact your ministeries of the interior and of justice, or you can contact your government’s ‘permanent representatation’ to the EU. You can find the contact details for all permanent representations on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/COREPER/">website „EU Whoiswho“</a>.</p>



<p>Tell your government that the <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">current draft</a> on Chat Control (officially called “Regulation … to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”) is unacceptable. You can find a summary of the draft in this <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/majority-for-chat-control-possible-users-who-refuse-scanning-to-be-prevented-from-sharing-photos-and-links/">blogpost</a>, and there is critical analysis by <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/be-scanned-or-get-banned/">European Digital Rights</a> and <a href="https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/May-2024-CDT-Europe-Feedback-on-the-Belgian-Presidencys-compromise-on-the-Regulation-on-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material.pdf">CDT</a>. Be polite but also resolute and ask them to clearly voice their disagreement with the proposal and to vote against the proposal.</p>



<p>Further, ask them to insist on a formal vote and for the abstentions to be properly counted by the Presidency. (Otherwise, in the Permanent Representatives Committee, sometimes the procedural trick is used not to ask for abstentions and to ignore them).</p>



<h3>Timeline</h3>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/CM-3141-2024-INIT/en/pdf">13 June</a>, ministers of the interior discussed the progress of discussions (<a href="https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27508">find a recording here</a>). The Belgian Council presidency <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-10666-2024-INIT/en/pdf">announced</a> that they will present a new compromise proposal afterwards. According to documents <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/anlasslose-massenueberwachung-frankreich-wackelt-in-der-ablehnung-der-chatkontrolle/#dokument">leaked by netzpolitik.org</a>, the COREPER 2 meeting in which they will put it to a vote will already take place on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/mpo/2024/6/coreper-2-permanent-representatives-committee-(337001)/">19 June</a>.</p>



<p><strong>So we all need to take action as soon as possible</strong> and demand a firm “No” by our governments against the Chat Control proposal to ward off this attempt to greenlight Chat Control in the Permanent Representatives Committee on 19 June. <strong>Time is pressing. This may be our last chance to stop Chat Control!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In April 2024, I found and reported two critical bugs to <a href="https://www.sei.io/">Sei Network</a> concerning their layer-1 blockchain. One of these issues impacted the chain’s availability, and the other its integrity. The Sei Foundation awarded me $75,000 and $2,000,000 respectively for these reports.</p>

<p>Both issues were caught after the code had been audited, merged, and slated for release but <strong>before</strong> it was shipped to production. As a result, no funds were put at risk. If it had made it to mainnet, the funds at risk from issue 2 would have been the entire Sei token market cap, or about $1B USD mark to market.</p>

<h2 id="issue-1">Issue 1</h2>

<p>If exploited, the first issue would have caused the chain to halt.</p>

<p>The Sei Network is a “Cosmos chain”, meaning it leverages the Cosmos SDK for its blockchain application and uses a tendermint fork (well, actually, Sei’s own fork of a fork) for consensus. Cosmos applications operate on blocks, which contain transactions, which further contain individual messages. Each of these messages triggers a state transition. The Cosmos SDK is written in Go.</p>

<p>Cosmos uses go panics for error handling. Transaction runs out of gas? panic. Try to spend more coins than you have? panic. Invalid inputs? panic.</p>

<p>To handle this, transactions are run within a <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/advanced/runtx_middleware">recovery loop</a> called the <code>RunTx recovery middleware</code>. When Cosmos processes a block of transactions, the flow is kind of like this (heavily simplified).</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>There’s some preprocessing to set up a block, transactions are safely processed within a recovery loop, and then there is some work to do at the end of a block. Every Cosmos <code>module</code> can specify its own start and end processing hooks too. These hooks are one type of <code>ABCI method</code>. Unfortunately, by default, ABCI methods are not run in a recovery loop. Woops! If you panic <em>there</em>, the program will simply crash.</p>

<p>I first learned of this Cosmos footgun from Trail of Bits’ fantastic <code>building-secure-contracts</code> repo. ref: <a href="https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic">https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic</a></p>

<p>Sei had a panic in one of its ABCI EndBlockers, which would have reliably halted the chain if the code was reached. Remediation would have required a hard fork.</p>

<p>While looking through all of the ABCI hooks in the Sei codebase for reachable panics, one stood out to me: <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/49eb8b3d205d4a73c5e2b2bb3a433f886279028b/x/evm/module.go#L232">https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/49eb8b3d205d4a73c5e2b2bb3a433f886279028b/x/evm/module.go#L232</a></p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above code, at the end of every block, goes through each transaction and tries to empty the “coinbase address” of any tokens. The way this is done is first the coinbase address’s balance is retrieved via a call to <code>GetBalance</code> and then this resulting balance is transferred out by a call to <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code>.</p>

<p>What the coinbase address represents in Sei doesn’t matter here. What’s important is that it is a deterministic address, calculable in advance. The address is calculated as a function of a tx’s index in a block. So the first tx in a block always has a “coinbase address” of <code>sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>The mistake here stems from the fact that cosmos chains have a notion of locked and unlocked balances. The <code>GetBalance</code> function called above returns the total of locked+unlocked funds. If, for example, the coinbase address has 42sei of locked funds and 1000sei of unlocked funds, the <code>GetBalance</code> call will report a total balance of 1042sei. However, because we can only transfer unlocked funds, the <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> call will return an error if we call it with any number greater than 1000ei. When <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> is called with an amount of 1042 sei, it will return an error and then we will reach the call to panic.</p>

<p>One way to end up with locked funds is via a vesting account. If, for example, I want to grant you one thousand tokens linearly over four years then I can create a vesting account and the unlocks are handled automatically by Cosmos. When creating a vesting account I can specify its address and any unused address will do. I don’t need the keys to it or anything.</p>

<p>Now we have all the pieces needed to reach an ABCI panic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a vesting account at the <code>sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv</code> address with some tokens.</li>
  <li>Send an EVM tx to Sei to reach this code block.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the vesting account all we have to do is run a command like  <code>seid tx vesting create-vesting-account sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv 1000000000000000usei 1800000000 --from my_account --fees 50000usei</code> from the seid CLI tool.</p>

<p>Once this command is executed and the vulnerable code is run, the coinbase balance will be greater than zero but not entirely transferable. The call to <code>GetBalance</code> will return the sum of locked and unlocked tokens. Calling <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> with this sum will return an error, and a panic will be triggered. The application will crash and the chain will halt.</p>

<p>To fix the issue, the call to <code>GetBalance</code> was simply replaced with a call to <code>SpendableCoins</code>. Easy! For safety, later on the panic was removed entirely.</p>

<h2 id="issue-2">Issue 2</h2>

<p>If exploited, the second issue would have allowed an attacker to freely transfer funds out of any account.</p>

<p>When browsing through the fix commit and subsequent changes made as a result of the previous issue, I noticed some interesting code at the junction of Sei’s Cosmos and Geth modules.</p>

<p>At this time the Sei team was just wrapping up their work on Sei V2. V2 introduced the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to Sei. Integrating the EVM into a system like Cosmos is a sensitive process. Neither of these systems were designed with the other’s compatibility in mind and trying to combine them is difficult. It’s easy to introduce subtle yet disastrous bugs to your blockchain when doing this.</p>

<p>In the fix PR for the previous issue, an unrelated bug was also patched in the evm account balance handling code. Looking at this file, I noticed that <code>SubBalance</code> and <code>AddBalance</code> had provisions for negative numbers:</p>

<p>Subtracting -x Sei tokens from an account is just redirected to be the same as adding +x. Similarly, adding -x Sei tokens to an account is redirected to the code for subtracting +x.</p>

<p>That’s interesting. I wonder, how are balance transfers handled in the EVM anyways?</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>If one could slip a negative amount into <code>Transfer</code>, they could siphon Sei <em>from</em> an account rather than transferring Sei <em>to</em> an account.</p>

<p>What guards are there before we reach Transfer?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// CanTransfer checks whether there are enough funds in the address' account to make a transfer.</span>

<p>Looks like an account can make transfers as long as it has more than the <code>amount</code> being transferred. Looks good so far. Say I want to steal 100sei; I’d need to send a transfer of -100sei. Well, even a 0sei balance is more than -100sei. So for negative amounts this check will always pass.</p>

<p>Of course, there may be even more checks prior to this. Or not. It’s a big codebase, I don’t know. Let’s just write the code and see what happens.</p>

<p>In SeiV2 there are three high level ways to trigger this EVM transfer code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From EVM space, use a <code>CALL</code>, <code>CREATE</code> or <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> opcode</li>
  <li>Send a top level EVM Message packaged in a transaction</li>
  <li>From cosmwasm space, send an internal EVM message</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these routes allow transfers of negative value then we will be able to steal the entire unlocked balance from any account.</p>

<hr>
<p>Right off the bat the first option will not work. The EVM uses 256 bit registers that we can set freely as opcode arguments but the state transition handling code for <code>CALL</code> and <code>CREATE</code> treat these as unsigned integers, so they are always positive. <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> triggers transfers but doesn’t take a value argument.</p>

<hr>
<p>The second option seems promising. We only need to construct a <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code> with negative value. However, Sei’s <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code> type uses the RLP encoding from Geth for the data field, which itself includes the <code>value</code> field. <code>value</code> is typed as a big int, which is a signed type and can be negative! Unfortunately there is no valid RLP encoding for a negative big int: when encoding, the sign information is discarded. When decoding, the output is always positive.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// WriteBigInt encodes a big.Int as an RLP string.</span>
<span>// Note: Unlike with Encode, the sign of i is ignored.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>EncoderBuffer</span><span>)</span> <span>WriteBigInt</span><span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>*</span><span>big</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>w</span><span>.</span><span>buf</span><span>.</span><span>writeBigInt</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>The third option uses yet another execution mode contained in Sei. Really Sei V2 has three modes of executing transactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cosmos messages</li>
  <li>cosmwasm</li>
  <li>EVM</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically cosmwasm and EVM programs are both triggered by high level cosmos messages, but it’s worth considering them separately. Cosmos transactions contain messages that execute specific functions. For example a message might execute an action like “stake some coins” or “send some coins”. These functions are baked into the chain code and are not generally programmable by end users.</p>

<p>The community found this a bit limiting, so to add more flexibility cosmwasm was introduced to bring a web assembly environment to Cosmos. This enabled general-purpose smart contract programming by end users.</p>

<p>Finally, Sei V2 builds on both of these and adds a bespoke EVM environment to the mix. The way this is done is by linking to go-ethereum and adding hooks to connect the EVM state mutations to the underlying Cosmos system and storage.</p>

<p>So now in addition to the fixed functions that can be called by messages, we also have the ability to specify messages that “create a cosmwasm or EVM program” or “execute a cosmwasm or EVM program”. The cosmwasm (web assembly) module is well tested and widely used. Sei’s EVM integration is custom, only used by Sei, and brand new.</p>

<p>At the time of my report, a Cosmos message in Sei could bounce execution back and forth between these environments as much as it wants. One could, for example, send a transaction that contains a message to call a cosmwasm program, which then dispatches a cosmos message to send coins, receives its result and calls an EVM contract.</p>

<p>Calling an EVM smart contract from cosmwasm in SeiV2 is slightly different from making a top-level EVM call directly. To make a cosmwasm -&gt; EVM call we use one of the following “internal” message types instead of <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MsgInternalEVMCall</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Sender</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Value</span>  <span>*</span><span>github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span>
	<span>To</span>     <span>string</span>
	<span>Data</span>   <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>MsgInternalEVMDelegateCall</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Sender</span>       <span>string</span>
	<span>CodeHash</span>     <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
	<span>To</span>           <span>string</span>
	<span>Data</span>         <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
	<span>FromContract</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Remember, what we’re interested in is triggering a transfer with a negative <code>amount</code> or <code>value</code> (these terms are used interchangeably at times). Of these two internal call types, only <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> allows us to specify a value to go along with the call. And it’s a signed int!</p>

<p>To find out whether or not I could successfully use <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> to make a siphoning transfer I added the following test to Sei’s test suite and ran it.</p>

<p>Sure enough, we can send an internal EVM call from an attacker account to a victim account with a negative value and siphon out that value from the victim’s balance.</p>

<p>At this point all funds on the chain are at risk. An attacker could freely steal Sei tokens from centralized exchanges, cold wallets, etc. Given that Sei is trading at around a $1 billion market cap with &gt;$100M of daily volume between derivatives and spot, there is a lot of profit opportunity here.</p>

<p>But for fun, we can take this bug even further.</p>

<p>Cosmos chains operate on proof of stake consensus. For Sei, this means that the 50 validators with the most stake are responsible for producing and verifying new blocks on the chain. All 50 validators’ stakes are held in one account called the “bonded token pool”.</p>

<p>An attacker can become the #1 most powerful validator on the chain by simply stealing the balance of the bonded token pool, and staking that sum again themselves. When they do this the tokens are returned to the same account they stole them from.  If you create 50 accounts, and do this 50 times, you will own all of the top 50 validators and control the chain. Because the active validator set is recalculated at the end of every block in an ABCI method, this whole attack can be done in one block.</p>

<p>Under the tendermint consensus system, anyone with &gt;2/3rds stake can arbitrarily choose what blocks are canonical on the chain. At this point the chain is considered compromised and needs to be hard forked from before the attack. Some things the attacker can do include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Censor anyone’s transactions. If someone tried to use this same exploit to steal coins back from the attacker, their transactions can be ignored and will never land in a block.</li>
  <li>Commit invalid state transitions. The attacker can use their 2/3rds stake to attest to whatever blocks they want, including ones with arbitrary information and proofs in the block header.</li>
  <li>Double spend coins.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the token theft mechanism is perfectly valid according to the chain’s code, certain types of faults like committing invalid blocks will be rejected by honest full nodes. These nodes will simply stop advancing their local chain in the face of a safety fault. But other attacks, like transaction censoring, are not detectable.</p>

<p>Light clients that only check validator proofs, like those used in IBC, will accept any of the attacker blocks.</p>

<p>Timeline:</p>
<ul>
  <li>April 23, 2024: I create the report on Immunefi</li>
  <li>April 24, 2024: The Sei team merge a PR fixing the bug</li>
  <li>April 24, 2024: The Sei team confirm the report</li>
  <li>May 22, 2024: The Sei team send payment of $2,000,000</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to thank the Sei Foundation for their commendable efforts in securing the Sei protocol. It is only due to their thoroughness in designing Sei’s security strategy that these bugs were able to be caught before the vulnerable code was deployed to mainnet. The issues described here are subtle and persisted through Sei’s internal code review and several external audits. However Sei has gone above and beyond, putting a large amount of resources towards setting up a public bug bounty program in their pursuit of defense in depth. In rapidly addressing and honestly rewarding these reports, the Sei Foundation has demonstrated their absolute commitment to protecting their users.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<p>Particularly attentive readers might notice that the test I added to confirm issue 2 is not actually an end to end proof of concept.</p>

<p>In the test I constructed a <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> directly. But in a real attack scenario we would have to create a cosmwasm contract compiled to webassembly, populate this struct from there, serialize it to JSON, and send it as a submessage from cosmwasm back to the main cosmos application which would construct the <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> for us.</p>

<p>These two scenarios are not identical. The JSON-&gt;Msg encoder and handler functions are both custom written by the Sei team and were skipped in my test. It is reasonable to wonder whether or not there they contain additional guards that might prevent the attack but were skipped in the test I made.</p>

<p>When submitting my report to Sei I was very confident that there were no such guards, as I had read all of the code many times at that point and knew it inside and out. But eventually I wanted to test stealing tokens from the bonded validator pool to take over the validator set. I ended up making a proper end to end proof of concept because I wasn’t sure whether or not the bonded token pool had any special status as an account, potentially with some sort of lock on its tokens, and wanted to test this.</p>

<p>The following cosmwasm contract exploits the bug and drains the bonded token pool.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 19:10:24 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://htmx.org/posts/2024-06-17-htmx-2-0-0-is-released/">https://htmx.org/posts/2024-06-17-htmx-2-0-0-is-released/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40709769">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
  <h2 id="htmx-2-0-0-release">htmx 2.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I’m very happy to announce the release of htmx 2.0.  This release ends support for Internet Explorer and tightens up some
defaults, but does not change most of the core functionality or the core API of the library.</p>
<p>Note that we are not marking 2.0 as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose"><code>latest</code></a> in NPM 
because we do not want to force-upgrade users who are relying on non-versioned CDN URLs for htmx.  Instead, 1.x will
remain <code>latest</code> and the 2.0 line will remain <code>next</code> until Jan 1, 2025. The website, however, will reference 2.0.</p>
<h3 id="major-changes">Major Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>All extensions have been moved out of the core repository to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx-extensions/">their own repo</a>
and website: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://extensions.htmx.org/">https://extensions.htmx.org</a>.  They are now all versioned individually and can be developed outside of
the normal (slow) htmx release cadence.
<ul>
<li>Most 1.x extensions will work with 2.x, however the SSE extension did have a break and must be upgraded.</li>
<li>The older extensions remain in the <code>/dist/ext</code> directory so as to not break the URLs of CDNs like unpkg, but please
move to the new extension URLs going forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We removed the deprecated <code>hx-sse</code> and <code>hx-ws</code> attributes in favor of the extensions, which were available and
recommended in 1.x.</li>
<li>HTTP <code>DELETE</code> requests now use parameters, rather than form encoded bodies, for their payload (This is in accordance w/ the spec.)</li>
<li>We now provide specific files in <code>/dist</code> for the various JavaScript module styles:
<ul>
<li>ESM Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.esm.js</code></li>
<li>UMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.umd.js</code></li>
<li>AMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.amd.js</code></li>
<li>The <code>/dist/htmx.js</code> file continues to be browser-loadable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>hx-on</code> attribute, with its special syntax, has been removed in favor of the less-hacky <code>hx-on:</code> syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-changes">Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>We made some default changes:
<ul>
<li><code>htmx.config.scrollBehavior</code> was changed to <code>'instant'</code> from <code>'smooth'</code></li>
<li>As mentioned previously, <code>DELETE</code> requests now use query parameters, rather than a form-encoded body.  This can
be reverted by setting <code>htmx.methodsThatUseUrlParams</code> to  the value <code>['get']</code>,</li>
<li><code>htmx.config.selfRequestsOnly</code> now defaults to <code>true</code> rather than <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Not much, really:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>selectAndSwap()</code> internal API method was replaced with the public (and much better) <a href="https://htmx.org/api/#swap"><code>swap()</code></a> method</li>
<li>Web Component support has been <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/web-components/">improved dramatically</a></li>
<li>And the biggest feature of this release: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">the website</a> now supports dark mode! (Thanks <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pokonski">@pokonski</a>!)</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete upgrade guide can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://htmx.org/migration-guide-htmx-1/">htmx 1.x -&gt; 2.x Migration Guide</a></p>
<p>If you require IE compatibility, the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://v1.htmx.org/">1.x</a> will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="installing">Installing</h3>
<p>htmx 2.0 can be installed via a package manager referencing version <code>2.0.0</code>, or can be linked via a CDN:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.0/dist/htmx.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>or <a href="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.0/dist/htmx.min.js" download="">Downloaded</a></p>

<p dir="auto">If you are invovled in developing, supporting, or maintaining an application that sends emails, this guide is a must read. This guide is your key to peace of mind, knowing that your emails will reach your customers as intended and your domain is shielded from abuse from cybercriminals and spammers.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's about ensuring they reach the intended destination - the recipient's inbox, not the spam or junk folder. For instance, You've built an e-commerce application or a SaaS platform that sends transactional emails like order confirmations or password resets or important customer notification emails. These emails are crucial touchpoints for your customers. But what if they never see them? What if these important communications end up in spam or junk?</p>
<p dir="auto">While email is one of the most common communication channels, it's also a favorite target for cybercriminals and a playground for spammers. Here are some real-world examples of how they can abuse email systems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: A cybercriminal wants to steal sensitive information from the customers of a well-known bank. The criminal could spin up or use a compromised server to send emails that appear to come from the bank's domain, asking customers to update their account information. If the bank hasn't implemented SPF, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the customer's inbox. The customer, thinking the email is from their bank, clicks the link and enters their login details on a fake website controlled by the criminal. The criminal can now access the customer's bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Brand Impersonation</strong>: A cybercriminal could impersonate a popular e-commerce platform and send emails to users asking them to confirm their purchase of an expensive item. The email could contain a link to a fake customer support page where the user is asked to enter their login details to cancel the purchase. If the e-commerce platform hasn't implemented DKIM, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the user's inbox. The user, thinking the email is from the e-commerce platform, enters their login details on the fake page, giving the criminal access to their account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</strong>: A cybercriminal could impersonate a company's CEO or another high-ranking official and send an email to the finance department, asking them to make a payment to a new vendor. If the company hasn't implemented DMARC, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the finance department's inbox. The finance department, thinking the email is from the CEO, could make the payment to the criminal's bank account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">By understanding and implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, you can protect your domain from being used in these types of attacks, safeguard your customers and employees, and maintain your reputation.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, why bother? Because your emails matter, your customers matter, and your reputation matters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Choose This Guide?</h2><a id="user-content-why-choose-this-guide" aria-label="Permalink: Why Choose This Guide?" href="#why-choose-this-guide"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With so many articles out in the internet why should I choose this guide? This guide stands out for its simplicity, clarity, and convenience. It demystifies SPF, DKIM, and DMARC with clear explanations and examples avoiding the technical jargon as much as possible. Hosted on GitHub, it integrates seamlessly with your development environment, providing quick access to information right from your IDE (visual studio code ,etc.) or command line. Plus, it's a document that will stay in Github and guaranteed that won't go anywhere that can be edited by you or anyone or the community to ensure it stays updated and relevant.</p>

<p dir="auto">While this guide aims to simplify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, it's not intended to be a comprehensive guide about these topics. It's not a guide for setting up an email server, nor does it cover advanced topics like encryption or secure email gateways.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SPF, DKIM, and DMARC: Simplified</h2><a id="user-content-spf-dkim-and-dmarc-simplified" aria-label="Permalink: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC: Simplified" href="#spf-dkim-and-dmarc-simplified"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</h3><a id="user-content-spf-sender-policy-framework" aria-label="Permalink: SPF (Sender Policy Framework)" href="#spf-sender-policy-framework"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">SPF: It's like a list of friends who can send emails for you. The SPF Record is this list. If an email says it's from you but it's not sent by a friend on your list, it's probably not really from you.</p>
<p dir="auto">As the owner of a domain, you can use SPF to create a list of 'email friends' - these are the mail servers that are allowed to send emails on your behalf. This helps stop people who aren't your 'email friends' from pretending to be you. The SPF Record, a DNS TXT record, is where you keep this list of 'email friends'.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record for an SPF your 'email friends' typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=spf1 ip4:123.123.123.123 ~all"><pre>v=spf1 ip4:123.123.123.123 <span>~</span>all</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</h3><a id="user-content-dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail" aria-label="Permalink: DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)" href="#dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DKIM: It's like a secret note inside your emails. When you send an email, you put a secret note inside. This note is made using a special secret code only you know.
When your email arrives, the receiver checks the secret note using a public code that everyone knows. This public code is stored in a place called the DKIM Record.
If the secret note matches the public code, the email is really from you and hasn't been changed. This helps stop bad people from pretending to send emails from you or changing your emails.</p>
<p dir="auto">This public code, also known as a public key, is stored in a DNS TXT record known as the DKIM Record, which is accessible to everyone. It's like the decoder for your secret code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record, where the public code (or public key) for DKIM is stored, typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=NICfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDBolTXCqbxwoRBffyg2efs+Dtlc+CjxKz9grZGBaISRvN7EOZNoGDTyjbDIG8CnEK479niIL4rPAVriT54MhUZfC5UU4OFXTvOW8FWzk6++a0JzYu+FAwYnOQE9R8npKNOl2iDK/kheneVcD4IKCK7IhuWf8w4lnR6QEW3hpTsawIDAQ0B&quot;"><pre>v=DKIM1<span>;</span> k=rsa<span>;</span> p=NICfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDBolTXCqbxwoRBffyg2efs+Dtlc+CjxKz9grZGBaISRvN7EOZNoGDTyjbDIG8CnEK479niIL4rPAVriT54MhUZfC5UU4OFXTvOW8FWzk6++a0JzYu+FAwYnOQE9R8npKNOl2iDK/kheneVcD4IKCK7IhuWf8w4lnR6QEW3hpTsawIDAQ0B<span><span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="dig TXT selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com"><pre>dig TXT selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: Replace <code>selector1</code> with your actual selector, and <code>yourdomain.com</code> with your actual domain. This command will fetch the DNS TXT record where your public code is stored.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance)</h3><a id="user-content-dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting--conformance" aria-label="Permalink: DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance)" href="#dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting--conformance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DMARC: It's like the boss of SPF and DKIM. It takes the rules from SPF and DKIM and makes a big rule book. This rule book tells everyone what to do if an email from your domain doesn't follow the rules. For example, one rule could be to send a report if an email doesn't pass the checks. The DMARC Record, a place everyone can see, holds this rule book.</p>
<p dir="auto">If an email passes the SPF and DKIM checks, the receiver then looks at the DMARC rule book to decide what to do with the email. They might follow the rule to send a report, or they might follow another rule depending on what your rule book says.</p>
<p dir="auto">DMARC allows domain owners to declare their rules in the rule book. This rule book, stored in the DMARC Record, a DNS TXT record, specifies your DMARC policies and how receivers should handle mail that violates these rules. If both SPF and DKIM checks pass, the receiver then checks the DMARC rule book to decide what to do with the email.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record for DMARC 'rule book' typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com"><pre>v=DMARC1<span>;</span> p=none<span>;</span> rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="dig _dmarc.example.com TXT"><pre>dig _dmarc.example.com TXT</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Let's look at how SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work in real-world example scenarios:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Mobile Apps</strong>: Mobile apps that send emails, such as a fitness app sending workout summaries or a banking app sending transaction alerts, also use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. When the app sends an email, the receiving server checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the sender's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, the server applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email. This ensures that the emails reach the user's inbox and not the spam folder, and protects the app's reputation by preventing email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Email Service Providers</strong>: Providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to authenticate incoming emails. For instance, when an email arrives, Gmail checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the sender's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, Gmail applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong>: Social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter that send notification emails also use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. When a user receives a notification email, their email provider checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the social media platform's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, the provider applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email. This ensures that the emails reach the user's inbox and not the spam folder, and protects the social media platform's reputation by preventing email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Businesses</strong>: Businesses use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to protect their email communication and brand reputation. For example, a business might send promotional emails to its customers. By implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the business ensures that its emails are not marked as spam and that its domain is not used for email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Government Agencies</strong>: Government agencies use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to secure their email communication and prevent phishing attacks. For instance, a government agency might send notifications to citizens. By using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the agency ensures that its emails reach the citizens' inbox and that cybercriminals cannot send phishing emails that appear to come from the agency.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Now that you've learned the basics of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, you might be thinking about using these tools to make your emails more secure. Here's a simple guide to help you get started:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Identify the Email Address and Domain</strong>: First, you need to know the email address and domain your app uses. You'll need to add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to this domain. A simple way to find this out is by sending an email from your app to yourself. For example, you could sign up for an account on your site and click on 'forgot password' to receive an email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Current Status</strong>: Next, check if you already have SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. If you do, make sure they're set up correctly. You can learn how to do this in the next section, 'Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Domain Access</strong>: Make sure you have the rights to change the DNS records of your domain. You'll need this to add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. If you don't have access, you'll need to request the person who does to add these records for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DMARC Monitoring</strong>: Once you've set up DMARC, you'll need to keep an eye on DMARC reports to make sure everything's working as it should and fix any problems. Decide who will do this and which email address will receive the DMARC reports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The usual order is to set up the SPF record first, then DKIM, and finally DMARC.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status</h2><a id="user-content-checking-your-spf-dkim-dmarc-status" aria-label="Permalink: Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status" href="#checking-your-spf-dkim-dmarc-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a straightforward with tools like MXToolbox and DMARCTester. Here's how you can use these tools:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>MXToolbox</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Visit <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" rel="nofollow">https://mxtoolbox.com/</a></li>
<li>Use the 'SPF Record Lookup', 'DKIM Record Lookup', and 'DMARC Record Lookup' tools to check the respective records for your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DMARCTester</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Visit <a href="https://www.dmarctester.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.dmarctester.com/</a></li>
<li>This site offers two ways to check your email security:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Send an Email</strong>: The site generates a unique email address for you. You can then send an email from your application or mail server to this address.</li>
<li><strong>Paste Email Headers</strong>: Alternatively, you can send an email from your application to your own email address, then copy the email headers and paste them into the tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Remember, these checks help you understand what's missing or needs improvement to enhance your email security and reputation, make sure you take note of that and take action.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: When using online tools, only share what's needed. Always check the site's privacy rules to keep your info safe. I'm sharing these tools because they're helpful, not because I am affiliated with them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ's with SPF, DKIM and DMARC</h2><a id="user-content-faqs-with-spf-dkim-and-dmarc" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ's with SPF, DKIM and DMARC" href="#faqs-with-spf-dkim-and-dmarc"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">What email address should I use for DMARC reporting?</p>
<p dir="auto">It's a good idea to use an email address that multiple people can check. This is often a shared mailbox. Ideally, this email address should be from the same domain that you're setting up DMARC for. If you decide to use an email address from a different domain, you'll need to add an extra step: You'll have to add a special record (called a DNS TXT record) to authorize the other domain to receive DMARC reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">What's the difference between ~all, -all, ?all, and +all in an SPF record?</p>
<p dir="auto">These are used to tell receiving servers what to do if an email comes from a server that isn't listed in your SPF record.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">~all (SoftFail): This means "It's okay if the server isn't on my list, but be aware that it might not be legit." The email will still be accepted, but it might be marked as suspicious. This is often used when you're still testing your SPF record or making changes to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">-all (Fail): This means "Only accept emails from servers on my list. Reject everything else." This is used when you're sure of all the servers that should be sending emails for your domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">?all (Neutral): This means "I'm not saying whether servers should be on my list or not. Treat the email as you normally would." This doesn't really give any instructions about how to handle the email, so it's not used very often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">+all (Pass): This means "Accept emails from all servers, even if they're not on my list." This isn't recommended because it could allow spammers to send emails that look like they're from your domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The choice between these depends on how strictly you want to enforce SPF rules for your domain. It’s generally recommended to use ~all while testing or setting up your SPF record, and switch to -all once you are confident that your SPF record is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Can I set up DMARC without SPF?</p>
<p dir="auto">Technically, you can, but it's not a good idea. DMARC is like a security guard for your emails. It uses two tools, SPF and DKIM, to check if an email is really from you. If an email fails both the SPF and DKIM checks, it also fails the DMARC check.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you set up DMARC without SPF, it's like the security guard is missing one of its tools. It can still use DKIM to check emails, but it won't be as effective.</p>
<p dir="auto">SPF isn't perfect and can't stop all fake emails on its own. That's why it's best to use it together with DKIM and DMARC. This gives you a more complete email security system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I've looked at an email header and I see multiple SPF fails and some SPF passes. Which one should I believe?</p>
<p dir="auto">Think of an email header like a story. The most recent events are at the top, and the oldest events are at the bottom. So, the original sender’s information is usually towards the bottom of the header.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you see multiple SPF fails and a couple of SPF passes, it might feel like the story is getting confusing. But don't worry! You should trust the SPF check that's related to your domain or the domains that you trust (like your 'friends list'). The other SPF checks are for other domains that were part of the email's journey, and their pass or fail status doesn't affect your domain's SPF status.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Wrapping Up</h2><a id="user-content-wrapping-up" aria-label="Permalink: Wrapping Up" href="#wrapping-up"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just like a secret handshake, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are the hidden heroes of email security. They're the reason your email recipients can trust messages from your domain. So, the next time you hit 'send', remember that these three musketeers are working tirelessly behind the scenes to keep your email safe.</p>

<!-- cache hit 26:single/related:0c36776f138d6344596caf6f8142af16 --><!-- empty -->
<p><a href="http://proton.me/">Proton</a>, the secure-minded email and productivity suite, is becoming a nonprofit foundation, but it doesn't want you to think about it in the way you think about other notable privacy and web foundations.</p>
<p>"We believe that if we want to bring about large-scale change, Proton can’t be billionaire-subsidized (like Signal), Google-subsidized (like Mozilla), government-subsidized (like Tor), donation-subsidized (like Wikipedia), or even speculation-subsidized (like the plethora of crypto “foundations”)," Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post announcing the transition. "Instead, Proton must have a profitable and healthy business at its core."</p>
<p>The announcement comes exactly 10 years to the day after a crowdfunding campaign saw 10,000 people give more than $500,000 to launch Proton Mail. To make it happen, Yen, along with co-founder Jason Stockman and first employee Dingchao Lu, endowed the Proton Foundation with some of their shares. <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">The Proton Foundation</a> is now the primary shareholder of the business Proton, which Yen states will "make irrevocable our wish that Proton remains in perpetuity an organization that places people ahead of profits." Among other members of the Foundation's board is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of HTML, HTTP, and almost everything else about the web.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Of particular importance is where Proton and the Proton Foundation are located: Switzerland. As Yen noted, Swiss foundations do not have shareholders and are instead obligated to act "in accordance with the purpose for which they were established." While the for-profit entity Proton AG can still do things like offer stock options to recruits and even raise its own capital on private markets, the Foundation serves as a backstop against moving too far from Proton's founding mission, Yen wrote.</p>
<h2>There’s a lot more Proton to protect these days</h2>
<p>Proton has gone from a single email offering to a wide range of services, many of which specifically target the often invasive offerings of other companies (read, mostly: Google). You can now take your cloud files, passwords, and calendars over to Proton and use its VPN services, most of which offer end-to-end encryption and open source core software hosted in Switzerland, with its notably strong privacy laws.
</p><p>None of that guarantees that a Swiss court can't compel some forms of compliance from Proton, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/privacy-focused-protonmail-provided-a-users-ip-address-to-authorities/">happened in 2021</a>. But compared to most service providers, Proton offers a far clearer and easier-to-grasp privacy model: It can't see your stuff, and it only makes money from subscriptions.</p>
<p>Of course, foundations are only as strong as the people who guide them, and seemingly firewalled profit/non-profit models <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-says-company-could-become-benefit-corporation-information-2024-06-15/">can be changed</a>. Time will tell if Proton's new model can keep up with changing markets—and people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission is taking action against software maker Adobe and two of its executives, Maninder Sawhney and David Wadhwani, for&nbsp;deceiving consumers by hiding the early termination fee for its most popular subscription plan and making it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf">federal court complaint</a> filed by the Department of Justice upon notification and referral from the FTC charges that Adobe pushed consumers toward the “annual paid monthly” subscription without adequately disclosing that cancelling the plan in the first year could cost hundreds of dollars. Wadhwani is the president of Adobe’s digital media business, and Sawhney is an Adobe vice president.</p><p>“Adobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel. The FTC will continue working to protect Americans from these illegal business practices.”</p><p>After 2012, Adobe shifted principally to a subscription model, requiring consumers to pay for access to the company’s popular software on a recurring basis. Subscriptions account for most of the company’s revenue.</p><p>According to the complaint, when consumers purchase a subscription through the company’s website, Adobe pushes consumers to its “annual paid monthly” subscription plan, pre-selecting it as a default. Adobe prominently shows the plan’s “monthly” cost during enrollment, but it buries the early termination fee (ETF) and its amount, which is 50 percent of the remaining monthly payments when a consumer cancels in their first year. Adobe’s ETF disclosures are buried on the company’s website in small print or require consumers to hover over small icons to find the disclosures.</p><p>Consumers complain to the FTC and the Better Business Bureau about the ETF, according to the complaint. These consumers report they were not aware of the existence of the ETF or that the “annual paid monthly” plan required their subscription to continue for a year. The complaint notes that Adobe has been aware of consumers’ confusion about the ETF.</p><p>Despite being aware of consumers’ problems with the ETF, the company continues its practice of steering consumers to the annual paid monthly plan while obscuring the ETF, according to the complaint.</p><p>In addition to failing to disclose the ETF to consumers when they subscribe, the complaint also alleges that Adobe uses the ETF to ambush consumers to deter them from cancelling their subscriptions. The complaint also alleges that Adobe’s cancellation processes are designed to make cancellation difficult for consumers. When consumers have attempted to cancel their subscription on the company’s website, they have been forced to navigate numerous pages in order to cancel.</p><p>When consumers reach out to Adobe’s customer service to cancel, they encounter resistance and delay from Adobe representatives. Consumers also experience other obstacles, such as dropped calls and chats, and multiple transfers. Some consumers who thought they had successfully cancelled their subscription reported that the company continued to charge them until discovering the charges on their credit card statements.</p><p>The complaint charges that Adobe’s practices violate the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act.</p><p>The Commission vote to refer the civil penalty complaint to the DOJ for filing was 3-0. The Department of Justice filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for the Northern District of California.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Commission refers a complaint for civil penalties to the DOJ for filing when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.</p><p>The staff attorneys on this matter are Sana Chaudhry and Daniel Wilkes of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>Ask publishers to restore access to the 500,000 books they’ve caused to be removed from the Internet Archive’s lending library.</em></p>



<h2><a href="https://change.org/LetReadersRead">Sign the Open Letter</a></h2>



<hr>



<p>I’m Chris Freeland, a librarian at the Internet Archive. The lawsuit against our library—<em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em>—is fast approaching the oral argument stage of its appeal on June 28. I’ve been reflecting on our ongoing, four-year experience with this litigation and on the outcome we’re hoping for. Our position is straightforward; we just want to let our library patrons borrow and read the books we own, like any other library.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://archive.org/embed/LetReadersRead" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>We purchase and acquire books—yes, physical, paper books—and make them available for one person at a time to check out and read online. This work is important for readers and authors alike, as many younger and low-income readers can only read if books are free to borrow, and many authors’ books will <a href="https://neglectedbooks.com/?p=9498">only be discovered or preserved</a> through the work of librarians. We use industry-standard technology to prevent our books from being downloaded and redistributed—the same technology used by corporate publishers. </p>



<p>But the publishers suing our library say we shouldn’t be allowed to lend the books we own. They have forced us to <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/why-are-so-many-books-listed-as-borrow-unavailable-at-the-internet-archive/">remove more than half a million books from our library</a>, and that’s why we are appealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Impact</h2>



<p>The legal decision and resulting injunction against our library have already had a profoundly negative impact on our patrons. They have inundated us with so many inquiries that our patron services team needed to prepare a<a href="https://help.archive.org/help/why-are-so-many-books-listed-as-borrow-unavailable-at-the-internet-archive/"> Help Document</a> explaining why our collection has been shrinking so rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked our patrons to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/14/patrons-speak-out-the-impact-of-losing-access-to-more-than-500000-books/">share their stories</a> of what losing access to these 500,000 books has meant to them. What’s clear from the <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/14/patrons-speak-out-the-impact-of-losing-access-to-more-than-500000-books/">hundreds of testimonials we’ve received</a> is the ability to access our books remains an absolute necessity for the many people around the world who depend on our library for their educational and professional development:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark, a researcher from New York, said that as an independent scholar without an institutional affiliation, he often struggles to gain access to books he needs for his research. He says that The Internet Archive has been a lifeline for him.</li>



<li>We heard from Lucero, an educator from Mexico City, who said that without our library, he wouldn’t have been able to complete his research on Mexican Sign Langauge.</li>



<li>Perhaps Mrittika said it best. She’s from a rural region in India and doesn’t have access to rare books. She asks the publishers, “If you are going to ban online availability of these resources, what about us?”</li>
</ul>



<h2>Take Action</h2>



<p>In appealing the district court’s decision, our goal is simply to let these readers continue on their journey. We envision a world in which Wikipedians can verify facts by following citations to information contained only in our printed history; where libraries can serve their communities online with collections financed through public investment; and above all, where library patrons are free to read without <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2024/05/18/librarians-are-waging-a-quiet-war-against-international-data-cartels">fear of corporate or government surveillance</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="https://change.org/LetReadersRead">Sign the Open Letter</a></h2>



<p>Please help spread the word across social media: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/archive.org/post/3kv53tybrb42q">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/internetnetarchive/videos/1519549638994455/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8UbEnvup2r/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/deck/@internetarchive/112632880238617231">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weareinternetarchive/video/7381422258365009182">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://x.com/internetarchive/status/1802658174777893309">Twitter/X</a></p>



<p>The potential repercussions of this lawsuit extend far beyond the Internet Archive. This is a fight for the preservation of all libraries, and the fundamental right to access information, a cornerstone of any democratic society. We believe in the right of authors to benefit from their work; and we believe that libraries must be permitted to fulfill their mission of providing access to knowledge, regardless of whether it takes physical or digital form. Doing so upholds the principle that knowledge should be equally and equitably accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or where they learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we head into this appeal, our message remains clear and unwavering: <strong>Let readers read</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Lend your voice to this message by <a href="http://change.org/LetReadersRead">signing the open letter to publishers</a>, asking them to restore access to the books they have removed from our library.</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180196/adobe-us-ftc-doj-sues-subscriptions-cancel">https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180196/adobe-us-ftc-doj-sues-subscriptions-cancel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40707037">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US government is suing Adobe for allegedly hiding expensive fees and making it difficult to cancel a subscription. In the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf">complaint filed on Monday</a>, the Department of Justice claims Adobe “has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.”</p><p>The lawsuit alleges Adobe “hides” the terms of its annual, paid monthly plan in the “fine print and behind optional textboxes and hyperlinks.” In doing so, the company fails to properly disclose the early termination fee incurred upon cancellation “that can amount to hundreds of dollars,” the complaint says.</p><p>When customers do attempt to cancel, the DOJ alleges that Adobe requires them to go through an “onerous and complicated” cancellation process that involves navigating through multiple webpages and pop-ups. It then allegedly “ambushes” customers with an early termination fee, which may discourage them from canceling.</p><p>Customers encounter similar obstacles when attempting to cancel their subscriptions over the phone or via live chats, the DOJ alleges. The complaint claims “subscribers have had their calls or chats either dropped or disconnected and have had to re-explain their reason for calling when they re-connect.” The lawsuit alleges that these practices break federal laws designed to protect consumers.</p><p>The lawsuit also targets Adobe executives Maninder Sawhney, the senior vice president of digital go-to-market and sales, as well as David Wadhwani, the president of the company’s digital media business. The complaint says both executives “directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of Adobe.” Adobe didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>“Adobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/06/ftc-takes-action-against-adobe-executives-hiding-fees-preventing-consumers-easily-cancelling?utm_campaign=ftc_takes_action_against_&amp;utm_content=1718638330&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">said in a statement</a>. “Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel.” The federal government <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003532/adobe-says-the-ftc-is-looking-into-its-subscription-cancellation-practices">began looking into Adobe’s cancellation practices</a> late last year.</p><p>In 2012, Adobe went from selling its creative software for lifetime use to charging users for a monthly or yearly subscription to its suite of products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and others. The company’s subscription model has long frustrated creatives, who are often forced to stay subscribed to Adobe in order to keep doing their jobs. Earlier this month, Adobe’s new terms of service were met with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173838/adobe-tos-update-firefly-generative-ai-trust">backlash after some interpreted</a> the move as an opportunity to train its AI on users’ art.</p><div><p>The lawsuit speaks to continued regulatory scrutiny of Adobe. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/15/23354532/adobe-figma-acquisition-20-billion-official">Adobe attempted to acquire</a> the product design platform Figma for $20 billion, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24008189/adobe-figma-deal-eu-explained-decoder">abandoned the deal last year after facing antitrust scrutiny</a> from European regulators.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A group of schools in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">London</a> have announced they will go smartphone-free, in a sign of the growing public concern over phone-based childhoods.</p><p>Headteachers at 17 of the 20 state secondary schools in Southwark, south London, have taken the collective action to shift their pupils away from smartphones, in the hope of also addressing the downsides of their use outside the school gates.</p><p>The other three state schools in the borough are working towards introducing the policy.</p><p>The schools will also help families and pupils to understand the well-documented downsides of smartphones and social media use among young people. These include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/30/stop-children-using-smartphones-until-they-are-13-say-french-experts-in-report" data-link-name="in body link">mental health concerns, screen time addiction, the impact on sleep and attention spans</a>, access to inappropriate and graphic content and increased risk of thefts and muggings.</p><p>“We were prompted to collaborate after seeing first-hand the negative impact of smartphones and social media on our children’s wellbeing and education,” said Mike Baxter, headteacher of the City of London academy.</p><p>“While the issues that we had to address typically occurred outside of school hours, it was often in school that these negative behaviours were exposed,” he added.</p><p>The schools have agreed that if any phone is used by a pupil during the school day, it will be confiscated. If the phone is a traditional mobile phone – without access to wifi – it will be returned relatively quickly. If the phone is a smartphone, however, it will not be returned for up to a week – or until parents collect it themselves.</p><p>The measures will impact more than 13,000 young people in one of the highest performing boroughs in London. All secondary schools will impose the policy for children from years 7 to 9. A number of schools in the group, however, are adopting a “whole-school” approach.</p><p>The group of secondary headteachers are also in contact with the leaders of primary headteachers in the borough, in the hope of establishing a borough-wide approach.</p><p>“Creating this positive change for the wellbeing and success of young people in Southwark is at the centre of this collective drive,” said Baxter. “Children are getting smartphones as young as four. We could make a massive difference if every parent in this borough knows what every school says about smartphones.”</p><p>Jessica West, headteacher of Ark Walworth academy, said the schools had to take action after phone companies failed to do so. “Many requests for stronger measures have been made of ‘big tech’ companies but action is woefully slow and that leaves our children at risk,” she said. “We are therefore acting in collaboration to support families and children in making healthy choices – we take our responsibilities to children seriously.”</p><figure id="d7675f42-b643-4ea0-bac3-99983ea56850" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:11,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Campaigners ‘thrilled’ as St Albans aims to be smartphone-free for under-14s&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d7675f42-b643-4ea0-bac3-99983ea56850&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/22/st-albans-headteachers-call-for-under-14s-smartphone-ban&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>A recent House of Commons education committee report found that extended screen time had become increasingly normal for young children and teenagers, with a 52% increase in children’s screen time between 2020 and 2022.</p><p>According to the report, nearly 25% of children and young people use their smartphones in a way that is consistent with a behavioural addiction.</p><p>The collaboration was greeted with delight by Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of <a href="http://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Smartphone Free Childhood</a> (SFC).</p><p>“This move from the headteachers in south London is fantastically powerful and pioneering – never have secondary schools clubbed together to take collective action on this issue before,” she said. “We know that the younger a child gets their first smartphone, the higher their incidence of mental illness later on, so this has the potential to change the lives of a generation of children in south London.</p><p>“School leaders have the ability to effect change in their schools immediately and to shape social norms in their communities,” she added.</p><p>The concern about smartphones and children has rocketed. There are now SFC groups in the US, UAE, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Portugal.</p><p>In the UK, there has been an increase in parents joining together to make “pacts” not to give their children smartphones until 14 years at least. In <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-parents-unite-campaign-ban-9241084.amp" data-link-name="in body link">Bristol</a>, 80 schools have started SFC groups and more than 1,000 parents taken pacts.</p><p>“We are so excited about how this is snowballing organically amongst schools, headteachers and parents, it was clearly a conversation that was waiting to happen,” said Greenwell.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Japan’s TDK is claiming a breakthrough in materials used in its small solid-state batteries, with the Apple supplier predicting significant performance increases for devices from wireless headphones to smartwatches.</p>
<p>The new material provides an energy density—the amount that can be squeezed into a given space—of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, which is about 100 times greater than TDK’s current battery in mass production. Since TDK introduced it in 2020, competitors have moved forward, developing small solid-state batteries that offer 50 Wh/l, while rechargeable coin batteries using traditional liquid electrolytes offer about 400 Wh/l, according to the group.</p>
<p>“We believe that our newly developed material for solid-state batteries can make a significant contribution to the energy transformation of society. We will continue the development towards early commercialisation,” said TDK’s chief executive Noboru Saito.</p>
<p>The batteries set to be produced will be made of an all-ceramic material, with oxide-based solid electrolyte and lithium alloy anodes. The high capability of the battery to store electrical charge, TDK said, would allow for smaller device sizes and longer operating times, while the oxide offered a high degree of stability and thus safety. The battery technology is designed to be used in smaller-sized cells, replacing existing coin-shaped batteries found in watches and other small electronics.</p>
<p>The breakthrough is the latest step forward for a technology industry experts think can revolutionize energy storage, but which faces significant obstacles on the path to mass production, particularly at larger battery sizes.</p>
<p>Solid-state batteries are safer, lighter and potentially cheaper and offer longer performance and faster charging than current batteries relying on liquid electrolytes. Breakthroughs in consumer electronics have filtered through to electric vehicles, although the dominant battery chemistries for the two categories now differ substantially.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The ceramic material used by TDK means that larger-sized batteries would be more fragile, meaning the technical challenge of making batteries for cars or even smartphones will not be surmounted in the foreseeable future, according to the company.</p>
<p>Kevin Shang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a data and analytics firm, said that “unfavorable mechanical properties,” as well as the difficulty and cost of mass production, are challenges for moving the application of solid-state oxide-based batteries into smartphones.</p>
<p>Industry experts believe the most significant use case for solid-state batteries could be in electric cars by enabling greater driving range. Japanese companies are in the vanguard of a push to commercialize the technology: Toyota is aiming for as early as 2027, Nissan the year after and Honda by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers are focused on developing sulfide-based electrolytes for long-range electric vehicles, an alternative kind of material to the oxide-based material that TDK has developed.</p>
<p>However, there is still skepticism about how quickly the much-hyped technology can be realized, particularly the larger batteries needed for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Robin Zeng, founder and chief executive of CATL, the world’s biggest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, told the Financial Times in March that solid-state batteries did not work well enough, lacked durability and still had safety problems. Zeng’s CATL originated as a spin-off from Amperex Technology, or ATL, which is a subsidiary of TDK and is the world’s leading producer of lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>TDK, which was founded in 1935 and became a household name as a top cassette tape brand in the 1960s and 1970s, has lengthy experience in battery materials and technology.</p>
<p>It has 50 to 60 percent global market share in the small-capacity batteries that power smartphones and is targeting leadership in the medium-capacity market, which includes energy storage devices and larger electronics such as drones.</p>
<p>The group plans to start shipping samples of its new battery prototype to clients from next year and hopes to be able to move into mass production after that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s no news that React is still the <a href="https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190">most popular and most used</a> UI framework and powers some big names of the web like Netflix, Airbnb, Discord and of course, React’s birthplace, Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp). Considering that React is used to create user interfaces that are used by billions of people, it’s reasonable to assume that a sizeable chunk of all of the internet’s traffic is "handled" by React.</p><p>Earlier this year, the much anticipated <a href="https://blog.codeminer42.com/whats-coming-next-in-react-19/">React 19 was announced</a>, but along with all the shiny new features and DX improvements, there was a little change that went unnoticed until <strong>last week</strong> that could potentially degrade in a significant manner the performance of many websites that rely on React.</p><p>It all started with this tweet:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094424/tk-dodo-first-post.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/TkDodo/status/1800501040766144676">https://x.com/TkDodo/status/1800501040766144676</a></p><p>Which was then followed by quite some reaction:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094427/adam-rackis-first-post-response.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/AdamRackis/status/1800588094560772224">https://x.com/AdamRackis/status/1800588094560772224</a></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094454/tanner-response.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/tannerlinsley/status/1800903098464096664">https://x.com/tannerlinsley/status/1800903098464096664</a></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094430/adam-rackis-vercel.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/AdamRackis/status/1800663066922963264">https://x.com/AdamRackis/status/1800663066922963264</a></p><p>Now, for those of you who don’t know Dominik, AKA <a href="https://x.com/TkDodo">TkDodo</a>, he’s one of the core maintainers of the widely used <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest">TanStack Query</a>, along with the legendary <a href="https://x.com/tannerlinsley">Tanner Linsley</a>.</p><p>But back to the main topic here, the change that’s being discussed is that React 19 <strong>disables parallel rendering of siblings within the same Suspense boundary</strong>, which essentially introduces data fetching waterfalls for data that is fetched inside these siblings.</p><p>Here’s an example of such a thing:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094440/real-case-waterfall-1.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094445/real-case-waterfall-2.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26380#issuecomment-2166178673">https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26380#issuecomment-2166178673</a></p><p>The worst part of all of this is that although this is a breaking change in terms of performance that’s going to affect a lot of people who rely on this pattern, there’s a <strong>single-line bullet point</strong> unceremoniously mentioning this change.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094436/react-19-migration.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>If you’re feeling lost with what I just said, you’re not the only one, I also felt this way the first time I stumbled upon these posts, so fear not as it all is going to make sense soon enough.</p><h2>Suspense Recap</h2><p>To understand what this is all about, we first need to do a quick recap on React’s Suspense.</p><p>Suspense is a React component that lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading, either because these children components are being lazy loaded, or because they’re making use of a Suspense-enabled data fetching mechanism.</p><p>It is used like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;Loading /&gt;}&gt;
  &lt;ComponentThatFetchesDataOrIsLazyLoaded /&gt;
&lt;/Suspense&gt;</code></pre><p>Although Suspense has been a part of React’s API for quite some time now, for a long time, the only <em>officially approved</em> usage of it was to <strong>lazy load components with <code>React.lazy</code></strong>, which is extremely useful for code-splitting your app and then only loading the split parts when needed.</p><p>When used with <code>React.lazy</code>, when trying to render the lazy loaded component for the first time (that is, before lazy loading it), it would trigger the Suspense boundary (i.e. the <code>Suspense</code> wrapping the component) and render the fallback until fetching the component’s code was finished, and then it would render the component itself.</p><p>For a long time, we’ve been promised <em>official</em> data fetching support for Suspense <strong>on the client</strong> (it already works on the server when using RSCs), but we never really got it until now, and despite that, a lot of libraries (TanStack Query being one of those) have implemented it by investigating React’s internals. Because of that, there are plenty of applications in production that currently <strong>do</strong> use Suspense for data fetching on the client.</p><h2>Understanding the Change</h2><p>As of now (React 18.3.1), when either using suspense-enabled data fetching or lazy loading with <strong>multiple components</strong> within the <strong>same Suspense boundary</strong>, React will try to render <strong>all siblings before bailing out of the render, even if the very first sibling suspends</strong>.</p><p>In practice, this means that the data fetching or lazy loading that happens within these siblings will all initiate <strong>in parallel</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an example that showcases this idea:</p><pre><code>function App() {
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Suspense fallback={"Loading..."}&gt;
        &lt;ComponentThatFetchesData val={1} /&gt;
        &lt;ComponentThatFetchesData val={2} /&gt;
        &lt;ComponentThatFetchesData val={3} /&gt;
      &lt;/Suspense&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}

const ComponentThatFetchesData = ({ val }) =&gt; {
  const result = fetchSomethingSuspense(val);

  return &lt;div&gt;{result}&lt;/div&gt;;
};</code></pre><p>Demo: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-x3nv7r?file=src%2FApp.jsx">https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-x3nv7r?file=src%2FApp.jsx</a></p><p>In this example (in React 18), even though <code>fetchSomethingSuspense</code> causes the first <code>ComponentThatFetchesData</code> to suspend, React will still try to render its siblings, which is going to trigger the data fetching for each of them in parallel.</p><p>This can be seen by looking at the console where we’re logging when each data fetching was triggered:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094450/stack-blitz-1.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>All data fetching initiates at almost the exact same time.</p><p>Now let’s look at what happens when we run the <strong>exact same code</strong> in React 19 (canary):</p><p>Demo: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-55rddj?file=src%2FApp.jsx">https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-55rddj?file=src%2FApp.jsx</a></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094453/stack-blitz-2.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>When we look at the console again, we notice that now there’s a waterfall, as each data fetching only initiates <strong>after</strong> the previous one was completed.</p><p>This happens because of the following PR: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26380">https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26380</a></p><p>After the changes introduced by this PR, instead of trying to render all of the siblings within the same Suspense boundary, React will <strong>bail out on the very first one that suspends</strong>, which in cases like this, makes it such that you first try rendering the first component, then it suspends, then only after its data fetching has finished and you can render it, is that you’ll hit the next sibling, which will suspend again and so on for each sibling.</p><p>Also, this new behavior will not only affect usages of Suspense for data fetching but also <strong>usages with <code>React.lazy</code></strong>, which <strong>were officially supported and are much more widespread as it’s an old pattern</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/bentonnnnnn/status/1800940807618171270">https://x.com/bentonnnnnn/status/1800940807618171270</a></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094434/lazy-loading.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><h2>Rationale and DX Implications</h2><p>The rationale behind this change, which is written out in the previously mentioned PR, is that <strong>trying to render all siblings before actually suspending is not free</strong>, and essentially delays displaying the fallback. Also, this change goes hand-in-hand with the "render as you fetch" approach that the React team has been pushing since the introduction of Suspense way back before React 18.</p><p>Ideally, instead of initiating the data fetching on the render of the same component that uses it, we should hoist it and start fetching data as early as possible.</p><p>Although this is undisputedly the best approach performance-wise, it does come with a significant DX drawback by making it unfeasible to collocate components and their data requirements.</p><p>I won’t go too deep into this topic because much has been said about it already and there’s even a <a href="https://relay.dev/">whole library</a> that was created specifically to address this very problem, but I’ll leave a few tweets that talk about this specific point:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094418/teemu-taskula-1.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094421/teemu-taskula-2.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/teemu_taskula/status/1800770818097754509">https://x.com/teemu_taskula/status/1800770818097754509</a></p><p>The main takeaway here is that having both the best possible performance characteristics <strong>and</strong> collocation for components and their data requirements is not really possible without the usage of a <strong>compiler</strong>, which is exactly what Relay does.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p>Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. After a lot of public pushback, heated discussions, and probably a good deal of talking behind the scenes, the React team backed out and decided to hold off on this change for now.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/d604h6pkko9r0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17094448/sophie.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><a href="https://x.com/sophiebits/status/1801663976973209620">https://x.com/sophiebits/status/1801663976973209620</a></p><p>This is not the first time there’s been pushback from the community towards changes that are introduced to React without much regard to how React is used outside Meta and Vercel. The push from React’s team and especially Vercel to make RSCs a fundamental part of building with React is one such case.</p><p>It’s clear that there’s a misalignment between what React’s maintainers think is best for the future of React and the community’s opinions on the subject. Whether these communication issues will deepen or not remains yet to be seen.</p><blockquote><p> We want to work with you.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m for more tests. I push my clients to measure and increase test coverage. When doing so, the start is easy. It is easy to get to 10%, 20% and 30% of coverage. It gets more interesting after that. You come to a point where you need to test code that contains calls to <code>IO</code> - code with side effects, e.g. databases or services.</p><p>There people introduce mocks. A mock is a an object that imitates another service, like a database Repository or a service. Mocks make testing code that has service calls in them easy. Mock frameworks are genius, a marvel to use. People use mocks they want to test things “in isolation”—not understanding that isolation is the core of the problem, not the solution. The bugs of the IO code you want to test, arises from the interaction with the service. If you mock that, you don’t test the reason for your bugs.</p><p><a href="https://dunnhq.com/posts/2024/prefer-test-doubles-over-mocking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Mocking frameworks are a path to insanity!”</a></p><p>Whenever I look at mocks, they mostly have the same problem as all unit tests that I see, they only model the happy path (I wrote about how to write unit tests to really find bugs in <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/how-unit-tests-find-prevent-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“How Unit Tests Really Help Preventing Bugs”</a>). Modelling the happy path is great for <a href="https://refactoring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refactoring</a> - even a necessity, but doesn’t help with finding bugs.</p><p>You can do mocks the right way, but it takes a lot of effort, and many skip this effort. Or are not aware of this effort. It’s worse to have bad mocks than no mocks, because they give you a wrong feeling of confidence in your tests—especially when mocks increase test coverage. You think your tests are testing things that in reality - they are not testing. Confusing, I know.</p><p><span>Back to the title: Mocking is an anti-pattern. Mocking adds complexity, is hard to maintain, introduces its own bugs, doesn't test what should be tested and creates a false sense of security.</span></p><h2 id="what-is-mocking">What is Mocking</h2><p>Lets look at the term <em>“Mocking”</em>. From <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a>
there are <strong>Dummy</strong> objects, <strong>Fake</strong> objects, <strong>Stubs</strong>, <strong>Spies</strong> and <strong>Mocks</strong>. All of them are different, in the context of this article I consider them the same.</p><p>When talking about IO, in general terms I mean side effects (in functional speak). This can include calling external services, REST calls, database calls, sending emails and reading and writing files.</p><p>Lets start at the beginning. Ha! <strong>How does mocking help with testing?</strong> Assuming you want to test this code:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>(<span>x</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>service</span>.<span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>service</span>.<span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>without executing the IO (too slow, no test setup possible etc.), how do you do that?</p><p>You replace the service with a mock:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>ServiceMock</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO1</span>() { <span>return</span> <span>1</span> }
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>() { <span>return</span> <span>2</span> }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and put that into your code instead of <code>IOService</code> for testing (the mock is created with some <a href="https://github.com/golang/mock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock library</a> the code above is just for illustration).</p><p>Refactoring <code>z</code> so we can inject the mock service:</p><p><em>(there are many other ways to inject the service)</em>.</p><p>Now we can write a test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>TestZ</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>service</span> = <span>ServiceMock</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>result</span> = <span>z</span>(<span>true</span>, <span>service</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>check</span>(<span>result</span>, <span>1</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works fine.</p><p>The problem is when <code>IOService</code> has edge cases. When building the mock, does it address the edge cases? When you want to find bugs by testing, the tests need to test the real world. So to work, the mock for <code>IOService</code> needs to model the edge cases of <code>IOService</code>. Does it? Does the developer know they need to model the edge cases, or the mock is not helping with finding bugs? Do you even know the edge cases of <code>IOService</code>? When <code>IOService</code> is a database service, does your mock work for records that do not exist? Or return more than one record?</p><p>Beside edge cases, <code>IOService</code> has failure modes. To detect bugs in the code you’re testing, that is using <code>IOService</code>, your tests need to test for those failure modes, and your mock needs to model those failure modes. If <code>IOService</code> is a database service, does your mock model disconnects correctly? Is it even possible to model all failure modes when <code>IOService</code> is from another team or even another company (like a cloud service)? Do you know all the failure modes for a starter?</p><p><strong>This leads to bugs in the interaction of services being undetected and tests with mocks do less than people think they’ll do for them.</strong></p><p>As my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverwehrens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oliver Wehrens</a> wrote: <em>“Especially when mocking services from other teams.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>goodCustomer</code> and <code>canSendTo</code> are now easy to test. And there is no need to test the <code>if</code> or the <code>send</code>.</p><p>Another one is <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Introduce Parameter Object</a>. The refactoring replaces several parameters in a function call with one parameter.</p><p>How does it help with testing? Given the code</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>invoiceCustomer</span>(<span>startDate</span>, <span>endDate</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>endDate</span> &lt; <span>startDate</span> { <span>return</span> }

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now <code>valid</code> can easily be tested.</p><p>Refactoring all you your (more complex) IF conditionals into their own functions, make the code easier to understand and you can write meaningful tests. There are many more refactorings (read the book!) to make your code easier to test. Start here, instead of mocking.</p><h2 id="easier-to-test-io">Easier to Test IO</h2><p>We can use alternatives to our dependencies. This often happens with an in-memory database, which is compatible to your main database you do use in production, but is faster. This way queries are faster, tests are faster, and especially fast enough to run them like unit tests. Then there is no need to mock the test service, just replace the database connection URL with the in-memory one and your done.</p><p>Where this is more common is with file access. When you use a virtual file system (like <a href="https://github.com/spf13/afero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">afero</a>) in your application, it is easy to swap that out with a memory one during testing. You still create files and delete files, but everything happens in memory and is blazingly fast. This way it is easy to test code that does file operations, without creating or destroying files. An easy way to reduce the need for mocking.</p><p>Before you use a virtual file system though to check operations, refactor your code to work on abstractions, like <code>Reader</code>. Instead of a filename in your method, give the method a <code>Reader</code>. The caller opens the file, creates a <code>Reader</code> and hands it to the method. In testing, you create a <code>Reader</code> from a string or byte array and pass it into the method to be tested.</p><p>What can’t be abstracted, like testing the creation of a file in a correct way, with correct attributes, you can test with a virtual file system.</p><h2 id="just-do-io">Just do IO</h2><p>One reason to replace IO with testing - beside easier setup - is performance. Tests with IO are slow.</p><p>Or so it seems.</p><p>IO is getting faster and faster. I come from an 8bit world of tape drives. To play a game as a kid, you had to start the tape drive, have lunch, then play the game because it took minutes to load. I was amazed when I got my first disc drive. Then my first hard drive. Then a Seagate Barracuda (look it up). At one company we put expensive hard drives and sound isolation into developer machines, to speed up testing. Then came SSDs. And even they become <a href="https://www.octobench.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster and faster</a>.</p><p>Now it might be the time to just do IO - in files or a database - because the IO has become blazingly fast. <em>Just do IO does not help with external services, but helps with IO.</em></p><p>And with Postgres you can easily copy a test database with a random name from a template for each test. So there is your easy setup.</p><h2 id="separation-of-logic-and-io">Separation of logic and IO</h2><p>Another way to get out of mocking, is to remove IO from your code. by separating IO logic from business logic.</p><p>Starting with your code that you want to test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How to move IO out of this code? First there is often logic in that code than can be separated. Take this code that I see often and that is hard to test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>(<span>order</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span> = <span>IO1</span>()

</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>(<span>customer</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Refactoring this to:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>addOrder</span>(<span>customer</span>, <span>order</span>) {

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>makes the logic of transforming a customer by adding a order easy to test. Just write a test for <code>addOrder</code>. I call this first step <code>untangling</code>.</p><p>After you’ve untangled all of your code, you end up with <code>IO</code> skeletons. How do you proceed testing <code>z()</code>?</p><p>One way is to use the command pattern:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span>  <span>IF</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>IO1Command</span>
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>IO2Command</span>
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>(Functional programming would implement the separation of logic and IO with Monads, Monad Transformers and Monad Transformer stacks - <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/investigating-the-i-o-monad-in-go-3c0fabbb4b3d]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a simple example</a>)</em></p><p>Then either the commands have an <code>execute()</code> method that does the IO for you (commands need to be very very simple, with logic inside commands you just moved the logic around, you haven’t separated the logic!)</p><p>Or somewhere in the code you have</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>// z() is pure and returns a command
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>command</span> = <span>z</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>SWITCH</span> <span>command</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>CASE</span> <span>IO1Command</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>(with parameters like the user ID as fields in the command)</em></p><p>You then can test the code and see if it returns <code>IO1Command</code> and <code>IO2Command</code> correctly. No need to mock IO.</p><p>What if there is more IO in <code>z</code>? You might create a <code>command</code> list:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>IF</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>commands</span>.append(<span>IO1Command</span>)
</span></span><span><span>} <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>commands</span>.append(<span>IO2Command</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// ... more comands here ...
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>return</span> <span>commands</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now <code>z</code> can perform a series of IO calls. But what if your decisions depend on IO (like the number of customers?):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>IF</span> <span>IO0</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>} <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>you might be drawn to solve this with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>commands</span>.append(
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IF</span>(<span>IOCommand0</span>, <span>IOCommand1</span>, <span>IOCommand2</span>)
</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and you’ve ended up with an interpreter. An interpreter?
Yes, most often you end up with a complicated interpreter when separating the last bits of <code>IO</code>. Or as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greenspun’s tenth rule</a> puts it: <em>“Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.”</em></p><h2 id="e2e-integration-testing">E2E integration testing</h2><p><em>See my article <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/brilliant-idea-e2e-tests-that-work-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Had a Great Idea - E2E Testing For Free</a></em></p><p>One problem as outlined above is that mocks do not represent reality. Or a changing reality. When an external services changes, your mocks will still run fine!</p><p>You need to test reality. Instead of mocking, invest in end-to-end (E2E) testing. E2E testing and integration testing is often seen as UI driven. You use Selenium or Playwright to drive the browser or a mobile application for E2E testing.</p><p>And while I do think some amount of UI driven E2E tests is necessary to check for a broken UI, the majority of E2E tests should be backend-serverside tests. Why do I personally prefer server side E2E tests?</p><p>For example I use:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>user</span> = <span>NewUser</span>(<span>name</span>, <span>email</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>RegisterUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckUserNotValidated</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>token</span> = <span>EmailValidationToUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>ok</span> = <span>ValidateUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckUserValidated</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Server side E2E testing can do things, UI-driven testing can’t.</p><p>For my last startup, I wrote a DSL to write server side E2E tests for it’s subscription and payment service.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>sub</span> = <span>newSubscriptionWithMonths</span>(<span>customer</span>, <span>3</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckSubscriptionEnded</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckInvoicesCreated</span>(<span>sub</span>, <span>2</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For every subscription model, for early cancellation, for refunds etc. we had end to end testing (simulating months) - finding bugs, finding edge cases and making sure there are no bugs in payment, invoicing and subscriptions.</p><p>E2E tests test the real thing. If they break, you have a bug.</p><p>When you add UI-driven tests (and you should have some), don’t add too many. UI-driven tests are fragile, break easily, take long to run, are flacky and a pain to maintain. Have some to test the main use cases (signup, checkout) to make sure the UI is not broken. Don’t overstretch or you will break under maintenance of UI-driven tests.</p><h2>Join CTO Newsletter</h2><p><h3>Join more than 2700 CTOs and Engineering Managers</h3></p><h3>More Stuff from Stephan</h3><h2>Other interesting articles for CTOs</h2><p>•

<p>In a vote along party lines, the National Defense Authorization Act, a must-pass bill that funds the Department of Defense for the next fiscal year, was passed by the House of Representatives. Within that bill is a small section that bans DJI from using the FCC frequencies.</p>



<p>After two days of debating and voting on amendments to the 2025 NDAA, the House voted and passed the bill that includes a <a href="https://dronedj.com/2024/06/14/advexure-dji-drone-ban-opinion/">ban on DJI drone usage in the United States</a>.</p>



<p>The NDAA funds all elements of the DoD and national defense operations of the Department of Energy, and every year a new version of this becomes law for the past six decades. What was once a bill <a href="https://x.com/ElenaWicker/status/1800662987361177692">one page long with only three sections</a>, is now over 1000 pages with even more sections, many of which don’t have anything to do with funding the military.</p>



<p>One of these sections, H.R. 2864, or the Countering CCP Drones Act, was added to the bill and can be found under Section 1722. For those who are just hearing about this for the first time, it would remove DJI’s ability to get approval from the FCC, banning any future drones from being imported and possibly grounding current drones.</p>



<p>The bill as it stands does not provide any compensation to those that could be affected by this ban, if it is retroactive.</p>



<p>The NDAA had wide bipartisan support until Thursday when House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/14/house-republicans-narrowly-pass-defense-bill-loaded-with-culture-war-issues-00163453">tacked on partisan amendments</a> and the Left whipped its members to vote against it. So when the House came to vote on the NDAA Friday, the vote was pretty much along party lines.</p>



<p>However, this should not be taken as Democrats being against the ban, anti-China legislation is popular on both sides of the aisle.</p>



<p>The bill has already started working its way through the Senate. If it passes the Senate then it will go to the President’s desk for signature into law.</p>



<p>After that, the ball is in DJI and the public’s hands if any legal challenges are attempted.</p>

<p>You’ve grabbed a shopping cart, walked through the sliding doors, and checked your list for the week. Keep it simple—Monday, spaghetti and meatballs. Tuesday, of course, is for tacos. Wednesday, how about a stew. Can’t forget the cold cuts, bread, and Cheez-Its for lunch this week. Thursday? Oh yeah, the dinner plans. On Friday, salmon, asparagus, and potatoes.</p>

<p>Down the snacks aisle, you were tempted and grabbed more than what was on your list. Next, you head to the dairy section for cheese, milk, and Greek yogurt. A couple rows over, you take a look at coffee and drinks. Then it’s time to head to checkout.</p>

<p>It’s a quietly amazing experience. No other time in human history has delivered as many food options to the masses as the supermarket has. A great logistical project involving hundreds of thousands if not millions of people from numerous countries on nearly every continent on Earth has brought this abundance to your little town, a panoply of tastes and combinations previous generations could only dream of.</p>

<p><a href="https://prospect.org/topics/jarod-facundo/"><strong><em>More from Jarod Facundo</em></strong></a></p>

<p>But then you remember that time when contaminated wheat gluten at a single manufacturing plant in Wangdien, China, caused a recall of <u><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-bars-wheat-gluten-used-recalled-pet-food-flna1C9474937" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (almost 100 pet food brands)">almost 100 pet food brands</a></u>, including 17 of the top 20 sold. Or a few years ago, when a <u><a href="https://prospect.org/labor/kellogg-is-digging-its-own-grave-union-strike/">strike</a></u> of just 1,400 Kellogg’s workers at four plants led to a national cereal shortage, with <u><a href="https://fox59.com/news/national-world/empty-store-shelves-show-pinch-of-striking-cereal-plant-workers/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (footage)">footage</a></u> of empty shelves across the country.</p>

<p>Moments like these reveal the truth about the seemingly endless set of options. Your supermarket choices actually narrow to a handful of suppliers making different brands whose prices are tightly coordinated. Step deeper inside the supply chain, and you find that the ingredients that make your food so addictive derive from an even smaller circle of titans.</p>

<p>What you end up learning, if you take the time, is that the supermarket, this tribute to human ingenuity, is actually a battlefield, a war between some of the biggest companies on the planet. And you are the guinea pig for their experiments.</p>

<p>In the grocery business, nothing is accidental. Every product’s placement, every advertisement, every coupon is a function of marketing wizardry and hardball tactics, in a bid for the eyes and wallets of consumers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The grocery store is where all facets of this new era of pricing come together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because everybody needs food to survive, retailers and manufacturers are willing to try every pricing strategy known to man. The grocery store is where all facets of this new era of pricing come together, where attempts to squeeze more from shoppers are tested, analyzed, and put into action.</p>

<p>It started with traditional marketing like coupons and loyalty programs, hooking consumers by giving them a reason to come back. But more insidious schemes lurk inside the grocery store: price-fixing, product shrinkage, electronic shelf tags that change on a whim, and skirmishes between grocers and food producers, or even grocers and other grocers.</p>

<p>This cutthroat dynamic has accelerated consolidation across the food and retail supply chain. It has also kept grocery prices noticeably higher since the pandemic than other goods in the economy. Since the beginning of 2020, grocery prices have <u><a href="https://groundworkcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/24.02.01-Whats-Driving-the-Rise-in-Grocery-Prices-and-What-the-Government-Can-Do-About-It.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (risen 25 percent)">risen 25 percent</a></u>, significantly higher than wages. Consumers experience the most reverberating effects, particularly low-income consumers who spend more of their paychecks on groceries. But food suppliers must also navigate the anti-competitive landscape and pay tolls just to get noticed. Meanwhile, independent supermarkets struggle to survive.</p>

<p>The story of how these towers of nutritional delight turned into rent-seeking alligator pits involves new technologies and fewer competitors for the grocery dollar at all levels. But every economic era has contained opportunities for food monopolists. Today’s difference lies in markets realizing the amplifying effects of this era’s more powerful, more granular, more invasive schemes to profit.</p>

<p>The final, surprising result could be a near future where grocery store consumers <i>become </i>the product.</p>

<p><b>BEFORE AMAZON AND WALMART’S LEGENDARY</b> logistics operations were even conceived, there was another everything store: the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, otherwise known as A&amp;P.</p>

<p>The first grocery stores looked more like the average New Yorker’s bodega. They had basic goods like coffee and tea supplied in bulk, and your grocer would ladle them out. Quality from place to place was a dice roll. And if you wanted meat or bread, you had to go to the butcher and the baker.</p>

<p>A&amp;P wanted to put all of a customer’s needs under one roof. The <u><a href="https://www.marclevinson.net/?page_id=1089" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (definitive book)">definitive book</a></u> on A&amp;P’s rise and fall, written by Marc Levinson, describes how A&amp;P saw the rebuilding efforts in Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871 as an expansion opportunity into the Midwest. The company grew from 70 stores across 16 cities in 1878 to nearly 200 stores by 1900.</p>

<p>To get suppliers and producers to converge at one company’s locations was a logistical feat. But the speed at which A&amp;P took over the manufacturing processes themselves—a vertical integration play—immediately drew critics.</p>

<p>First, the company hired an on-site chemist to manufacture baking powder for changing consumer tastes, and slapped the well-regarded A&amp;P name onto the powder’s red tin.</p>

<p>On one level, A&amp;P eliminated the cost of acquiring baking powder from an outsider, and signaled to other suppliers to lower their prices or risk being taken over, too. But more importantly, the in-store brand distinguished the company from its competitors. This strategy would be repeated across coffee, fresh produce, and in-house meat departments. By 1929, the company was the second company to reach $1 billion in sales; the following year, the chain reached a peak of 15,737 U.S. stores.</p>

<p>In the mid-1930s, Congress passed the Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) and the Miller-Tydings Act, taking direct aim at stores like A&amp;P in defense of small grocers. But it could have been worse. Separately, Rep. Wright Patman introduced a “<u><a href="https://thecounter.org/ap-food-retail-small-business-grocery-chain-store-ban/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (death tax)">death tax</a></u>” bill targeting chain stores. A&amp;P spearheaded a massive lobbying campaign against it by bringing organized labor, producers, and consumers together. The campaign succeeded, and the death tax provision never became law.</p>

<p>Still, antitrust enforcers pummeled the company. “In 1938,” Levinson wrote, “[the FTC] required A&amp;P to pay for brokerage commissions on purchases involving no brokers. A decade later, it restrained the Morton Salt Company from selling small quantities of table salt at $1.60 per case while charging less to customers buying by the rail car load.” By September 1946, a federal court ruled that A&amp;P’s owners had conspired to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act by maintaining artificially low prices.</p>

<p>In Levinson’s telling, these RPA enforcement actions caused chain stores to raise their prices. “The discount revolution would be postponed by several decades, to help keep small businesses alive.”</p>

<p>But enforcement of predatory pricing waned, and in the case of Robinson-Patman, disappeared entirely after the 1980s. By the time the discount supermarket returned, building on A&amp;P’s model, it was more sophisticated and more ruthless. And eventually, those lower prices, which devastated food suppliers and independent grocers alike, would find the opportunity to turn higher.</p>

<p><b>THE SEEDS OF FOOD INFLATION TODAY</b> are planted long before items hit the grocery store. A recent book, <i>Barons: Money, Power, and the Corruption of America’s Food Industry</i>, written by Austin Frerick, details how a handful of families came to dominate meat processing, commodities such as corn and soy, and nearly every sip of coffee on the planet. A recent <u><a href="https://groundworkcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/24.02.01-Whats-Driving-the-Rise-in-Grocery-Prices-and-What-the-Government-Can-Do-About-It.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (report )">report </a></u>from the progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative details how four companies control between 55 and 85 percent of the market for beef, poultry, and pork processing.</p>

<p>Consolidation creates the illusion of product choice. Aquafina and Gatorade are both Pepsi products. Minute Maid and Simply are parts of Coca-Cola’s portfolio. Beverage makers are also in the snack game. Pepsi owns Frito-Lay, competing with other chip makers such as Utz Quality Foods and Kellogg’s Pringles. Pepsi even owns Gamesa, Mexico’s largest cookie manufacturer, popular for its Marias cookies. One of its top competitors for the snack dollar is Mondelez International, maker of Oreos, Wheat Thins, and Ritz crackers.</p>

<p>This dominance gives companies pricing power, and alongside the pandemic inflation they put that power to work. Pepsi and Coca-Cola each raised their prices by double digits over the past few years; because they control so many brands, customers had few options but to pay up. Keurig Dr Pepper, a subsidiary of the JAB coffee empire, doubled margins on U.S. non-coffee beverage sales in the third quarter of 2023 from the year before. For snacks, Groundwork quotes a Hershey executive on an earnings call last year, telling investors “pricing and productivity gains more than offset inflation and higher manufacturing and overhead costs.”</p>

<p>Sometimes this price inflation is of the illegal variety, involving collusion of small groups of food producers to raise the price. A notable win for consumers in Washington state <u><a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/washington-checks-mailed-homes-price-fixing-lawsuit-chicken-tuna-products-40-million-ag-bob-ferguson-press-conference" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (came)">came</a></u> after Attorney General Bob Ferguson found that 19 chicken producers had driven up chicken and tuna prices since 2008; regulators anticipated returning 1.2 million low-income residents checks ranging from $50 to $120.</p>

<p>Another lawsuit brought forward by delis and restaurants against Hormel Foods <u><a href="https://www.startribune.com/hormel-settles-pork-price-fixing-suits-for-11-million/600358116/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (resulted)">resulted</a></u> in an $11 million settlement. A <i>New York Times Magazine </i><u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/magazine/chicken-industry-antitrust.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (article)">article</a></u> on federal antitrust enforcers and poultry tycoons details how even large fast-food chains such as KFC can be goaded into higher prices, dictated by even bigger chicken companies.</p>

<p>The food companies have gotten bigger because the outlets where they sell their products are getting bigger. At the height of its power, A&amp;P took in about 16 percent of U.S. grocery market sales. According to a <u><a href="https://ilsr.org/walmarts-monopolization-of-local-grocery-markets/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (2019 report)">2019 report</a></u> from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Walmart captured more than 50 percent of that share in 43 metropolitan areas and 160 smaller cities. Other grocers in the marketplace are big—and the merger between Kroger and Albertsons, <u><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-challenges-krogers-acquisition-albertsons" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (now under challenge from the FTC)">now under challenge from the FTC</a></u>, could make them even bigger. But nobody has the share that Walmart has.</p>

<p>Walmart’s unique money-extraction capabilities can be inferred from how assiduously the company has fought to increase its share of dollars from federal anti-poverty programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP. Frerick estimates the company took in $26.8 billion in SNAP benefits last year, more than doubling the total collected in 2013.</p>

<p>“Walmart wants to capture every dollar of America’s underclass,” said Frerick, a former Treasury Department official. “Most people don’t realize how essential Walmart is to lots of parts of the country.” Outside of the most densely populated urban areas on the coasts, Walmart and scattered Dollar Generals fill the void left by shuttered independent grocers. Frerick worries about the mid-level grocers “collaps[ing] like the rest of America.”</p>

<p><b>WALMART LEARNED WELL FROM ITS</b> monopolist predecessor, particularly in how it deals with suppliers. The company demands the lowest possible prices from those suppliers, taking more of the grocery dollar for itself. And it demands logistical perfection, or the prices drop even further. Over a three-year period, Walmart <u><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grocers-restaurants-to-suppliers-hurry-up-make-more-11620388801" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (raised the percentage)">raised the percentage</a></u> that a supplier’s deliveries must be made on time from 75 percent in 2017 to 98 percent in 2020, with a 3 percent penalty on delayed orders, a large number considering the industry’s narrow profit margins. The implication was clear; sell to Walmart or get out of the business.</p>

<p>Another common grocery tactic sends prices higher. Retailers charge food companies “slotting fees” to acquire prime shelf space in stores. With limited space, especially for cold or frozen foods, companies get into bidding wars to present themselves to customers in the biggest stores. Eventually, you and I pay for these auctions in the grocery aisles.</p>

<p>The space is even more constrained because companies make room for their own store-brand products, like Great Value at Walmart or Private Selection at Kroger. These products are usually cheaper—after all, they don’t pay slotting fees—and have <u><a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-consumers-price-gouging-spending-economy-999e81e2f869a0151e2ee6bbb63370af" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (become more popular)">become more popular</a></u> amid inflation. Outside companies get whatever space is left. This benefits the biggest food companies that can afford the cost of slotting.</p>

<p>Errol Schweizer, a nearly three-decade veteran of the grocery industry and former vice president of Whole Foods’ grocery division, told me that for every dollar in a grocery supplier’s operations, about a quarter of it goes toward a web of wholesaler and retailer fees. Meanwhile, federal oversight guidelines for slotting fees haven’t changed in <u><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/report-federal-trade-commission-workshop-slotting-allowances-and-other-marketing-practices-grocery/slottingallowancesreportfinal_0.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (nearly 25 years)">nearly 25 years</a></u>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Retailers are driving consumers toward a future of surge and dynamic pricing models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The battle for shelf space is difficult; though some food companies consider it unfair, legal action to remedy competition harms is rare, because of the cascading effects of speaking out. “They rarely come public,” Frerick told me, referring to suppliers that have reached out to him since his book was published, who fear retaliation from their market’s largest buyers.</p>

<p>However, an unlikely set of actors, Snoop Dogg and Master P, <u><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/08/1230071380/snoop-dogg-master-p-walmart-lawsuit-cereal-brand-off-shelves" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (filed a lawsuit)">filed a lawsuit</a></u> earlier this year against Walmart and Post, the famous cereal brand, alleging the two sabotaged Snoop Cereal by making it unavailable on shelves. On the surface, most coverage of the lawsuit <u><a href="https://time.com/6692740/snoop-dogg-suing-walmart-cereal-lawsuit/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (fixates on the novelty)">fixates on the novelty</a></u> of a discrimination case against the “first ever black-owned cereal brand.” But there’s more to the saga.</p>

<p>Broadus Foods, the duo’s brand, initially approached Post for a marketing partnership. The <u><a href="https://bencrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Complaint-Accepted-Filing.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (lawsuit)">lawsuit</a></u> alleges that Post refused, instead offering to purchase the cereal outright. The two turned down the offer and Post came back to the table, this time offering to manufacture, market, and distribute the cereal, with an equitable split of the profits. Snoop and Master P agreed.</p>

<p>But they allege that Post then slow-walked their cereal and didn’t get it stocked on store shelves, while Post’s own brands—Grape-Nuts, Honey-Comb, Raisin Bran, Fruity Pebbles, and more—remained prominent. Boxes of Snoop Cereal were stuck in Walmart stockrooms, with codes that told store staff not to display them.</p>

<p>It was a catch-and-kill situation, according to the plaintiffs, a way to destroy a competitor by locking it out of the market. “Because Snoop Dogg and Master P refused to sell Snoop Cereal in totality, Post entered a false arrangement where they could choke Broadus Foods out of the market, thereby preventing Snoop Cereal from being sold or produced by any competitor,” the complaint reads.</p>

<p>Legal counsel for Broadus Foods could not arrange an interview with the <i>Prospect</i>. Walmart and Post also did not return comment.</p>

<p><b>THE WAR CONTINUES BETWEEN GIANT</b> supermarkets and their smaller competitors, a battle that came to a head during the supply chain crunch. A 2021 <u><a href="https://www.nationalgrocers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NGA-Antitrust-White-Paper.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (white paper)">white paper</a></u> published by the National Grocers Association, an independent trade group of over 1,700 retailers, detailed how wholesale prices offered to independent grocers were as much as 53 percent higher than the <i>retail</i> price at big-box stores.</p>

<p>This was an exacerbation of long-standing trends in the industry. Schweizer told me that big grocers have always applied pressure to suppliers and wholesalers, demanding steep discounts and custom packaging that competitors cannot access. The NGA report offered a revealing example. One grocer wanted to carry a 36-pack of toilet paper, the same as what Walmart’s bulk store Sam’s Club sells. “The manufacturer said they could only offer the product if the member committed to 2,380 pallets of the jumbo packs—a volume that would have exceeded all of the member’s sales of that product in the previous year.”</p>

<p>During the pandemic, the NGA report claimed, Walmart, Amazon, and others also pressured suppliers to serve them first, before any competitors. “NGA members have been told by numerous manufacturers that, as a result of pandemic supply challenges, they would receive reduced allocations or no allocations of popular staples and essential products,” the report said. “Those same products have been fully stocked at Amazon and on the shelves of big box national chain retailers.” Independent grocers were also denied price promotions and discounts. This all tended to entrench the buying power of the biggest groceries.</p>

<p>The NGA report and <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/business/small-stores-out-of-stock/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (media amplification)">media amplification</a></u> sparked the FTC to launch a comprehensive <u><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p162318supplychainreport2024.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (study)">study</a></u> into the food and retail industry, based on publicly available data and information from grocery retailers, wholesalers, and producers. The report, titled “Feeding America in a Time of Crisis,” ultimately confirmed complaints that anti-monopoly advocates and smaller grocery industry firms had voiced for years, that power buyer retailers demanded that suppliers prioritize their orders, by imposing short deadlines and steep fines for noncompliance.</p>

<p>However, Christopher Jones, chief government relations officer at NGA, told me that the report missed the gray market of independent grocers having to buy goods from larger competitors. “It’s arbitrage,” he said. “It’s a cost-raising strategy [on rivals].”</p>

<p>The report also notes that retailers responded to supply chain risks through a mix of building out and acquiring manufacturing capacity. For example, like A&amp;P before it, Walmart has also become a food supplier, <u><a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2023/10/11/walmart-announces-new-milk-processing-facility-in-valdosta-georgia" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (building its own milk processing plant)">building its own milk processing plant</a></u> in Georgia, and a <u><a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2023/06/13/walmart-announces-new-case-ready-beef-facility-in-olathe-kansas" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (beef-packing plant)">beef-packing plant</a></u> in Kansas. The FTC warned that, given the incumbent market power of the largest retailers, such moves could leave smaller buyers “worse off.”</p>

<p>While the FTC carefully notes it did not directly study the relationship between grocery industry profits and input costs, the damaging of rivals had an effect that can be seen in publicly available data. Profits rose over total costs in 2021 and 2023 at a higher rate not seen since 2015.</p>

<p><b>OUTSIDE OF BATTLES FOR SUPERMARKET</b> dominance and shelf space, consumers experience the trickle-down effects of experiments with pricing strategies. For example, there’s been a recent shift to repackage goods into smaller containers, without changing the price.</p>

<p>A report from <u><a href="https://groundworkcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24.03.05-Big-Profits-in-Small-Packages.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Groundwork)">Groundwork</a></u> sheds light on these recent industry changes. Shrinkflation, or “price pack architecture,” in the industry’s preferred lingo, has been a hot topic on earnings calls from the last year. In the best case, packaging innovations cut down on environmental waste or align with what consumers say they want. But they’re also a method of extracting greater profits.</p>

<p>Take for example the explosion of mini-cans of soda. On the one hand, they appeal to consumers who may be more conscious of their dietary habits. However, as Groundwork puts it, companies use consumer preference to mask “introducing new smaller portions that can be sold at a higher weight per ounce.”</p>

<p>The story of falling inflation rates obscures how by repackaging goods, the consumer’s dollar is worth less than it was before. The Groundwork report compares inflation rates accounting for and excluding shrinkflation from January 2019 to October 2023. With shrinkflation included, the rates range from 3 to 10 percent higher, depending on the goods. These small hikes upward are “the path to higher margins,” as Utz’s CEO Dylan Lissette told analysts in 2021.</p>

<p>Other pricing strategies leverage consumer data. Groceries have previously used low-tech programs to understand customers, essentially personalizing pricing for each shopping cart. That long ribbon of coupons you get with your receipt initially just reflected the purchases you just made. That evolved into “rewards” cards, and subscription-based services to big-box stores like Costco or Sam’s Club. These entitle customers to a combination of either lower prices or targeted discounts over their non-member counterparts. But members give something up in the exchange: Grocery stores can assemble long and detailed purchase histories.</p>

<p>If a grocer can identify distinct patterns of buying, or when customers switch from one brand to another, they can build powerful and intelligent individual profiles to inform future promotions and overall pricing. In-store deals that require customers to “clip” coupons on digital apps give grocers access to even more personal information. There was already immense data available on consumers. But by linking them to individualized profiles, retailers gain a more granular look at who their customers are.</p>

<p>This insight into personal shopping habits opens up numerous possibilities. Walgreens has begun to use video screens in their refrigerated section. That enables rapid price changes at the click of a button, without having to deal with physical price tags. Digital price tags have popped up at <u><a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/why-more-grocers-are-putting-electronic-shelf-labels-in-their-stores/642002/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Kroger and other stores)">Kroger and other stores</a></u> as well.</p>

<p>As Phil Longman of the Open Markets Institute told me, with data in hand and a way to rapidly deploy it, retailers are driving consumers toward a future of surge and dynamic pricing models and eroding consumer surplus, economist-speak for the difference between what a consumer will pay for a good and what they actually paid.</p>

<p>“Surge pricing is definitely on the horizon,” Schweizer told me, though it’s only being talked about at this point. The conversations reminded him of when self-checkout was just an idea. Yet, “we’re on the opposite end of it now.”</p>

<p>This can help retailers eke out more revenue by knowing what a customer wants even before they do. But, grocery profit <u><a href="https://www.itretail.com/blog/maximize-grocery-store-profit-margins" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (margins)">margins</a></u> only hover around 1 to 3 percent. There’s a much bigger potential outlet for this data, and it’s the grocery industry’s hottest new trend: retail media.</p>

<p>Essentially, grocers can sell access to consumer shopping histories, which contain some of the most valuable information available: what people buy and when. Advertisers are willing to pay top dollar for that data. Kroger and Albertsons both have in-house retail media agencies, willing to work with advertisers to essentially sell your likes and dislikes while food shopping to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>This advertising is directed at people outside the grocery store: in their homes, while they look at their phones, anywhere. Walmart’s proposed acquisition of the TV manufacturer Vizio for $2.3 billion, critics note, is about gaining access to smart-TV users, to place more ads with sharply refined data. And though Amazon is a smaller player in grocery, its endless supply of data lends itself to a retail media play, in addition to the fact that it sells devices like Fire TV and streaming services like Amazon Prime Video that can be landing spots for data-rich ads.</p>

<p>The data trove can also empower retailers with additional negotiating power. If they know what customers like more than the suppliers, they can make even more overbearing demands for delivery and logistics.</p>

<p>“Selling groceries is incidental to how [grocers are] making profits. It’s an advertising-driven data factory,” Longman said. That’s why he thinks that the real stakes over the pending Kroger-Albertsons merger are less about a more concentrated grocer, and more about a richer database of consumer behavior.</p>

<p><b>FOR SCHWEIZER, THE FIRST STEPS</b> to addressing problems in the grocery industry have been taken by the FTC publishing its report on the industry. But that’s just the beginning: “Walmart is the center of gravity in this industry … You don’t deal with Walmart by creating another Walmart,” he said, referring to the Kroger-Albertsons deal.</p>

<p>In September 2022, FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya gave a <u><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/returning_to_fairness_prepared_remarks_commissioner_alvaro_bedoya.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (speech)">speech</a></u> in Minnesota, signaling readiness to revive Robinson-Patman Act enforcement at the FTC: “Certain laws that were clearly passed under what you could call a fairness mandate … directly spell out specific legal prohibitions. Congress’s intent in those laws is clear.”</p>

<p>The following year, the FTC announced two investigations into the food industry, which appear to be focused on pricing strategies in violation of the RPA. The first <u><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/09/pepsi-coke-soda-federal-probe-00077126" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (targets)">targets</a></u> Pepsi and Coke for soda pricing. The second is looking into Southern Glazer’s for <u><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-takes-total-wine-federal-court-enforce-compliance-antitrust-civil-investigative-demand" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (selling)">selling</a></u> to Total Wine at discounts unavailable to smaller retailers.</p>

<p>Stacy Mitchell, the co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, told me Bedoya’s speech represented a watershed moment, and the FTC investigations take it to its logical conclusion. For the grocery industry, it means the power of the chain stores—exemplified by their dominance over suppliers, ability to muscle out rivals, and unparalleled access to consumer data—may finally be tackled. And that could reverberate across the supply chain, to the big processors and food conglomerates.</p>

<p>Until then, Schweizer has concerns about the pricing strategies on the horizon. Surges on Uber and Lyft are frustrating, he said, but the prospect of such strategies brings into focus ethical concerns when applied to basic necessities. The war for your shopping cart, in other words, has collateral damage.</p>

<p>Most folks dream of being entrepreneur; “<em>a path that seemed inevitable</em>“, they say. None of that shit applies to me. I’m only here cause I kept getting laid off and that nonsense infuriated me.</p>
<p>I treated my first layoff as a joke, as I’d seen them in movies &amp; TV; “<em>now they’re happening to me – how funny</em>“. My second felt like a whispered “fuck-you”, as the company had been acquired and I was deemed useless. The third and fourth scrambled my brain and forced me down a path <strong><em>I never intended to travel</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>I’m only here cause I had to save myself.</h2>
<p>I remember thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I can’t trust them anymore; I gotta figure out a way to generate revenue myself; from my own business; that I control. Online preferably.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s where I started. Daunting for someone with a History degree. I had no other choice.</p>
<p>So, I took stock of my background at that moment. Web analytics, Paid Search, and pittance of SEO.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, I’ll start there. I’ll skip coding for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d recently been exposed to a new online ad network, that paid by lead and/or click. I had previously implemented it on a company’s website &amp; it generated around $30-$50 a day for them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sounds good to me, let’s try something like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I couldn’t code, I couldn’t launch a website. So the gears of my dusty cobweb cranium began to turn. What can I do that doesn’t require coding? Eventually, a thought bubbled up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, what’s stopping me from signing up for one of those ad networks, and then going to a search engine, typing a popular search term, digging through the organic results, searching for sites WITHOUT advertising, emailing them to request ad rates, and implementing <span>//my own//</span> ad pixel there.</p></blockquote>
<p>There wasn’t a damn thing stopping me. So I started doing that (with the hopes the website owner never found out about said ad network, as I could be cut out of loop). This was late 2003.</p>
<p>I needed a topic. Alot of people seemed to search for tourism information online, so I leaned into that corner. Began searching broad terms &amp; phrases in any search engine. My thought was, if site is in top ten results for major keyword, then it’s safe to say they’re receiving a significant (enough) amount of traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Caribbean.jpg" alt="Caribbean" width="277" height="182">I’d search ‘Aruba’, and would email every site that fit the bill. “<em>Do you accept advertising? If so, what are your rates?</em>” I’d search ‘Bahamas’ &amp; repeat process. Then ‘Key West’. And on and on.</p>
<p>I’d get a nibble occasionally. I’d reply asking their traffic levels &amp; monthly ad rates. Then I’d napkin math whether I’d be able to cover *their* ad expense &amp; (possibly) generate profit with my own ad revenue from the network (which was guesstimated, on my part). Oftentimes, the numbers wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Until the owner of a Cancun travel website replied. His rate was $50/month to advertise. His site ranked well for several Cancun related terms &amp; received significant traffic. I estimated my ad unit, if placed in a certain section on the page, would receive 2% CTR. Then I multiplied that number by his daily traffic levels, and guesstimated $5-$8 of revenue per day. I remember thinking I was going to get hosed on the deal, but me being me, I kept going.</p>
<p>He asked what type of ads I’d run. I didn’t know, as they were dynamically generated based on the content of the site/page. I told him “<em>several travel &amp; tourism promotions targeted to Cancun</em>“. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>That worked for him, so I began paying $50 a month, and shot him my ad pixel to implement. Off-the-bat, the darn thing began generating $300-$350 a month.</p>
<p>The ads were perfectly targeted. Cancun hotels. Swim with dolphins. Paragliding. Cruises. Most months I was clearing $300/month profit (after ad expenses to the website owner). I couldn’t fukkin believe it. It was my mini-watershed moment; exposing me to the fact that, yes, dolt-brain me could do this. If I could generate revenue from this disgustingly duct-taped business model, I could do it in other fashions online. I just didn’t know what those fashions were yet. One thing I did know:</p>
<blockquote><p>I gotta learn how to code</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the avenue hanging me up &amp; intimidating me. I was currently advertising <em>on other folks websites. That they built. They hosted. They managed.</em> I had to mimic that same position. And that meant coding, launching, &amp; managing my own sites. </p>
<p>Outside of its complexities, coding tripped me up cause it required a basic tenet that I typically veered away from: <em>basic reading</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn.jpeg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn-230x300.jpeg" alt="Alfred E Neumann" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn-230x300.jpeg 230w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn.jpeg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px"></a>I don’t mind reading, I just don’t like doing it, I find it difficult to focus (I’m more of a distinguished MAD Magazine type of reader). I’d rather watch a video tutorial, listen to an audiobook, or have someone side-by-side explaining things. Those avenues didn’t quite exist back then; so I had to get creative.</p>
<p>Instead of lamenting &amp; bemoaning my position, I decided to throw out all the rules and <strong>✨ <em>just start building a website although I didn’t know how</em> ✨</strong>. I’d figure out the rest once I started.</p>
<p>Someone told me ‘hosting’ was required, so I bought a cheap package and began to poke around. Once I skipped the documentation, I discovered they had a ‘ticket’ system where they allowed customers to submit support questions. Huhmm.</p>
<p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>
<em><strong>Ticket #1:</strong><br>
<strong>from:</strong> Peter<br>
<strong>message:</strong> please help me get a website online</em> (╯˘ -˘ )╯<br>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p>
<p>… and – God bless them – they replied. That’s where I learned about the “index.html” file. They became my unpaid tutors. Volleying countless questions on how all this stuff works. What the hell a domain name was. How to update my DNS. File transfer protocol. They pushed me far enough where I became comfortable researching myself. Googling questions. Forum questions. Twitter. Asking friends. All of it. Hell, my friend Charles Lumpkin educated me on the wonders of a &lt; div &gt; tag.</p>
<p>From there, I got a basic one-page website online. Hand-coded. I felt like trashcan-Superman.</p>
<p>Then I channeled my advertising/marketing background. “What’s a website I can build that might generate ad revenue &amp; serve small businesses?”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2-300x256.jpeg" alt="Yellow Pages" width="300" height="256" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2-300x256.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2.jpeg 558w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">My father’s friend worked in the Yellow Pages industry, and always remarked how profitable that business model was. We were still in early internet days (2004’ish), so I mused how I could mimic that industry online. In other words, create a central directory bringing buyers &amp; sellers together. Buyers searching for services; businesses providing those services. I liked this simple model, so I swung that way.</p>
<p>I grabbed a Yellow Pages book in my apartment, opened it up, and began to flip through. In those days, basic listing were free, but businesses could advertise large rectangle ads in their category. As I fanned through the pages, I’d keep an eye out for sections with heavy ad promotion (as it indicated an industry that understood the value of advertising). I found a few. Windshield repair. Limos. Carpet cleaning. Self storage. Pest control. And on and on. Then, I’d buy an ugly domain &amp; create an online directory of that category (ie. pest control), mixed in with geography based terms for seo, like ‘atlanta pest control’. And on that page, I’d curate several atlanta pest control operators, and list all their contact info. About as basic &amp; boring of a site as you can get. But simple to navigate, and no hoops to jump through.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv.jpg" alt="View source" width="500" height="291" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv.jpg 500w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px">Then, as I further began to code, I discovered the wonders of “view page source”. I could right-click, copy &amp; paste another website’s syntax into my editor; monkey with that updated design; then upload it to my server. Tables &amp; rows, mainly. I’d swap out the logo; change the background color; the width of the container; manually add new pages. My trashcan-Superman aura was morphing into trashcan-Zeus. It felt like walking through a deep fog treasure-chest where I could only touch &amp; feel what was directly in front of me, and each outcome was bizarrely fascinating. An ape could have designed better, yes, but I was proud.</p>
<p>Then traffic began trickling in. From outreach; from sponsorships I placed; from seo stuff; from all kinds of marketing endeavors.&nbsp; I began offering premium listings; businesses began signing up; I’d charge them through Paypal (no Stripe back then). Then I began adding those ad networks (I mentioned above). And more revenue began to appear. A somewhat consistent monthly recurring revenue stream.</p>
<p>I was still working 9-5, but an escape hatch was coming into focus. A path to avoid someone else’s bonehead business decision which kneecaps a company &amp; executes my career. The glitter of fancy salaries had already grown dim – that hook they’d dangle to entrap me. I yearned for my own {mini} golden goose that provided the independence I was blindly searching for. The <em>Rage Against The Machine</em> lyric often came to mind:&nbsp; <em>“Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin’ ’em”.</em> [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDZV8TdnCoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">src</a>]</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-300x194.jpg" alt="Wordpress" width="300" height="194" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">My development path accelerated when I discovered WordPress. Most hosts had one-click installation. WP had recently added the ability to create ‘Pages’, so I moved my development focus inside that petri dish. The pre-built themes (free &amp; paid) were a boon to my design inadequacies.</p>
<p>I built more sites ~ nights &amp; weekends ~ thanks to WordPress. But that became time consuming, so I began *<em>buying</em>* fully developed websites, direct from mom &amp; pop operators via cold email. Usually informational sites. Then I could expand the content based on search volume trends and incorporate small bits of advertising. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/at-ads.jpg" alt="Appalachian Trail" width="400" height="533" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/at-ads.jpg 400w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/at-ads-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>AppalachianTrail.com circa 2008’ish (now sold)</figcaption></figure><p>AppalachianTrail.com was a good example. I cold emailed the owner a $3,000 offer for the site &amp; domain. I received no reply, which was normal. Until I did receive a reply; 30 days later; accepting the offer. I further built the site out &amp; it began generating around $500/month for me.</p>
<p>What I kept noticing, though, when I’d transfer a site under my wing, I’d {immediately} focus on domain transfer, as control of that asset dictated ownership of the site.</p>
<p>These domain <em>‘things’</em> seemed intriguing, so I dug deeper. I discovered the expiring domain name market. A universe where 50k-100k domains expire &amp; auction every day. There, I discovered the impact of a blue chip, descriptive .com domain name ~ especially in development. An unfair advantage that allows small players to punch up.</p>
<p>I remember sitting in a pizza joint with my friend <a href="https://x.com/agraber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen Graber</a>, grabbing lunch one day. At some point, he stepped away from the table and my mind was wandering. Dissecting my path to that point, and trying to stitch together what it all meant, and if there was a next step. And a thought surfaced: <em>Why not just wait. Sit and wait. And watch the expiry lists. For a premium .com domain to expire, that has development potential.</em> I was in no rush. That seemed to jive with my inner-nature. I’d already witnessed a few gorilla .com’s go up, so I understood others could as well. I’d just need to empty my mind and wait for the pull to arrive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/boots-rope.jpeg" alt="boots and rope" width="170" height="187">The pull came in 2009. The domain was marvelous. A group in NY state abandoned ‘DudeRanch.com’, and I <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/dude-that-built-duderanch-com/">acquired at auction</a> for $17,949. It provided the backbone for me to build a vacation marketplace for that historic industry. An environment where I could shepherd vacationers towards dude ranches that met their needs. And monetize the asset through premium (highlighted) listings that paid me a flat-fee per year.</p>
<p>The mild success I achieved there allowed me to quit the 9-5. It opened me to more projects. More domains. And opened me to empty myself into these endeavors.</p>
<p>I didn’t raise any money for these projects. I funded them with my 9-5 salary. Solo. And the reason for that was simple – why on earth would I vehemently abandon boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the 9-5 world only to raise money &amp; adopt a board of boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the startup world. If I’m gonna build, I’m gonna have free-rein decision making to pursue any and all ludicrous business models, with no oversight. If I fail, fine. That’s on me. If it works, son-of-a-gun, my job will feel like play.</p>
<p>I still to this day, over 20 years later, experience the sting from those layoffs. The check-mate move that I couldn’t counter. I had no plan, but I started. I had no goal; I just got going. I guess I’m still going; I don’t quite know where. But I’m quite content. And thankful. It appears peace of mind is the prize I’m pursuing.</p>
<p>it’s weird to look back.</p>

In 2021, only one of the ten top-grossing films––the Ryan Reynolds vehicle </span><em>Free Guy––</em><span>was an original. There were only two originals in 2020’s top 10, and none at all in 2019.</span></p><p><span>People blame this trend on </span><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies/hollywood-produce-many-remakes-prequels-25386785" rel="">greedy movie studios</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aqvrq6/im_really_so_tired_of_reboots_and_remakes/" rel="">dumb moviegoers</a><span>&nbsp;or </span><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies/hollywood-produce-many-remakes-prequels-25386785" rel="">competition from Netflix</a><span>&nbsp;or </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5mqqt0/why_are_there_so_many_remakes/" rel="">humanity running out of ideas</a><span>. Some say it’s </span><a href="https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/articles/deja-vu-is-the-film-industrys-sequel-and-remake-addiction-a-sign-of-the-end/" rel="">a sign of the end of movies</a><span>. Others&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-movies-these-days-sequels-remakes-adaptions-or-reboots" rel="">claim there’s nothing new about this at all</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Some of these explanations are flat-out wrong; others may contain a nugget of truth. But all of them are incomplete, because this isn’t just happening in movies. In every corner of pop culture––movies, TV, music, books, and video games––a smaller and smaller cartel of superstars is claiming a larger and larger share of the market.&nbsp;What used to be </span><em>winners-take-some</em><span> has grown into </span><em>winners-take-most</em><span> and is now verging on </span><em>winners-take-all</em><span>. The (very silly) word for this </span><em>oligopoly</em><span>, like a monopoly but with a few players instead of just one.</span></p><p><span>I’m inherently skeptical of big claims about historical shifts. I recently published a paper showing that </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53b44b72e4b056a5b67a4fa1/t/62266e77ee9ae420d7fab9a4/1646685817535/pnas.2107260119.pdfhttps:/static1.squarespace.com/static/53b44b72e4b056a5b67a4fa1/t/62266e77ee9ae420d7fab9a4/1646685817535/pnas.2107260119.pdf" rel="">people overestimate how much public opinion has changed over the past 50 years</a><span>, so naturally I’m on the lookout for similar biases here. But this shift is not an illusion. It’s big, it’s been going on for decades, and it’s happening everywhere you look. So let’s get to the bottom of it.</span></p><p><span>(Data and code available </span><a href="https://osf.io/8k23f/" rel="">here</a><span>.)</span></p><p>At the top of the box office charts, original films have gone extinct.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I looked at the 20 top-grossing movies going all the way back to 1977 (</span><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2020/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses" rel="">source</a><span>), and I coded whether each was part of what film scholars call a “multiplicity”—sequels, prequels, franchises, spin-offs, cinematic universe expansions, etc. This required some judgment calls. Lots of movies are based on books and TV shows, but I only counted them as multiplicities if they were related to a previous movie. So 1990’s </span><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em><span>&nbsp;doesn’t get coded as a multiplicity, but 1991’s </span><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze</em><span>&nbsp;does, and so does the 2014 </span><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em><span>remake. I also probably missed a few multiplicities, especially in earlier decades, since sometimes it’s not obvious that a movie has some connection to an earlier movie.</span></p><p>Regardless, the shift is gigantic. Until the year 2000, about 25% of top-grossing movies were prequels, sequels, spinoffs, remakes, reboots, or cinematic universe expansions. Since 2010, it’s been over 50% ever year. In recent years, it’s been close to 100%.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg" width="600" height="380" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:380,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:45346,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e99a510-2215-4682-9b84-0be0fbf8d20f_600x380.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Original movies just aren’t popular anymore, if they even get made in the first place.</p><p><span>Top movies have also recently started taking a larger chunk of the market.

Since 2005, it’s been above 75% every year, and sometimes it’s 100%. At the top of the charts, it’s all Mario, Zelda, </span><em>Call of Duty</em><span>,</span><em> </em><span>and </span><em>Grand Theft Auto</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Any explanation for the rise of the pop oligopoly has to answer two questions: why have producers started producing more of the same thing, and why are consumers consuming it? I think the answers to the first question are </span><em>invasion</em><span>, </span><em>consolidation</em><span>, and </span><em>innovation. </em><span>I think the answer to the second question is&nbsp;</span><em>proliferation</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Software and the internet have made it easier than ever to create and publish content. Most of the stuff that random amateurs make is crap and nobody looks at it, but a tiny proportion gets really successful. This might make media giants choose to produce and promote stuff that independent weirdos never could, like an </span><em>Avengers </em><span>movie. This can’t explain why oligopolization started decades ago––YouTube only launched in </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/" rel="">2005</a><span>, for example, and most Americans didn’t have broadband until&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/" rel="">2007</a><span>––but it might explain why it’s accelerated and stuck around.</span></p><p><span>Big things like to eat, defeat, and outcompete smaller things. So over time, big things should get bigger and small things should die off. Indeed, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios#The_majors_after_the_Golden_Age" rel="">movie studios</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/" rel="">music labels</a><span>, </span><a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/local-networks/consolidation-local-tv-radio-newspapers-cuts.html" rel="">TV stations</a><span>, and publishers of </span><a href="https://www.authorsalliance.org/2021/12/08/the-consolidation-of-publishing-houses-past-and-present/" rel="">books</a><span>&nbsp;and </span><a href="https://psuvanguard.com/the-consolidation-of-the-video-game-industry/" rel="">video games</a><span>&nbsp;have all consolidated. Maybe it’s inevitable that major producers of culture will suck up or destroy everybody else, leaving nothing but superstars and blockbusters. Indeed, maybe cultural oligopoly is merely a transition state before we reach cultural monopoly.</span></p><p><span>You may think there’s nothing left to discover in art forms as old as literature and music, and that they simply iterate as fashions change. But it took humans </span><a href="http://www.essentialvermeer.com/technique/perspective/history.html#:~:text=In%20its%20mathematical%20form%2C%20linear,De%20pictura%20%5BOn%20Painting%5D" rel="">thousands of years</a><span> to figure out how to create the illusion of depth in paintings. Novelists used to think that sentences had to be long and complicated until Hemingway came along, wrote some snappy prose, and changed everything. Even very old art forms, then, may have secrets left to discover. Maybe the biggest players in culture discovered some innovations that won them a permanent, first-mover chunk of market share. I can think of a few:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>In books: lightning-quick plots and chapter-ending cliffhangers. Nobody thinks </span><em>The Da Vinci Code </em><span>is high literature, but it’s a book that </span><em>really really </em><span>wants you to read it. And a lot of people did!</span></p></li><li><p><span>In music: sampling. Musicians </span><a href="https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2019/03/2019-the-state-of-sampling-draft.html#:~:text=1%20in%205%20Songs%20on,usually%20between%2020%2D25%25" rel="">seem to sample more often these days</a><span>. Now we not only </span><em>remake</em><span> songs; we </span><em>franchise</em><span> them too.</span></p></li><li><p><span>In movies, TV, and video games: cinematic universes. Studios have finally figured out that once audiences fall in love with fictional worlds, they want to spend lots of time in them. Marvel, DC, and Star Wars are the most famous, but there are also smaller universe expansions like&nbsp;</span><em>Better Call Saul </em><span>and </span><em>El Camino</em><span>&nbsp;from&nbsp;</span><em>Breaking Bad </em><span>and&nbsp;</span><em>The Many Saints of Newark </em><span>from </span><em>The Sopranos. </em><span>Video game developers have understood this for even longer, which is why Mario does everything from playing tennis to driving go-karts to, you know, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario" rel="">being a piece of paper</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>Invasion, consolidation, and innovation can, I think, explain the pop oligopoly from the supply side. But all three require a willing audience. So why might people be more open to experiencing the same thing over and over again?</p><p><span>As options multiply, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice" rel="">choosing gets harder</a><span>. You can’t possibly evaluate everything, so you start relying on cues like “this movie has Tom Hanks in it” or “I liked </span><em>Red Dead Redemption</em><span>, so I’ll probably like </span><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em><span>,” which makes you less and less likely to pick something unfamiliar.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Another way to think about it: more opportunities means higher opportunity costs, which could lead to lower risk tolerance. When the only way to watch a movie is to go pick one of the seven playing at your local AMC, you might take a chance on something new. But when you’ve got a million movies to pick from, picking a safe, familiar option seems more sensible than gambling on an original.</p><p><span>This could be happening across all of culture at once. Movies don’t just compete with other movies. They compete with every other way of spending your time, and those ways are both infinite and increasing. There are now&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/#:~:text=Project%20Gutenberg%20is%20a%20library%20of%20over%2060%2C000%20free%20eBooks" rel="">60,000</a><span> free books on Project Gutenberg, Spotify </span><a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/#:~:text=Discover%2C%20manage%20and%20share%20over,ad%2Dfree%20music%20listening%20experience" rel="">says</a><span> it has 78 million songs and 4 million podcast episodes, and humanity uploads 500 hours of video to YouTube </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202020%2C%20more,for%20online%20video%20has%20grown" rel="">every minute</a><span>. So uh, yeah, the Tom Hanks movie sounds good.</span></p><p><span>Some may think that the rise of the pop oligopoly means the decline of quality. But the oligopoly can still make art: </span><em>Red Dead Redemption II </em><span>is a terrific game, “Blinding Lights” is a great song, and </span><em>Toy Story 4 </em><span>is a pretty good movie.&nbsp;And when you look back at popular stuff from a generation ago, there was plenty of dreck. We’ve forgotten the pulpy Westerns and insipid romances that made the bestseller lists while books like&nbsp;</span><em>The Great Gatsby</em><span>, </span><em>Brave New World</em><span>, and </span><em>Animal Farm </em><span>did not.</span><em>&nbsp;American Idol </em><span>is not so different from the televised talent shows of the 1950s. Popular culture has always been a mix of the brilliant and the banal, and nothing I’ve shown you suggests that the ratio has changed.</span></p><p>The problem isn’t that the mean has decreased. It’s that the variance has shrunk. Movies, TV, music, books, and video games should expand our consciousness, jumpstart our imaginations, and introduce us to new worlds and stories and feelings. They should alienate us sometimes, or make us mad, or make us think. But they can’t do any of that if they only feed us sequels and spinoffs. It’s like eating macaroni and cheese every single night forever: it may be comfortable, but eventually you’re going to get scurvy.&nbsp;</p><p><span>We haven’t fully reckoned with what the cultural oligopoly might be doing to us. How much does it stunt our imaginations to play the same video games we were playing 30 years ago? What message does it send that </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moves_like_Jagger" rel="">one of the most popular songs in the 2010s</a><span> was about how a 1970s rock star was really cool? How much does it dull our ambitions to watch 2021’s </span><em>The Matrix: Resurrections</em><span>, where the most interesting scene is just Neo watching the original&nbsp;</span><em>Matrix </em><span>from 1999? How inspiring is it to watch tiny variations on the same police procedurals and reality shows year after year? My parents grew up with the first </span><em>Star Wars </em><span>movie, which had the audacity to create an entire universe. My niece and nephews are growing up with the ninth </span><em>Star Wars </em><span>movie, which aspires to move merchandise. Subsisting entirely on cultural comfort food cannot make us thoughtful, creative, or courageous.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, there’s a cure for our cultural anemia. While the top of the charts has been oligopolized, the bottom remains a vibrant anarchy. There are </span><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-sadly-porn?s=r" rel="">weird books</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lobster" rel="">funky movies</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfMh0zfIO3A" rel="">bangers from across the sea</a><span>.&nbsp;Two of the most interesting video games of the past decade put you in the role of an&nbsp;</span><a href="https://papersplea.se/" rel="">immigration officer</a><span> and an </span><a href="https://obradinn.com/" rel="">insurance claims adjuster</a><span>. Every strange thing, wonderful and terrible, is available to you, but they’ll die out if you don’t nourish them with your attention. Finding them takes some foraging and digging, and then you’ll have to stomach some very odd, unfamiliar flavors. That’s good. Learning to like unfamiliar things is one of the noblest human pursuits; it builds our empathy for unfamiliar people. And it kindles that delicate, precious fire inside us––without it, we might as well be algorithms. Humankind does not live on bread alone, nor can our spirits long survive on a diet of reruns.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Retro devices, like old game consoles and CD players, bring joy to people who are <strong>nostalgic</strong>. They allow them to revisit the past in today’s ever-changing tech world. Now, someone has combined the old and now to create Linamp.</p>
<!-- BREAK 1 --> 

<p>Linamp is a physical media player inspired by Winamp, a Windows media player first released in 1997. The new device features a 7.9-inch touch screen that displays the interface of the legendary program, along with many other interesting features.</p>
<!-- BREAK 2 -->
<h2><strong>Linamp, the Physical Media Player Inspired by Winamp</strong></h2>

<p>Linamp is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4B with a 32 GB SD card. This microcomputer board has made it possible to include a <strong>3.5 mm headphone jack</strong>, a USB-C port, a USB-A port, and an Ethernet port. The body of the device is made of aluminum and seeks to mimic the style of audio devices from the 1990s.</p>
<!-- BREAK 3 --> 

<p>The front part has been 3D printed. Instead of “Winamp,” it says Linamp, but it adopts the exterior appearance of the program’s classic skin. To play an audio file, you need to to connect an SD card or use an external disc player.</p>
<!-- BREAK 4 --><div>
   <p><a href="https://www.xatakaon.com/audio/what-happened-to-creative-technology-the-company-that-created-the-legendary-sound-blaster-cards">

    </a>
   </p>
   
  </div>
<p>When users insert a CD, Linamp automatically detects the disc, extracts the track information, and is ready to play your selection. To start listening to music, all you need to do is <strong>press the Play button</strong> on the touch screen. In the future, the creator plans to add support for Bluetooth and Spotify.</p>
<!-- BREAK 5 -->
<p>Linamp is a project by Rodrigo Méndez. According to his <a rel="noopener, noreferrer" href="https://hackaday.io/rodmg">Hackaday profile</a>, he’s a Mexico-based “computer engineer by training, software engineer by trade, geek by birth” who “also enjoys embedded systems and electronics.” You can find additional details about his latest creation in a <a rel="noopener, noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=EyidVBoFrTISYUQ2&amp;v=5nUYHROVOmo&amp;feature=youtu.be">video posted on YouTube</a>.</p>

      <p>Working with PostgreSQL, and virtually any database system, extends far beyond merely inserting and retrieving data. Many application and business processes, maintenance tasks, reporting, and orchestration tasks require the integration of a job scheduler. While third-party tools can drive automation, you can also automate the execution of predefined tasks directly within the database environment. Although system-level cron might be a starting point, the power of the database system lies in its ability to store all the necessary information alongside your data/schema. In this article, we will explore <code>pg_cron</code> and <code>pg_timetable</code> as two distinct PostgreSQL-specific tools for scheduled task automation.</p>
<h2 id="the-many-roles-of-job-scheduling">The Many Roles of Job Scheduling
</h2>
<p>Usually, the first requirement to automate job execution is the optimisation of the PostgreSQL cluster and databases. Except in very low usage scenarios, <strong>routine maintenance</strong> is the foundation of all database deployments. Whether it is VACUUMing, index rebuilding, or updating statistics, these are tasks that you will eventually need to automate to maintain operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Job scheduling is also indispensable for <strong>maintaining data quality</strong>, particularly through operations like refreshing materialised views or batch removal of outdated data from the system. From there, it is just a step to <strong>reporting</strong>, which can involve the automation of generating operational and business reports.</p>
<p>I also believe that databases are an excellent place to <strong>coordinate business processes</strong>. Automating data flows between components, teams, and departments helps create agile systems. As mentioned above, there is no better place to store the description of such automations than alongside your data.</p>
<h2 id="pg-cron-automation-s-first-gear">pg_cron: Automation's First Gear
</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the role of automation started with operating system tools like cron or Task Scheduler. That's where <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron"><code>pg_cron</code></a> comes in. It's a PostgreSQL extension that provides the simplicity and familiarity of cron's scheduling directly within the database environment.</p>
<p>Due to its dependency on a shared library (because of the use of the background worker), it requires a full cluster restart. Nevertheless, due to its popularity, it is available within most managed cloud environments.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span># requires configuration update in postgresql.conf (or conf.d)
</span><span>shared_preload_libraries = '</span><span>pg_cron</span><span>'
</span><span>
</span><span># add extension as superuser 
</span><span>CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
</span></code></pre>
<p>As long as you are familiar with cron-like syntax, you can get started immediately by using commands like:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>cron</span><span>.</span><span>schedule</span><span>('</span><span>30 3 * * 6</span><span>', $$</span><span>DELETE FROM</span><span> events </span><span>WHERE</span><span> event_time &lt; now() - interval '</span><span>1 week</span><span>'$$);
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>pg_cron</code> exposes its functionality in the <code>postgres</code> database (configurable), where it expects its metadata tables. Personally, I consider this a drawback, as it makes it less obvious to the casual DBA who might not be aware of the scheduling logic present.</p>
<p>In the same database, you can perform basic monitoring, for example, getting details of running and recently completed jobs:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>* </span><span>FROM </span><span>cron</span><span>.</span><span>job_run_details </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> start_time </span><span>DESC LIMIT </span><span>5</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is no direct support to talk to other PostgreSQL clusters (you would have to facilitate this, for example, using Foreign Data Wrappers).</p>
<p>While cron-like syntax is beneficial for adoption, it is where <code>pg_cron</code> falls short, as it does not support advanced cases like task chaining, dependencies, and triggers.</p>

<p>If <code>pg_cron</code> offers automation in first gear, <code>pg_timetable</code> is where you can go full speed ahead. It not only provides cron-like syntax but elevates it to a whole new level with task chaining, parameter support, multiple execution clients, enhanced scheduling, and much more.</p>
<p>The first difference you might notice is in its distribution. Timetable is not a PostgreSQL extension but a standalone binary (or available as a Docker image) that you have to configure and run. This immediately raises the bar in terms of the infrastructure it requires. On the other hand, not being distributed as an extension makes it compatible with all managed services by default (if you can get the process up and running).</p>
<p>While the basic syntax might be similar to <code>pg_cron</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>add_job</span><span>('</span><span>execute-func</span><span>', '</span><span>5 0 * 8 *</span><span>', '</span><span>SELECT public.my_func()</span><span>');
</span></code></pre>
<p>this is not anywhere near the limits of <code>pg_timetable</code>. <code>add_job</code> is a helper function that creates a simple one-task chain. For task execution, it directly supports more options, including built-in tasks (like sending emails if properly configured, downloading files, sleeping, copying files, etc.), external commands, the ability to choose which client should execute the job, concurrency, and more.</p>
<p>In its full definition, <code>add_job</code> is quite powerful (see <a href="https://pg-timetable.readthedocs.io/en/master/basic_jobs.html#add-simple-job">documentation</a> for details):</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>add_job</span><span>(
</span><span>    job_name            =&gt; '</span><span>notify every minute</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_schedule        =&gt; '</span><span>* * * * *</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_command         =&gt; '</span><span>SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_parameters      =&gt; '</span><span>["TT_CHANNEL", "Hello World!"]</span><span>'::jsonb,
</span><span>    job_kind            =&gt; '</span><span>SQL</span><span>'::</span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>command_kind</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_client_name     =&gt; </span><span>NULL</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_max_instances   =&gt; </span><span>1</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_live            =&gt; </span><span>TRUE</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_self_destruct   =&gt; </span><span>FALSE</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_ignore_errors   =&gt; </span><span>TRUE
</span><span>) AS chain_id;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The components of <code>pg_timetable</code> consist of the <strong>command</strong> (SQL/program or built-in), <strong>task</strong> controlling the configuration for the command execution (error handling, timeout, or database connection to use), and <strong>chain</strong> which can contain a number of tasks chained together.</p>
<p>The big difference comes in the scheduling options. While <code>pg_cron</code> is limited (as its name suggests) to cron-like syntax, <code>pg_timetable</code> uses it for simple use cases but offers much more. It supports schedules <code>@every</code> and <code>@after</code>, allowing repeated execution and breaking away from the limitations of cron notation as it can go down to custom intervals (including second intervals). Another case is <code>@reboot</code> for instances when the <code>pg_timetable</code> controller reconnects to the database.</p>
<p>The timetable setup manages own schema migrations and stores all the configuration in schema <code>timetable</code> (by default), where you can find the definitions of chains/tasks and relevant auditing information (logs).</p>
<p>And yes, if you have been paying attention, <code>pg_timetable</code> architecture allows for running tasks across multiple PostgreSQL clusters, making it an advanced orchestration tool. The database connection, which can be configured in-place or via a drop-in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html">connection service file</a>, can be set on a per-task basis.</p>
<p>With chains, the setup can be much more complex:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>DO $$
</span><span>DECLARE
</span><span>  v_chain_id </span><span>BIGINT</span><span>;

<h2 id="the-comparison">The Comparison
</h2>
<p>When deciding between <code>pg_cron</code> and <code>pg_timetable</code>, it's essential to consider the specific needs of your use case, as both tools target different scenarios and scales of deployment. Here’s a comparison to help you decide which tool is more suitable for your requirements:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>pg_cron</th><th>pg_timetable</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Distribution</td><td>PostgreSQL extension</td><td>Standalone executable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scheduling</td><td>Limited (cron-like)</td><td>Extensive (intervals, calendar, custom)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Types</td><td>SQL</td><td>SQL, Built-in, Shell</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Chaining</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Error Handling</td><td>Basic</td><td>Intermediate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logging</td><td>Basic</td><td>Intermediate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dependencies</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ease of Use</td><td>Easy</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Configuration</td><td>Easy</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orchestration</td><td>Single Cluster</td><td>Advanced (multiple clusters)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="when-to-use-pg-cron">When to Use <code>pg_cron</code>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>If your requirements are straightforward, such as running maintenance tasks, refreshing materialised views, or generating periodic reports using simple SQL commands, <code>pg_cron</code> is an excellent choice. Its cron-like syntax is familiar and <strong>easy to use</strong>.</li>
<li><code>pg_cron</code> is a PostgreSQL extension, making it <strong>easier to install</strong> and configure within your existing PostgreSQL environment. This makes it ideal for users who prefer minimal setup effort.</li>
<li>When your environment is limited to a <strong>single PostgreSQL cluster</strong>, <code>pg_cron</code> is well-suited for the job. It does not support orchestration across multiple clusters, so it’s best used in environments where all operations are confined to one database cluster.</li>
<li>If <strong>Basic Error Handling and Logging</strong> is sufficient, <code>pg_cron</code> provides the necessary functionalities without additional complexity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="when-to-use-pg-timetable">When to Use <code>pg_timetable</code>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you need more <strong>advanced scheduling capabilities</strong> and <strong>task depedencies and chaining</strong>, such as task chaining, complex intervals, and custom execution times, <code>pg_timetable</code> is the better choice. It supports extensive scheduling options beyond the typical cron syntax.</li>
<li><code>pg_timetable</code> supports a <strong>variety of job types</strong>, including SQL commands, built-in tasks (like sending emails or downloading files), and shell commands. This makes it ideal for more complex automation needs that go beyond simple SQL execution.</li>
<li>If your environment spans multiple PostgreSQL clusters, <code>pg_timetable</code> can handle <strong>advanced orchestration</strong>, allowing tasks to be executed across different clusters seamlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Error Handling and Logging</strong> provides better insights and control over job executions.</li>
<li>Although bit more complex to setup, <code>pg_timetable</code> works as <strong>standalone Service</strong>, which makes it suitable for environments where extensions cannot be installed directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing between <code>pg_cron</code> and <code>pg_timetable</code> depends on your specific needs. For simpler, single-cluster tasks, <code>pg_cron</code> offers ease of use and straightforward setup. For more complex requirements involving advanced scheduling, task dependencies, and multi-cluster orchestration, <code>pg_timetable</code> provides a more powerful and flexible solution.</p>
<p>By understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool, you can make an informed decision that best suits your database automation needs.</p>
<p>PS: there's also <a href="https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgagent">pgAgent</a>, but it is generally not used and does not seem to be actively maintained.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was roasting some pumpkin for a delicious soup and towards the end of the cooking time the fan on the oven started into overdrive, making a lot of noise then it started beeping and popped up this obscure error message. I phoned the manufacturer, Electrolux, on the provided number and they told me I'd need to pay at least $160 to have their engineer come out and tell me what was wrong.</p><p>You've probably had this experience with lots of stuff. "Sorry, the item is out of warranty so you'll have to pay." The problem with this is that <a href="https://consumer.gov.au/consumers-and-acl">Australian Consumer Law</a> gives an <i>automatic</i> warranty. You can expect the item to last a reasonable amount of time. Now an old fashioned light bulb shouldn't be expected to last a decade, but an oven?</p><p>Challenged on this, I went around and around in circles with the Electrolux call centre worker. "So you think an oven should only last for two years?" and eventually I asked to be escalated to a manager who could actually make a decision. After some follow up, I finally got a call from a manager who was well drilled in shutting down any idea I should expect something from them. Eventually I said okay thanks, I'll see you at the Tribunal.</p><h2>How long should an appliance last?</h2><p>The "warranty" companies talk about is actually an "express warranty" and if you read them you'll notice these days they now include mandatory text about how they aren't able to exclude guarantees that come from the Australian Consumer Law. Anything they offer in their written warranty is in addition to your base rights.</p><p>So you have a reasonable expectation that your appliance will last a reasonable amount of time. So how long is reasonable? Well if you look around on the web you'll find different lengths of time for different classes of appliance. And if you buy the cheapest Chinesium appliance, you shouldn't expect it to last as long as the exxy Miele model.</p><h2>Time to book a court date</h2><p>NSW (and I think all the other states) has a tribunal especially for consumer claims, what used to be the "small claims court" is now the <a href="https://ncat.nsw.gov.au/" title="Link: https://ncat.nsw.gov.au/">NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal</a>, NCAT. It's specifically designed to be low cost and straightforward. You shouldn't need a lawyer and can turn up with your documents.</p><p>The important thing to know about tribunals like NCAT is you're paying mostly with your time. You'll need to front up on the booked date and make your case. There's a small filing fee: in this case it was $58, which is still a lot less than Electrolux wanted to charge just to tell me what the problem was.</p><p>Before you book your date, you need to work out who is the other side of the transaction. You don't ordinarily go after the manufacturer but the retailer. So I contacted Appliances Online to talk it through. They took the same line as Electrolux that it was out of warranty and so not their problem. Again: see you in the Tribunal.</p><p>I filled in the forms. They're annoyingly slow, but the online system mostly works. Paid my fee and bingo, out comes an email with a tribunal date and location.</p><h2>Amazing service, just add NCAT date</h2><p>And the next day I get a call from the lovely Dylan from Appliances Online, someone who's evidently empowered to make decisions that make tribunal appointments go away. He tells me he'll get Electrolux to invoice them instead, an appointment is booked and we're off to the races.</p><p>One thing worth understanding is this: if the retailer has to send someone along to the Tribunal, they lose already. Even the cost of a junior lawyer going to the tribunal is going to be more than it would cost to repair your appliance. They might do it on principle if you're taking the piss but if you have a decent case they're wasting time and money.</p><h2>A couple of engineer visits</h2><p>Don't go cancelling your NCAT date just yet though! First you need the problem resolved. Remember, this could have all been resolved by them applying Australian Consumer Law when you first asked, so keep that clock ticking, it keeps things moving.</p><p>I had a lovely engineer from Electrolux visit and take a look. He wasn't sure what the problem was: tested the fan and heater element and found no problem. In the end he replaced the light bulb (which hadn't worked for years, we hadn't bothered replacing it) and the message had gone away anyway.</p><p>Next day the message is back, and Dylan drops me a note asking me to remove the NCAT booking. I respond saying it still isn't resolved and magically another engineer appointment pops up.</p><p>The second visit does the trick. The engineer replaced the heating element and fan and the message has gone away. We've done a few baking projects since and all seems good!</p><h2>Satisfaction, but annoyed I have to assert my rights</h2><p>So my oven is fixed. Otherwise it's a <i>great</i> oven. It's annoying that I have to push to get my consumer rights though. It should just be standard! My hope is that by encouraging others to also assert their rights it'll become easier. Don't put up with this shit about appliances having a tiny warranty period!<br>

<h2>Beginning in 1979, former librarian Marion Stokes privately recorded broadcasts from multiple televisions at once, 24 hours a day, eventually accumulating a startling 71,000 tapes of television history.</h2><div id="attachment_475597"><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-475597" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes.jpg" alt="Marion Stokes" width="900" height="462" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes-300x154.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-475597"><span>Zeitgeist Films</span><span>Marion Stokes took it upon herself to record and archive every moment of television.</span></p></div>
<p>Marion Stokes believed that the news held crucial historical details at risk of disappearing forever. So, beginning around 1979, the former librarian and civil rights activist began obsessively recording television broadcasts 24 hours a day. </p>
<p>For more than three decades, Stokes attempted to archive every broadcast that she had access to, eventually recording programs on as many as eight televisions at once. In the end, she wound up with more than 70,000 recorded tapes. </p>
<p>Stokes was equal parts compulsive hoarder and guerrilla archivist, and her unique project has raised important questions about media preservation. Although she died in 2012, her project has been given new life thanks to the Internet Archive, which began the painstaking process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes in 2013. This massive undertaking is itself a years-long task, which shows just how prolific Marion Stokes’ work truly was. </p>

<p>Marion Marguerite Stokes was born on Nov. 25, 1929, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stokes grew up in the city’s Germantown neighborhood and attended Girls High School. From the 1940s to the early 1960s, she worked as a librarian at the Free Library of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>But it was Stokes’ later work as a <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/civil-rights-movement-photos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">civil rights</a> activist, working to help integrate Girard College, that initially made her a standout. She helped organize buses to the 1963 <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/march-on-washington" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March on Washington</a>, and served as a founding board member of the National Organization for Women. She was likewise the Chair for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an organization that opposed the economic boycott of Cuba. </p>

<p>In 1960, Stokes married a teacher named Melvin Metelits, with whom she had one son, Michael. The couple later split, and Marion would go on to marry television anchor John Stokes Jr., whom she met while working as a panelist on a local news show called <em>Input.</em> </p>
<p>The Stokeses later moved into a new home in Rittenhouse Square. Around 1975, Stokes bought herself a Betamax magnetic videotape recorder and began to casually record episodes of her favorite sit-coms, documentaries, and news broadcasts.</p>
<p>But in 1979, amid the Iran Hostage Crisis, something in Marion Stokes changed. </p>
<p>As her son Michael Metelits said in the 2019 documentary <em><a href="https://recorderfilm.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project</a>,</em> “she hit record and she never stopped.”</p>
<h2>The Birth Of A Unique Obsession</h2>
<p>Marion Stokes became obsessed with chronicling and archiving news footage. She would purchase countless tapes, load them into the recorder, and let the television run all day long. </p>
<p>Every six to eight hours — depending on the length of the tape — she quickly swapped it out for a new one. Sometimes, this meant rushing home early from a meal to ensure she didn’t miss a second of a broadcast.</p>
<p>Gradually, she bought more and more TVs so she could document multiple programs at once until she was recording from eight different devices.</p>
<p>“It was just a logistical nightmare — that’s really the only way to put it,” Michael Metelits told <em><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3022022/the-incredible-story-of-marion-stokes-who-single-handedly-taped-35-years-of-tv-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fast Company</a></em> in 2013.</p>

<p>As one might expect, these tapes eventually began to take up space — a lot of it. By investing in Apple stock, Stokes saved enough money to buy as many as nine additional apartments, which she used as storage units to hold all of her tapes. </p>
<p>“Pretty much everything else took a back seat,” Metelits said. “It provided a certain rhythm to her life, and a certain amount of deep, deep conviction that this stuff was going to be useful. That somehow, someone would find a way to index it, archive it, store it — that it would be useful.”</p>
<p>The archives eventually grew to approximately 71,000 VHS and Betamax tapes, stored in various locations. These tapes contained not only news broadcasts but also sit-coms, commercials, and talk shows, recorded in Extended Play format. </p>

<p>Stokes worried that facts and details from early news broadcasts could become lost or muddied as stories were retold over time. Little inconsistencies could start to add up, leaving viewers with no way of knowing how the story was originally reported. </p>
<p>“Television has been our most pervasive and persuasive medium,” said Roger MacDonald, the librarian in charge of the Internet Archive’s television portion. “But we’ve never really had much of a pause and rewind button on our experience of it to reflect back on television news, to compare and contrast and mine it for knowledge.”</p>
<p>Archiving television programs was not Stokes’ only fascination. In fact, the tech-savvy hoarder also took an early interest in Apple computers — and amassed 192 Macintosh computers before she died. </p>
<p>Still, it was her obsessive archiving of the daily news that would be her ultimate legacy.</p>
<h2>The Legacy And Lasting Impact Of Marion Stokes’ Work</h2>
<p>Marion Stokes continued to record and archive television footage up until the end. She lived to be 83 years old. And as it would turn out, her last day on Earth would coincide with her last recordings — and a horrible tragedy. </p>
<p>Stokes died on Dec. 14, 2012. That very same day, news organizations across the United States were reporting on the mass shooting at <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/false-flag-conspiracies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>. </p>
<p>“I got to the house and this horrific news was going on,” Metelits said. “Kids being killed. Teachers being killed while shielding children, that sort of thing… I remember being very grateful that that wasn’t the last news she saw.”</p>
<p>Marion Stokes’ project died with her that day. Her son did not continue her archival work, saying he “came to respect her project, but it wasn’t my project.” </p>

<p>But while no new tapes would ever be added to Stokes’ collection, her project did find new life in 2013, just a year after her death, when the Internet Archive began the process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes and putting them online. </p>
<p>Then, in 2019, filmmaker Matt Wolf released his documentary about Marion Stokes, allowing audiences to understand Stokes’ obsession with archiving television. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was met with positive reviews, with some critics noting that the film — and Stokes herself — made a compelling case for guerrilla archiving.</p>
<p>Marion Stokes’ story also resonates strongly today, albeit somewhat differently, as private ownership of the media we consume daily begins to fade. With more and more services shifting to a streaming or digital model, only to then restrict access to certain media or get rid of it altogether, many are considering the merits of physical media as a means of preserving history.</p>
<p>As MacDonald told <em>Fast Company</em>, some moments in television history have likely been lost forever.</p>
<p>“But who knows,” he said. “Because there may be other Marion Stokeses out there who had that similar passion.”</p>
