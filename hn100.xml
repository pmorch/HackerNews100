<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
    
  
<p>Restricting the volume of high-emitting vehicles roaming city streets carries many benefits, from clearing the air to quieting the urban din and beyond. Recognition of this simple fact has led to the proliferation of clean air zones, designated regions within a city where vehicles must meet strict pollution standards or pay a fee to operate within it. At last count, over 300 such areas had been established across Europe. In London, which boasts the largest <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">ultra-low emissions zone</a> in the world, <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01621-7">a study</a> has found a secondary benefit: Kids started walking and biking to school more.</p>



<p>In 2018 — the year before London’s rule took effect in the center of the city, and five years before the zone encompassed its entirety — researchers at the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University saw in the impending policy an opportunity to conduct a natural experiment. They recruited children aged 6 to 9 and their families in central London and in Luton, a small city to the north, for a multi-year study to investigate how the program might affect a child’s health. Though research focused on understanding how lightening a city’s pollution load shaped the way young lungs develop, participants completed questionnaires alongside their annual health assessments. The responses allowed researchers to glean insights into their subjects’ activity levels, mental health, and other ancillary outcomes.</p>    




<p>In the first of many papers expected from the study, the researchers found that, a year after the ultra-low emissions zone took effect, <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01621-7">2 out of every 5 London students</a> in the study had switched from “passive” to “active” ways of getting to school. So instead of being chauffeured to school by their parents, the students started walking, biking, scootering, or taking public transit. On the other hand, in Luton, which acted as a control group, 1 in 5 made the same switch to modes that got them up and active, but an equal proportion switched to passive travel. But in London’s ultra-low emissions zone, shifting to driving was rare.</p>



<p>The implications of getting kids active, even if it’s just for their pre-class commute, are intuitive but important.</p>



<p>“Walking and biking and scootering to school is better for the child, better for the family, and better for the environment,” said Alison Macpherson, an epidemiologist at York University in Toronto who researches ways to protect and promote the health and safety of children. (She was not involved in the London study.)</p>



<p>“It’s a great way for children to start their day,” she said. “You can imagine just being thrown in a car and thrown out of a car is not the most calming way.” Walking or biking to school, on the other hand, can be calming and conducive to concentration, Macpherson said, potentially even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4874515/">improving academic performance</a>. But perhaps most importantly, at a time when an epidemic of <a href="https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/childhood-obesity-in-the-united-states">childhood obesity</a> is on the rise <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2819322#google_vignette">worldwide</a>, walking or wheeling to and from school can get kids <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-9-134">more active</a>.</p>



<p>“Physical activity in general is vital for preventing obesity,” said Christina Xiao, an epidemiologist affiliated with Cambridge University and lead author of the paper. “There’s strong evidence that shows that it prevents weight gain, and also has benefits in terms of children’s physical development and mental health as well.”</p>



<p>What exact health outcomes manifest among the cubs involved in the study will be a subject of forthcoming studies. One will attempt to tease apart what prompted parents to stop driving their kids to school. Xiao’s results demonstrate that the change took place, exploring why was beyond the scope of her study. So, whether the parents stopped driving because the daily fee of $16.50 (12.50 British pounds) made it cost prohibitive or because, with fewer cars on the roadways, parents felt safer letting their kids make the stroll to campus (or some combination of the two) remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Despite the benefits that stem from <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/low-and-zero-emissions-zones.pdf">emissions-control zones</a> like this, the <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/59/">legal environment in the United States</a> has erected immense obstacles to replicating something like London’s ultra-low emissions zone. The closest anyone’s come was a voluntary and short-lived <a href="https://www.santamonica.gov/zero-emission-delivery-zone">zero emissions delivery zone</a> pilot in Santa Monica, California. And then there was New York City’s ill-fated congestion pricing zone, which <a href="https://grist.org/transportation/kathy-hochul-congestion-pricing-new-york/">Governor Kathy Hochul axed</a> before it had a chance to <a href="https://grist.org/transportation/critics-of-congestion-pricing-often-end-up-supporting-it-heres-why/">woo the opposition</a>.</p>

<p>While the legislative gordian knot tied by federal laws that preempt cities from establishing low emissions zones waits to be unwound, cities across the country can improve the infrastructure that enables people to embrace walking, biking, or busing, said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ clean transportation program.</p>



<p>“We are on the way in making this switch from gasoline and diesel to electric vehicles, which is great,” Reichmuth said. “But really to meet our climate goals, we also just need to reduce the amount of driving. And these things that encourage or enable the ability for people to use active transportation are super important.”</p>



<p>While developing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and building out protected bike lanes can encourage a shift in how people travel, Xiao found as she assembled a review of research investigating how to promote <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00220-0/fulltext">shifts to healthier transit</a>, people preferred the stick to the carrot. In other words, discouraging car travel was often more effective than just building infrastructure conducive to active travel.</p>



<p>But whether it takes carrots or sticks to drive the shift, Xiao’s work adds yet more evidence to the argument that what is best for the health of the children benefits the health of communities and that of the planet as well. And, in the minds of those doing similar work, it underscores the urgency of getting fewer cars and more feet on city streets.</p>



<p>“Active transportation is sustainable transportation,” Macpherson said, “and we have to not lose sight of all of the benefits that come with making the commute to school easier to do in an active and sustainable way.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>This article has been updated in September 2024 with new information about the Infineon photo-acoustic sensor as well as the performance of photo-acoustic sensors outdoors.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to low cost CO2 sensors, there are basically three different methods to measure CO2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimated CO2 (eCO2) through TVOC sensors</li>
<li>NDIR sensors</li>
<li>Photo-acoustic sensors</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="estimated-co2-eco2-through-tvoc-sensors---not-recommended--">Estimated CO2 (eCO2) through TVOC sensors <strong>- not recommended -</strong></h3>
<p>The first method via TVOC sensors is extremely unreliable. Some TVOC sensors like the Sensirion SGP30 estimate CO2 via organic components in the air. When you breathe out, you add organic components to the air which these sensors pick up and try to calculate a corresponding CO2 ppm value. The problem is that also other indoor sources like deodorizers add these chemical components to the air and thus the estimated CO2 rises -even though nobody might be in the room. We strongly advise against using TVOC sensors for CO2 estimation and thus will also not analyse it further in the rest of this article.</p>
<h3 id="co2-gas-absorption-principle">CO2 gas absorption principle</h3>
<p>Both NDIR as well as photo-acoustic sensors are much more accurate than eCO2 from TVOC sensors as these sensors measure the CO2 directly and both are based on the absorption principle of gases. Different gases absorb light at specific ranges of wavelengths. So if the light is tuned at a certain wavelength and a receiver measures the incoming light levels, the rate of absorption can be calculated and with this the concentration of the gas established.</p>
<p>Different gases have different absorption bands:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/wavelength.jpg"></p><p>Absorption wavelengths of different gases.
</p>
</div>
<p>To measure CO2, the light is tuned to emit a light of close to 4.26 micron (μm) which corresponds to the absorption of CO2.</p>
<h3 id="ndir-co2-sensors">NDIR CO2 Sensors</h3>
<p>NDIR stands for “nondispersive infrared” and is a common technology to measure CO2. Thereby an infrared light emitter, typically an LED, sends light in a chamber filled with ambient air to a receiver.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/ndir_principle.jpg"></p><p>NDIR working principle.
</p>
</div>
<p>Some NDIR sensors have dual channels, one for the measurement of the CO2 levels in the ambient air and one with a control gas as a reference. This allows to detect drifts in the measurements and increases accuracy.
One of the disadvantages of NDIR sensors is their size. There needs to be a certain minimum distance between the light emitter and receiver to achieve a certain level of accuracy and thus modern NDIR sensors like the SenseAir S8 that we use in our air quality kits are more than 3 cm long. This is not too big but would prevent certain applications, e.g. in a mobile phone.</p>
<h3 id="photo-acoustic-sensors">Photo-Acoustic Sensors</h3>
<p>Photo-acoustic sensors use the same working principle of the absorption wavelengths but unlike the NDIR sensors that measure the receiving light from an emitting LED, photo accoustic sensors measure the absorption with a microphone. When the CO2 molecules absorb the IR light, they start to “humm” and this sound can be picked up by a microphone.
The biggest advantage of this principle is that the detection does not rely on line-of-sight anymore and thus these sensors can be built much smaller. Some are smaller than 1 cm3.</p>

<p>Except for the size and connectivity, the specs are quite similar. They do also cost around the same (USD 10 - 25).</p>
<h3 id="side-by-side-comparison-indoors">Side-By-Side Comparison Indoors</h3>
<p>We tested the SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40 / SCD41 for a few weeks and saw them behaving very similarly. Below is a chart over 14 days in a typical indoor home environment (bedroom).</p>

<p>Both sensors deliver very reliable results and the only difference that can be spotted is that the S8 seems to be a bit more sensitive and picks up higher values more. This can be seen on an X Y chart:</p>

</p>
</div>
<h3 id="outdoors">Photo-Acoustic Struggles Outdoors</h3>
<p>We do also measure CO2 levels outdoors with our outdoor monitor <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/outdoor/">Open Air</a>, and it helps to detect local emission sources. As part of that development we also tested photo-acoustic CO2 sensors outdoors in collaboration with researchers from the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>Outdoor measurement of CO2 is more challenging due to mainly two reasons:</p>
<p>Firstly, there is a much larger range of temperature and humidity that the sensor is directly exposed to. For example indoor temperatures normally range between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius whereas outside we could have a range from -30 to +45 degrees Celsius of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Secondly, the typical CO2 concentration levels outdoor are in the range of 400 to 550 ppm (higher in rural areas) whereas indoors you typically have a range of 400 to up to 3000ppm. In general, it is often easier for sensors to measure higher concentrations because there are more molecules or particles that can be detected.</p>
<p>Below is a comparison of two SenseAir S8 and two Sensirion SCD40 sensors compared to a CO2 reference instrument. All sensors have been offset to the same starting point.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/outdoor-s8-scd.jpg"></p><p>Outdoor time-line comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can observe a few interesting things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The two pairs have very distinctive differences</li>
<li>The two SenseAir S8 (optical) NDIR sensors aligns much better with the reference than the photo acoustic sensors from Sensirion</li>
<li>The two SenseAir S8 sensors correlate much better compared to each other than the two Sensirion SCD sensors. In fact there are cases where the SCD sensors go into completely opposite directions</li>
</ol>
<p>These observations can also be easily shown in the R2 comparisons. R2 is a mathematical number showing the degree of correlation between two number. A number of 1 indicates a perfect correlation, where as a number of 0 indicates no correlation at all. In terms of accuracy we want to get as close to one as possible.</p>
<p>First let’s compare the two sensor pairs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>R2 between S8</th>
<th>R2 between SCD 41</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.90</td>
<td>0.36</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These number clearly indicate that the S8 sensors have a much higher agreement with each other than the photo acoustic sensors.</p>
<p>Now lets look at the comparison with the reference instrument.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Sensor</th>
<th>R2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>S8 -1</td>
<td>0.69</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S8 -2</td>
<td>0.64</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCD -1</td>
<td>0.16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCD -2</td>
<td>0.24</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Also, here we see that the S8 has a much higher correlation with the reference instrument compared to the photo acoustic sensors. By the way in more comprehensive (and ongoing) tests, the S8 actually achieves correlations with reference instruments above 0.9 and thus even better than the above numbers indicate.</p>
<p>By the way all of the above observations can also be seen clearly in the X Y comparison between the point the sensor measures and the reference.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/outdoor-s8-scd-scatter.jpg"></p><p>Outdoor comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40 with X Y comparison.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the S8 dots (red and blue) are much closer to the 1:1 line than the dots from the photo-acoustoc sensors.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We have been using the SenseAir S8 in our air quality monitors for many years now and have made very good experience with. The Sensirion SCD4x seems to give a similar accuracy under normal indoor conditions but seems to be more impacted by environmental conditions and is not recommended for outdoor usage.</p>

		<p>I noticed something strange earlier this month when I pulled up the Uber app and requested a ride.
</p><ul><li>I had my monthly $15 American Express Uber credit in my account<br>
</li><li>The price for the ride was displayed net of this credit (rather than full price, just showing the Uber credit as a payment method later)<br>
</li><li>And the fare seemed higher than usual.  It was also much higher than Lyft.</li></ul>
<p>My hypothesis was that Uber seemed to be picking a higher price <i>because I had credits in my account</i>.  I might be willing to spend more because my ‘real’ out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped <i>anyway</i>.</p>
<p>I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead.  That pricing seemed normal.  I need to keep my eye on this.</p>
<p>Reader <b>Charles</b> says he noticed something similar.</p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<ul><li>He regularly pre-books rides with Uber – between the same locations at the same time of day – and generally finds the price to be stable ~ $20 and a bit cheaper than Lyft.
</li><li>He bought Uber gift cards at Costco for a 20% discount to face value.  That’s when things got weird.</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Loaded first $50 card in my uber account, everything behaved normal. I loaded another $200 before taking Uber to airport, then was surprised to find uber won’t allow payment with uber cash loaded in the account this way for rides scheduled ahead of time. </p>
<p>…then stranger things happened: for same ride I book regularly increased from about $20 to $30!  Just as a sanity check, Lyft is still ~$20 for same ride.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went a step farther and did something I didn’t: he checked Uber prices “with someone else’s phone” who did not have a balance in their Uber account – and Uber was pricing the route at the usual $20 for them.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what’s happening here, but something seems strange and – unsurprisingly – not in a customer-friendly way. At the same time, I’m also not the first person to experience (or think they experienced) this.  Have you seen anything like it?  I’d be curious your experiences, especially once you get Uber credits in your account.  My theory, and it is definitely just that, is this is something they’re testing on a subset of users to learn how customers respond.</p>
<p>Remember when Uber brought in Dara Khosrowshahi from Expedia to be their new CEO, to become kinder and gentler and friendler?  At the time I figured things would get worse because he was literally in charge <i>at Expedia</i>.  But drivers now seem to earn less, even though (because of) tipping.  It’s more expensive to customers, too.  And there’s no more “surge pricing” – they just charge you higher and higher amounts without <i>telling you</i> they’re doing it.</p>

<p>Just to add, I’m seeing the exact same thing but had not gotten around to submitting any bug reports.</p>
<p>But it’s reproducible in ST and VSC.</p>
<p>If I create a new file called ‘foo.html.haml’, the system will append .h to the file!</p>
<p>Why on earth would Apple add a ‘feature’ like this!</p>

The problem of filling a plane with identical tiles has been so thoroughly explored since antiquity that it’s tempting to suppose that there is nothing left to be discovered about it. But the researchers deduced the principles of tilings with a new set of geometric building blocks that have rounded corners, which they term ‘soft cells’.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>“Simply, no one has done this before”, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss, a mathematician at the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City, who was not involved in the work. “It’s really amazing how many basic things there are to consider.”</p><p>It has been known for millennia that only certain types of polygonal tile, such as squares or hexagons, can be packed together to fill 2D space with no gaps. Tilings that fill space without a regularly repeating arrangement, such as Penrose tilings, have attracted interest since the discovery of non-periodic structures called quasicrystals in the 1980s. Last year, the first quasiperiodic tiling, lacking any true periodicity, that uses just a single tile shape was announced by Goodman-Strauss and his colleagues<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>Avoiding corners</h2><p>Mathematician Gábor Domokos at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and his co-workers returned to periodic polygonal tilings — but considered what happens when some of the corners are rounded. In two dimensions, not all corners can be rounded without leaving gaps. But space-filling tilings become possible when some corners are deformed into ‘cusp shapes’. These corners have internal angles of zero — their edges meet tangentially as in a teardrop, and they fit snugly next to the rounded corners (see ‘Soft tilings’).</p><p>Domokos and colleagues devised an algorithm for smoothly converting geometric tiles — either 2D polygons or 3D polyhedra, like the bubbles of a foam — into soft cells, and explored the range of possible shapes these rules permit. In 2D, the options are fairly limited: all tiles must have at least two cusp-like corners. But in 3D, introducing softness has some surprises in store. In particular, these soft cells can fill volumetric space without having any corners at all.</p><p>The researchers devised a quantitative measure of the degree of ‘softness’ of such space-filling 3D tiles, and found that the softest are not compact shapes, but instead develop flange-like circular ‘wings’ at their edges, typically emerging from saddle-like tile surfaces. The softest shape elements are in fact circular discs, which the flanges of the 3D tiles approximate.</p><h2>The cost of kinks</h2><p>Domokos thinks that, for any given initial polyhedral tiling, there is a unique tiling with the greatest possible softness. He also suspects that, in real materials, this optimum will turn out to maximize some physical quantity related to, say, the bending energy in the edges or the interfacial tension. He admits that he and his colleagues currently have no proof of this maximal-softness conjecture, but hopes “that someone much smarter will pick this up and prove it”.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The researchers identified soft tilings in nature in the 2D shapes of islands in braided rivers, cross-sections of the concentric layers in an onion and biological cells in a tissue, as well as the 3D compartments of spiral shells such as those of the nautilus, a marine mollusc (see ‘Nature’s soft cells’). Nature generally seeks to avoid corners, they think, because such kinks have a high cost in deformation energy and can be sources of structural weakness.</p><p>Studying the nautilus “was the turning point” of the work, says Domokos. In cross-section, the shell compartments looked like 2D soft cells with two corners. But co-author Krisztina Regős, also at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, suspected that the actual 3D chamber had no corners at all. “That sounded unbelievable,” says Domokos. “But later we found that she was right.”</p><h2>Ancient geometry</h2><p>Given that the analysis uses mathematics that has been known for centuries, it might seem surprising that no one has formalized the notion of soft cells until now. But Goodman-Strauss suspects that “the soft edges are enough of a block for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00402-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00402-3" data-track-category="body text link">geometers</a> not to have thought about it” previously.</p><p>“The universe of polygonal and polyhedral tilings is so fascinating and rich that mathematicians did not need to expand their playground,” says Domokos. He suspects that there is a common perception that fresh insights demand advanced mathematics or cutting-edge computation, not simply well-established geometric methods.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Goodman-Strauss sees the work as offering “a kind of descriptive language of structure”, but which might not yet reveal new physical principles underlying the formation of such structures in nature. To understand, say, river banks, he says, it is probably still necessary to consider the physical process from first principles, such as the roles of flow, sediment transport and erosion.</p><p>Domokos and colleagues think that architects such as Zaha Hadid have long used soft cells intuitively to avoid or minimize corners, either for aesthetic or structural reasons. Since completing the paper, Domokos and co-author Alain Goriely of the University of Oxford, UK, have collaborated with architects at the California College of Arts in San Fransisco, who devised an award-winning structure using soft-cell elements made — appropriately — from eggshells.</p>

<p dir="auto">Ever wanted to write C code and run it on Android?  Sick of multi-megabyte
packages just to do the most basic of things.  Well, this is a demo of how
to make your own APKs and build, install and automatically run them in about
2 seconds, and with an apk size of about 25kB (with API 26).  API 30 (Android R+)
is unfortunately at 45kB to support ARM64 + ARM32.</p>
<p dir="auto">With this framework you get a demo which has:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To make a window with OpenGL ES support</li>
<li>Accelerometer/gyro input, multi-touch</li>
<li>An android keyboard for key input</li>
<li>Ability to store asset files in your APK and read them with <code>AAssetManager</code></li>
<li>Permissions support for using things like sound. Example in <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/cnfa">https://github.com/cnlohr/cnfa</a> / <a href="https://github.com/cntools/cnfa/blob/d271e0196d81412032eeffa634a94a1aaf0060a7/CNFA_android.c#L305">https://github.com/cntools/cnfa/blob/d271e0196d81412032eeffa634a94a1aaf0060a7/CNFA_android.c#L305</a></li>

<p dir="auto">Because sometimes you want to do things that don't fit into the normal way of doing it and all the discussions online revolve around doing it with all the normal processes.  And those processes change, making it difficult to keep up and do specific things.  By using <code>Makefile</code>s it's easy to see what exact commands are executed and add custom rules and tweak your build.  C is a universal language.  Rawdraw operates on everything from an ESP8266, to RaspberryPi, Windows Linux and now, even Android.  Write code once, use it everywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you don't fill your build process with hills of beans, you end up being left with the parts that are important, and not the frivilous parts. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, etc, because everything takes much less time.</p>
<p dir="auto">A little bit of this also has to do to stick it to all those Luddites on the internet who post "that's impossible" or "you're doing it wrong" to Stack Overflow questions... Requesting permissions in the JNI "oh you <strong>have</strong> to do that in Java" or other dumb stuff like that.  I am completely uninterested in your opinions of what is or is not possible.  This is computer science.  There aren't restrictions.  I can do anything I want.  It's just bits.  You don't own me.</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S. If you want a bunch of examples of how to do a ton of things in C on Android that you "need" java for, scroll to the bottom of this file: <a href="https://github.com/cntools/rawdraw/blob/master/CNFGEGLDriver.c">https://github.com/cntools/rawdraw/blob/master/CNFGEGLDriver.c</a> - it shows how to use the JNI to marshall a ton of stuff to/from the Android API without needing to jump back into Java/Kotlin land.</p>

<p dir="auto">Most of the testing was done on Linux, however @AEFeinstein has done at least cursory testing in Windows.  You still need some components of Android studio set up to use this, so it's generally easier to just install Android studio completely, but there are instructions on sort of how to do it piecemeal for Windows.</p>

<p dir="auto">This set of steps describes how to install Android Studio with NDK support in Linux.  It uses the graphical installer and installs a lot more stuff than the instructions below.  You may be able to mix-and-match these two sets of instructions.  For instance if you are on Linux but don't want to sacrifice 6 GB of disk to the Googs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE</strong> You probably should use the WSL instructions instead of these instructions as it will produc a more lean installation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Because we are doing this entirelly in the NDK, with the JNI, we won't have the luxury of writing any Java/Kotlin code and calling it.  That means all of the examples online have to be heavily marshalled.  In rawdraw's EGL driver, we have many examples of how to do that.  That said, you can use the following functions which get you most of the way there.</p>
