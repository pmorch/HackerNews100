<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h2>My new car has a mysterious and undocumented switch</h2></p></div><div id="post-content-parent"><p>Last week I bought a car. After twelve years of service, my old trusty Peugeot 107 in blue has had its best. Expensive repairs were coming <em>at some point</em>, and I did not feel like waiting around for them to come. Plus the existing list of faults (like the high oil usage of about a litre per month, a brake that sometimes blocked without reason, or the smell of exhaust fumes that sometimes came into the car when the fan was on high) also started getting longer and longer.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732888980123/91643929-8f55-468a-8568-97d1a64862da.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway, new car time! After a lot of research I ended up with an Opel Corsa from 2020. To be precise, it’s an Opel Corsa Edition with 101 HP, and most importantly, it’s mine.</p>
<p>Unlike the Peugeot, the Opel has gadgets - quite a few of them. Of course it being my car, I want to know what all buttons do, so I read the entire manual (which is very annoying to read, as they make one manual for every version of the car, so half of it does not apply to this car, but I digress). One of those buttons was the following below the lighting controls.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732889068247/f39bda1d-77c1-4186-862b-c566cce517bb.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Those do not appear in the manual, or the website, or anywhere. What could they be? Just flipping the switch does nothing, apart from turning off the light on the switch. So let’s look where the button goes. I can see that part of it is wired to the back of the OBD2 port (a port that retrieves data from the onboard computer about the car, such as pedal position, temperature, lights, rev count, speed - basically if you can see it on your dashboard it can be read using the OBD2 port), so it is getting information from the car, but apart from that the wires go to places that I can’t see without taking the car further apart.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732889143592/00372c30-63b8-4807-9ae3-4b15727304e5.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Something else that I noticed before is that I heard the typical inference noise coming from that area of the car when putting the ignition on. You know, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FYjs7vsaSEw">this</a> sound. <em>Ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, TAAAAAAAAAAA</em>. That gave me the ominous feeling there might be something sending data in there. Sure, my car does that too so I can see in the app where I parked it (seriously, it does that), but at least I gave permission for that.</p>
<p>I asked the wisdom of the crowd. A lot of ideas came up: nitrous (would have been fun), LPG switch (it’s only petrol), flame kit (I wish), front parking sensors (those are standard on the car). No avail.</p>
<p>I called my dealership and asked. They guessed it might have been an immobiliser - bit strange on a car this young and type, and also strange for it to be a switch like this. I called the dealership that previously maintained the vehicle based on the phone number in the service history. They did not install it, and guessed it might be a black box. They did tell me who it previously belonged to (a large company), so I called their headquarters. They told me they don’t do their own cars any more, but that they outsourced it, and gave me a phone number. I called them, they told me they don’t do that, but he speculated it might be a GPS tracker.</p>
<p>Some more searching, and I figured I would just drive to my dealership. More speculating with the salespeople, who told me to make an appointment with the mechanics. I did, they had a quick look at it and I now have an answer:</p>
<p>The metal part is something to hold a magnet next to. It registers who's driving to a fleet tracker via a device also mounted in the car, which sends it to a fleet manager via the internet. That way it can be tracked which employee did what (and potentially who to send the fine to). That would also explain the mobile phone interference noises I've heard from that area of the car. So it’s a black box, a GPS tracker, and maybe also an immobiliser? I am not sure about the last one (and why it has a switch).</p>
<p>I'm getting it removed because now I'm basically driving around with a foreign GPS tracker. Some lease company somewhere is getting data on wherever I go. Kind of spooky if you think of it, especially as I assume I am one of the few actually looking into what this is. Most people would have probably driven around for years with a foreign GPS tracker.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732889803408/1353bcc6-c25c-482b-9a75-67686582c479.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>And that’s how the search comes to an end. After a bit of perseverance I figured out what it is. I now know my car is being tracked still, and that they know I did try out what the car’s acceleration is like at full throttle.</p>
<p>There are more interesting angles to this, like “can I request my data from the fleet manager thing that has been tracking my whereabouts under the GDPR?”, and “can I get free data from the SIM card embedded in the device that I now technically own?” but I will leave those for another day.</p>

<p>The map above shows how much houses cost in 1950 in each US state in 2024 inflation adjusted US dollars, compared to what the average cost actually is in 2024.  </p>
<p>In every single US state the increase was at at least double the rate of inflation from a low in Ohio of just 107% above inflation to a high in <a href="https://brilliantmaps.com/us-maps/alaska-map/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="99" title="Map of Alaska The Government Doesn’t Want You To See">Alaska</a> of 675% above inflation. </p>
<p>The following map shows the percentage increase above inflation:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Here’s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let’s say you’re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I’d see
is… nothing! It doesn’t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn’t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as “uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don’t
show me the output, that’s weird”, and I’d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I’ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why “pipes get stuck” sometimes is that it’s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it’s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don’t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it’s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here’s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it’s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use “block buffering” – only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you’ll see the line as
soon as it’s printed, but if it’s writing to a pipe, you won’t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn’t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc’s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here’s where that’s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: “programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal” isn’t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can’t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don’t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don’t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it’s a command
where you’re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here’s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there’s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can’t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn’t matter because <code>sort</code> can’t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default “print” statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you’re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on what print function you
use, for example in Rust <code>print!</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>println!</code>
will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>’s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable – I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It’s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn’t have the same “<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer” problem though – in my experience it usually behaves
more like you’d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I’m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s talk solutions. Let’s say you’ve run this command or s</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the “command writing to
pipe slowly” situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
“unnecessary” <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the “line buffer” flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they’re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they’ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you’ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc’s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it’s a bit unreliable – it doesn’t work on
static binaries, I think won’t work if the program isn’t using libc’s
buffering, and doesn’t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program’s output to be a TTY, which means
that it’ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>’s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it’s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that’s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It’s a bit hard for me to say which one is “best”, I think personally I’m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it’s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I’ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I’m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it’s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I’m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don’t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I’m also curious about whether there are any programs that just
automatically flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1
second). It feels like it would be a nice solution but I can’t think of any
program that does that, maybe it’s not easy to implement?</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn’t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system’s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than “you’re writing
to a pipe”</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/11/14/prometheus-3-0/">https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/11/14/prometheus-3-0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42274660">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<p>Following the recent release of <a href="https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team
is excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>

<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time, 
evolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to 
continue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>

<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>


<div><ul>

<li><a href="#remote-write-2-0">Remote Write 2.0
</a></li>
<li><a href="#utf-8-support">UTF-8 Support

</a></li>
</ul>
<li><a href="#native-histograms">Native Histograms
</a></li>
<li><a href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes
</a></li>
</ul></div>

<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>

<h2 id="new-ui">New UI<a href="#new-ui" name="new-ui"></a>
</h2>

<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png" alt="New UI query page"></p>

<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href="https://promlens.com/"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,
and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>

<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.
Users can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>

<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please 
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>

<p><img src="https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png" alt="New UTF-8 UI"></p>

<h2 id="remote-write-2-0">Remote Write 2.0<a href="#remote-write-2-0" name="remote-write-2-0"></a>
</h2>

<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,
created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. 
There is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found
<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="utf-8-support">UTF-8 Support<a href="#utf-8-support" name="utf-8-support"></a>
</h2>

<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,
as has been true in version 2.x.</p>

<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,
metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax
in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>

<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>

<h2 id="otlp-support">OTLP Support<a href="#otlp-support" name="otlp-support"></a>
</h2>

<p>In alignment with <a href="https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features 
several new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry. </p>

<h3 id="otlp-ingestion">OTLP Ingestion<a href="#otlp-ingestion" name="otlp-ingestion"></a>
</h3>

<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>

<h3 id="utf-8-normalization">UTF-8 Normalization<a href="#utf-8-normalization" name="utf-8-normalization"></a>
</h3>

<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href="#utf-8-support">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>

<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>

<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:%7E:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="native-histograms">Native Histograms<a href="#native-histograms" name="native-histograms"></a>
</h2>

<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>

<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes<a href="#breaking-changes" name="breaking-changes"></a>
</h2>

<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>

<p>Please read the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>



<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>
<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>
<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png" alt="Memory bytes"></p>

<p><img src="https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png" alt="CPU seconds"></p>

<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366">prombench macrobenchmark</a> 
that uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>



<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and… 
hopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>

<ul>
<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong>
</li>
<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>
<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>
<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>
<li>More optimizations!</li>
<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>
</ul>



<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href="https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus">official binaries</a> and <a href="https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags">container images</a>.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.
Please note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>

<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Nov.  27, 2024, 11:19 a.m.</p><p>The ruling comes after a judge dismissed similar claims filed by Raw Story and AlterNet earlier this month.</p><div id="content_div-233168">


<p>Last week, a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.616536/gov.uscourts.nysd.616536.122.0.pdf">New York federal judge ruled</a> a key copyright violation claim by The Intercept against OpenAI would move ahead in court. The ruling is the latest in a series of major legal decisions involving the AI developer this month, after OpenAI sought to dismiss lawsuits from several digital news publishers.</p>
<p>Judge Jed Rakoff said he’d hear the claim that OpenAI <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202#:~:text=(b)Removal,management%20information%2C">removed authorship information</a> when it allegedly fed The Intercept’s articles into the training data sets it used to build ChatGPT. Doing so could be a violation of the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>, a 1998 law that, among other protections, makes it illegal to remove the author name, usage terms, or title from a digital work.</p>
<p>The judge dismissed The Intercept’s claim that OpenAI had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202#:~:text=(3)distribute%2C%20import%20for%20distribution%2C%20or%20publicly%20perform%20works%2C%20copies%20of%20works%2C%20or%20phonorecords%2C%20knowing%20that%20copyright%20management%20information%20has%20been%20removed%20or%20altered%20without%20authority%20of%20the%20copyright%20owner%20or%20the%20law%2C">knowingly distributed copies</a> of its articles after removing the DMCA-protected information. The judge also dismissed all The Intercept’s claims against Microsoft, which has a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/microsoft-cfo-says-openai-investment-will-cut-into-profit-this-quarter.html">multibillion-dollar</a> investment in OpenAI and was named in the initial filing. An opinion from the judge, laying out his reasoning for the dismissals, will be published in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“The decision allows for a DMCA claim on behalf of digital publishers who do not have copyright registrations to proceed against OpenAI,” said <a href="https://www.loevy.com/attorneys/matt-topic/">Matt Topic</a>, a partner at Loevy &amp; Loevy, who is representing The Intercept. “We’re obviously disappointed to lose the claims against Microsoft, but the core claim is the DMCA claim against OpenAI, and we’re very happy to see that that will be going forward.”</p>
<p>“Our models are trained on publicly available data, grounded in fair use and related principles that we view as fair for creators,” OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/03/the-intercept-charts-a-new-legal-strategy-for-digital-publishers-suing-openai/">I reported</a> that The Intercept’s case was carving out a new legal strategy for digital news publishers to sue OpenAI.</p>
<p>The New York Times’ lawsuit against OpenAI, and similar suits filed by <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/04/30/daily-news-sues-microsoft-open-ai-artifcial-intelligence-federal-court/">The New York Daily News</a> and <a href="https://revealnews.org/press/cir-sues-openai/">Mother Jones</a>, lead with claims of copyright infringement. Infringement suits require that relevant works were first registered with the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO). But most digital news publishers don’t have their article archives registered. For many, The Intercept included, filing all of their published work on the internet with the USCO is too costly or burdensome.</p>
<p>Until this summer, the government body required each individual website article page be filed and charged separately. In August, though, the USCO <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-07-22/pdf/2024-15880.pdf">added a rule</a> that allows “news websites” to file articles in bulk. Among other reasons, the decision cited concerns about unchecked infringement of online news content and a hope for copyright registrations to stay “adaptive to technological changes.” But for most digital news publishers seeking legal action against OpenAI, particularly for its use of their work to train ChatGPT, the new rule came too late.</p>
<p>For now, The Intercept case is the only litigation by a news publisher, that is not tied to copyright infringement, to move past the motion-to-dismiss stage.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the DMCA-focused legal strategy <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opena-alternet-raw-story-copyright-lawsuit-dmca-standing/">took a major hit</a> when another New York federal judge dismissed all DMCA claims against OpenAI filed by Raw Story and AlterNet. The progressive digital news sites are jointly represented by Loevy &amp; Loevy.</p>
<p>“Let us be clear about what is really at stake here. The alleged injury for which Plaintiffs truly seek redress is not the exclusion of [content management information] from Defendants’ training sets, but rather Defendants’ use of Plaintiffs’ articles to develop ChatGPT without compensation,” wrote Judge Colleen MacMahon <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/RawStoryMediaIncetalvOpenAIIncetalDocketNo124cv01514SDNYFeb282024/4?doc_id=X18AGVQ2BEU9DCBFDQULD4SNTVV">in that decision</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, the judge said she would consider an amended complaint against OpenAI that took into account her concerns. A proposed amended complaint by Raw Story and AlterNet was filed by Loevy &amp; Loevy last week, just before The Intercept ruling was announced.</p>
<p>“When they populated their training sets with works of journalism, Defendants had a choice: they could train ChatGPT using works of journalism with the copyright management information protected by the DMCA intact, or they could strip it away. Defendants chose the latter,” reads the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68290709/119/1/raw-story-media-inc-v-openai-inc/">proposed amended complaint</a>. “In the process, [OpenAI] trained ChatGPT not to acknowledge or respect copyright, not to notify ChatGPT users when the responses they received were protected by journalists’ copyrights, and not to provide attribution when using the works of human journalists.”</p>
<p>Like The Intercept, Raw Story and AlterNet are asking for $2,500 in damages for each instance that OpenAI allegedly removed DMCA-protected information in its training data sets. If damages are calculated based on each individual article allegedly used to train ChatGPT, it could quickly balloon to tens of thousands of violations.</p>
<p>“The proposed amended complaint would match up and probably even go beyond the allegations that survived in The Intercept case,” said Topic. “Different judges could come out differently on the same question, but we feel optimistic that we will have the opportunity to proceed with an amended claim.”</p>
<p>It is unclear if the Intercept ruling will embolden other publications to consider DMCA litigation; few publications have followed in their footsteps so far. As time goes on, there is concern that new suits against OpenAI would be vulnerable to statute of limitations restrictions, particularly if news publishers want to cite the training data sets underlying ChatGPT. But the ruling is one signal that Loevy &amp; Loevy is narrowing in on a specific DMCA claim that can actually stand up in court.</p>
<p>“We do think that the claim that has survived for The Intercept is a claim that most digital publishers would also be able to bring,” said Topic.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dontfuckwithscroll.com">https://dontfuckwithscroll.com</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42273505">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Momentum (aka. smooth or interia) scrolling plugins (example <a href="https://dontfuckwithscroll.com/smooth.html">here</a>), while marketed as enhancements, are a plague upon the internet. They disrupt the natural, efficient, and predictable web browsing experience in countless ways, by they often degrading usability, accessibility, and performance. Here are ten reasons why they ruin the web for everyone.</p><div>
    <li>
      <h2>Violates User Expectations</h2>
      <p>Users know how scrolling works. It's been the same since the dawn of the web: you scroll, content moves. Momentum scrolling plugins hijack this fundamental behavior. Instead of instant and predictable movement, users get some bizarrely animated experience that feels more like playing a bad video game. Muscle memory? Tossed out the window. It's like giving people a steering wheel in a car and making it turn the opposite direction—just for kicks.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This disrupts muscle memory and established habits, which users rely on for efficient navigation. The experience feels artificial and clunky, making users feel like they're fighting against the page instead of interacting with it naturally.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Causes Motion Sickness</h2>
      <p>Not everyone wants a theme-park ride when reading an article. Momentum scrolling plugins introduce floaty, swoopy animations that feel like watching a shaky cam on repeat. Users prone to motion sickness or vertigo (and there are more than you think) can't handle these unnecessary flourishes. What's worse, many sites don't even offer an option to turn it off, leaving people stuck feeling queasy just trying to read your blog post.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users prone to motion sickness or vertigo may find the website literally nauseating to use. Is your content so unimportant that you'd rather users leave than scroll down? Probably not.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Reduces Accessibility for Disabled Users</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility is a right, not an optional feature. Momentum scrolling plugins laugh in the face of inclusivity. They disrupt assistive technologies like screen readers and keyboard navigation by introducing timing delays. For users with disabilities, such as motor impairments or visual limitations, these delays can render a site unusable. A feature that excludes millions of users isn't a feature—it's a flaw.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users with disabilities may struggle to interact with the site. Do you really want to alienate an entire demographic just to make scrolling look a little fancier? Accessibility isn't optional—it's a baseline requirement.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Inconsistent Performance Across Devices</h2>
      <p>Momentum scrolling plugins don't care if you're on a state-of-the-art gaming rig or a five-year-old budget phone. They load JavaScript that can lag, stutter, or outright break on older or lower-end devices. Why make your website cater only to people with perfect hardware? The web is supposed to work for everyone, not just the ones who can afford shiny new gadgets every year.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Instead of feeling "Momentum," the page feels broken on weaker devices. Great job—now you've ensured your site only works properly for people with high-end tech. Good UX means working for everyone, not just the rich.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Impairs Usability for Power Users</h2>
      <p>Power users exist. They're the ones who zoom through documentation, rapidly scroll through pages, and want precision. Momentum scrolling spits in their faces. It slows down their workflow by forcing them to endure molasses-like animations. They're not here for your slow, cutesy effects—they're here to get things done. Stop standing in their way. It's like making a racecar driver go 20 mph because it "looks prettier."</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> These users will hate your site. And let's be clear, power users are often the ones most likely to recommend or share content. Do you really want to alienate your most enthusiastic audience?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Increases Page Load Times</h2>
      <p>Momentum scrolling plugins add bloated JavaScript libraries, extra dependencies, and more CPU cycles to render animations. Guess what? That comes at a cost.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Slower load times annoy everyone. On mobile networks, especially in areas with poor connectivity, your fancy scrolling makes the page slower and less accessible. Congrats, you've sacrificed performance for aesthetics.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Breaks Native Browser Features</h2>
      <p>Modern browsers already include Momentum scrolling settings for users who want them. Adding third-party plugins often overrides or conflicts with these native features, breaking custom scroll gestures or momentum scrolling.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Your site ends up less functional than the browser it's displayed in. Users who expect their preferences to work (e.g., system-wide reduced motion settings) will feel betrayed. You just took something that worked and made it worse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Makes Scroll Position Unclear</h2>
      <p>Momentum scrolling animations introduce a delay between action and result, making it hard to tell exactly where you are on the page. Combine this with long pages, and users are left feeling lost.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users now spend extra time figuring out their position. Nobody likes a website that feels like a guessing game. Quick navigation becomes a chore instead of a feature. Great job, you just turned scrolling into a problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Adds Maintenance Overhead</h2>
      <p>Momentum scrolling plugins aren't "set it and forget it." They need regular updates to stay compatible with modern browsers, operating systems, and devices. And every update risks introducing new bugs.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> You've now created extra work for your development team, all for a feature nobody really asked for. That's time and money that could've been spent making your site faster, more secure, or better optimized. But sure, keep chasing that "Momentum" scroll.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Disrespects the User's Control</h2>
      <p>Users come to your website for content, not for an overly choreographed scrolling experience. Overriding default scrolling assumes your vision of scrolling is better than the user's preferences or needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> By enforcing Momentum scrolling, you're essentially telling users: "We know better than you." That arrogance doesn't go unnoticed. Respect your users' autonomy—don't dictate how they interact with your site.</p>
    </li>
  </div><p>Momentum scrolling plugins are the web equivalent of turning a functional bike into a unicycle because it "looks cool." It adds unnecessary complexity, degrades usability, and frustrates users. Instead of reinventing scrolling, stick to what works: native, predictable, fast scrolling behavior.</p><p>Don't make scrolling a thing. Just let people scroll.</p><p>And if you're still not convinced, go to the <a href="https://dontfuckwithscroll.com/smooth.html">smooth version</a> and try to tell me it's better.</p></div>]]></description>

<p>
The long-awaited release of the <a href="https://gimp.org/">GNU Image
Manipulation Program</a> (GIMP)&nbsp;3.0 is on the way, marking the first
major update since version&nbsp;2.10 <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/04/27/gimp-2-10-0-released/">was
released</a> in April&nbsp;2018. It now features a <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/">GTK&nbsp;3</a> user interface and GIMP&nbsp;3.0
introduces significant changes to the core platform and plugins. This
release also brings performance and usability improvements, as well as more
compatibility with Wayland and complex input sources.
</p>

<h4>Modernized interface</h4>

<p>
GIMP&nbsp;3.0 is the first release <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2023/07/09/gimp-2-99-16-released/#gtk3-port-officially-done">to
use GTK&nbsp;3</a>, a more modern foundation than the GTK&nbsp;2 base of
prior releases. <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/">GTK&nbsp;4</a> has
been available for a few years now, and is <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/6440">on the project's
radar</a>, but the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/12/25/gimp-2-99-4-released/#whats-next">plan</a>
was always to finish the GTK&nbsp;3 work first.
Moving to GTK&nbsp;3 brings initial Wayland compatibility
and HiDPI scaling. In addition, this allows for GIMP users to take
advantage of multi-touch input, bringing pinch-to-zoom gestures to the
program, and offering a better experience when working with complex
peripherals, such as advanced drawing tablets. These features were not
previously possible due to the limitations of GTK&nbsp;2.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/999429/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/gimp-welcome-sm.png" alt="[Welcome screen]" title="Welcome screen" width="300" height="316">
</a></p><p>
A secondary result of the transition to GTK&nbsp;3 is a refreshed user
interface (UI), now with support for CSS themes included. In this release,
four themes are available by default, including light, dark, and gray
themes, along with a high-contrast theme for users with visual
impairments. Additionally, this release has transitioned to using <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/patterns/containers/header-bars.html">GTK's
header bar</a> component, typically used to combine an application's
toolbar and title bar into one unit. To maintain familiarity with previous
releases, however, GIMP&nbsp;3.0 still supports the traditional menu interface.
</p>

<p>
When GIMP 3.0 is launched, users will be greeted with a
new welcome screen, seen on the right. This dialog presents various useful
links for the GIMP project, such as tutorials, documentation, and donation
options. It also provides users with quick functions for setting up GIMP as
needed before starting their work. This includes the option to choose GTK
and icon themes, and for placing the menu in the title bar, saving vertical
space. In the "Create" tab of the dialog, users can create a new image,
select from their recent work, or open an existing image from the
filesystem.  The welcome screen can be disabled if desired.
</p>

<h4>Better workflow, performance, and color management</h4>

<p>
A major focus of this release is greater integration with the <a href="https://www.gegl.org/">Generic Graphics Library</a> (GEGL), first
introduced in 2000 for the purpose of improving GIMP's image-processing
capabilities through a <a href="https://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~powerk/GeneralGraphicsNotes/scenegraph/scenegraph.htm">scene-graph-based</a>
architecture. As part of this effort, there have been numerous
optimizations to GIMP's core and to its standard plugins. In tandem with
memory management and multi-threading improvements, these changes should
bring significant speed boosts when applying filters and effects, even on
larger images.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
GEGL allows image-processing operations to be chained together in such a
way that the original image data is preserved, along with a record of every
edit. This is referred to as non-destructive editing, and GIMP&nbsp;3.0 is
the first stable release of the project to make this workflow available,
though there is still more work to be done. Users can apply filters and effects to any layer without altering the original image. As a result, effect parameters can be changed even after they've been applied. This change removes the need to perform an undo any time a filter or effect does not have the desired result. Filters, and any plugins that use GEGL operations, now offer real-time previews.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/999599/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/gimp-split-preview-sm.png" alt="[Split preview]" title="Split preview" width="300" height="196">
</a></p><p>
GIMP&nbsp;3.0 continues efforts to improve color management under the
initiative referred to as "<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/20264674">space invasion</a>", and
delivers significant <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/02/21/gimp-2-99-18-released/#color-space-invasion">color-correctness
results</a>. This will improve the consistency of color reproduction across different devices and workflows. The foundation of these improvements is the <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl library</a>, responsible for handling pixel-format conversions and color-space management. Color profiles are now automatically managed when opening files with an included color profile. In the 2.10.x series, manual intervention was required when loading these files.
</p>

<p>
GIMP&nbsp;3.0 supports palettes outside of the "Standard Red Green Blue"
(<a href="https://techterms.com/definition/srgb">sRGB</a>) range, such as
"Cyan Magenta Yellow Key" (<a href="https://techterms.com/definition/cmyk">CMYK</a>) and (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a>). This
expanded color support, especially for CMYK, is essential to those who work
with print and desktop publishing. However, GIMP continues to use sRGB,
grayscale, and indexed colors for storing color information internally for
now. Conversion to other color spaces is done on output, where necessary.
</p>

<p>
Version&nbsp;3.0 delivers CMYK output for some file formats, specifically
JPEG, TIFF, and Photoshop (PSD). When working with these color formats, users often
need to use soft-proofing, a digital preview of how colors will look when
printed, helping ensure color accuracy in the final output. GIMP's&nbsp;3.0
soft-proofing workflow has been improved, and it saves this information <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/08/27/gimp-2-99-12-released/#simulation-data-is-now-image-data">in
its XCF format</a>, preserving settings between sessions.
</p>

<h4>Layers and file-format improvements</h4>

<p>
The layer workflow has been upgraded in GIMP&nbsp;3.0, with new features
that bring greater parity with other advanced photo editors such as Adobe
Photoshop and Affinity Photo. Layer operations can now be applied in bulk,
and multiple layers can be selected and grouped. Layers can even be moved,
reordered, duplicated, merged, and deleted <i>en masse</i>, whether or not they
are contiguous within the layer dialog. Each layer now displays a distinct
"Fx" icon to represent when filters and effects are in use. Filters and
effects can be managed from a popover, which is opened up by clicking on
this icon.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/999430/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/gimp-layers-sm.png" alt="[Layers dialog]" title="Layers dialog" width="300" height="208">
</a></p><p>
The developers intend to further improve the layer-effects workflow with tighter integration of these features and a <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/specifications/layer-effects-ui/">better UI</a>. In future releases, GIMP's non-destructive functionality will be extended to <a href="https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Layer_Masks/">layer masks</a>, and <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.4/en/glossary.html#glossary-c:~:text=C-,Channels,-A%20Channel%20is">layer channels</a> as well. For users who wish to use a destructive workflow (where filters are applied to the original image data), there is a "Merge Filter" option available in the filter dialog.
</p>

<p>
Another new feature in GIMP&nbsp;3.0's layer workflow is <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/02/21/gimp-2-99-18-released/#auto-expanding-layers">auto-expanding
layers</a>. Layers may need to extend outside of the canvas in order to
preserve parts of an image that need to later be moved or transformed, or
within animations, where part of the animation needs to be made invisible
temporarily. An auto-expanding layer will extend beyond its borders when
painting outside of the canvas, though the canvas itself will retain its
size. To enable this feature, users will need to check the  "Expand Layers"
option on any brush tool. Layer masks can be set to expand with the layer;
the "Align And Distribute" tool has been completely reworked to recognize the layer's contents and not just its boundaries.
Improvements to guides, snapping, and the text editor also help make
GIMP's layer workflows more appealing in a way that will be familiar to
users of other tools in this space.
</p>

<p>
This update brings improved support for many
image formats. PSD images now preserve their layer order on import, and
Paintshop Pro images (PSP) preserve several features, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile">International Color
Consortium (ICC) profiles</a>, <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.4/en/gimp-concepts-image-grid.html">grids,
and guides</a>. In a crucial bug fix for working with GIFs, GIMP&nbsp;3.0
detects whether these files contain animations, and correctly saves
animated GIFs when overwriting existing files.
</p>

<p>
New <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/02/21/gimp-2-99-18-released/#new-image-format-supports-farbfeld-esm-software-pix-hej2">image formats</a> have been added, with import and export supported for each format. The highly versatile <a href="https://www.selapa.net/swatchbooker/">SwatchBooker</a> palette format, SBZ, <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/02/21/gimp-2-99-18-released/#new-palette-format-support-swatchbooker">is now supported</a>, bringing parity with <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> and <a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a>. Unlike most other palette formats, SBZ files can save complex details such as layouts, textures, gradients, named colors, color-space information, and even multiple palettes in a single file. For processing raw images (formats that preserve unprocessed image data), GIMP has long relied on external applications such as <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a> and <a href="https://www.rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a>. However, recent changes in darktable's API <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/15968">broke this integration</a>, causing GIMP to be unable to detect and recognize if it was installed. To rectify this issue, dedicated darktable integration is <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/10/05/development-update/#darktable-integration">now available</a> thanks to a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/10572">collaborative effort</a> between the two projects.
</p>

<p>
This update introduces a new extension system and file format, GEX,
allowing for easier distribution of plugins, themes, brushes, and other
means of extending and supplementing the core application. This extension
system even allows for multiple features, such as plugins, brushes, and
themes, to be packaged and managed simultaneously. For example, a project
such as <a href="https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP">PhotoGIMP</a> could
use this system to completely transform GIMP's standard functionality with
a single package.
</p>

<p>
In addition, an <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/08/19/gimp-2-10-6-released/#gimp-extensions">extension manager</a> has been developed and is available in this update. It's not immediately exposed to users, however, because the backend infrastructure for distributing extensions is still under development. To access it, users will need to use GIMP's command search, which can be found in the menu under "Help&gt;Search and Run a Command". Once extension support has matured, it will allow managing other features on the fly.
</p>

<h4>Future developments</h4>

<p>
Apart from the myriad user-visible features, several under-the-hood changes
will either land in this release or <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap/#post-gimp-300">come to
fruition</a> in near future releases. GIMP&nbsp;3.0 contains the
infrastructure for <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap/#non-destructive-layer-types">non-destructive
layer types</a> (such as <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/merge_requests/773">vector
layers</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/merge_requests/823">link
layers</a>), <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap/#animation-and-multi-page-support">animations</a>
in the core application, multi-page files, and native support for working
in color spaces outside of the RGB range.
</p>

<p>
The changes in  GIMP&nbsp;3.0 have necessitated an <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/resource/script-fu/overview-v3/">API
break</a> so it is no longer compatible with plugins from older
releases. To lessen the impact, the developers have decided <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/06/gimp-2-99-2-released">to
couple</a> this shift with the incompatible changes of switching to
GTK&nbsp;3. Because of this, the development of the <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/roadmap/#gimp-210x-stable-branch-roadmap">2.10.x
branch</a> has continued, with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/05/05/gimp-2-10-38-released/#backports-of-other-gtk3-features">some
features</a> being backported from GIMP&nbsp;3.0 during this development
cycle. Future releases within the 2.10.x branch are still possible, but
unlikely, with the foundation of the 3.x series reaching maturity. Do note,
however, that most of GIMP's existing plugins will need to be updated to
support the new API, which is expected to provide developers <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/02/25/gimp-2-99-10-released/#improved-api-for-plug-ins">with the benefit</a> of increased functionality and improved performance.
</p>

<p>
These are just some of the changes coming to GIMP in
version&nbsp;3.0. Exactly when GIMP&nbsp;3.0 will be released remains to be
seen, but users interested in trying the new features before release can <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/">download development
builds</a>; updates are <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/">regularly
posted</a> on the GIMP web site. The first release candidate has <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/11/06/gimp-3-0-RC1-released/">already
landed</a> on November&nbsp;6, following the project <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/gimps-master-branch-string-freeze/22895">reaching
string freeze</a> on the main branch. So long as there are no major bugs or
regressions, the final release will be built from the release candidate. However, additional
candidates may be necessary if any major problems are found. The
developers have <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/11/06/gimp-3-0-RC1-released/#future-changes-to-release-process">already
announced</a> that subsequent releases should land faster, with smaller,
feature-focused releases providing more stability. Overall, GIMP&nbsp;3.0
represents a big step forward for the free photo and graphics editor, and sets the stage for even greater improvements to come.

<article>





<p>I recently responded to someone on Mastodon who asked about producing decent-looking PDFs from markdown. I replied eagerly with “OMG Typst!” and linked to my earlier blogpost about developing an <a href="https://imaginarytext.ca/posts/2024/more-typst">entire book layout template for Pandoc and Typst</a>. The response I then received was this was “far beyond” what they need – and on reflection I had to admit that my blog post was a bit, well, <em>niche</em>.</p>
<p>I recalled that a decade ago, when Pandoc was new (or at least I was new to Pandoc), I produced a set of tutorials for producing high-quality EPUBs from Pandoc, and that these were quite well received. These days I find EPUB pretty uninteresting,<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> but I’m still using Pandoc for a variety of purposes, and especially using it to drive PDF (that is, “print”) production via Typst. Typst emerged as an output option for Pandoc sometime last year and since then has gotten even smarter and smoother.</p>
<p>So here’s an attempt at a basic tutorial for using Typst with Pandoc to produce beautiful – and easily customizable – PDFs and indeed printed pages.</p>
<p>Now… you know how when you google a recipe online, and you get to a food blog, and you have to scroll through 37 screens of narrative and photographs before they finally give you the recipe? Let’s cut to the chase: here’s the recipe. Now you can read the rest of this post to learn what it means.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imaginarytext.ca/posts/2024/img/simplePandocTypst.template">Download simplePandocTypst.template</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p><strong>Typst</strong> is a new (since 2023) open-source tool for typesetting and page layout. It was designed to replace LaTeX, which has been the standard way of producing scientific publications <em>for decades</em> (in the niche where InDesign and Desktop Publishing apps fall down because of complex equation formatting). LaTeX has been used – and more significantly, <em>learned</em> – by generations of grad students in the hard sciences, as a way of formatting theses, articles, reports, and so on. But where LaTeX is weird, old, and arcane, Typst was designed as a modern, streamlined tool to produce excellent typography through templated pages.</p>
<p>Now, <em><a href="https://typst.app/">Typst.app</a></em> is an interactive website which invites you to compose Typst documents and see the typeset results on the fly. This is presumably aimed at those chemistry and math grad students who would otherwise write LaTeX code, often in an interactive web interface just like this. But Typst is <em>also</em>, significantly, a <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst">downloadable piece of open-source software</a>. Technically, what you’re downloading is the ‘typst compiler’ – you feed it a text file written in Typst sourcecode (specifying document properties, formatting, and so on), and it outputs a PDF file to spec.</p>
<p>That’s all very well but I’d just as soon not have to learn to write Typst source code at all (as I don’t deal with complex mathematical equations in my life). This is where Pandoc comes in.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></strong>, which bills itself as a “universal document converter” is an open-source tool that will take just about any structured text format as input, and produce just about any other structured text format as output. But in practice, what it does exceptionally well is producing various outputs from <em><strong>markdown</strong></em> formatted text files. Which is to say <em>minimally formatted</em> text files, since the point of markdown is to be the simplest possible document formatting system. This is markdown’s great virtue: the formatting information is there, and is explicit and unambiguous, but it doesn’t get in the way of you seeing the text itself.</p>
<h3>Using Pandoc with Typst</h3>
<p>Now, when I say that Typst is an available output for Pandoc, I mean that we can pass a markdown-formatted text file to Pandoc, and it will convert it to Typst code, which we can then give to Typst to make a PDF. Actually, it’s easier than that, because Pandoc will both convert to Typst code <em>and</em> ask Typst to render that as a PDF in one step.</p>
<pre><code>pandoc mymarkdownfile.txt --pdf-engine=typst -o myPDF.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>You can try that, and you’ll get a nice-looking PDF. Pandoc uses a default <em>template</em> for Typst that defines page size, margins, and some basic typography. Typst right out of the box already does a lot of the work – hyphenation and justification and page numbering and so on. But we can have some fine-tuned control over that by tweaking the template that Pandoc uses. That said, Pandoc’s default Typst-formatted PDF may be good enough for basic use.</p>
<h2>Basic document metadata</h2>
<p>Typst expects to see some basic metadata about the document you’re producing: the title, the author, and the date, at minimum (though more is possible). In a markdown document, this is typically written as a metadata block at the top of the file like so:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "Using Pandoc and Typst to produce PDFs"
author: JMax
date: 2024-07-10
---
</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc recognizes this, and so Typst will, by default, format them in a centered header, as if it were an ACM-style journal article or conference paper. You don’t <em>have to</em> include those elements, but if you do, Typst will style them as frontmatter in your PDF.</p>
<p>We can change how it treats those items by tweaking the template, just as we can change pretty much anything else: page size, orientation, columns, margins, typography, and so on.</p>
<h3>Customizing the template</h3>
<p>Pandoc keeps a hidden store of all the default templates it uses for different outputs, and you can ask Pandoc to show you its default template for any given format. We can ask for the Typst default template like so:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc -D typst
</code></pre>
<p>You <em>could</em> save that into a file, and modify it as you like, and you’d have a new ‘custom’ template you can use. You can specify your own template instead of the default one by telling Pandoc:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc inputfile.txt --pdf-engine=typst --template=myTypst.template -o output.pdf
</code></pre>
<h2>A Starter Custom Template</h2>
<p>But here I’m going to short-circuit things, and offer you a starter kit for a custom template. This is one that I’ve developed, bit by bit, over the past few months. It’s a simpler version of the book-layout template I blogged about earlier, but the bones are the same.</p>
<p>You can think of Typst templates as the equivalent of CSS stylesheets: they define the specs for all the various things in your document. Typst templates are more complicated than CSS, but that’s because there’s a lot more going on here: for instance, you could tell it to start page numbering only after the third right-hand page. There is actually a ton of programmable stuff that you could put into these templates; the one I’m offering here is pretty straightforward so you can go in and muck with it as you like.</p>
<p>For instance, I’ve set up the basic font as Times New Roman, because it’s available on almost every computer; you can change this to any font you have, though. I’ve set the default paper size to US Letter, but if you’re in Europe, you can set this to A4 or whatever you like. My paragraph styling is to indent the first line of all subsequent paragraphs, but I’ve included an optional instruction for flush-left paragraphs with space between them if you prefer that.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>My template tries to cover a lot of formatting bases: images, footnotes, header and footer, code snippets, etc. You should, of course, consult the extensive (if not always crystal-clear) documentation at <a href="https://typst.app/docs/">https://typst.app/docs/</a> for details and more possibilities.</p>

                                        <p>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-children-1abadf5445418c8c14f5f68cf76b38d0">social media ban for children</a></span> under 16 passed the Australian Parliament on Friday in a world-first law.</p><p>The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.</p><p>The Senate passed the bill on Thursday 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-young-children-bf0ca2aedaf61b71fe335421240e94c4">overwhelmingly approved</a></span> the legislation by 102 votes to 13.</p><p>The House on Friday endorsed opposition amendments made in the Senate, making the bill law. </p><p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law supported parents concerned by online harms to their children.</p><p>“Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Albanese told reporters.</p>
    

<p>The platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.</p><p>Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been “rushed.”</p><p>Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law’s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.</p>



<p>“The social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice – the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,” DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The amendments passed on Friday bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.</p><p>Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.</p>
    

<p>While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.</p><p>Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.</p><p>“This policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,” Shoebridge told the Senate.</p><p>Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom.</p><p>Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. “The core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,” Kovacic told the Senate.</p><p>“This is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,” she added.</p><p>Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a “monumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.”</p>
    

<p>“It’s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,” she said.</p><p>Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage. </p><p>“I have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today’s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,” Holdsworth said.</p><p>Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people’s mental health and sense of connection.</p>
    

<p>“The government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,” Stone said.</p><p>The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.</p><p>“Naturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,” Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. “However, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.”</p>
    

<p>Snapchat said it was also concerned by the law and would cooperate with the government regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.</p><p>“While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia,” Snapchat said in a statement.</p><p>Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents’ concerns about their children’s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.</p><p>Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.</p><p>Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.</p><h2>____</h2><p>AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/byd-launches-sodium-ion-grid-scale-bess-product/">https://www.energy-storage.news/byd-launches-sodium-ion-grid-scale-bess-product/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42270610">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>He said it uses the company’s Long Blade Battery, has a ‘CTS super integrated design’, and is the world’s first high-performance sodium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS). He claimed it has ultra high energy density, exceptional safety standards and flexible module design. </p>



<p>The BESS has an energy storage capacity of 2.3MWh and a nominal voltage of 1200V, with a voltage range from 800V-1400V.</p>



<p><em>Energy-Storage.news </em>has asked BYD’s press team for more information and will update this article or follow up in due course. </p>



<p>In response to questions left as comments on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7262096404557250560-TlM4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his post</a>, Wang said, of the advantages of sodium-ion: “The first advantage is its natural abundance, which theoretically results in lower manufacturing costs compared to lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, sodium-ion batteries offer a higher charge/discharge rate, a broader operating temperature range, a longer cycle life, and improved safety.”</p>



<p>Natural abundance of sodium and better fire safety features are the two main reasons many are pinning their hopes on sodium-ion as an alternative to lithium-ion, with the latter’s supply chain shocks of 2021 and 2022 and relatively rare but high-profile fire incidents causing major challenges for the energy storage industry to-date. </p>



<p>Most agree that, thanks to its cheaper materials, sodium-ion cells should also be cheaper than lithium-ion once manufacturing scales up. </p>



<p>Sodium-ion cells are however much less energy dense, as illustrated by BYD’s new product only packing 2.3MWh per 20-foot container, much less than the <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/cost-shipping-energy-density-driven-convergence-to-5mwh-bess-form-factor-cea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5MWh and more than is now standard in the lithium-ion BESS space</a>. That is less of an issue in the BESS segment than for EVs, however, though there are EVs in China being sold with sodium-ion batteries too. </p>



<p>Chinese companies are investing a lot into the sodium-ion technology space, and the world’s largest BESS system using sodium-ion technology is there, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/first-half-world-largest-200mwh-sodium-ion-project-comes-online-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 100MW/200MWh system, half of which came online in summer</a>. One of the technology providers on that project was China-based company called HiNa Battery.</p>



<p>In January, BYD began construction of 30GWh sodium-ion battery plant in Xuzhou City, China. BYD is the largest EV company in the world by sales, and has also expanded into lithium-ion battery cells and BESS production over the years, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/huawei-and-byd-among-global-top-five-system-integrators-of-2022-amidst-china-price-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing to be one of the largest in that space too</a>.</p>



<p>The US is also making a push into sodium-ion technology. The US Department of Energy (DOE) last week (21 November) awarded US$50 million to establish the ‘Low-cost Earth-abundant Na-ion Storage (LENS) Consortium’, which aims to develop high-energy, long-lasting sodium-ion battery technology.</p>



<p>The consortium will be led by Argonne National Laboratory, and will also involve Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.</p>



<p>US-based sodium-ion BESS startup Peak Energy recently raised US$55 million in a Series A led by TDK Ventures, following which the <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/density-cycle-life-now-where-they-need-to-be-sodium-ion-bess-investor-tdk-on-technologys-state-of-play/">TDK partner who led the deal spoke to <em>Energy-Storage.news </em>about the sodium-ion BESS space (Premium access article)</a>. </p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Automatic TLS</strong> native support for let's encrypt.</li>
<li><strong>Drop in replacement for plausible</strong> you can use existing plausible  scripts and just point them to the vince instance (note that vince is lean and only covers features for a single entity self hosting, so it is not our goal to be feature parity with plausible).</li>
<li><strong>Outbounds links tracking</strong></li>
<li><strong>File download tracking</strong></li>
<li><strong>404 page tracking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Custom event tracking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time period comparison</strong></li>
<li><strong>Public dashboards</strong> allow access to the dashoard to anyone(by default all dashboards are private).</li>
<li><strong>Unique shared access</strong> generate unique links to dahboards that can be password protected.</li>
<li><strong>Zero Dependency</strong>: Ships a single binary with everything in it. No runtime dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to operate</strong>: One line commandline flags with env variables is all you need.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited sites</strong>: There is no limit on how many sites you can manage.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited events</strong>: scale according to availbale resources.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy friendly</strong>: No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.</li>
