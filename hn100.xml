<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Containerization</h2><a id="user-content-containerization" aria-label="Permalink: Containerization" href="#containerization"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Containerization package allows applications to use Linux containers.
Containerization is written in <a href="https://www.swift.org/" rel="nofollow">Swift</a> and uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization" rel="nofollow">Virtualization.framework</a> on Apple silicon.</p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization provides APIs to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Manage OCI images.</li>
<li>Interact with remote registries.</li>
<li>Create and populate ext4 file systems.</li>
<li>Interact with the Netlink socket family.</li>
<li>Create an optimized Linux kernel for fast boot times.</li>
<li>Spawn lightweight virtual machines.</li>
<li>Manage the runtime environment of virtual machines.</li>
<li>Spawn and interact with containerized processes.</li>
<li>Use Rosetta 2 for executing x86_64 processes on Apple silicon.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please view the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main">API documentation</a> for information on the Swift packages that Containerization provides.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization executes each Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">Linux kernel configuration</a> and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/vminitd">vminitd</a> is a small init system, which is a subproject within Containerization.
<code>vminitd</code> is spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and provides a GRPC API over vsock.
The API allows the runtime environment to be configured and containerized processes to be launched.
<code>vminitd</code> provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process is ran.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You need an Apple silicon Mac to build and run Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build the Containerization package, your system needs either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>macOS 15 or newer and Xcode 26 Beta</li>
<li>macOS 26 Beta 1 or newer</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Applications built using the package will run on macOS 15 or later, but the following features are not available on macOS 15:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Non-isolated container networking - with macOS 15, containers on the same vmnet network cannot communicate with each other</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example Usage</h2><a id="user-content-example-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Example Usage" href="#example-usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For examples of how to use some of the libraries surface, the cctl executable is a good start. This tools primary job is as a playground to trial out the API. It contains commands that exercise some of the core functionality of the various products, such as:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/ImageCommand.swift">Manipulating OCI images</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/LoginCommand.swift">Logging in to container registries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/RootfsCommand.swift">Creating root filesystem blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/RunCommand.swift">Running simple Linux containers</a></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux kernel</h2><a id="user-content-linux-kernel" aria-label="Permalink: Linux kernel" href="#linux-kernel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A Linux kernel is required for spawning lightweight virtual machines on macOS.
Containerization provides an optimized kernel configuration located in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">kernel</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">This directory includes a containerized build environment to easily compile a kernel for use with Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">The kernel configuration is a minimal set of features to support fast start times and a light weight environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this configuration will work for the majority of workloads we understand that some will need extra features.
To solve this Containerization provides first class APIs to use different kernel configurations and versions on a per container basis.
This enables containers to be developed and validated across different kernel versions.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel/README.md">README</a> in the kernel directory for instruction on how to compile the optimized kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pre-build Kernel</h3><a id="user-content-pre-build-kernel" aria-label="Permalink: Pre-build Kernel" href="#pre-build-kernel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to consume a pre-built kernel it must have <code>VIRTIO</code> drivers compiled into the kernel, not as modules.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers">Kata Containers</a> project provides an optimized kernel for containers with all the required configuration options enabled provided on the <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases/">releases</a> page.</p>
<p dir="auto">A kernel image named <code>vmlinux.container</code> can be found in the <code>/opt/kata/share/kata-containers/</code> directory of the release artifacts.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Status</h2><a id="user-content-project-status" aria-label="Permalink: Project Status" href="#project-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Version 0.1.0 is the first official release of Containerization. Earlier versions have no source stability guarantees.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because the Containerization library is under active development, source stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2). If you don't want potentially source-breaking package updates, you can specify your package dependency using .upToNextMinorVersion(from: "0.1.0") instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">Future minor versions of the package may introduce changes to these rules as needed.</p>

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced new technologies and enhancements to its developer tools to help developers create more beautiful, intelligent, and engaging app experiences across Apple platforms. A beautiful new software design brings more focus to content, and delivers more expressive and delightful experiences across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26,<sup>1</sup> while keeping them all instantly familiar. The Foundation Models framework joins a suite of tools that allow developers to tap into on-device intelligence, and Xcode 26 leverages large language models like ChatGPT, giving them access to Xcode’s Coding Tools and other intelligent features.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These new resources join the extensive and continuously evolving set of technologies Apple offers developers, including over 250,000 APIs that enable developers to integrate their apps with Apple’s hardware and software features. These APIs span a wide range of capabilities, such as machine learning, augmented reality, health and fitness, spatial computing, and high-performance graphics. With each platform release, Apple expands and refines its technologies and tools to assist developers in bringing their ideas to life and delivering rich, responsive, and optimized experiences across Apple platforms.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“Developers play a vital role in shaping the experiences customers love across Apple platforms,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “With access to the on-device Apple Intelligence foundation model and new intelligence features in Xcode 26, we’re empowering developers to build richer, more intuitive apps for users everywhere.”

                 <div>With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are intelligent, available when they’re offline, and that protect their privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The framework has native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code. Guided generation, tool calling, and more are all built into the framework, making it easier than ever to implement generative capabilities right into an existing app. For example, Automattic is using the framework in its Day One journaling app to bring users privacy-centric intelligence features.

                 <div>“At Etsy, our job is to seamlessly connect shoppers with creative entrepreneurs around the world who offer extraordinary items — many of which are hard to describe. The ability to meet shoppers right on their iPhone with visual intelligence is a meaningful unlock, and makes it easier than ever for buyers to quickly discover exactly what they’re looking for while directly supporting small businesses,” said Etsy CTO Rafe Colburn.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To ensure kids have enjoyable, enriching, and appropriate in-app experiences, developers can utilize a range of tools — including parental controls and the Sensitive Content Analysis framework — to enhance child safety and ensure privacy. Building on these existing tools, developers can use the new Declared Age Range API to deliver age-appropriate content based on a user’s age range. When developers implement this API, parents can allow their children to share their age range without disclosing a birthdate or other sensitive information, enabling developers to tailor experiences accordingly. The feature is built around privacy: Age range data is shared only if parents choose to allow it, and they can disable sharing at any time.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS started as a toy project to practice systems programming, and over the years morphed into a full-blown OS and a playground to explore new ideas. It aims to re-examine principles of OS design, and see how much is really needed today to make a functional OS, and where shortcuts can be taken using modern tools. The design has no pretention to be superior to anything else, rather it is an experiment in striving for simplicity of the codebase (but not necessarily a lightweight binary or minimal dependencies).</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, here are usual cornerstones of OS design that Munal OS does <strong>NOT</strong> implement:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bootloader</li>
<li>Page mapping</li>
<li>Virtual address space</li>
<li>Interrupts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EFI binary</h3><a id="user-content-efi-binary" aria-label="Permalink: EFI binary" href="#efi-binary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has no bootloader; instead, the entire OS is compiled into a single EFI binary that embeds the kernel, the WASM engine and all the applications. The UEFI boot services are exited almost immediately and no UEFI services are used except for the system clock.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Address space</h3><a id="user-content-address-space" aria-label="Permalink: Address space" href="#address-space"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">UEFI leaves the address space as identity-mapped and Munal OS does not remap it. In fact the page tables are not touched at all, because the OS does not make use of virtual address mechanisms. The entire OS technically runs within a single memory space, but something akin to the userspace/kernelspace distinction is provided by WASM sandboxing (see below), preventing arbitrary access to kernel memory by user applications.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drivers</h3><a id="user-content-drivers" aria-label="Permalink: Drivers" href="#drivers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS does not rely on PS/2 inputs or VGA/UEFI GOP framebuffers for display. Instead, it implements a PCI driver which is used to communicate with QEMU via the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html" rel="nofollow">VirtIO 1.1 specification</a>. A generic virtqueue system serves as the basis for 4 different VirtIO drivers: keyboard, mouse, network and GPU. Notably, the drivers are entirely polling-based and do not rely on CPU interrupts at all (in fact Munal OS does not implement any).</p>
<p dir="auto">The reliance on VirtIO means Munal OS does not support running on real hardware yet; more work would be needed, either to use BIOS/UEFI-provided methods (such as PS/2, VGA, GOP) or to implement full-blown GPU and USB drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Event loop</h3><a id="user-content-event-loop" aria-label="Permalink: Event loop" href="#event-loop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For simplicity, Munal OS does not implement multi-core support or even interrupts, and everything happens linearly within one single, global event loop. Every iteration of the loop polls the network and input drivers, draws the desktop interface, runs one step of each active WASM application, and flushes the GPU framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">One advantage of this approach is that it is trivial to inspect the performance of each OS component and user application, simply by measuring how much of the total frametime they eat. For now, the loop should run at well over 60 FPS on a modern CPU with all applications open.</p>
<p dir="auto">The downside of course is that each step of the loop is not allowed to hold the CPU for arbitrary amounts of time, and must explicitly yield for long-running tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Applications</h3><a id="user-content-applications" aria-label="Permalink: Applications" href="#applications"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS embeds the <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">wasmi</a> WASM engine for running WASM applications. This achieves full sandboxing of user applications and memory separation from the kernel without the use of a virtual address space (or, moving the virtual address space to a VM, rather). A "system call" API is provided by the kernel so that apps can interact with the system. In particular, apps can query mouse/keyboard events, open/use TCP sockets, and send output framebuffers which are then read by the OS and composited onto the desktop. This lets apps use any drawing library they want (at the cost of a framebuffer copy).</p>
<p dir="auto">All showcased applications are written in Rust, but there would be nothing preventing apps to be made in other languages, as long as it can compile to WASM.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of its custom "system call" API, Munal OS does not aim for compatibility with the WASI standards. However, the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/README.md">WASI Preview1</a> standard is partially supported, mostly so that applications can be compiled without using <code>#![no_std]</code> (which is often a blocker for pulling in external dependencies). Only the bare minimum is implemented, and WASI functions that have no analog in Munal OS (e.g <code>path_rename()</code>) are simply stubbed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS relies on cooperative scheduling, meaning that applications are given control of the CPU every iteration of the global event loop, and must explicitly relinquish it. This is less an intentional design decision and more a consequence of using Wasmi as the WASM engine, which does not support interrupting and resuming functions mid-excution. However Wasmi does support fuel limiting, and so in theory it would be possible to terminate misbehaving apps that hold the CPU for too long (though that's not implemented yet).</p>
<p dir="auto">Each app has a dedicated log stream (akin to stdout in the UNIX world) which can be inspected from the desktop in a dedicated "audit" view. This view also shows how much of the system resources (frametime, memory, resources) are consumed by this app.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UI Library</h3><a id="user-content-ui-library" aria-label="Permalink: UI Library" href="#ui-library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has its own UI toolkit (plainly named Uitk) which is used throughout the desktop UI. It is also used by WASM applications, though that's just for convenience and consistency with the desktop styling; it is just a shared library and applications could in theory swap for any other library they wish, as long as it can render to a generic framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">Uitk is an immediate mode toolkit which supports some basic widgets: buttons, progress bars, text editing, scrollable canvas...a generic triangle rasterizer is also provided (which is used to draw the radial pie menu and the 3D cube demo),</p>
<p dir="auto">Styling is supported via a global stylesheet which can be shared between OS and apps, and can be overriden for individual UI elements.</p>
<p dir="auto">A basic caching system is implemented to avoid unnecessary redraws: for example, generic scrollable canvases (like the web browser) are split into "tiles" tracked with a unique content ID. A system based on Rust's mutability rules automatically keeps track of changes to the content, and so tiles are only redrawn if the content ID changes, and pulled from a cache otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and running</h2><a id="user-content-building-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Building and running" href="#building-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project compiles as of Rust Nightly 2025-06-01 and runs as of QEMU 10.0.0.</p>
<p dir="auto">First add the required rustup components:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"><pre><code>rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then execute this script to build and run:</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/munal-os/blob/master/run.sh">run.sh</a> script is very straightforward, it simply builds the WASM apps one by one, then builds the kernel, then runs QEMU.</p>
<p dir="auto">The script assumes that the QEMU command is named <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>, so if that's not the case on your system just replace it with the proper name.</p>

It’s crafted with a new material called Liquid Glass. This translucent material reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more. For the very first time, the new design extends across platforms — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26<sup>1</sup> — to establish even more harmony while maintaining the distinct qualities that make each unique.

Meticulously crafted by rethinking the fundamental elements that make up our software, the new design features an entirely new material called Liquid Glass. It combines the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve, as it transforms depending on your content or context. It lays the foundation for new experiences in the future and, ultimately, it makes even the simplest of interactions more fun and magical.”

                 <h2><strong>Introducing Liquid Glass: A New and Expressive Material</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Inspired by the depth and dimensionality of visionOS, the new design takes advantage of Apple’s powerful advances in hardware, silicon, and graphics technologies. The new material, Liquid Glass, is translucent and behaves like glass in the real world. Its color is informed by surrounding content and intelligently adapts between light and dark environments. Born out of a close collaboration between the design and engineering teams, Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and dynamically reacts to movement with specular highlights. This creates a lively experience that makes using iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV even more delightful.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>This gorgeous new material extends from the smallest elements users interact with every day — like buttons, switches, sliders, text, and media controls — to larger elements, including tab bars and sidebars for navigating apps. It also shines in system experiences, such as the Lock Screen, Home Screen, notifications, Control Center, and more.

                 <h2><strong>Updated App Designs&nbsp;</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Driven by the goal of bringing greater focus to content that’s instantly familiar, Apple’s design team considered every aspect of Apple’s platforms to identify improvements that could be made across the board.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Controls, toolbars, and navigation within apps have been redesigned. Previously configured for rectangular displays, they now fit perfectly concentric with the rounded corners of modern hardware and app windows — establishing greater harmony between hardware, software, and content. Controls are crafted out of Liquid Glass and act as a distinct functional layer that sits above apps. They give way to content and dynamically morph as users need more options or move between different parts of an app. And with thoughtful groupings, it’s easier for users to find the controls they need.
</div>

        <div>
             
                 <div>Tab bars and sidebars have been redesigned with the same approach. In iOS 26, when users scroll, tab bars shrink to bring focus to the content while keeping navigation instantly accessible. The moment users scroll back up, tab bars fluidly expand. In iPadOS and macOS, updated sidebars make apps like Apple TV even more immersive. They refract the content behind them — while reflecting content and the user’s wallpaper from around them — which ensures users always have a sense of their context.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These updated design elements apply across fresh new experiences in apps such as Camera, Photos, Safari, FaceTime, Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple Podcasts.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new design extends across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, with updates to system experiences like the Lock Screen, Home Screen, desktop, and Dock. To maintain the focus on the subject of photo wallpapers on the Lock Screen, the time is now crafted out of Liquid Glass and fluidly adapts to fit elegantly behind the subject.

        <div>On the Home Screen and desktop, the Dock, app icons, and widgets have all been crafted from multiple layers of Liquid Glass. They look stunning, with specular highlights, and allow for greater personalization options while still maintaining the familiarity that users rely on. For example, in macOS Tahoe 26, users can customize the desktop and Dock with widgets and app icons that come to life in light or dark appearances, colorful new light and dark tints, as well as an elegant new clear look. And it’s made even better with a completely transparent menu bar that makes the Mac display feel even larger.

If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit.</p><p>Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not "really" an "expense", regardless of the fact that you paid them.</p><p>What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case).</p><p>Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k.</p><p>So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think "well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation," but in this case software engineers are <i>special</i> and aren't deductible in the same way.</p><p>In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.</p><p>The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax <i>even in years in which they were unprofitable.</i></p><p>These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers.</p><p>It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules.</p></div></td></tr>

Instead, the $1M was to be amortized over 5 years, so now the business can only count $200K as the deductible expense for that year. So now it's going to be taxed on "profits" of $900K. Assuming the tax rate is 50%, that means the business owes $450K in taxes, even though it has a total of $100K in the bank after the actual expenses were paid. So it would have to either borrow to pay taxes or raise venture capital, meaning that VC-funded companies would be advantaged over bootstrapped ones!</p><p>- The letter's goal is to bring things back to how they were (and how they are for all other businesses): let businesses deduct their actual expenses from their actual revenue, and tax that actual profit.</p><p>I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, this is just my understanding of this issue.</p></div></td></tr>

Not even close.</p><p>Here's the key:</p><pre><code>  Development costs incurred to remove uncertainty are amortized.  
  All other costs are deductible during the tax year where they are incurred.
</code></pre><p>
How does this work?</p><p>You are going to design a new robot arm.</p><p>In January, you spend $100K to "remove uncertainty". In rough strokes, this means discovering all the things you don't know and need to know for this robot arm to become a product. This amount will be amortized over five years under 174.</p><p>Now, with uncertainty removed, you spend an additional $1.1MM from January until December for engineering implementation. No uncertainty being removed. Just building a product. This is 100% deductible that tax year.</p><p>Analogy: You want to build a new brick wall with specific properties. You spend $100K to develop a new type of brick and $1.1MM to build the wall using that brick. The $100K is amortized, the $1.1MM is deductible in one shot.</p><p>BTW, at year 6 the amortization schedule reaches steady-state and you are amortizing the full $100K every year. In other words, the impact of 174, if treated intelligently, is the time value of money until steady state is reached for the engineering costs incurred to remove uncertainty.</p><p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2" rel="nofollow">https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2</a></p></div></td></tr>

Usual suspects are BigTech and large consulting groups. The later act as intermediaries: they sell worker hours at a higher rate, skimming the difference between their prices and employee's salary. If they were somehow barred from H1B program the H1B visa holders would presumably find better paying jobs elsewhere.</p><p>H1B rules around changing jobs means that even if the employee joins at a market-level salary when they come to the US, they tent to stay at the same company much longer and can be exploited. The new company has to go through a lengthy paperwork process to allow the visa holder to switch jobs. Also, since the tech world tends to use things like stock options / RSUs / monetary bonuses for large parts of compensation package and those do not count towards "salary" you may have a situation where an h1b holder on paper seems to be paid fairly but in practice get only about 40-50% of what their peers get.</p><p>If they were allowed to change jobs freely they would be able to negotiate their compensation fairly. The companies would be less intensified to hire H1Bs to save money and would also consider local talent for same positions. Everybody would win: both H1B visa holders and their families <i>and</i> American workers, too. The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).</p><p>There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.</p></div></td></tr>

The concept of it seems sensible, in practice you end up justifying why something is R&amp;D to essentially non-technical people, probably at some consultancy who can then repeat a moderately garbled version of your description to HMRC who presumably just approve in most cases because they also don't have the expertise to truly assess the subject matter (and let's face it, we'd all struggle, even if we believe we're expert software engineers, how do you assess whether work on a mortgage issuing product for a bank is truly R&amp;D if you have no familiarity with the domain).</p>

The rule is not about taxation, but deductions/expenses. If your expenses cover most revenue, you owe little in taxes. With this rule, a particular type of expense (software engineering salaries) is no longer deductible from revenue to calculate taxable income over which taxes are owed. So you might previously owe no taxes, but now you do. The deduction might carry over to the next few years and eventually (after 6 years) you will reach the same point - assuming your salaries don't go up and your business doesn't grow. The remainder in deductions will be returned after the business stops employing software engineers. I'm not sure why anyone would want the tax code to incentivize a business outcome that all of us would consider failure.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Just this week I was working on something similar but specifically for users who have disabilities, so they can more easily report issues to site owners. I also combined general annotation capability so other users (of my browser extension) can read their comments. And also compatibility with Hypothesis (<a href="https://github.com/hypothesis">https://github.com/hypothesis</a>, <a href="https://hypothes.is/" rel="nofollow">https://hypothes.is</a>), also using the W3C Web Annotation spec.
I hadn't thought of the drag-and-drop bug metaphor; I like it.
I had also considered recording mouse and keystroke events up until the time that the bug is marked, and then bundling those events (sanitized) with the bug report for more precise repro steps, but of course that's a bigger ask for the opt-in.</p>

                  <p>I hired a house cleaner. I didn't tell them what to do because figuring that out is their job. They didn't do the things I wanted and they even missed some spots on what they did do. I didn't tell them about that either. It's they're job. So I fired them and switched to another. Repeat. Maybe eventually one of them will figure it out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Doctors Could Hack the Nervous System With Ultrasound"><p><strong>Inflammation: It’s the body’s</strong> natural response to injury and infection, but medical science now recognizes it as a double-edged sword. When inflammation becomes chronic, it can contribute to a host of serious health problems, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/arthritis">arthritis</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-disease">heart disease</a>, and certain cancers. As this understanding has grown, so too has the search for effective ways to manage harmful inflammation.</p><p>Doctors and researchers are exploring various approaches to tackle this pervasive health issue, from new medications to dietary interventions. But what if one of the most promising treatments relies on a familiar technology that’s been in hospitals for decades?</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027020301448" target="_blank">focused ultrasound stimulation</a> (FUS), a technique that uses sound waves to reduce inflammation in targeted areas of the body. It’s a surprising new application for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound">ultrasound</a> technology, which most people associate with prenatal checkups or diagnostic imaging. And FUS may help with many other disorders too, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/diabetes">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obesity">obesity</a>. By modifying existing ultrasound technology, we might be able to offer a novel approach to some of today’s most pressing health challenges.</p><p>Our team of biomedical researchers at the <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/bioelectronic-medicine" target="_blank">Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine</a> (part of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research), in Manhasset, N.Y., has made great strides in learning the electric language of the nervous system. Rather than treating disease with drugs that can have broad side effects throughout the body, we’re learning how to stimulate nerve cells, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neurons">neurons</a>, to intervene in a more targeted way. Our goal is to activate or inhibit specific functions within organs.</p><p>The relatively new application of FUS for <a href="https://www.neuromodulation.com/about-neuromodulation" target="_blank">neuromodulation</a>, in which we hypothesize that sound waves activate neurons, may offer a precise and safe way to provide healing treatments for a wide range of both acute and chronic maladies. The treatment doesn’t require <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/surgery">surgery</a> and potentially could be used at home with a wearable device. People are accustomed to being prescribing pills for these ailments, but we imagine that one day, the prescriptions could be more like this: “Strap on your ultrasound belt once per day to receive your dose of stimulation.”</p><h2>How Ultrasound Stimulation Works</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-ultrasound-history" target="_self">Ultrasound</a> is a time-honored medical technology. Researchers began experimenting with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound-imaging">ultrasound imaging</a> in the 1940s, bouncing low-energy <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasonic">ultrasonic</a> waves off internal organs to construct medical images, typically using intensities of a few hundred milliwatts per square centimeter of tissue. By the late 1950s, some doctors were using the technique to show expectant parents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_ultrasonography" target="_blank">developing fetus inside the mother’s uterus</a>. And high-intensity ultrasound waves, which can be millions of milliwatts per square centimeter, have a variety of therapeutic uses, including <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16541-hifu-high-intensity-focused-ultrasound" target="_blank">destroying tumors</a>.</p><p>The use of low-intensity ultrasound (with intensities similar to that of imaging applications) to alter the activity of the nervous system, however, is relatively unexplored territory. To understand how it works, it’s helpful to compare FUS to the most common form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuromodulation">neuromodulation</a> today, which uses electric current to alter the activity of neurons to treat conditions like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/parkinson-s-disease">Parkinson’s disease</a>. In that technique, electric current increases the voltage inside a neuron, causing it to “fire” and release a neurotransmitter that’s received by connected neurons, which triggers those neurons to fire in turn. For example, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/deep-brain-stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> used to treat Parkinson’s activates certain neurons to restore healthy patterns of brain activity.</p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p><strong></strong>In FUS, by contrast, the sound waves’ vibrations interact with the membrane of the neuron, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28040-1" target="_blank">opening channels</a> that allow ions to flow into the cell, thus indirectly changing the cell’s voltage and causing it to fire. One promising use is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.12.010" target="_blank">transcranial ultrasound stimulation</a>, which is being tested extensively as a noninvasive way to stimulate the brain and treat neurological and psychiatric diseases.</p><p>We’re interested in FUS’s effect on the peripheral nerves—that is, the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. We think that activating specific nerves in the abdomen that regulate inflammation or metabolism may help address the root causes of related diseases, rather than just treating the symptoms.</p><h2>FUS for Inflammation</h2><p>Inflammation is something that we know a lot about. Back in 2002, <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md" target="_blank">Kevin Tracey</a>, currently the president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes, upset the conventional wisdom that the nervous system and the immune system operate independently and serve distinct roles. He discovered the body’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01321" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflammatory reflex</a>: a two-way neural circuit that sends signals between the brain and body via the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vagus-nerve">vagus nerve</a> and the nerves of the spleen. These nerves control the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cytokines</a>, which are proteins released by immune cells to trigger inflammation. Tracey and colleagues found that stimulating nerves in this neural circuit suppressed the inflammatory response. The discoveries led to the first clinical trials of electrical neuromodulation devices to treat chronic inflammation and launched the field of bioelectronic medicine.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Tracey has been a pioneer in treating inflammation with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-vagus-nerve-a-back-door-for-brain-hacking" target="_self">vagus nerve stimulation</a> (VNS), in which electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve activates neurons in the spleen. In animals and humans, VNS has been shown to reduce harmful inflammation in both chronic diseases such as arthritis and acute conditions such as sepsis. But direct VNS requires surgery to place an implant in the body, which makes it risky for the patient and expensive. That’s why we’ve pursued noninvasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen.</p><p>Working with Tracey, collaborators at <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/" target="_blank">GE Research</a>, and others, we first experimented with rodents to show that ultrasound stimulation of the spleen <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08750-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affects an anti-inflammatory pathway</a>, just as VNS does, and reduces cytokine production as much as a VNS implant does. We then conducted the first-in-human trial of <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/non-invasive-ultrasound-stimulation-spleen-reduces-inflammation-in-humans-new-study" target="_blank">FUS for controlling inflammation</a>.</p><p>We initially enrolled 60 healthy people, none of whom had signs of chronic inflammation. To test the effect of a 3-minute ultrasound treatment, we were measuring the amount of a molecule called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tumor necrosis factor</a> (TNF), which is a biomarker of inflammation that’s released when white blood cells go into action against a perceived pathogen. At the beginning of the study, 40 people received focused ultrasound stimulation, while 20 others, serving as the control group, simply had their spleens imaged by ultrasound. Yet, when we looked at the early data, <em>everyone</em> had lower levels of TNF, even the control group. It seemed that even imaging with ultrasound for a few minutes had a moderate anti-inflammatory effect! To get a proper control group, we had to recruit 10 more people for the study and devise a different sham experiment, this time unplugging the ultrasound machine.</p></div><p><img id="f166b" data-rm-shortcode-id="2ae16b235445ec02f72e63b3c909cc7a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-collage-with-neuron-brain-textures-and-dynamic-wave-patterns-in-pastel-colors.jpg?id=60560952&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-collage-with-neuron-brain-textures-and-dynamic-wave-patterns-in-pastel-colors.jpg?id=60560952&amp;width=980" width="1200" height="1500" alt="Abstract collage with neuron, brain textures, and dynamic wave patterns in pastel colors."><small><p>Shonagh Rae</p></small></p><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p>After the subjects received either the real or sham stimulation, we took blood samples from all of them. We next simulated an infection by adding a bacterial toxin to the blood in the test tubes, then measured the amount of TNF released by the white blood cells to fight the toxin. The results, which we published in the journal <em>Brain Stimulation</em> in 2023, showed that people who had received FUS treatments <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X23017436" target="_blank">had lower levels of TNF</a> than the true control group. We saw no problematic side effects of the ultrasound: The treatment didn’t adversely affect <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-rate">heart rate</a>, blood pressure, or the many other biomarkers that we checked.</p><p>The results also showed that when we repeated the blood draw and experiment 24 hours later, the treatment groups’ TNF levels had returned to baseline. This finding suggests that if FUS becomes a treatment option for inflammatory diseases, people might require regular, perhaps even daily, treatments.</p><p>One surprising result was that it didn’t seem to matter which location within the spleen we targeted—all the locations we tried produced similar results. Our hypothesis is that hitting any target within the spleen activates enough nerves to produce the beneficial effect. What’s more, it didn’t matter which energy intensity we used. We tried intensities ranging from about 10 to 200 mW per cm<sup>2</sup>, well within the range of intensities used in ultrasound imaging; remarkably, even the lowest intensity level caused subjects’ TNF levels to drop.</p><p>Our big takeaway from that first-in-human study was that targeting the spleen with FUS is not just a feasible treatment but could be a gamechanger for inflammatory diseases. Our next steps are to investigate the mechanisms by which FUS affects the inflammatory response, and to conduct more animal and human studies to see whether prolonged administration of FUS to the spleen can treat chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><h2>FUS for Obesity and Diabetes</h2><p>For much of our research on FUS, we’ve partnered with GE Research, whose parent company is one of the world’s leading makers of ultrasound equipment. One of our first projects together explored the potential of FUS as a treatment for the widespread inflammation that often accompanies obesity, a condition that now affects about <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank">890 million people</a> around the world. In this study, we fed lab mice a high-calorie and high-fat “Western diet” for eight weeks. During the following eight weeks, half of them received ultrasound stimulation while the other half received daily sham stimulation. We found that the <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-and-ge-research-demonstrate-ultrasound-stimulation-reduces-obesity" target="_blank">mice that received FUS had lower levels of cytokines</a>—and to our surprise, those mice also ate less and lost weight.</p><p>In related work with our GE colleagues, we examined the potential of FUS as a <a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/research-team-treats-diabetes-using-ultrasound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">treatment for diabetes</a>, which now affects <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">830 million people</a> around the world. In a healthy human body, the liver stores glucose as a reserve and releases it only when it registers that glucose levels in the bloodstream have dropped. But in people with diabetes, this sensing system is dysfunctional, and the liver releases glucose even when blood levels are already high, causing a host of health problems.</p></div><p><span>For diabetes, our ultrasound target was the network of nerves that transmit signals between the liver and the brain: specifically, glucose-sensing neurons in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_hepatis" target="_blank">porta hepatis</a><span>, which is essentially the gateway to the liver. We gave diabetic rats 3-minute daily ultrasound stimulation over a period of 40 days. Within just a few days, the treatment <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00870-w" target="_blank">brought down the rats’ glucose levels</a> from dangerously high to normal range. We got similar results in mice and pigs, and </span>published these exciting results<span> in 2022 in </span><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em><span>.</span></p><p>Those diabetes experiments shed some light on why ultrasound had this effect. We decided to zero in on a brain region called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a>, which controls many crucial automatic body functions, including metabolism, circadian rhythms, and body temperature. Our colleagues at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ge-research">GE Research</a> started investigating by blocking the nerve signals that travel from the liver to the hypothalamus in two different ways—both cutting the nerves physically and using a local anesthetic. When we then applied FUS, we didn’t see the beneficial decrease in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glucose">glucose</a> levels. This result suggests that the ultrasound treatment works by changing glucose-sensing signals that travel from the liver to the brain—which in turn changes the commands the hypothalamus issues to the metabolic systems of the body, essentially telling them to lower glucose levels.</p><p>The next steps in this research involve both technical development and clinical testing. Currently, administering FUS requires technical expertise, with a sonographer looking at ultrasound images, locating the target, and triggering the stimulation. But if FUS is to become a practical treatment for a chronic disease, we’ll need to make it usable by anyone and available as an at-home system. That could be a wearable device that uses ultrasound imaging to automatically locate the anatomical target and then delivers the FUS dose: All the patient would have to do is put on the device and turn it on. But before we get to that point, FUS treatment will have to be tested clinically in randomized controlled trials for people with obesity and diabetes. GE HealthCare recently <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/ge-healthcare-and-novo-nordisk-to-collaborate-to-advance-novel-non-invasive-treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-and-obesity-with-ultrasound" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Novo Nordisk to work on the clinical and product development of FUS in these areas.</p><h2>FUS for Cardiopulmonary Diseases</h2><p>FUS may also help with chronic cardiovascular diseases, many of which are associated with immune dysfunction and inflammation. We began with a disorder called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension" target="_blank">pulmonary arterial hypertension</a>, a rare but incurable disease in which <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blood-pressure">blood pressure</a> increases in the arteries within the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lungs">lungs</a>. At the start of our research, it wasn’t clear whether inflammation around the pulmonary arteries was a cause or a by-product of the disease, and whether targeting inflammation was a viable treatment. Our group was the first to try FUS of the spleen in order to reduce the inflammation associated <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/feinstein-institutes-ultrasound-neuromodulation-for-pulmonary-hypertension" target="_blank">with pulmonary hypertension</a> in rats.</p><p>The results, published last year, were very encouraging. We found that 12-minute FUS sessions <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323679" target="_blank">reduced pulmonary pressure</a>, improved heart function, and reduced lung inflammation in the animals in the experimental group (as compared to animals that received sham stimulation). What’s more, in the animals that received FUS, the progression of the disease slowed significantly even after the experiment ended, suggesting that this treatment could provide a lasting effect.</p><p>One day, an AI system might be able to guide at-home users as they place a wearable device on their body and trigger the stimulation.</p><p>This study was, to our knowledge, the first to successfully demonstrate an ultrasound-based therapy for any cardiopulmonary disease. And we’re eager to build on it. We’re next interested in studying whether FUS can help with congestive <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-failure">heart failure</a>, a condition in which the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. In the United States alone, more than <a href="https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/ddi/heart-failure-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">6 million people</a> are living with heart failure, and that number could surpass 8 million by 2030. We know that inflammation plays a significant role in heart failure by damaging the heart’s muscle cells and reducing their elasticity. We plan to test FUS of the spleen in mice with the condition. If those tests are successful, we could move toward clinical testing in humans.</p><h2>The Future of Ultrasound Stimulation</h2><p>We have one huge advantage as we think about how to bring these results from the lab to the clinic: The basic hardware for ultrasound already exists, it’s already <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fda">FDA</a> approved, and it has a stellar safety record through decades of use. Our collaborators at GE have already experimented with modifying the typical ultrasound devices used for imaging so that they can be used for FUS treatments.</p><p>Once we get to the point of optimizing FUS for clinical use, we’ll have to determine the best neuromodulation parameters. For instance, what are the right acoustic wavelengths and frequencies? Ultrasound imaging typically uses higher frequencies than FUS does, but human tissue absorbs more acoustic energy at higher frequencies than it does at lower frequencies. So to deliver a good dose of FUS, researchers are exploring a wide range of frequencies. We’ll also have to think about how long to transmit that ultrasound energy to make up a single pulse, what rate of pulses to use, and how long the treatment should be.</p><p>In addition, we need to determine how long the beneficial effect of the treatment lasts. For some of the ailments that researchers are exploring, like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8261174/" target="_blank">FUS of the brain to treat chronic pain</a>, a patient might be able to go to the doctor’s office once every three months for a dose. But for diseases associated with inflammation, a regular, several-times-per-week regimen might prove most effective, which would require at-home treatments.</p><p>For home use to be possible, the wearable device would have to locate the targets automatically via ultrasound imaging. As vast databases already exist of human ultrasound images from the liver, spleen, and other organs, it seems feasible to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect targets automatically and in real time. One day, an AI system might be able to guide at-home users as they place a wearable device on their body and trigger the stimulation. A few startups are working on building such <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearable-devices">wearable devices</a>, which could take the form of a belt or a vest. For example, the company <a href="https://www.secondwaveus.com/" target="_blank">SecondWave Systems</a>, which has partnered with the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, has already conducted a small <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240501993182/en/SecondWave-Systems-Demonstrates-Reduction-in-Disease-Activity-in-Clinical-Study-Evaluating-Novel-Ultrasound-Based-Anti-Inflammatory-Therapy-in-Rheumatoid-Arthritis" target="_blank">pilot study</a> of its wearable device, trying it out on 13 people with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and seeing positive outcomes.</p><p>While it will be many years before FUS treatments are approved for clinical use, and likely still more years for wearable devices to be proven safe enough for home use, the path forward looks very promising. We believe that FUS and other forms of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bioelectronic-medicine">bioelectronic medicine</a> offer a new paradigm for human health, one in which we reduce our reliance on pharmaceuticals and begin to speak directly to the body electric.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>For Netherlands mobile numbers, they always start with <code>06</code>, meaning there's 6 digits we'd have to brute. 10**6 = 1,000,000 numbers. That might be doable with proxies, but there had to be a better way.</p>

<p>I added some extra code to validate a possible hit with the first name, and a random last name like <code>0fasfk1AFko1wf</code>. If it still claimed it was a hit, it would be filtered out, and there we go:</p>

              How do we know which country code a victim's phone is?
            </h4><p>Interestingly enough, it's possible for us to figure out the country code based off of the phone mask that the <a href="https://g.co/AccountRecoveryRequest">forgot password flow</a> provides us. Google actually just uses <a href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber">libphonenumbers</a>'s "national format" for each number.</p>
<p>Here's some examples:</p>
<pre><code>{
    ...
    "• (•••) •••-••-••": [
        "ru"
    ],
    "•• ••••••••": [

              How do we get the victim's Google account display name?
            </h4><p>Initially in 2023, Google changed their policy to only show names if there was direct interaction from the target to you (emails, shared docs, etc.), so they slowly removed names from endpoints. By April 2024, they updated their internal <code>FocusBackend</code> service to completely stop returning display names for unauthenticated accounts, removing display names almost everywhere. </p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>It was going to be tricky to find a display name leak after all that, but eventually after looking through random Google products, I found out that I could create a <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/">Looker Studio</a> document, transfer ownership of it to the victim, and the victim's display name would leak on the home page, <strong>with 0 interaction required from the victim</strong>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is making a point - generative AI is relatively cheap -
that might seem so obvious it doesn't need making. I'm mostly writing it because I've
repeatedly had the same discussion in the past six months where people claim the opposite.
Not only is the misconception still around, but it's not even getting less frequent. This
is mainly written to have a document I can point people at, the next time it repeats.</p>

<p>It seems to be a common, if not a majority, belief that Large
Language Models (in the colloquial sense of "things that are like
ChatGPT") are very expensive to operate. This then leads to a ton
of innumerate analyses about how AI companies must be obviously
doomed, as well as a myopic view on how consumer AI businesses can/will
be monetized.</p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake, since inference was indeed very
expensive at the start of the AI boom, and those costs were talked about
a lot. But inference has gotten cheaper even faster
than models have gotten better, and nobody has an intuition for
something becoming 1000x cheaper in two years. It just doesn't happen.
It doesn't help that the common pricing model ("$ per million tokens")
is very hard to visualize.</p>
<p>So let's compare LLMs to web search. I'm choosing search as the
comparison since it's in the same vicinity and since it's
something everyone uses and nobody pays for, not because I'm suggesting that
ungrounded generative AI is a good substitute for search.</p>

<read-more></read-more>

<p>(It should also go without saying that these are just my personal
opinions.)</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-web-search-cost">What is the price of a web search?</h3>
<p>Here's the public API pricing for some companies operating their own
web search infrastructure, retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing">Gemini API pricing</a>
lists a "Grounding with Google Search" feature at $35/1k queries. I
believe that's the best number we can get for Google, they don't publish
prices for a "raw" search result API.<br>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing">Bing Search API</a>
is priced at $15/1k queries at the cheapest tier.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://brave.com/search/api/">Brave</a>
has a price of $5/1k searches at the cheapest tier. Though there's something very
strange about their pricing structure, with the unit pricing increasing as
the quota increases, which is the opposite of what you'd expect. The
tier with real quota is priced at $9/1k searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there's a range of prices, but not a horribly wide one, and with the
engines you'd expect to be of higher quality also having higher prices.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-equivalent-llm-usage-cost">What is the price of LLMs in a similar domain?</h3>
<p>To make a reasonable comparison between those search prices and LLM
prices, we need two numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many tokens are output per query?<br>
</li>
<li>What's the price per token?</li>
</ul>
<p>I picked a few arbitrary queries from my search history, and phrased
them as questions, and ran them on Gemini 2.5 Flash (thinking mode off)
in AI Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>[When was the term LLM first used?] -&gt; 361 tokens, 2.5
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the top javascript game engines?] -&gt; 1145 tokens, 7.6
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the typical carry-on bag size limits in europe?] -&gt; 506
tokens, 3.4 seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[List the 10 largest power outages in history] -&gt; 583 tokens, 3.7
seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I'm not judging the quality of the answers here. The
purpose is just to get rough numbers for how large typical responses
are. A 500-1000 token range seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>
<p>What's the price of a token? The pricing is sometimes different for input
and output tokens. Input tokens tend to be cheaper, and our inputs are
very short compared to the outputs, so for simplicity let's consider all
the tokens to be outputs. Here's the pricing of some relevant models,
retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>

<p>If we assume the average query uses 1k tokens, these prices would be
directly comparable to the prices per 1k search queries. That's convenient.</p>
<p>The low end of that spectrum is at least an order of magnitude
cheaper than even the cheapest search API, and even the models at the
low end are pretty capable. The high end is about on par with the
highest end of search pricing. To compare a midrange pair on quality,
the Bing Search vs. a Gemini 2.5 Flash comparison shows the LLM being
1/25th the price.</p>
<p>Note that many of the above models have cheaper pricing in exchange
for more flexible scheduling (Anthropic, Google and OpenAI give a 50%
discount for batch requests, Deepseek is 50%-75% cheaper during off-peak
hours). I've not included those cheaper options in the table to keep
things comparable, but the presence of those cheaper tiers is worth
keeping in mind when thinking about the next section...</p>
<h3 id="objection">Objection!</h3>
<p>I know some people are going to have objections to this
back-of-the-envelope calculation, and a lot of them will be totally
legit concerns. I'll try to address some of them preemptively. Slightly
different assumptions can easily lead to clawing back 10% here and 50%
there. But I don't see how to bridge a 25x gap just for breaking even,
let alone making the AI significantly more expensive. If you want to play
around with different assumptions, there's a little calculator widget
below.</p>
<p><strong>Surely the typical LLM response is longer than that</strong>
- I already picked the upper end of what the (very light) testing
suggested as a reasonable range for the type of question that I'd use
web search for. There's a lot of use cases where the inputs and outputs
are going to be much longer (e.g. coding), but then you'd need to also
switch the comparison to something in that same domain as well.</p>
<p><strong>The LLM API prices must be subsidized to grab market
share -- i.e. the prices might be low, but the costs are high</strong> -
I don't think they are, for a few reasons. I'd instead assume
APIs are typically profitable on a unit basis. I have not found any
credible analysis suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>First, there's not that much motive to gain API market share
with unsustainably cheap prices. Any gains would be temporary, since
there's no long-term lock-in, and better models are released weekly.
Data from paid API queries will also typically not be used for training
or tuning the models, so getting access to more data wouldn't explain
it. Note that it's not just that you'd be losing money on each of
these queries for no benefit, you're losing the compute that could
be spent on training, research, or more useful types of inference.</p>
<p>Second, some of those models have been released with open weights and
API access is also available from third-party providers who would have
no motive to subsidize inference. (Or the number in the table isn't even
first party hosting -- I sure can't figure out what the Vertex AI
pricing for Gemma 3 is). The pricing of those third-party hosted APIs
appears competitive with first-party hosted APIs. For example, the
<a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-r1/providers">Artificial Analysis
summary on Deepseek R1 hosting</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Deepseek released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/202502OpenSourceWeek/day_6_one_more_thing_deepseekV3R1_inference_system_overview.md">actual
numbers</a> on their inference efficiency in February. Those numbers
suggest that their normal R1 API pricing has about 80% margins
when considering the GPU costs, though not any other serving costs.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are a bunch of first-principles analyses on the cost structure
of models with various architectures should be. Those are of course mathematical
models, but those costs line up pretty well with the observed end-user
pricing of models whose architecture is known. See the references section for
links.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices amortize building and updating the
search index, LLM inference is based on just the cost of
inference</strong> - This seems pretty likely to be true, actually? But
the effect can't really be <em>that</em> large for a popular model:
e.g. the allegedly leaked OpenAI financials claimed $4B/year spent on
inference vs. $3B/year on training. Given the crazy growth of
inference volumes (e.g. Google recently claimed a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/">
50x increase in token volumes in the last year</a>) the training costs
are getting amortized much more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices must have higher margins than LLM
inference</strong> - It's possible. I certainly don't know what the
margins of any Search API providers are, though it seems fair to assume
they're pretty robust. But, well, see the point above about Deepseek's
releasd numbers on the R1 profit margins.</p>
<p>Also, it seems quite plausible that some Search providers would
accept lower margins, since at least Microsoft execs have testified
under oath that they'd be willing to pay more for the iOS query stream
than their revenue, just to get more usage data.</p>
<p><strong>Web search returns results 20x-100x faster than an LLM
finishes the query, how could it be more expensive?</strong> - Search
latency can be improved by parallelizing the problem, while LLM
inference is (for now) serial in nature. The task of predicting a single token can
be parallelized, but the you can't predict all the output tokens at
once.</p>

<p><strong>But OpenAI made a loss, and they don't expect to make profit for years!</strong> -
That's because a huge proportion of their usage is not monetized at all,
despite the usage pattern being ideal for it. OpenAI reportedly made a
loss of $5B in 2024. They also reportedly have 500M MAUs. To reach break-even,
they'd just need to monetize (e.g. with ads) those free users for an average of $10/year,
or $1/month. A $1 ARPU for a service like this would be pitifully low.
</p>

<p>If the reported numbers are true, OpenAI doesn't actually have
high costs for a consumer service that popular, which is what you'd
expect to see if the high cost of inference was the problem. They just
have a very low per-user revenue, by choice.</p>

<h3 id="widget">Sensitivity analysis</h3>

<p>
  If you want to play around with different assumptions, here's
  a calculator:

<h3 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>I mean, you're right to ask that. Nothing really matters and
eventually we'll all be dead.</p>
<p>But it is interesting how many people have built their mental
model for the near future on a premise that was true for only a brief
moment. Some things that will come as a surprise to them even assuming
all progress stops right now:</p>
<p>There's an argument advanced by some people about how low
prices mean it'll be impossible for AI companies to ever recoup
model training costs. The thinking seems to be that it's just
the prices that have been going down, but not the costs, and
the low prices must be an unprofitable race to the bottom for
what little demand there is. What's happening and will continue
to happen instead is that as costs go down, the prices go down too,
and demand increases as new uses become viable. For an example,
look at the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/rankings">OpenRouter
API traffic volumes</a>, both in aggregate and in the relative
share of cheaper models.
</p>
<p>This post was mainly about APIs, but consumer usage will have
exactly the same cost structure, just a different monetization
structure. And given how low the unit costs must be, advertising isn't merely
viable but lucrative.</p>
<p>From this it follows that the financials of frontier AI labs are a
lot better than some innumerate pundits would have you believe. They're
making a loss because they're not under pressure to be profitable, and
aren't actively trying to monetize consumer traffic yet. This
could well be a land grab unlike APIs, since unpaid consumer queries
may be used for training while paid API queries typically are not.
Even the subscription pricing might be there
mainly for demand management rather than trying to run a profit.</p>
<p>The real cost problem isn't going to be with the LLMs themselves,
it's with all the backend services that AI agents will want to access
if even a rudimentary form of the agentic vision actually materializes.
Running the AI is already cheap, will keep getting cheaper, and will always
have a monetization model of some sort since it's what the end user is
interacting with. Neither of those is true for the end-user services
that have been turned into AI backends without their consent. An AI
trying to, I don't know, book concert tickets whenever a band I like
plays in my town will probably be phenomenally expensive to its
third-party backends (e.g. scraping ticket sites). Those sites will be
uncompensated for the expense while also removing their actual revenue
streams.</p>
<p>I don't really know how that plays out.</p>
<p>Obviously many service owners will try to make unauthorized scraping
harder, but that's a very hard problem to solve on the web. Maybe some
of them give up on the web entirely, and move to mobile where they can
at least get device attestations. Some might just give up on the open
web, and require all usage to be signed in, with account creation being
gated on something scarce. Some might become unviable and close up shop
entirely.</p>
<p>If/when that happens, what's the play on the AI agent side? Will they
choose an escalating adversarial arms race with increasingly dodgy
tactics, or will they eventually decide that it's better to pay for the
services they use? The former seems unsustainable. If the latter, then
it feels like the core engineering challenge becomes one of building data
provider backends optimized specifically for AI use, with the goal of scaling to
massive volumes and cheaper unit prices, with the trade-off being higher latency, lower
reliability and lower quality.
That could be quite interesting from a systems perspective. (Yes, I'm aware
of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">MCP</a>,
but it's a solution to an orthogonal issue.)
</p>
<p>But one thing I'm confident won't be happening is that it's the AIs that
turn out to be too expensive to run.</p>

<p>Ajit Pai is back on the telecom policy scene as chief lobbyist for the mobile industry, and he has quickly managed to anger a coalition that includes both cable companies and consumer advocates.</p>
<p>Pai was the Federal Communications Commission chairman during President Trump's first term and then spent several years at private equity firm Searchlight Capital. He changed jobs in April, becoming the president and CEO of wireless industry lobby group CTIA. Shortly after, he visited the White House to discuss wireless industry priorities and had a <a href="https://x.com/AjitPai/status/1914845780826873974">meeting with Brendan Carr</a>, the current FCC chairman who was part of Pai's Republican majority at the FCC from 2017 to 2021.</p>
<p>Pai's new job isn't surprising. He was once a lawyer for Verizon, and it's not uncommon for FCC chairs and commissioners to be lobbyists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/fccs-revolving-door-former-chairman-leads-charge-against-title-ii/">before or after</a> terms in government.</p>
<p>Pai's move to CTIA means he is now battling a variety of industry players and advocacy groups over the allocation of spectrum. As always, wireless companies AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile want more spectrum and the exclusive rights to use it. The fight puts Pai at odds with the cable industry that cheered his many deregulatory actions when he led the FCC.</p>
<p>Pai wrote a May 4 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/america-has-lost-its-lead-in-5g-fcc-tech-telecom-spectrum-auctions-c64d395f">op-ed in The Wall Street Journal</a> arguing that China is surging ahead of the US in 5G deployment and that "the US doesn't even have enough licensed spectrum available to keep up with expected consumer demand." He said that Congress must restore the FCC's lapsed authority to auction spectrum licenses, and auction off "at least 600 megahertz of midband spectrum for future 5G services."</p>
<p>"During the first Trump administration, the US was determined to lead the world in wireless innovation—and by 2021 it did," Pai wrote. "But that urgency and sense of purpose have diminished. With Mr. Trump's leadership, we can rediscover both."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Pai's op-ed drew a quick rebuke from a group called Spectrum for the Future, which alleged that Pai mangled the facts.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pai's arguments are wrong on the facts—and wrong on how to accelerate America's global wireless leadership," the vaguely named group said in a <a href="https://spectrumfuture.com/ctia-has-lost-the-plot-on-5g/">May 8 press release</a> that accused Pai of "stunning hypocrisy." Spectrum for the Future said Pai is wrong about the existence of a spectrum shortage, wrong about how much money a spectrum auction could raise, and wrong about the cost of reallocating spectrum from the military to mobile companies.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pai attributes the US losing its lead in 5G availability to the FCC's lapsed spectrum auction authority. He'd be more accurate to blame his own members' failure to build out their networks," the group said.</p>
<h2>Big Cable finds allies</h2>
<p>Pai's op-ed said that auctioning 600 MHz "could raise as much as $200 billion" to support other US government priorities. Spectrum for the Future called this an "absurd claim" that "presumes that this auction of 600 MHz could approach the combined total ($233 billion) that has been raised by every prior spectrum auction (totaling nearly 6 GHz of bandwidth) in US history <em>combined</em>."</p>
<p>The group also said Pai "completely ignores the immense <em>cost</em> to taxpayers to relocate incumbent military and intelligence systems out of the bands CTIA covets for its own use." Spectrum for the Future didn't mention that one of the previous auctions, for the 3.7–3.98 GHz band, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/auction/107">netted over $81 billion</a> in winning bids.</p>
<p>So who is behind Spectrum for the Future? The group's <a href="https://spectrumfuture.com/about-us/">website lists 18 members</a> , including the biggest players in the cable industry. Comcast, Charter, Cox, and lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association are all members of Spectrum for the Future. (<em>Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 12 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications, which owns Ars Technica parent Condé Nast.</em>)</p>

<p>When contacted by Ars, a CTIA spokesperson criticized cable companies for "fighting competition" and said the cable firms are being "disingenuous." Charter and Cox declined to answer our questions about their involvement in Spectrum for the Future. Comcast and the NCTA didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The NCTA and big cable companies are no strangers to lobbying the FCC and Congress and could fight for CBRS entirely on their own. But as it happens, some consumer advocates who regularly oppose the cable industry on other issues are on cable's side in this battle.</p>
<p>With Spectrum for the Future, the cable industry has allied not just with consumer advocates but also small wireless ISPs and operators of private networks that use spectrum the big mobile companies want for themselves. Another group that is part of the coalition represents schools and libraries that use spectrum to provide local services.</p>
<p>For cable, joining with consumer groups, small ISPs, and others in a broad coalition has an obvious advantage from a public relations standpoint. "This is a lot of different folks who are in it for their own reasons. Sometimes that's a big advantage because it makes it more authentic," said Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, which is part of Spectrum of the Future.</p>
<p>In some cases, a big company will round up nonprofits to which it has donated to make a show of broad public support for one of the company's regulatory priorities—like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/business/media/comcasts-web-of-lobbying-and-philanthropy.html">needed merger approval</a>. That's not what happened here, according to Feld. While cable companies probably provided most of the funding for Spectrum for the Future, the other members are keenly interested in fighting the wireless lobby over spectrum access.</p>
<p>"There's a difference between cable being a tentpole member and this being cable with a couple of friends on the side," Feld told Ars. Cable companies "have the most to lose, they have the most initial resources. But all of these other guys who are in here, I've been on these calls, they're pretty active. There are a lot of diverse interests in this, which sometimes makes it easier to lobby, sometimes makes it harder to lobby because you all want to talk about what's important to you."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Feld didn't help write the group's press release criticizing Pai but said the points made are "all things I agree with."</p>
<h2>The “everybody but Big Mobile” coalition</h2>
<p>Public Knowledge and New America's Open Technology Institute (OTI), another Spectrum for the Future member, are both longtime proponents of shared spectrum. OTI's Wireless Future Project director, Michael Calabrese, told Ars that Spectrum for the Future is basically the "everybody but Big Mobile" wireless coalition and "a very broad but ad hoc coalition."</p>
<p>While Public Knowledge and OTI advocate for shared spectrum in many frequency bands, Spectrum for the Future is primarily focused on one: the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which spans from 3550 MHz to 3700 MHz. The CBRS spectrum is used by the Department of Defense and shared with non-federal users.</p>
<p>CBRS users in the cable industry and beyond want to ensure that CBRS remains available to them and free of high-power mobile signals that would crowd out lower-power operations. They were disturbed by <a href="https://www.attconnects.com/ten-years-later-a-new-vision-for-the-3-ghz-band/">AT&amp;T's October 2024 proposal</a> to move CBRS to the lower part of the 3 GHz band, which is also used by the Department of Defense, and auction existing CBRS frequencies to 5G wireless companies "for licensed, full-power use."</p>
<p>The NCTA <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120632176086/1">told the FCC in December</a> that "AT&amp;T's proposal to reallocate the entire 3 GHz band is unwarranted, impracticable, and unworkable and is based on the false assertion that the CBRS band is underutilized."</p>
<p>Big mobile companies want the CBRS spectrum because it is adjacent to frequencies that are already licensed to them. The Department of Defense seems to support AT&amp;T's idea, even though it would require moving some military operations and sharing the spectrum with non-federal users.</p>

<h2>Pentagon plan similar to AT&amp;T’s</h2>
<p>In a May research note provided to Ars, New Street Research Policy Advisor Blair Levin reported some details of a Department of Defense proposal for several bands of spectrum, including CBRS. The White House asked the Department of Defense "to come up with a plan to enable allocation of mid-band exclusive-use spectrum," and the Pentagon recently started circulating its initial proposal.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Pentagon plan is apparently similar to AT&amp;T's, as it would reportedly move current CBRS licensees and users to the lower 3 GHz band to clear spectrum for auctions.</p>
<p>"It represents the first time we can think of where the government would change the license terms of one set of users to benefit a competitor of that first set of users... While the exclusive-use spectrum providers would see this as government exercising its eminent domain rights as it has traditionally done, CBRS users, particularly cable, would see this as the equivalent of a government exercis[ing] its eminent domain rights to condemn and tear down a Costco to give the land to a Walmart," Levin wrote.</p>
<p>If the proposal is implemented, cable companies would likely sue the government "on the grounds that it violates their property rights" under the priority licenses they purchased to use CBRS, Levin wrote. Levin's note said he doesn't think this proposal is likely to be adopted, but it shows that "the game is afoot."</p>
<p>CBRS is important to cable companies because they have increasingly focused on selling mobile service as another revenue source on top of their traditional TV and broadband businesses. Cable firms got into the mobile business by reselling network access from the likes of Verizon. They've been increasing the use of CBRS, reducing their reliance on the major mobile companies, although a recent <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/a-hunt-for-cable-s-cbrs-deployments-turns-up-not-much">Light Reading article</a> indicates that cable's progress with CBRS deployment has been slow.</p>

<p>In its statement to Ars, CTIA said the cable industry "opposes full-power 5G access in the US at every opportunity" in CBRS and other spectrum bands. Cable companies are "fighting competition" from wireless operators "every chance they can," CTIA said. "With accelerating losses in the marketplace, their advocacy is now more aggressive and disingenuous."</p>
<p>The DoD plan that reportedly mirrors AT&amp;T's proposal seems to represent a significant change from the Biden-era Department of Defense's stance. In September 2023, the department issued a <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/DoD-EMBRSS-FeasabilityAssessmentRedacted.pdf?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com">report</a> saying that sharing the 3.1 GHz band with non-federal users would be challenging and potentially cause interference, even if rules were in place to protect DoD operations.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"DoD is concerned about the high possibility that non-Federal users will not adhere to the established coordination conditions at all times; the impacts related to airborne systems, due to their range and speed; and required upgrades to multiple classes of ships," the 2023 report said.&nbsp;We contacted the Department of Defense and did not receive a response.</p>
<p>Levin quoted Calabrese as saying the new plan "would pull the rug out from under more than 1,000 CBRS operators that have deployed more than 400,000 base stations. While they could, in theory, share DoD spectrum lower in the band, that spectrum will now be so congested it's unclear how or when that could be implemented."</p>

<h2>Small ISP slams “AT&amp;T and its cabal of telecom giants”</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T argues that CBRS spectrum is underutilized and should be repurposed for commercial mobile use because it "resides between two crucial, high-power, licensed 5G bands"—specifically 3.45–3.55 GHz and 3.7–3.98 GHz. It said its proposal would expand the CBRS band's total size from 150 MHz to 200 MHz by relocating it to 3.1–3.3 GHz.</p>
<p>Keefe John, CEO of a Wisconsin-based wireless home Internet provider called Ethoplex, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/great-spectrum-heist-how-att-corporate-elites-plotting-keefe-john-7o0sc/">argued</a> that "AT&amp;T and its cabal of telecom giants" are "scheming to rip this resource from the hands of small operators and hand it over to their 5G empire. This is nothing less than a brazen theft of America's digital future, and we must fight back with unrelenting resolve."</p>
<p>John is vice chairperson of the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA), which represents small ISPs and is a member of Spectrum for the Future. He wrote that CBRS is a "vital spectrum band that has become the lifeblood of rural connectivity" because small ISPs use it to deliver fixed wireless Internet service to underserved areas.</p>
<p>John called the AT&amp;T proposal "a deliberate scheme to kneecap WISPs, whose equipment, painstakingly deployed, would be rendered obsolete in the lower band." Instead of moving CBRS from one band to another, John said CBRS should stay on its current spectrum and expand into additional spectrum "to ensure small providers have a fighting chance."</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>An AT&amp;T spokesperson told Ars that "CBRS can coexist with incumbents in the lower 3 GHz band, and with such high demand for spectrum, it should. Thinking creatively about how to most efficiently use scarce spectrum to meet crucial needs is simply good public policy."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said that an auction "would provide reimbursement for costs associated with" moving CBRS users to other spectrum and that "the Department of Defense has already stated that incumbents in the lower 3 GHz could share with low-power commercial uses."</p>
<p>"Having a low-power use sandwiched between two high-power use cases is an inefficient use of spectrum that doesn't make sense. Our proposal would fix that inefficiency," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has previously said that under its proposal, CBRS priority license holders "would have the choice of relocating to the new CBRS band, accepting vouchers they can use toward bidding on new high-power licenses, or receiving a cash payment in exchange for the relinquishment of their priority rights."</p>
<h2>Democrat warns of threat to naval operations</h2>
<p>Reallocating spectrum could require the Navy to move from the current CBRS band to the lower part of 3 GHz. US Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) sent a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/2B29105E-75BF-4D7B-B6B2-7AEC58053698">letter</a> urging the Department of Defense to avoid major changes, saying the current sharing arrangement "allows the Navy to continue using high-power surveillance and targeting radars to protect vessels and our coasts, while also enabling commercial use of the band when and where the Navy does not need access."</p>
<p>Moving CBRS users would "disrupt critical naval operations and homeland defense" and "undermine an innovative ecosystem of commercial wireless technology that will be extremely valuable for robotic manufacturing, precision agriculture, ubiquitous connectivity in large indoor spaces, and private wireless networks," Cantwell wrote.</p>
<p>Cantwell said she is also concerned that "a substantial number of military radar systems that operate in the lower 3 GHz band" will be endangered by moving CBRS. She pointed out that the DoD's September 2023 report said the 3.1 GHz range has "unique spectrum characteristics" that "provide long detection ranges, tracking accuracy, and discrimination capability required for DoD radar systems." The spectrum "is low enough in the frequency range to maintain a high-power aperture capability in a transportable system" and "high enough in the frequency range that a sufficient angular accuracy can be maintained for a radar track function for a fire control capability," the DoD report said.</p>

<h2>Spectrum for the Future members</h2>
<p>In addition to joining the cable industry in Spectrum for the Future, public interest groups are fighting for CBRS on their own. Public Knowledge and OTI teamed up with the American Library Association, the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society, the Schools Health &amp; Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition, and others in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1107113725696/1">November 2024 FCC filing</a> that praised the pro-consumer virtues of CBRS.</p>
<p>"CBRS has been the most successful innovation in wireless technology in the last decade," the groups said. They accused the big three mobile carriers of "seeking to cripple CBRS as a band that promotes not only innovation, but also competition."</p>
<p>These advocacy groups are interested in helping cable companies and small home Internet providers compete against the big three mobile carriers because that opens new options for consumers. But the groups also point to many other use cases for CBRS, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBRS has encouraged the deployment of "open networks" designed to host users needing greater flexibility and control than that offered by traditional CMRS [Commercial Mobile Radio Services] providers, at higher power and with greater interference protection than possible using unlicensed spectrum. Manufacturing campuses (such as John Deere and Dow Chemical), transit hubs (Miami International Airport, Port of Los Angeles), supply chain and logistic centers (US Marine Corps), sporting arenas (Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center), school districts and libraries (Fresno Unified School District, New York Public Library) are all examples of a growing trend toward local spectrum access fueling purpose-built private LTE/5G networks for a wide variety of use cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SHLB told Ars that "CBRS spectrum plays a critical role in helping anchor institutions like schools and libraries connect their communities, especially in rural and underserved areas where traditional broadband options may be limited. A number of our members rely on access to shared and unlicensed spectrum to deliver remote learning and essential digital services, often at low or no cost to the user."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Spectrum for the Future's members also include companies that sell services to help customers deploy CBRS networks, as well as entities like Miami International Airport that deploy their own CBRS-based private cellular networks. The NCTA featured Miami International Airport's private network in a recent <a href="https://www.ncta.com/news/cbrs-at-work-miami-international-airport/">press release</a>, saying that CBRS helped the airport "deliver more reliable connectivity for visitors while also powering a robust Internet of Things network to keep the airport running smoothly."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future doesn't list any staff on its website. Media requests are routed to a third-party public relations firm. An employee of the public relations firm declined to answer our questions about how Spectrum for the Future is structured and operated but said it is "a member-driven coalition with a wide range of active supporters and contributors, including innovators, anchor institutions, and technology companies."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future appears to be organized by Salt Point Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm. Salt Point Spectrum Policy Analyst David Wright is described as Spectrum for the Future's policy director in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1022061330085/1">FCC filing</a>. We reached out to Wright and didn't receive a response.</p>

<p>The Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill," approved by the House, is one area of interest for both sides of the CBRS debate. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1">bill</a> would restore the FCC's expired authority to auction spectrum and require new auctions. One question is whether the bill will simply require the FCC to auction a minimum amount of spectrum or if it will require specific bands to be auctioned.</p>
<p>WISPA provided us with a statement about the version that passed the House, saying the group is glad it "excludes the 5.9 GHz and 6 GHz bands from its call to auction off 600 megahertz of spectrum" but worried because the bill "does not exclude the widely used and previously auctioned Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band from competitive bidding, leaving it vulnerable to sale and/or major disruption."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>WISPA said that "spectrum auctions are typically designed to favor large players" and "cut out small and rural providers who operate on the front lines of the digital divide." WISPA said that over 60 percent of its members "use CBRS to deliver high-quality broadband to hard-to-serve and previously unserved Americans."</p>

<p>On June 5, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/6/chairman-cruz-releases-budget-reconciliation-text">released the text</a> of the Senate Commerce Committee proposal, which also does not exclude the 3550–3700 MHz from potential auctions. Pai and AT&amp;T issued statements praising Cruz's bill.</p>
<p>Pai said that Cruz's "bold approach answers President Trump's call to keep all options on the table and provides the President with full flexibility to identify the right bands to meet surging consumer demand, safeguard our economic competitiveness, and protect national security." AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.attconnects.com/att-statement-on-senate-commerce-budget-reconciliation-text/">said</a> that "by renewing the FCC's auction authority and creating a pipeline of mid-band spectrum, the Senate is taking a strong step toward meeting consumers' insatiable demand for mobile data."</p>
<p>The NCTA said it welcomed the plan to restore the FCC's auction authority but urged lawmakers to "reject the predictable calls from large mobile carriers that seek to cripple competition and new services being offered over existing Wi-Fi and CBRS bands."</p>
<h2>Licensed, unlicensed, and in-between</h2>
<p>Spectrum is generally made available on a licensed or unlicensed basis. Wireless carriers pay big bucks for licenses that grant them exclusive use of spectrum bands on which they deploy nationwide cellular networks. Unlicensed spectrum—like the bands used in Wi-Fi—can be used by anyone without a license as long as they follow rules that prevent interference with other users and services.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-rules-innovative-spectrum-sharing-35-ghz-band">issued rules for the CBRS band</a> in 2015 during the Obama administration, using a somewhat different kind of system. The FCC rules allow "for dynamic spectrum sharing in the 3.5 GHz band between the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial spectrum users," the National Telecommunications and Information Administration <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2024/ntia-fcc-navy-work-expand-innovative-35-ghz-spectrum-sharing-framework">notes</a>. "DoD users have protected, prioritized use of the spectrum. When the government isn't using the airwaves, companies and the public can gain access through a tiered framework."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Instead of a binary licensed-versus-unlicensed system, the FCC implemented a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-overview">three-tiered system</a> of access. Tier 1 is for incumbent users of the band, including federal users and fixed satellite service. Tier 1 users receive protection against harmful interference from Tier 2 and Tier 3 users.</p>
<p>Tier 2 of CBRS consists of Priority Access Licenses (PALs) that are distributed on a county-by-county basis through competitive bidding. Tier 2 users get interference protection from users of Tier 3, which is made available in a manner similar to unlicensed spectrum.</p>
<p>Tier 3 "is licensed-by-rule to permit open, flexible access to the band for the widest possible group of potential users," the FCC says. Tier 3 users can operate throughout the 3550–3700 MHz band but "must not cause harmful interference to Incumbent Access users or Priority Access Licensees and must accept interference from these users. GAA users also have no expectation of interference protection from other GAA users."</p>
<p>The public interest groups' November 2024 filing with the FCC said the unique approach to spectrum sharing "allow[s] all would-be users to operate where doing so does not threaten harmful interference" and provides a happy medium between high-powered operations in exclusively licensed spectrum bands and low-powered operations in unlicensed spectrum.</p>
<p>CTIA wants the ability to send higher-power signals in the band, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1106313426200/1">arguing</a> that full-power wireless transmissions would help the US match the efforts of other countries "where this spectrum has been identified as central to 5G." The public interest groups urged the FCC to reject the mobile industry proposal to increase power levels, saying it "would disrupt and diminish the expanding diversity of GAA users and use cases that represent the central purpose of CBRS's innovative three-tier, low-power and coordinated sharing framework."</p>
<h2>Pai helped carriers as FCC chair</h2>
<p>The FCC's original plan for PALs during the Obama administration was to auction them off for individual Census tracts, small areas containing between 1,200 and 8,000 people each. During President Trump's first term, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/ajit-pais-5g-plans-make-it-harder-for-small-isps-to-deploy-broadband/">Pai FCC granted a CTIA request</a> to boost the size of license areas from census tracts to counties, making it harder for small companies to win at auction.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-366624A1.pdf">auctioned PALs</a> in 2020, getting bids of nearly $4.6 billion from 228 bidders. The <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/cbrs-spectrum-auction-maps-who-won-what-and-where">biggest winners</a> were Verizon, Dish Network, Charter, Comcast, and Cox.</p>
<p>Although Verizon uses CBRS for parts of its network, that doesn't mean it's on the same side as cable users in the policy debate. Verizon <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/11071224022983/1">urged the FCC</a> to increase the allowed power levels in the band. Dish owner EchoStar also <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1206040236805/1">asked</a> for power increases. Cable companies <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120632176086/1">oppose</a> raising the power levels, with the NCTA saying that doing so would "jeopardize the continued availability of the 3.5 GHz band for lower-power operations" and harm both federal and non-federal users.</p>

<p>As head of CTIA, one of Pai's main jobs is to obtain more licensed spectrum for the exclusive use of AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other mobile companies that his group represents. Pai's Wall Street Journal op-ed said that "traffic on wireless networks is expected to triple by 2029," driven by "AI, 5G home broadband and other emerging technologies." Pai cited a <a href="https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Looming-Spectrum-Crisis-Accenture.pdf">study</a> commissioned by CTIA to argue that "wireless networks will be unable to meet a quarter of peak demand in as little as two years."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future countered that Pai "omits that the overwhelming share of this traffic will travel over Wi-Fi, not cellular networks." CTIA told Ars that "the Ericsson studies we use for traffic growth projections only consider demand over commercial networks using licensed spectrum."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future pointed to statements made by the CEOs of wireless carriers that seem to contradict Pai's warnings of a spectrum shortage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Pai cites a CTIA-funded study to claim "wireless networks will be unable to meet a quarter of peak demand in as little as two years." If that's true, then why are his biggest members' CEOs telling Wall Street the exact opposite?</p>
<p>Verizon's CEO <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/2024-12/UBS_Conference_Transcript_120924.pdf">insists</a> he's sitting on "a generation of spectrum"—"years and years and years" of spectrum capacity still to deploy. The CEO of Verizon's consumer group goes even further, insisting they have "<a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/2024-05/MN_Conference_Transcript_051424.pdf">almost unlimited spectrum</a>." T-Mobile agrees, <a href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/t-mobile-ceo-bigs-spectrum-ubs-event">bragging</a> that it has "only deployed 60 percent of our mid-band spectrum on 5G," leaving "lots of spectrum we haven't put into the fight yet."</p></blockquote>
<h2>Battle could last for years</h2>
<p>Spectrum for the Future also scoffed at Pai's comparison of the US to China. Pai's op-ed said that China "has accelerated its efforts to dominate in wireless and will soon boast more than four times the amount of commercial midband spectrum than the US." Pai added that "China isn't only deploying 5G domestically. It's exporting its spectrum policies, its equipment vendors (such as Huawei and ZTE), and its Communist Party-centric vision of innovation to the rest of the world."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Spectrum for the Future responded that "China's spectrum policy goes all-in on exclusive-license frameworks, such as 5G, because they limit spectrum access to just a small handful of regime-aligned telecom companies complicit in Beijing's censorship regime... America's global wireless leadership, by contrast, is fueled by spectrum innovations like unlicensed Wi-Fi and CBRS spectrum sharing, whose hardware markets are dominated by American and allied companies."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future also said that Pai and CTIA "blasting China for 'exporting its spectrum policies'—while asking the US to adopt the same approach—is stunning hypocrisy."</p>
<p>CTIA's statement to Ars disputed Spectrum for the Future's description. "The system of auctioning spectrum licenses was pioneered in America but is not used in China. China does, however, allocate unlicensed spectrum in a similar manner to the United States," CTIA told Ars.</p>
<p>The lobbying battle and potential legal war that has Pai and CTIA lined up against the "everybody but Big Mobile" wireless coalition could last throughout Trump's second term. Levin's research note about the DoD proposal said, "the path from adoption to auction to making the spectrum available to the winners of an auction is likely to be at least three years." The fight could go on a lot longer if "current licensees object and litigate," Levin wrote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">My input stream is full of it: Fear and loathing and cheerleading and prognosticating on what generative AI means and whether
    it’s Good or Bad and what we should be doing. All the channels: Blogs and peer-reviewed papers and social-media posts and
    business-news stories. So there’s lots of AI angst out there, but this is mine.
    I think the following is a bit unique because it focuses on cost, working backward from there. As for the
    genAI tech itself, I guess I’m a moderate; there is a there there, it’s not all slop. But first…</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>The rent is too damn high</span> · 
I promise I’ll talk about genAI applications but let’s start with money. <em>Lots</em> of money, big numbers! For example,
    venture-cap startup money pouring into AI, which as of now apparently adds up to
    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html">$306
    billion</a>. And that’s just startups; Among the giants, Google alone
    <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/google-cloud-generative-ai-data-center-capacity-buildouts/739357/">apparently plans
    $75B</a> in capital expenditure on AI
    infrastructure, and they represent maybe a quarter at most of cloud capex. You think those are big numbers? McKinsey offers
    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers">The cost of compute: A $7 trillion race to scale data centers</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, lots of people are
    wondering when and where the revenue will be to pay for it all. There’s one thing we know for sure:
    The pro-genAI voices are fueled by hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fear and desire; fear that it’ll
    never pay off and desire for a piece of the money. Can you begin to imagine the pressure for revenue that investors and
    executives and middle managers are under?</p>

<p><a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114572118905328515">Here’s an example</a> of the kind of debate that ensues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/-big/Anil-MCP.jpg.html"><img alt="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" title="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Anil-MCP.png"></a></p>
<p>“MCP” is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Model Context Protocol</a>, used for communicating between LLM
    software and other systems and services.<br>
I have no opinion as to its quality or utility.</p>
<p>I suggest that when you’re getting a pitch for genAI technology, you should have that greed and
    fear in the back of your mind. Or maybe at the front.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>And that’s just the money</span> · 
For some reason, I don’t hear much any more about the environmental cost of genAI, the gigatons of carbon pouring out of the
    system, imperilling my children’s future. Let’s please not ignore that; let’s read things like
    <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-center-energy-needs-are-upending-power-grids-and-threatening-the-climate">Data
    Center Energy Needs Could Upend Power Grids and Threaten the Climate</a> and let’s make sure every freaking conversation about
    genAI acknowledges this grievous cost.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at a few sectors where genAI is said to be a big deal: Coding, teaching, and professional
    communication. To keep things balanced, I’ll start in a space where I have kind things to say.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>Coding</span> · 
Wow, is my tribe ever melting down. The pro- and anti-genAI factions are hurling polemical thunderbolts at each
    other, and I mean extra hot and pointy ones. For example, here are 5600 words entitled
    <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">I Think I’m Done Thinking About genAI
    For Now</a>. Well-written words, too.</p>

<p>But, while I have a lot of sympathy for the contras and am sickened by some of the promoters, at the moment
    I’m mostly in tune with Thomas Ptacek’s
    <a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a>. It’s long and (fortunately) well-written
    and I (mostly) find it hard to disagree with.</p>

<p>it’s as simple as this: I keep hearing talented programmers
    whose integrity I trust tell me “Yeah, LLMs are helping me get shit done.” The probability that they’re all lying or being
    fooled seems very low.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I note an absence of concern for cost and carbon in these conversations. Which is unacceptable. But let’s
    move on.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that I learned two useful things from Ptacek’s essay that I hadn’t really understood. First, the “agentic”
    architecture of programming tools: You ask the agent to create code and it asks the LLM, which will sometimes 
    hallucinate; the agent will observe that it doesn’t compile or makes all the unit tests fail, discards it, and re-prompts. If
    it takes the agent module 25 prompts to generate code that while imperfect is at least correct, who cares?</p>

<p>Second lesson, and to be fair this is just anecdata: It feels like the Go programming language is especially well-suited to
    LLM-driven automation. It’s small, has a large standard library, and a culture that has strong shared idioms for doing almost
    anything. Anyhow, we’ll find out if this early impression stands up to longer and wider industry experience.</p>

<p>Turning our attention back to cost, let’s assume that eventually all or most developers become somewhat LLM-assisted. Are
    there enough of them, and will they pay enough, to cover all that investment?  Especially given that models that are both
    open-source and excellent are certain to proliferate? Seems dubious.</p>

<p>Suppose that, as Ptacek suggests, LLMs/agents allow us to automate the tedious low-intellectual-effort parts of our
    job. Should we be concerned about how junior developers learn to get past that “easy stuff” and on the way to senior skills?
    That seems a very good question, so…</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Learning</span> · 
Quite likely you’ve already seen Jason Koebler’s
    <a href="https://www.404media.co/teachers-are-not-ok-ai-chatgpt/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">Teachers Are Not OK</a>, a
    frankly horrifying survey of genAI’s impact on secondary and tertiary education. It is a tale of unrelieved grief and pain
    and wreckage. Since genAI isn’t going to go away and students aren’t going to stop being lazy, 
    it seems like we’re going to re-invent the way people teach and learn.</p>

<p>The stories of students furiously deploying genAI to avoid the effort of actually, you know,
    learning, are sad. Even sadder  are those of genAI-crazed administrators leaning on faculty to become more efficient and
    “businesslike” by using it.</p>

<p>I really don’t think there’s a coherent pro-genAI case to be made in the education context.</p>

<p id="p-11"><span>Professional communication</span> · 
If you want to use LLMs to automate communication with your family or friends or lovers, there’s nothing I can say that will
    help you. So let’s restrict this to conversation and reporting around work and private projects and voluntarism and so on.</p>

<p>I’m
    pretty sure this is where the people who think they’re going to make big money with AI think it’s going to come from.
    If you’re interested in that thinking,
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Der8WWGeVxdOWx37bMV_nj9N1tUAVcvSSRa6qxKx75g/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1">here’s
    a sample</a>; a slide deck by a Keith Riegert for the book-publishing business which, granted, is a bit stagnant and a whole lot
    overconcentrated these days. I suspect scrolling through it will produce a strong emotional reaction for quite a few readers here.
    It’s also useful in that it talks specifically about costs.</p>

<p>That is for corporate-branded output. What about personal or internal professional communication; by which I mean emails and
    sales reports and committee drafts and project pitches and so on? I’m pretty negative about this. If your email or pitch
    doc or whatever needs to be summarized, or if it has the colorless affectless error-prone polish of 2025’s LLMs, I would
    probably discard it unread.
    I already found the switch to turn off Gmail’s attempts to summarize my emails.</p>

<p>What’s the genAI world’s equivalent of “Tl;dr”? I’m thinking “TA;dr” (A for AI)
    or “Tg;dr” (g for genAI) or just “LLM:dr”.</p>

<p>And this vision of everyone using genAI to amplify their output and everyone else using it to summarize and filter
    their input feels simply perverse.</p>

<p>Here’s what I think is 
    <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror/114606355212363074">an important finding</a>, ably summarized by Jeff Atwood:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/-big/Dare-Jeff.jpg.html"><img alt="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" title="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Dare-Jeff.png"></a></p>
<p>Seriously, since LLMs by design emit streams that are optimized for plausibility and for harmony with the model’s
    training base, in an AI-centric world there’s a powerful incentive to say things that are implausible, that are out of tune,
    that are, bluntly, weird. So there’s one upside.</p>

<p>And let’s go back to cost. Are the prices in Riegert’s slide deck going to pay for trillions in capex?
    Another example: My family has a Google workplace account, and the price just went up from $6/user/month to
    $7. The announcement from Google emphasized that this was related to the added value provided by Gemini. Is $1/user/month gonna
    make this tech make business sense?</p>

<p id="p-13"><span>What I can and can’t buy</span> · 
I can sorta buy the premise that there are genAI productivity boosts to be had in the code space and maybe some other
    specialized domains.  I can’t buy for a second that genAI is anything but toxic for anything education-related.  On the
    business-communications side, it’s damn well gonna be tried because billions of dollars and many management careers depend on
    it paying off. We’ll see but I’m skeptical.</p>

<p>On the money side? I don’t see how the math and the capex work. And all the time, I think about the carbon that’s poisoning
    the planet my children have to live on.</p>

<p>I think that the best we can hope for is the eventual financial meltdown leaving a few useful islands of things that
    are actually useful at prices that make sense.</p>

<p>And in a decade or so, I can see business-section stories about all the big data center shells that were never filled in,
    standing there empty, looking for another use. It’s gonna be tough, what can you do with buildings that have no windows?</p>

		<p>In this day and age, celebrities have a lot of influence over our politics. Garthwaite and Moore <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf">estimated</a> that Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement of Barack Obama in 2008 netted him an extra 1 million votes [1]. More recently, an Instagram post by Taylor Swift <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/12/taylor-swift-democrats-midterm-election-celebrity-political-endorsements">led over 160,000 Americans to register to vote</a> prior to the 2018 midterm elections [2]. With the advent of social media, we have an ever increasing need to know celebrities’ opinions on the political issue of the day. Celebrities by and large have obliged — but with notable exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes">Shawn Mendes</a> is a pop singer/songwriter from Canada who became famous several years ago. If you’re anything like me, you wake up every morning, thinking to yourself, “What is Shawn Mendes’ position on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute">Kuril Islands territorial dispute</a> between Japan and Russia?” You try Googling the “Shawn Mendes Kuril Islands” — but alas, just like on every previous morning, you fail to find a public statement from Mendes on the issue. Indeed, as far as I can tell, Mendes has never publicly stated his position on the dispute.</p>

<p>Well, lucky you: I believe I may have found out Mendes’ opinion, cryptically hidden in his 2018 single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYDVwGnAKFM">“Lost in Japan”</a> [3].</p>
<p>The chorus of “Lost in Japan” goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>
I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I<br>
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight<br>
‘Cause I-I-I can’t get you off my mind<br>
Can’t get you off my mind<br>
Can’t get you off my mind (oh)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the song’s name, Mendes is clearly <em>not</em> lost in Japan: he is a “couple hundred miles” from Japan. This raises the question: if not in Japan, where exactly is Shawn Mendes lost? Let’s find out.</p>

<p>Consider Figure 2: circles of radius 200 miles centered at various points in Japan. Not much land is a couple hundred miles from Japan, but there is some. Perhaps Mendes is in South Korea, perhaps the Russian far-east. South Korea seems much more plausible, since it’s substantially more populous than these parts of Russia; but we can’t be sure yet. Let’s take a closer look at the lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All it’d take is <strong>one flight</strong><br>
<strong>We’d be in the same time zone</strong><br>
[…]</p>
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>
<strong>I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan</strong>, and I<br>
I was thinking I could <strong>fly to your hotel tonight</strong><br>
‘Cause I-I-I can’t get you off my mind<br>
[…]</p>
<p>I know it’s more than just a friendship<br>
I can hear you thinking ’bout it, yeah<br>
<strong>Do I gotta convince you?</strong><br>
<strong>That you shouldn’t fall asleep?</strong><br>
<strong>It’ll only be a couple hours</strong><br>
<strong>And I’m about to leave</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mendes is a couple hundred miles from Japan and wants to fly there tonight to see his “more than just a friend” (henceforth, “friend” for short). There are several useful pieces of information in the lyrics, the first of which is “We’d be in the same time zone.” This implies that Mendes is currently <em>not</em> in the same time zone as his friend. Let us look now at a map of time zones in eastern Asia.</p>

<p>Aha! As demonstrated by Figure 3, Mendes cannot be in South Korea, because South Korea and Japan are in the same time zone.</p>
<p>Instead, perhaps Mendes is in China, and that “couple hundred miles” is an innocent understatement. However, China is too far from Japan for this to be a real possibility. Indeed, about the shortest flight that one could take between China and Japan is from Shanghai to Fukuoka.</p>

<p>There is another possibility to consider: the Ryukyu Islands, an archipelago of islands belonging to Japan, stretch very far south, almost to Taiwan:</p>

<p>The lyrics say, “All it’d take is one flight.” Is there really a direct flight from Taipei to this tiny island?

<p>It is therefore unlikely that Mendes would find himself in Taipei to begin with. This leaves us with only one possibility: Mendes is flying in from the barren lands of the Russian far-east. Let’s take a closer look.</p>

<p>The land masses belonging to Russia that are within 200 miles of Japan include: part of the Sakhalin Island; small parts of the east coast of the Russian mainland; and the Kuril islands to the northeast<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. It turns out that between all of these places, there is only one airport with direct flights to Japan: the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport, based in the town of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the largest on Sakhalin Island (population 180,000).</p>

Perhaps Mendes is flying from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo, the largest city in northern Japan. There is one flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo: <a href="https://www.flightsfrom.com/UUS-CTS?sdate=2019-11-17">Aurora flight HZ4536</a>. On most days of the week, the flight is not an evening flight — but on Sunday it is, departing Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at 6:30pm. So maybe Mendes plans to take the Sunday night flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo. This sounds reasonable, but there are a couple issues with this theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flight, which departs at 6:30pm, arrives at… 6:00pm, due to a time zone difference.<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> In the song lyrics, Mendes asks his friend, “Do I gotta convince you? / That you shouldn’t fall asleep?” But 6pm is hardly late enough that his friend might be thinking about going to sleep.</li>
<li>Mendes goes on to say, “It’ll only be a couple hours / And I’m about to leave.” The flight alone takes 90 minutes. Mendes would presumably need to take a taxi to the airport, pass through security and customs, and upon arriving in Sapporo, take a taxi to wherever his friend is staying — all in all, probably at least four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>(One very reasonable objection is that the flight schedule could very well have changed since Mendes wrote the song. However, as far as I can tell, this is not the case: I checked the Web Archive for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.new-chitose-airport.jp/en/airport/fis/result/">archives of the Sapporo Airport’s arrivals page</a>, and going back as far as 2016 it appears that all flights from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk arrived in the afternoon or early evening.)</p>
<p>It seems that we’ve overlooked something. And indeed, I believe we have: there are two airports to the east-northeast of Sapporo, labeled with red dots in Figure 11. These flights are to Iturup Island (the more northeasterly one) and Kunashir Island, both of which belong to the Kuril Islands chain.</p>
<p>It is helpful at this point to go over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute">some history</a>. The Kuril Islands have been a point of contention between Japan and Russia for quite some time. In the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda, the two countries agreed that the four southernmost islands — including the aforementioned Iturup and Kunashir Islands — would belong to Japan, while the more northerly islands would belong to Russia.</p>
<p>However, after World War II, Russia occupied these four islands, much as the allies occupied Germany after World War II. Ever since then, Japan has seen this occupation as a violation of its sovereignty, and although the islands are now unambiguously under Russian administration, Japan maintains its claim [10].</p>

<p>It is plausible, however, that Shawn Mendes thinks of the four southernmost Kuril Islands as rightfully belonging to Japan. So when Mendes says he’s flying to Japan tonight, perhaps he is talking about these islands.</p>
<p>Indeed: on Sundays, Aurora Flight HZ4617 departs from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at 7:50pm and lands on Iturup Island (the more northerly of the two red dots in Exhibit 11) at 8:55pm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mendes would arrive at Iturup Airport at 8:50pm and probably wouldn’t make it to his friend’s hotel until well past 9pm. The lyrics “Do I gotta convince you? / That you shouldn’t fall asleep” make much more sense with this flight in mind.</li>
<li>In addition to the flight time being 20 minutes shorter, this is a domestic flight (since the Kuril Islands are administered by Russia), so Mendes wouldn’t need to go through customs. This means that, while Mendes is optimistic in saying that “It’ll only be a couple hours,” it’s a much less egregious underestimate on his part.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There is also a 7-8:30pm flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Kunashir Island on Thursdays. This flight also fits the constraints of the song lyrics, albeit somewhat less closely.)</p>
<p>Now, you might be skeptical of a step or two in the above reasoning. Perhaps flight schedules have changed. Perhaps I overlooked something. However, I believe that I have found incontrovertible<sup><a id="ref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> photographic evidence that Shawn Mendes did in fact visit Iturup Island:</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>The case is closed: beyond a reasonable doubt, we may conclude that Shawn Mendes was in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, looking to fly to Iturup Island to see his friend. Crucially, then, when Mendes sings, “I’m a couple hundred miles from <em>Japan</em> tonight,” he is referring to Iturup Island as “Japan,” thus taking a clear stand on the territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>Prior to pursuing this line of inquiry, the Kuril Islands dispute was one of few political issues on which I had no opinion. However, learning of Shawn Mendes’ bold stance — his subtle, cryptic, yet cutting reference to these islands as “Japan” — has clarified my thoughts on the issue. I am now firmly on Japan’s side in this dispute and believe it imperative that we stand up to Russia and its immoral 1945 land grab.</p>
<p>Do you got plans tonight? Because if not — and if you happen to be reading this in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on an evening — then you’re a couple hundred miles from Japan tonight.</p>

<p>In a new modeling study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02343-9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published</a> in Communications Earth &amp; Environment, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, showed that restoring forests to their preindustrial extent could lower global average temperatures by 0.34 degrees Celsius. That is roughly one-quarter of the warming the Earth has already experienced.</p>
<p>The study is based on an increase in tree area of about 12 million square kilometers, which is 135% of the area of the United States, and similar to estimates of the global tree restoration potential of 1 trillion trees. It is believed the planet has lost nearly half of its trees (about 3 trillion) since the onset of industrialized society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Reforestation is not a silver bullet,” said Bob Allen, a climate scientist at UC Riverside and the paper’s lead author. “It’s a powerful strategy, but it has to be paired with serious emissions reductions.”</p>
<p>While previous studies have largely focused on trees’ ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere, this research includes another critical dimension. Trees also have an effect on the chemical makeup of the atmosphere in ways that amplify their cooling effect.</p>
<p>Trees naturally release compounds known as biogenic volatile organic compounds, or BVOCs. These interact with other gases to form particles that reflect sunlight and encourage cloud formation, both of which help cool the atmosphere. Most climate models do not account for these chemical interactions.</p>
<p>“When you include these chemical effects, the net cooling impact becomes more significant,” Allen said. “It’s a crucial part of the picture.”</p>
<p>The benefits of reforestation, however, are not evenly distributed. The study found that tropical forests produce stronger cooling effects with fewer drawbacks. Trees in these regions are more efficient at absorbing carbon and produce greater amounts of BVOCs. They also have less of the surface darkening effect that can cause warming by trees in higher latitudes.</p>
<p>Beyond global temperature, reforestation can also affect regional air quality. The researchers found a 2.5 percent reduction in atmospheric dust in the northern hemisphere under their restoration scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the tropics, increased BVOC emissions were a mixed bag in terms of air quality. They were linked to worse air based on particulate matter associated with enhanced aerosol formation, but improved air quality based on ozone measurements.</p>
<p>These localized effects, the researchers say, suggest that reforestation efforts do not need to be massive to be meaningful.</p>
<p>“Smaller efforts can still have a real impact on regional climates,” said Antony Thomas, graduate student in UCR’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and co-author of the study. “Restoration doesn’t have to happen everywhere at once to make a difference.”</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that the scenario modeled in the study is unlikely to be realized. It assumes trees could be restored to all areas where they once grew, which would require reclaiming developments such as housing as well as farmland and pastures. That raises questions about food security and land-use priorities.</p>
<p>“There are 8 billion people to feed,” Allen said. “We have to make careful decisions about where trees are planted. The best opportunities are in the tropics, but these are also the areas where deforestation continues today.”</p>
<p>The researchers highlight Rwanda as an example of how conservation and economic development can align. There, tourism revenue tied to forest protection is reinvested in local communities, providing incentives to preserve land that might otherwise be cleared.</p>
<p>The study began as a project in Allen’s graduate-level climate modeling course at UC Riverside. It eventually evolved into a collaborative research paper, drawing on Earth system modeling and land-use data to explore what large-scale reforestation could realistically achieve.</p>
<p>Its conclusion is cautiously optimistic: forest restoration is a meaningful part of the climate solution, but not a substitute for cutting fossil fuel use.</p>
<p>“Climate change is real,” Thomas said. “And every step toward restoration, no matter the scale, helps.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/fse-vs-fbi.html">https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/fse-vs-fbi.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44220860">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="md-content"><h2>FSE Meets the FBI!</h2><p>I have for you a bizarre tale of scrapers, feds, data poisoning, Torswats, and everyone's favorite fedi instance.  It veers technical, because I suspect it will be of interest to other people running servers with UGC (i.e., every fedi instance), and also because the mechanics of how I figured out what I figured out might be useful.  It's also got information about how the FBI collects data, which is of interest to everyone, but especially US citizens.  I have a few pieces of the puzzle, maybe someone with interlocking pieces can say more; I'm happy to compare notes.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the FBI pays some shady companies to scrape data, the data is scanned for keywords (yep, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_%28software%29">CARNIVORE</a>).  Links and content are then fed into Facebook, organized by topic based on the keywords.  Some rudimentary analysis is performed (sentiment analysis at least, but as friendly as Microsoft is with the feds, and as LLMs have gotten popular, the influence of machines has probably expanded) and perused by agents, using some FBI internal interface.
</p>
<p>The TL;DR above probably implies this, but this is the longest post on here to date, by a wide margin.  I expect that most people will skip around instead of reading straight through:  probably only people running instances are going to be interested in the <a href="#Crash_course">technical parts</a>, and when building out <a href="#Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">the chronology</a> I erred on the side of providing too much information rather than simplifying.
</p>
<p><em>A note about links that go to fedi sites</em>:  some of them (like the main FSE site) are down, but if you put the links into your own instance's search box, you can generally find the post (if it federated; obviously if your instance is newer or if it's configured to scrub old posts, you might not have it) and view it on your own instance.  In either case, it's generally better to try searching for the post's URL on your home instance, whether that instance is currently live or not, because then you can interact with it locally.  (FSE is actually just a few commits from resuming federation, though being ready to use is a bit farther out.  Within the next few days, probably, it'll be possible to resume fetching objects from it; I have a couple of bugs to fix in the way Revolver stores users, though it's serving objects just fine.)
</p>
<h2 id="Root_Cause">Root Cause</h2>
<p>Pedophiles were showing up on FSE.  The rest of this section is background, the TL;DR is I had a problem getting pedophiles to stay away from FSE and I wanted to stop waking up in a cold sweat.  You can <a href="#Doing_some_digging">skip this bit</a> without missing much besides my woes and what I did about them.
</p>
<p>As far as I could reason, pedophiles were, besides being a problem themselves, the most likely reason for FSE to attract attention from law enforcement.  Nobody wants to host CP (or be in its vicinity) or get their gear seized because they fell asleep on the wheel and they let the pedos have free or they got CP-raided.  (If you are not familiar, this is a type of false-flag where a group of people floods a place with CP and then immediately alerts the FBI, usually done to get the site taken down.  Of course, you have to have it to upload it and usually if it results in any arrests, it results in the arrest of the attackers.)
</p>
<p>I was not happy about their arrival because, like with most fedi instances, it represented the primary existential threat to FSE, but as long as they weren't bothering any kids or uploading anything illegal, FSE has zero viewpoint censorship.  Almost invariably, they would immediately do something illegal.
</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that they misunderstood the rules, the <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/what-is-freedom-of-speech.html">meaning of freedom of speech</a>, something like that.  It turns out that a lot of them have a habit of just dumping illegal stuff <em>everywhere</em> and coming back in a week to see which accounts have been banned and which places have admins that are asleep (an approach that basically leaves no doubt that they are knowingly parasitic), then telling their friends", so you have to stay on top of it and get rid of them early, or they bring more.  It should not be a surprise that if someone's gratification is predicated on getting what they want without regard for who it hurts, that person is happy to engage in parasitic behavior like this:  violating a server and panicking an adult is no big deal if you're willing to violate a child and potentially ruin the kid's life.
</p>
<p>I'd like to also thank <a href="https://fba.ryona.agency/?domain=freespeechextremist.com">fediblock</a> for never fact-checking anything ever, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4b93bc31ef7f0923fa8ba902c64e48b1ca45f5725814b52f42c61b288cc004">giving the false impression</a> that <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/the-loli-question.html">things that FSE has never permitted</a> were allowed.  FSE being fedi's equivalent of a dive bar, I understand people on "gated community" instances not wanting to deal with it (though <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/917fcd965d2a27d5b62f02494dc2e32cf11cfe6c8c965dda0b4c6d3beed234ec">it turns out</a> that instance-blocking is ham-fisted and just blocking a handful of accounts solves the problem), but I would prefer if they did not lie about their reasons or about me personally.  That sort of thing doesn't help when pedos show up having heard that there are no rules.  The blocks don't help them, either:  I've sent messages to admins on instances that were (hopefully unknowingly) hosting CP but got no response because they blocked FSE.  That's <em>their</em> problem, though; hope the block was worth it.
</p>
<p>It does mean that when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">the FBI seized the kolektiva.social database backups</a>, nothing from FSE was in there.  As combative and block-happy as that instance was, very few other instances actually did make it into their database; for all anyone knows, the "accidental seizure" might have been just cover for a CI:  if the FBI wanted the database and the CI had it, serving an overly broad warrant lets them collect it without burning that informant.  I don't know anything about the people involved, but the FBI has used that tactic before.
</p>
<p>So when someone came looking for or attempting to provide CP I started just posting their IP and email and UA and whatever I had or could dig up.  (If you've punched a waiter, you can't complain that he refuses to bring you food.  Likewise with anyone trying to get me to host CP and then whining about me leaving them at the mercy of the internet.  I'm happy to care about your expectations for reasonable terms of service until you intentionally try something that you know is not just against the rules anywhere, but that can get the site eliminated and get me arrested.  I will do my best to discourage you from proceeding.)  I wanted to convey, completely unambiguously, that this is a hostile place to people doing that kind of thing:  the thing that <em>really</em> worries pedos is transparency.
</p>
<p>But it turns out that almost none of them were even paying attention:  they were just here to dump files or grab files and leave, or they expected to be banned 90% of the time and were looking for places where they didn't get banned.  So it didn't work, and I kept digging to figure out where they were coming from.
</p>
<h2 id="Doing_some_digging">Doing some digging</h2>
<p>If you are running an instance, it's even odds that you're doing it because you're interested in computers in general and the best way to learn is solving the problems that crop up.  This is great!  I have some helpful information; I post about it a lot but I haven't put it in one place.  Here is one place.  It's hopefully helpful to people that don't have a lot of experience with the topic and possibly has some bits that are of interest even to people that have been at this a long time.
</p>
<p>I've got a bigger piece about this in the larder but here's a survival guide:  it should give you enough that you can fill in the gaps by hitting the books, and enough of the technical background to understand the rest of the story.  It's a little dense in parts.
</p>
<h2 id="Why">Why?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation for any given piece of software ignores the problems that crop up:  coders like to think their software is painless and they treat information to the contrary as a bug in their code (or sometimes as a bug in the real world).  Pleroma and <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">similar software</a> also have two audiences:  users and people with their hands in the guts, and people with their hands in the guts need the real info.  But workarounds, real troubleshooting information, things like this are a little embarrassing to include.  "This is how much it'll tolerate before it breaks" is critical information, but the first thought a coder usually has is "It shouldn't break" and try to come up with a solution rather than document the tolerances.  (Eventually, <a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen">everything breaks</a>.  You just don't know how much it takes or what happens when it breaks if you don't test it.)  Combine that with the the fact that most complaints come from people that expect the software to Just Work™ and you can expect that you won't get too many tips for learning how to deal with Weird, and if you run networked software that talks to the open internet, you will encounter Weird.  There are bots and scanners and worms, and as fedi grows, all servers become more interesting targets.  And if it's a high-traffic server with open registrations, you'll attract at least a little targeted attention.  (And of course, more if you call the server something like "freespeechextremist.com":  I may as well make the favicon a big, red bullseye.  But I like encountering Weird, so it's no trouble for me.)
</p>
<p>But the Weird is only weird until you have an answer, so between that and the paucity of documentation of the Weird (because it is nebulous, because coders often don't know all the bugs and if they do, they often don't like to document them, and because high-traffic servers are rare on fedi), your best bet is to get good at diagnostic tooling and analyzing data.  Half of running a server of any sort is being able to tell if something undesirable is going on and the other half is figuring out the shape of it.  (Actually fixing it tends to be trivial.)  That is, you come up with questions and then you figure out how to answer them.  A lot of the questions are going to be "Why is this slow?" or "Why did this stop working?" but if you understand the stream of logs, sometimes the questions are going to be "What the hell is <em>that</em>?"
</p>
<p>You want to be able to understand the logs directly, but you will also need to be able to understand them in aggregate and correlate them with other logs.  Luckily for you, it's all text streams and text files and Unix is <em>full</em> of tools for answering questions about text.  Here's the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/2d50aa0f78a11a3b5d3cac3c5580a16085811bd3fd2db5fc6cd4322accdcc8e7">crash course</a>!
</p>
<h2 id="Crash_course">Crash course!</h2>
<p>This is dense but not difficult:  if you can set up Postgres and Pleroma and nginx, this material is all within your grasp.  Learn one of the things below and you will get some use out of it, and the use is exponential the more of them that you learn.
</p>
<p>If you know any scripting languages, you can learn enough awk for it to be useful in 30 minutes:  every awk program is <code>predicate1{action1} predicate2{action2} [...]</code>.  If you don't, you can probably pick up awk in a few hours.  (I'm serious, no exaggerating.  Do yourself a favor.)  If you combine this with <code>tail -f</code> and <code>mawk -Winteractive</code> then this is as much as you need in order to do real-time analysis of your log files.  I can't speak highly enough of awk's usefulness:  it's like the SQL of plain text.
</p>
<p>If you are any good with awk and some basic networking tools (dig, whois, traceroute, tcpdump, iftop), you know how to use datasets (<a href="https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/nro-delegated-stats">NRO delegated stats</a>, for example; whois on IPs will often give a geofeed URL, etc.) and services (whois again, <a href="https://blog.shodan.io/5-free-things-for-everybody/">Shodan</a> is a good start, DDG <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bangs">lists several services</a> that it integrates), it's possible to figure out just from your webserver logs who is who, when someone signed up (grep the logs for the <code>POST</code> to the accounts endpoint), from where, whether or not it was a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses">Tor exit</a> or proxy, what language they have told their browser to say they speak, things like that.  There is no shortage of tools for network exploration, and the more you learn about how the Internet works, the better you'll be able to use them.  That should suffice:  do a few hours of reading and you have just put your competence into the top 10% of fedi admins, and learned some things that you can apply anywhere.
</p>
<p>nginx, lighttpd, Apache httpd, and almost all of the other webservers that are popular to set in front of fedi for load-balancing or caching or filtering or rate-limiting, they all have a some directives that allow you to control the format of the logfiles, log arbitrary headers, timing information.  It's not always necessary, but keep it in your pocket for when you need it.  With FSE (and other servers I run, not just fedi stuff), I usually strip most of the quote marks added in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format">common log format</a>, I add a lot of timing information (especially time required to get a response from the backend).  I also use tabs, effectively making the log files a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">TSV</a>:  the extra space makes the files a little easier to read visually, a little simpler to use with awk, but also opens up the tooling options:  R, sed, sort, nearly anything can read TSVs.  Read the output of grep into irb or some other REPL that's good at string-mangling; set <code>IFS</code> and pipe it into a <code>while read line</code> loop in bash.  Or if you have some favorite spreadsheet software, they can all read TSVs (but you'll probably want to filter it or split it into chunks unless you have the kind of spreadsheet software that doesn't choke on a 20GB file).  (Of course, because I deal with 20GB files, the tooling I use <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2019-06-04-using-awk-and-r-to-parse-25tb/index.html">can handle pretty big files</a>.)  In fact, although awk is like SQL for delimited text, you can even use regular SQL:  <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations">sqlite3 can operate on text pipelines</a>.  And if you're good with SQL, check the man page for psql:  you can have it emit TSVs pretty easily!  A full SQL tutorial would take longer than awk, but SQL is very useful to pick up.
</p>
<p>Really simple numerical analysis is indispensable when you are looking for aberrances:  the Weird sticks out.  If you're tailing the logs and piping that somewhere, you can keep a running average and calculate standard deviations and find the outliers.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">68, 95, 99.7</a>:  calculate the standard deviation of your window, and you can find things that stick out.  (In awk, this is really concise, since it keeps track of line—technically "record"—numbers automatically:  <code>{a[NR%1000]=$0}</code> keeps the last thousand records in the array <code>a</code>.)  Some endpoints start to get a disproportionate amount of traffic out of nowhere, some IPs show up out of nowhere and flood you.  Finding things that stick out is the point of data analysis.  (This is the sort of tool I was writing/using when I would post things like "90% of the POSTs are coming from the same address".)  On fedi, network-based DDoS tends to be more popular than targeting specific endpoints; if you see <a href="https://techhub.social/users/Drand">someone suddenly hammering TWKN</a>, and it's probably <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">a scraper</a>.  (Probably!)
</p>
<p>The last thing to learn is when you're being too paranoid:  sometimes it's not a DDoS, someone just linked to a post from a popular site like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, sometimes <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">an idiot wrote the scraper and doesn't understand rate-limiting</a>.  (Always include a mechanism to limit the rate, even if you are making <a href="https://git.freespeechextremist.com/gitweb/?p=embot;a=blob;f=embot;h=21a11493cec9b361ee54884dd3de10fce8750cb2;hb=HEAD#l220">a trivial Markov bot</a>.)  Sometimes, it's just someone trying to write a new client and the client has a bug:  fedi is exciting like that, there are hackers all over.
</p>
<h2 id="Scar_Tissue">Scar Tissue</h2>
<p>Over time, running a service, you bump into problems, and your service grows solutions to those problems, and you keep the solutions around so that you don't have the same problem twice.  The service acquires scar tissue, reminders of problems, marks that distinguish it from a new service.  (The scar tissue is one of the reasons that you encounter so many surprises when doing a big rewrite.)
</p>
<p>Early in FSE's history, we had some malicious signups:  just normal spammers.  I view captchas as hostile to legitimate users and ineffective (and of course, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/captchaboy/pleroma_captcha_solver">Pleroma's captchas have been cracked</a> since then).  Likewise with email verification, except that expecting a real email isn't just hostile design, it's also a privacy risk.  There's a tradeoff there:  I have to manually generate password resets if people forget them, FSE can't send out email notifications, things like that, but on the other hand, someone that wants email addresses isn't going to target FSE, and in the event FSE <em>is</em> compromised, the email addresses aren't leaked.  (If someone has an email address and a password, the first thing they'll do is try to use that combination on other services.  If they don't have a real email address, though, they can't.)  But there are a lot of tradeoffs you have to make and people that don't like the ones I made can make different servers or join different ones.
</p>
<p>There's work stuff where, if you can use an off-the-shelf solution to a problem, that's usually what you want; it's generally an explicit policy to spend as little time as possible on things that aren't part of your core business.  That's reasonable but I don't think web applications have gotten <em>more</em> reliable in the decade and a half since this became conventional wisdom, so maybe it's worth considering the emergent properties of this kind of policy.  So when I'm on my own, a project where I have no boss and no reason to compromise, I generally roll my own solutions.  I like coding anyway so it's not a costly experiment, and these solutions generally end up faster, more reliable, and more flexible; aside from that, I'm not at a vendor's mercy for bugfixes.  (There are always bugs.  The difference is whether I've got to try to find them in someone else's 200kLOC codebase or in my own 4-line script.  Additionally, you can guess whether it's faster to bash a four-line script into the text editor or tweak a 400-line config file.)
</p>
<p>So I needed a way to tamp down on the spam without making the site suck:  my solution was to tail the logs, send them through an awk script, and it would just email me when it saw someone do <code>POST /api/v1/accounts</code> and get a 200 back.  Eventually I expanded the script and it would do things like check <code>pidof xlock</code> as a reasonable approximation of whether I was at my desk and if xlock wasn't running, it would pipe <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/4741d89afcf57973a9afcc973a43804a6ce4e6134b96d38dcd87173ed5b1e9e9">a message</a> through <code>espeak -s120 -v other/en-sc</code>.  (I call him "scotbot".  As you can hear, I did have it correctly pluralize "user" but forgot to change "there are" to "there is" when only one occurred.)  At some point, we got a really big hit, and I had nginx rate-limit signups to one per minute.  Later on, I did the welcomebot, so new signups would be announced in public.
</p>
<p>So I would keep an eye on new users arriving:  usually it was just merry shiptoasters, but once in a while I see a pedo show and this sets off the self-preservation instincts, so I dump the stuff they've done and if they are still there and I haven't had to hit the red button yet (that is, they haven't done <code>POST /api/v1/media</code> yet, compelling me to kill off their IP and account and delete all of the shit they uploaded), I can watch them move around, look at what they are searching for.
</p>
<p>The pedos would land on a page, some post or something, usually a local mirror of a post from another instance, then they'd sign up, start mashing search terms into the box (which is usually how I noticed them:  some search terms were added to an awk script that would ping me), follow a handful of accounts, and usually just leave.  A peculiar thing stuck out:  a lot of them were coming from <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>, based on the <code>Referer</code> header, so I tugged on that thread, and that thread turned out to be the weird one.
</p>
<h2 id="Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">Who is <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>?</h2>
<p>I'd never heard of them, so I looked around, and <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a> was a strange site indeed:  very barebones, didn't work over Tor, no contact information listed anywhere.  (Some time in the interim, they added a SocialGist banner at the bottom...that goes to a 404 now that SocialGist has moved.)  I bashed in some of the search queries that the pedos had used on FSE and was pretty horrified to find the posts they landed on, all of which originated on other servers, but all of which were also ascribed to FSE.
</p>
<p>It turns out that BoardReader was a tool for searching forums.  The authors don't appear to understand what fedi is, so they had treated FSE as a forum, and all of the public posts that came to FSE from elsewhere as forum posts made on some forum called "freespeechextremist.com".
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a small search index for forums and it got big enough to be bought by a Japanese company, the two founders had issues with the new owners, and the company eventually was sloughed off and acquired by <a href="https://socialgist.com/">SocialGist</a> (which now redirects you to <a href="https://www.socialgist.ai/">socialgist.ai</a>).  SocialGist purports to sell "accessible social data", they list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153015/https://socialgist.com/data-sources/">several data sources</a>, and per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124110504/https://socialgist.com/blog/">their blog</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240415001121/https://blog.socialgist.com/understanding-how-we-find-data">their developers are in Serbia</a>, which lines up with the IP they were using, so I've started thinking I've got the right people.
</p>
<p>Most of the search results indicated that long ago, BoardReader identified itself in the User-Agent header and most of the targets viewed it as hostile:  it's present on a lot of lists of poorly behaved bots.  There are also complaints about it on a lot of forums, and there are threads where people are asking how to stop it; in those threads, some people show up from nowhere and suggest that the person running the board should be grateful for the traffic bump.  (If you owned a search engine for discussion boards, wouldn't you use it to search for mentions of your engine?  And if you were running a somewhat aggressive crawler that was annoying people, it's a matter of temperament to decide whether to ask what would bother people less versus showing up to argue with them.  I give it even odds that those posts were made by owners or employees at BoardReader itself.)
</p>
<h2 id="BoardReader_and_FSE">BoardReader and FSE</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_05__Sunday">2023-03-05 (Sunday)</h2>
<p>I went over and grepped the logs to see if they'd been to FSE:  nothing.  But they had to be getting data from FSE:  they had posts from other instances and links to FSE.  So I kept looking and found a large amount of scraping on <code>/api/v1/timelines/public?local=false</code> from a browser claiming to be Chrome, and coming through way faster than a human could scroll even if they were leaning on the Page Down key.
</p>
<p>spider1.boardreader.com through spider43 all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A">A records</a>, but traffic was coming through 45.15.176.187 (which was, at the time, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/b110271c6ec2ed688cbbce406a6a1ca9379145ec3d54ba2c7a73927970df47dc">owned by DediPath</a>).  That was odd, right:  why would BoardReader go to the trouble of making A records for their spiders and then go through some other service?
</p>
<p>So, I tell the server to drop traffic from the IPs that were scraping.  Problem solved!  Then immediately I start seeing a large number of attempts from different IPs.  Residential IPs in the US:  they're buying residential proxies.  It's one thing to lie in the User-Agent header, but it's a step past that to pay money to evade detection.  Someone that has money to burn wants FSE scraped, probably a business.  At this point I'm certain enough that it's BoardReader.  I dash off a quick email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> asking for information on their crawler.  Since they are going to lengths to hide what they are doing, I don't expect much, but it doesn't hurt.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_08__Wednesday">2023-03-08 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>So I need an automated approach if they're automatically hopping proxies.  <code>awk</code> and <code>iptables</code> plus a really quick Ruby script to sit between nginx and Pleroma for that endpoint, and I can start dropping traffic from any IP that tries to hit FSE with that token.  If I keep it there, I'll exhaust their proxies before they fill their cache.
</p>
<p>Eventually, the requests dry up and I see a request from an IP owned by a Serbian ISP that leads back to <a href="https://devtools.boardreader.com/">devtools.boardreader.com</a>.  It acts like a normal browser:  it loads all the resources, grabs a Bearer token, executes JavaScript, and subsequent to that, the scraping resumes using that token.  They're trying to play back a browser session:  that's clever.  Watching the logs confirms it:  bots using that token start arriving, playing back the sequence of requests, and then hammering the hell out of the public timeline again.  To verify, I wander back through their site and see that they are indeed getting new posts from that batch of requests.
</p>
<p>I start severely limiting TWKN by cranking the rate-limiting way up.  At this point, it starts throwing 429s even at legitimate users, so I finally <a href="https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/8061b855-1dd7-4fbb-95de-cd812dd04a49">talked about the problem in public some</a> after mostly keeping it to myself or in DMs.  (And, of course, writing this has made me regret not having taken notes with timestamps.  I've had to piece everything together from scattered notes, timestamps on scripts and logs, DMs, etc.  The first draft of this post was missing some information and had the chronology wrong.)
</p>
<p>BoardReader is sneaky and annoying and using fraudulent means to extract data from FSE over my objections, but now thay I can isolate their traffic, I can I try a lot of different approaches.  They aren't going to get any legitimate data again, but I can see how their crawler behaves.  I start just sending back 429s:  their scraper responds by sending <em>more</em> requests.  Apparently, if it doesn't get the response it wants, it just repeats the request immediately, no delay.  Rude, but they have some confidence in their ability to get around restrictions, so they don't have to be polite.  But this is worse:  they send the reqs back so fast that it actually saturates the pipe, it's basically a worse DoS than before.  Unsurprisingly, sending back 401s, 403s, 500s, same result.  So I start just sending <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.3">402 Payment Required</a>, an idea I got from <a href="https://poa.st/users/graf">graf</a>.  Unfortunately, this means no one gets anything from TWKN for a while.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_13__Monday">2023-03-13 (Monday)</h2>
<p>...And that's when they finally get back to me.  I had sent an email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> on the 5th telling them that I was looking for information on their crawler, and on the 13th, after the server has started adamantly refusing to I finally get an email from <a href="mailto:dave@socialgist.com">dave@socialgist.com</a> asking what I want to know.  Noncommittal.  I reply to him a few hours later, at 20:45 UTC, explaining the problem and telling him if he wants to index that he'll need to only fetch local posts and use a UA that identifies BoardReader.  He tells me at 21:01 that he'll forward it to the engineering team and asks what domains I'd like them to quit crawling.  I give the entire IP range that I owned and complain about the pedophiles.  While we're corresponding, their developers are still scraping and actively debugging the scraper, so I mention that he could save them some time.  I can another Serbian IP address.  Over email, I offer to talk to their devs, I pass a few links to <a href="https://fedilist.com/">FediList</a> (which was still on the <code>demo.</code> subdomain at the time), I try to explain how fedi works.

<p>So obviously I don't trust them.  Dave stops replying to emails, and they're not only ''still' scraping, but they are trying to get around the countermeasures:  SocialGist is lying.  They're actively putting work into continuing to do something they've promised to stop doing:  they can't get anything out of TWKN (the last real post they got from FSE was on the 8th), and they're doing their damnedest to try to rectify this, while telling me that they'll stop.  If they felt really good about it, they'd have no reason to lie, so either their motivations are not what what they say, or the person I'm dealing with is not the same person that has decided to put FSE on the list and then told the devs to make sure they can get posts from it.
</p>
<h2 id="Then_the_FBI_shows_up">...Then the FBI shows up</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_14__Tuesday">2023-03-14 (Tuesday)</h2>
<p>The morning after Dave ghosted me, I got <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1e24f117e3892a83e9f998f5fb636a3b99711e27e3ff37743f20746708b1b6e4">an email</a> from an fbi.gov email address, the subject line "Emergency Disclosure Request", and this in the body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Special Agent Peter Christenson, with the FBI. I am requesting subscriber information for the user "WitchKingOfAngmar." This user posted the attached threat. Please let me know if you can assist with this request.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also includes <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e">FSE Screen Shot.PNG</a>.  I've never seen someone outside fedi refer to freespeechextremist.com as FSE, so my first thought is it was a prank, but the headers and my mail server's logs and the SPF info for fbi.gov all indicated that this was a real email from the place it claimed to be from.
</p>
<p>This was the attached screenshot, which, despite being labeled "FSE Screen Shot", is not a screenshot of FSE:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e" alt="Not a screenshot of FSE">
<p>So after I was reasonably certain that it was a legitimate email, my first reaction was to rack my brain trying to remember who the hell "WitchKingOfAngmar" was.  He didn't sound familiar to me.  I checked and this was a user at <a href="https://sneed.social/">sneed.social</a> (which was dead for a long time, but appears to have <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/sneed.social">come back recently</a>).  The screenshot had some interesting bits in it.  For one thing, despite being named "FSE Screen Shot", FSE has never looked like that.  It also described FSE as a "forum".  In fact, the top said "Forum • Blackrock Executiv...".  Some text is highlighted, "kill blackrock" "larry fink", as if those were search terms.  There was also some rudimentary sentiment analysis.  The post itself was from 26 days before the email was sent, but the screenshot read "11 hours ago" and "13 hours".  (So much for "Emergency" from the subject line, but it also indicates that it takes two hours for a post to go through whatever that system is.)
</p>
<p>Obviously, you don't expect to receive an email from the FBI, so it took me a minute to figure out what to make of it.  WitchKingOfAngmar's post was clearly a threat but it was also clearly absurd, an obvious joke, not a credible threat.  And obviously, he wrote it to troll the admins of the site.
</p>
<p>I know a couple of pretty good lawyers in case anything crazy happens, but the goal is always to make sure that nothing crazy happens.  So, best-case scenario, everything from FSE is public:  if you can't see it, I don't have it.  Ideally, the FBI gets that and I don't have to do any convincing.  Worst-case scenario is they kick in the door and grab the server.  They'd need a warrant to do that, and they wouldn't ask politely if they had a warrant already...unless they were trying to get me to say no or they were trying to see how I respond.
</p>
<p>Dealing with law enforcement is usually an uphill battle to convince a person afflicted with motivated reason of the obvious.  They are looking for something, their job performance is predicated on finding it, and when that's the case, it's hard to get them to look at something that isn't the thing they're looking for, even if that thing demonstrates very clearly that what they are looking for is not here.
</p>
<p>On top of that, I'm paranoid.  I go ask the dead spacemen for their thoughts and one of them points out that posting about it might count as obstruction and the FBI had lately been somewhat zealous about obstruction charges.  (Good to have solid friends with level heads.)
</p>
<p>And the previous day, fresh on my mind because the memes were flying, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/9c7e72e28d6b8f9add669ef70f40ded4bba81bde46e6726537f63f2caea47fac">Mike Chitwood</a> (mostly notable for <a href="https://www.mambaonline.com/2017/06/06/newspaper-outs-18-men-arrested-cruising-florida-parks/">publicizing mugshots of people arrested for, though not convicted of, cruising</a>, part of his <a href="https://edramatica.com/The_Daytona_Nine">long-running battle to stop gay dudes in Daytona Beach since at least 2006</a>) had just <a href="https://www.volusiasheriff.gov/news/volusia-county-sheriff/video-new-jersey-man-identified-arrested-following-online-threat-to-murder-sheriff-chitwood.stml">had Richard Golden extradited</a> for saying "Just shoot him in the head" on, uh, apparently it was "<a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/03/15/richard-golden-what-we-know-about-the-new-jersey-man-accused-of-threatening-sheriff-mike-chitwood/70012169007/">a 4CHAN chatroom, a communications platform shared by extremist groups</a>".  (Informed citizens may recognize 4chan as <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/e427aa87b4a334f0ed4f59f6ab2485cf4e9bbd381fa8bc5353a495a80040e0f2">a far-left website</a> as well.)  It is kind of interesting that Chitwood used the same "eradicating scumbags" language about neo-Nazi propagandists and gay dudes bangin' in the woods.  But anyway, I couldn't help noticing that there had just been a case where cops were getting excited about anonymous internet threats.
</p>
<p>The timing was a little obvious:  they got it from BoardReader.  I go and find the post on BoardReader, to make sure it's in their index.  It is:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1337eade3854b2802404520b99448300a920d821cff0c5d1ba9f8599f7944c02" title="Fans of long-ass hashes may notice that this one starts with 1337!" alt="Exactly the same shit the FBI sent me, just a different UI.">
<p>The odds that the FBI and BoardReader would screw up the Unicode in exactly the same way are pretty low.  (The original Unicode codepoints, 1f9e2, 1f438, and 1f44d, got turned into question mark boxes indicating invalid Unicode.  BoardReader's codebase being a mess of PHP, no surprise.)  A common glitch is not absolute, but there is the other unlikely mistake, that a post from somewhere else is ascribed to FSE.  Guess now I know why Dave ghosted:  they're scraping for the FBI, he can't turn it off.  Legally, the FBI can't pay a private organization to do something that they can't do, but if the organization is doing something on their own and the FBI "doesn't" (<em>cough</em>) know and doesn't ask, they're just buying access to a stream of data, not paying someone to violate the CFAA.
</p>
<p>🧢🐸👍</p>
<p>I had been saying for a while that the three-letter agencies don't really "get" fedi.  Decentralized networks take some explaining to regular people, but individuals can get them.  But there's a long way from an individual understanding it to an organization understanding it.  (If you haven't ever worked in a stultifying bureaucracy, think about the amount of time that passes between a rumor propagating through your extended family and any sort of concrete change in behavior propagating.  Something can be obvious to everyone and still not obvious to the organization as a whole.)  Apparently the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/faa13e7f66b7ff9e97634aaf04f6fd4faab95cf3931080fd03b0d98d76c7df2a?name=hydra-on-the-web.pdf">German feds</a> get it and the feds in the US are <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/835374c1bfa10895663d4d1c94500049823ea928fb7e9c47b01a6b7f8f07c091?name=nsf-staff-report.pdf">starting to get it</a>.  But this more or less confirmed it:  SocialGist doesn't understand what fedi is, really, and the FBI saw "It came from this website" and they just rolled with it.
</p>
<p>So I get my head together and reply, explaining that since the guy was on another server, I don't have the information he is looking for, that BoardReader wrote "Free Speech Extremist" on the post but that it didn't come from FSE.  And, miraculously, that works:  he asks who to ask, I tell him to check the origin server, and ask him if he'd rather I not discuss the exchange in public, with no response.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_15__Wednesday">2023-03-15 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>BoardReader is still hammering FSE and getting only 402s in response.
</p>
<p>Still corresponding with Special Agent Christenson, but no reply until East Coast business hours start.  (My last email was 15:50 on the 14th in LA, 18:50 in Quantico.)  The last email is him saying thanks, I ask him one more time if it would bother the FBI if I said something, and nothing.  In the mean time, I've been alternating between disappearing from fedi and running around TWKN being twitchy and paranoid while the actual endpoint is spewing errors.  It's better to be transparent and I usually am but people are asking questions.  The FBI guy probably can't say "Sure, write whatever, here's a selfie!" but if they wanted me not to say anything, he could definitely tell me not to say anything, so I figure it's fine.  On the other hand, the whole thing still made no sense.  (Maybe it made no sense to him either and he was just doing what his boss said.)  So I give a limited explanation and a promise to deliver a full explanation, then wait for the flashbang to come through my window, because, although I was certain I wasn't doing anything wrong or illegal, I am really paranoid:
</p>

</p>
<p>I realize that was a screenshot of a very long post in the middle of a very long article; you'll notice that it ends with an announcement that FSE is going into lockdown until further notice:  no viewing TWKN or public timelines without an account, and registrations closed.  I recommended everyone else do the same.  I hate doing that and I hate when other instances do it, but a lot of instances follow suit.

<p>I'm on the edge of my seat, watching BoardReader continue to fail to get around the wall of 402s.  (As verifying the bearer token means a round-trip to the DB, I'm still mostly kicking them out by using nginx, along with a pile of awk scripts that .)  They're using residential proxies, they're using Tor, they're rotating the User-Agent strings every request  No word from them <em>or</em> the FBI for a week.
</p>
<p>I don't say much beyond the public post, but I ping the admin of sneed.social and ask him if the FBI agent contacted him, I send him the link to my post.  (I didn't know him, but everyone said he was reasonable to deal with when it was something like this, and he was.)  He goes to check his email, says that he'll reach out, and remarks that the user in question was actively trying to get banned, due to some other issue; I didn't ask.

<p>This dissipates pretty quickly:  the fed checks it out because he's got to, but it's pretty obvious, isn't it?  Your guess is as good as mine with regards to why no one was arrested for sending the FBI a false report.

<p>There are a couple of bits worth including here, so I'll quote them.  I've <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/on-human-bots.html">mentioned this before on the blog</a>, but the tone on fedi is significantly less formal (one is less likely to tell the same joke at work on Monday morning that they told at the bar on Friday night), so please bear with me while I quote myself.  If you're unfamiliar with the slang, a "fedpost" is a post that includes threats of violence, and a "glowie" is a federal agent.  These terms are usually used humorously.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't find any other fedi instances on there, but this is a pretty annoying scraper to get rid of.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hasn't changed; as far as I know, FSE is the only one they were scraping.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glowies are (or want to convey that they are) specifically looking at threats against Blackrock executives.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that "want to convey that they are" was correct, but I didn't know that until much later.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember everyone that was freaking out about the various search engines on fedi, most recently as:Public? Remember that I keep saying that there are scrapers getting at fedi *without* identifying themselves? It turns out that I was right and this is because I AM A GODDAMN GENIUS and EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER TOLD ME THAT I AM WRONG IS A RETARDED COPROPHILIAC. There are scrapers getting data out of fedi without identifying themselves and at least one of them is selling data to the FBI.

<p>This has still not sunk in for most of the people that are worried about, e.g., Archive Team, as:Public, FediList, etc.  (Especially the text in all-caps.)  I have linked to some other cases above.

<p>It is important to note here that <em>every</em> sentence in the following paragraph is <em>completely</em> wrong.
</p>
<p>It looked like the situation with the FBI was over and they had what they wanted.  They were just following up on some idiot making a random threat on the internet.  So the balance remaining was just mopping-up and getting BoardReader off my back.  That shouldn't be too difficult!

<p>Despite promising to stop, BoardReader hasn't just kept scraping, but they are still trying to debug their scraper so that it can resume collecting posts:

<p>I've been keeping track of traffic referred to FSE by BoardReader.  Unsurprisingly, this post, written by a Markov bot that lives on a completely different server (and as always, attributed to FSE by BoardReader), is the most frequent URL that people land on if they come from BoardReader:
</p>

<p>Anyone that is putting search terms into BoardReader and getting <em>that</em> post is someone that I would like to discourage from signing up.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_24__Friday__and_subsequent_weeks">2023-03-24 (Friday) and subsequent weeks</h2>
<p>Clearly, sending them emails and making sure that they can't scrape were not working, and they're still trying to fix their scraper, they're still hammering the API endpoint for fetching the posts.  Pedophiles are still landing on FSE, coming from boardreader.com.  That was the issue from the beginning, and it's been weeks.  I want to open the timelines back up, re-open registrations.  We've been on lockdown too long!  Plus, the site is slow as hell because BoardReader is choking my server (even though they're getting no data, they're still sending multiple requests per second), and on top of that, I'm paying bandwidth overage charges.
</p>
<p>Since I've talked to them and got them to agree and I've stopped sending them data, and they're still trying to get around the restrictions and still sending pedophiles, I've exhausted reasonable methods.
</p>
<p>So I grab some samples of the timeline, and bash out a small <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100127161358/http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/">CGI script</a>:  it just does string substitutions, mashing together accounts that do not exist and generating posts that do not exist.  (Initially the IDs were just random 32-bit numbers.  Eventually half the number varied per post and half was derived from the timestamp of the request, so I could trace the posts through BoardReader more easily.)  I don't bother making the URLs match actual Pleroma URLs:  why would I?  They just have to be unique.  I also have to start up <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> to serve it:  FSE uses nginx, but since nginx doesn't support CGI scripts (a travesty), I've got to send the requests for that endpoint to lighttpd.  Because I was still all the way in awk mode, of course I just used awk.  For fun, I grabbed some lists of words to include in the posts:  some based on search terms people had used on BoardReader, and then rounded out with the CARNIVORE list.  (First search result; I don't know if it was the real list or not but it didn't really matter.)
</p>
<p>It worked:  you can see <a href="https://archive.is/aDKNA">an archived sample of the gibberish</a> or a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4a30d103f90230ad734aa74e80ef292194a5ad4551946f4a3d4c529ea80831">screenshot of different gibberish</a>.  Of course, it worked beautifully:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1fb168a7c52fa9324326c4c0026488d2088e6493daadff22bdc8a825d606be75" alt="Searching for FSE posts on boardreader.com just gives gibberish">
<p>The only problem was that the scraper loved it <em>too</em> much.  We were suddenly getting DoS'd by their scraper.  So I built in a little delay and then had a fun idea:  jam the BoardReader search terms in.  And I saw something <em>really</em> weird very suddenly:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/7fd1ea217eb279e31a4fae7a6a976fa5be00e5bf65d8b7dfbf322b6b92fd99be" alt="timestamps and a large number of blue 4s and hyphens, explained below">
<p>This is an awk script that draws a histogram of the requests coming into FSE.  The basic idea is really simple:  the first version of it just printed a "." and then when the timestamp changed, it printed a newline, too.  This draws a histogram for you of the number of requests per second, in real-time if you can convince awk not to buffer excessively (e.g., <code>mawk -Winteractive</code>).  By this time, it had gotten somewhat more sophisticated:  the hyphens represent requests that received a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.2">2xx status code</a>, the blue hyphens representing POST requests and the others GETs.  When the request resulted in some other status code, the first digit was printed.  The end of the line contains summary data:  number of requests that second in brackets, followed by the number of 5xx errors, followed by the ratio of server errors to total requests (as a fraction and a percentage) and the average number of requests per second.  Like many scripts that were unreasonably useful and then gew bit by bit (usually under duress, while trying to fix a problem with the server), it is nearly unreadable but is surprisingly compact and reliable.  (<a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1965c57f5e3becafa64b68431d9d279ed6f7bcfcd94933c08a0f2496c8f1fb37">Here is the version that I was running when I took the screenshot</a> for the curious; you probably won't get any direct use out of it unless you're using the same logfile format as me, but if you can read it, it should be pretty straightforward:  it's messy, but not complex.)
</p>
<p>The big field of green-on-blue 4s sticks out:  those are requests that resulted in a 402, in this case almost all originating from Facebook, and all of them requesting URLs matching the fake posts.  Facebook shouldn't have been crawling FSE's public timeline.
</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the random IDs were present in the posts:  the script generating the random gibberish didn't keep any history, because I didn't want the problem of storing infinite random gibberish, but I could match posts on BoardReader to URLs in the webserver logs by just pasting these random IDs into the search form on BoardReader.  So I dropped IDs from the posts into the BoardReader search box, and that more or less confirmed it:  Facebook was fetching these posts shortly after BoardReader indexed them.  Apparently BoardReader was giving Facebook a feed of their data, but it wasn't just that:  there was a common thread in the gibberish, a pattern in the posts that Facebook was interested in.  You can probably guess the hypothesis, the test, and the result:  I opened up the CGI script and, where there had been a long, random list of words to cram into the posts, I replaced it with just one phrase:  "larry fink".
</p>
<p>Almost as soon as I saved the file, Facebook started flooding my server.  I wanted my keystrokes to start echoing again so I un-did it, replacing the list with the previous version except without "larry fink", and the flow slowed to a trickle and then stopped.  Curiosity got the best of me so I re-did it, and after the wait for Boardreader to index it, the flood resumed.
</p>
<p>So the pipeline was my terrible awk script generating JSON that represented gibberish posts, and that went out through lighttpd, then nginx, then it left my machine and went into BoardReader's crawlers, from there into their index (however that was built) and straight out to Facebook, and presumably from there to the FBI, and from there into whatever UI that was that they were using to search.  (Zuckerberg had just testified in Congress that Facebook was critical national infrastructure:  maybe he wasn't lying.)
</p>
<h2 id="Further_Shenanigans">Further Shenanigans</h2>
<p>How <em>do</em> you get BoardReader to stop?  I couldn't get them to respond to emails and filling their database with gibberish wasn't helping.
</p>
<p>So I shoved some more delays in:  eventually I spaced out the writes until they were a trickle designed to finish exactly one second before the timeout happened.  That solved the bandwidth overages:  they were just using a trickle.  For fun, I tossed in a little more randomness:  once in a while, I'd omit some random characters from the end so that it wouldn't parse.  Maybe if the error rate spiked, they'd notice.  You can get partial data out of something like that if you're using an event-based parser or you've structured it to use coroutines or thunks or whatever; the type of thing that builds up a data structure piecemeal and leaves you with a valid (if incomplete) data structure (and this approach can let you work with JSON structures that are too big to fit in memory, of course), but the overwhelming majority of JSON parsers just take a string and give you a data structure or an error:  it's easier to call something like that.  It looks like BoardReader is using the common type, so they spend about a minute on a single request and end up with no useful data.  The situation stays <a href="https://archive.is/U0CNN">exactly like that</a> for a while.
</p>
<p>It's annoying, but I don't have to worry about it too often.  I pop in and tweak the random timeline script's output or its behavior once in a while.  And then I have a pretty evil idea:  I just start putting Dave's phone number into the randomly generated posts.  The following morning I get a reply from Dave:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hey peter, sorry for the radio silence. i've filed a jira ticket this week and hopefully will have an answer for you shortly. if we need any more information i'll loop in one of our engineers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess it worked!  We go back and forth very briefly and they stop scraping pretty quickly, though it takes about a week for them to get FSE out of their index.  It shouldn't take a week for that to happen; whether they were stalling or it actually took that long, I probably won't find out.
</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue___Torswats">Epilogue:  Torswats</h2>
<p>The story wrapped up just short of a year after it started, in a very unexpected way.
</p>
<h2 id="2024_01_18">2024-01-18</h2>
<p>Alan Winston Filion of Lancaster, CA—not too far from <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/3bb1dad6a6d79223a2b49222bc03ab431734f4686acb5029722f2f16aabf61d5">my home</a>—is arrested:  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>.
</p>
<p>Torswats.  The guy responsible for creating hundreds of bomb scares, fake hostage situations.  This was essentially a griefing tactic, and he had a long enough run that he was able to build up a little business making anonymous calls to the police and the FBI.
</p>
<p>It turns out that that's who the FBI was looking for.  That was "WitchKingOfAngmar", which apparently is a "Lord of the Rings" reference.  That was why they were so interested in threats against Larry Fink:  apparently, Torswats had a habit of tirades full of nonsensical threats against Larry Fink.  Apparently there's a lot of information about Torswats on KiwiFarms:  <a href="https://archive.ph/yqwuA">https://archive.ph/yqwuA</a>.
</p>
<p>And that's it:  most of the things that didn't make sense about the story fit together after that.  There are still some murky bits:  what is BoardReader at present?  Just a front to give a plausible excuse to SocialGist to scrape?  Around 2010, scraping social media to find ISIS recruitment got popular, and of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a> was the logical conclusion of that:  is BoardReader even a legitimate site at this point, or just the forum-scraping division of SocialGist?  What was Facebook doing in the pipeline?  Are they providing the FBI with tools for this kind of thing or do they just act as a convenient repository for this kind of data?
</p>
<h2 id="An_Aside___Some_Advice_for_Shady_Jagoffs">An Aside:  Some Advice for Shady Jagoffs</h2>
<p>The best advice is the advice that you are almost guaranteed not to take:  don't scrape fedi, it's evil.
</p>
<p>If you want data from fedi, just make a fake instance and cram it onto a bunch of <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance?software=activityrelay">relays</a>.  You're still a shady jagoff, but at least you don't break anyone else's server, it's easier than scraping, and the data gets delivered to you in real-time and dumped in your database rather than you having to make some Rube Goldberg system to extract it from unwilling participants.
</p>
<p>I usually make a remark like "I wonder why they don't do this" but I can't be sure they're not:  how <em>would</em> you know if anyone actually is doing that?  Maybe the only scrapers we know about are the noisy ones doing conventional scraping and the other ones don't make enough noise to cause problems.  People only noticed newjack.city because it was full of followbots, but you don't need to use followbots any more.  There are several varieties of <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">ActivityPub relay and ActivityPub software</a> and some of them lend themselves to repurposing as a scraper.  As demonstrated by <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/gangstalking.services">gangstalking.services</a> (a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/987672a2f1853b5c21fe8de9e0b8ee012d9e476e0d82c047d72b5fa17061eda5">signed-fetch workaround</a> and <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/61c804fbb9e9d9f83128bde6ddecc7ed20cd404a14f596ff5fa181afbcbf8628">proof of concept</a>) as well as <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/pls.zuck.dad">pls.zuck.dad</a> and other instances, a lot of normal fedi software can be repurposed for this kind of thing.
</p>
<p>So, if you're not a shady asshole and you're just trying to run a server, keep it in mind.  A company like SocialGist can make themselves hard to find:  I only knew about them because they screwed up, but once I knew where to look, it wasn't difficult to create a trail of breadcrumbs.  How many people or organizations are out there doing the same thing, but <em>without</em> SocialGist's mistakes?  How would you know?

Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.</p><figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement"><span></span></figure><p>In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions.</p><p>A childlike feeling of glee filled me as I sat in the rear of the long carriage and watched the city reveal itself as I floated anything from 8 to 9 metres (26ft to 39ft) above it. At the railway’s westernmost end, Vohwinkel is the first of only four stations whose carriages run above the street, between iron arches. The rest of the railway, which in total runs for just over eight miles, follows the route of the river Wupper. As the hanging train curves and sways above the serpentine river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground ride for its 80,000 daily passengers. My hitherto unknown train geek had been unleashed and was utterly delighted.</p><figure id="9d465518-f6d9-4be8-ad10-d49018d42b4d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper.</span> Photograph: Hackenberg-Photo-Cologne/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>The Schwebebahn came about almost by accident. The Wupper valley, about 15 miles east of Düsseldorf, was a major textile production base when Germany was undergoing its own Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As workers flooded to the growing cities of Barmen and Elberfeld – which merged in 1929 and were renamed Wuppertal in 1930 – the authorities realised a public transport system was needed. Other cities were going underground, but Wuppertal’s rocky soil and narrow, steep valley made any sort of U-Bahn impossible, forcing the Schwebebahn’s inventor, Eugen Langen, to look up instead.</p><p>At Schwebodrom, the railway museum that opened in late 2023 near Werther Brücke station at the line’s eastern end, the rich history of the Schwebebahn is laid out in three galleries, revealing one fascinating detail after another. One gallery tells the story of Tuffi, a young circus elephant loaded into the Schwebebahn for a publicity stunt in 1950. Poor Tuffi was so spooked by jostling journalists that she bolted through a window and tumbled into the river. Luckily she was only lightly bruised and lived for another 49 years, her landing spot in the Wupper now marked by an elephant statue between Alter Markt and Adler Brücke stations. You can’t move in Wuppertal without seeing Tuffi on some souvenir or another – even on milk cartons.</p><p>Among the museum’s films and displays, the highlight for me was the reproduction of an original carriage, where I sat glued to my VR headset and found myself in 1920s Wuppertal. After riding the rails in real life, I was able to go back in time to see what had changed. Much of Wuppertal had to be rebuilt after heavy allied bombing in the second world war, and the railway itself has been completely reconstructed – including its art nouveau stations – while keeping the original steampunk-style design in the iron girders.</p><figure id="e88de0a8-dccb-4a0b-9b2a-f42d8e15dcd5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Laurentiusplatz, Wuppertal." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.9751327186365" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Laurentiusplatz, Wuppertal.</span> Photograph: ©Adam Batterbee</figcaption></figure><p>But there is a Wuppertal beyond the Schwebebahn, and this city of about 350,000 people was as full of pleasant surprises as its railway. Local guide Heike Fragemann took me to the tree-lined streets around Laurentiusplatz, a square dominated by the austere-looking 19th-century basilica of St Lawrence, dedicated to Wuppertal’s patron saint. Popular with many of the 23,000 students at the University of Wuppertal as well as people of all ages, the cosmopolitan streets hummed with cafes, delis, boutiques, bars and restaurants run by some of the many nationalities that have settled here over the decades – Italian, Turkish, Greek, Indian, Vietnamese and Spanish among them. In fact, the range of restaurants throughout the city was huge, and also included Lebanese, Chinese, Croatian and traditional German fare.</p><p>Pointing out an example of Wuppertal’s distinctive style of architecture – slate cladding, green shutters and white window frames – Heike led me along the narrow streets behind Laurentiusplatz as we steadily walked uphill. Not only was Wuppertal Germany’s Manchester because of its industry, Heike told me, but it was also compared to San Francisco thanks to its steepness. “We are the city of steps,” she said as we came to yet another one. “We have 500 staircases, more than 12,000 steps within the city. This is the most famous one.” She pointed to a sign with the captivating name of Tippen-Tappen-Tönchen, in honour of those 19th-century workmen clopping in their wooden clogs towards the riverside factories – hence the tipping-tapping sound. One to add to my list of adorable street names.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="584fe0b6-66ec-4fee-8c9c-f5e806a78cbd" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Elisenturm tower sits next to a lily-covered pond in the Botanical Garden in Wuppertal" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Botanical Garden, one of many public gardens in Wuppertal, a city shaped by wealthy 19th-century industrialists.</span> Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>It was the wealthy 19th-century industrialists who shaped the city, not just with their comfortable hillside villas, but also with Wuppertal’s cultural institutions. The Von der Heydt Museum, named after an art-collecting banking family, houses its impressive collection of 19th- and early 20th-century art in what had been the neoclassical town hall. The entrance is flanked by two large sculptures by the Liverpool-born Turner prize-winner Tony Cragg, who made Wuppertal his home in 1977. The Historische Stadthalle concert hall, marking its 125th anniversary this year, had Richard Strauss as one of its first conductors and Sir Simon Rattle rated its acoustics among the best in the world.

Engels died in London six years before the Schwebebahn opened, and it was many years earlier that the city’s industrialists had already implemented social reforms for working-class residents that were ahead of their time. The Schwebebahn, too, looks like something from the future, but its story is purely of Wuppertal’s unique past.

        <p>The promise is seductive: Snap a photo of your meal, and artificial intelligence will instantly tell you exactly how many calories you're consuming. No more tedious manual logging, no more guessing at portion sizes, no more human error. Apps like Cal AI, Lose It!, and MyFitnessPal's new photo features claim to revolutionize calorie tracking by letting your smartphone's camera do the heavy lifting.</p><p>But as someone with a long, complicated history with calorie counting—and admittedly, a somewhat <a href="https://lifehacker.com/fuck-noom-1848442892" target="_blank">cursed expertise in it</a>—I can tell you that counting calories with a photo is exactly as stupid as it sounds.</p><h2 id="how-ai-powered-calorie-counting-is-supposed-to-work">How AI-powered calorie counting is supposed to work</h2><p>Calorie counting apps promise to solve what developers claim is the biggest problem with calorie tracking: human error.

Cal AI markets itself as one of the more sophisticated options in this space, so I decided to see for myself. The app was free for the first three days, then $29.99/year.</p><p>The setup process is straightforward: Download the app, create an account, input basic demographic information, and set your goals. Here's where I encountered my first red flag. The app cheerfully informed me that "losing 10 lbs is a realistic target"—except that losing 10 pounds would actually push me into underweight BMI territory. This kind of blanket statement reveals a concerning lack of nuance about individual health needs.</p><p>Cal AI's photo logging process follows these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Take a clear photo of your food, ideally against a plain background.</p></li><li><p>Make sure all ingredients are visible and well-lit.</p></li><li><p>Include a reference object (like a coin or your hand) for scale.</p></li><li><p>Upload the image and wait for AI analysis.</p></li><li><p>Review and correct the app's identifications and portion estimates.</p></li><li><p>Save the entry to your daily log.</p></li></ol><p>The app provides detailed tips for getting better results: Use natural lighting, avoid shadows, keep the camera parallel to the plate, and ensure no ingredients are hidden. These guidelines sound reasonable in theory, but they hint at the fundamental challenge these apps face—the complexity of real-world eating.</p><h2 id="the-reality-is-wildly-disappointing">The reality is wildly disappointing</h2><p>I started my testing with something simple: a Pink Lady apple weighing 222 grams. Surely this would be an easy win for the AI—apples are among the most photographed foods on earth, with a distinctive shape and color that should be instantly recognizable.</p><p>Cal AI confidently identified my apple as tikka masala.</p><div>

<p>I gave it another chance, this time photographing the apple alongside its barcode and sitting on a kitchen scale displaying its exact weight. The app did recognize it as an apple this time, but estimated it at 80 calories when the <a href="https://www.pinkladyapples.co.uk/the-pink-lady-story/apple-nutrition-vitamins-and-minerals" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">actual count</a> should have been closer to 120. That's a 33% underestimation—not exactly the precision you'd want if you're trying to track intake accurately.</p><p>The real test came with a more complex meal: my current meal-prepped lunch of fried tofu, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, and chickpeas, all generously dressed with an oil-based homemade vinaigrette. This is the kind of mixed dish that presumably showcases AI's advantage over manual logging—no need to search for individual ingredients or estimate their quantities.</p><p>The results were a masterclass in algorithmic overconfidence. The app identified the golden-brown fried tofu as croutons, which I had to manually correct. It did a reasonably good job recognizing the vegetables and feta, but completely whiffed on the oil content. Despite the salad being visibly glistening with dressing, the app estimated the entire dish at 450 calories.</p><p>This estimate was laughably low. A single can of chickpeas contains <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Chickpeas_%28garbanzo_beans%2C_bengal_gram%29%2C_rinsed_in_tap_water%2C_drained%2C_canned%2C_mature_seeds_nutritional_value.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">about 400 calories</a>, and my portion included roughly that amount plus significant quantities of feta cheese and several tablespoons of olive-oil-based dressing. A realistic calorie count for this meal would have been closer to 800 to 900 calories.</p><p>The app's portion estimation proved even more problematic than its ingredient identification. When I photographed a smaller serving—less than a quarter of the original salad—Cal AI estimated it at 250 calories. According to the app's own logic, less than 25% of the meal somehow contained more than 55% of its calories. The math simply doesn't work.</p><div>

<p>This highlights a fundamental limitation of photo-based calorie counting: Cameras capture two-dimensional images of three-dimensional objects. Without consistent reference points or sophisticated depth analysis, estimating volume from photos remains largely guesswork. Even humans struggle with this task, which is why nutrition professionals typically recommend weighing foods for accuracy.</p><p>To get a fuller picture of the AI calorie counting landscape, I also tested two other popular apps: SnapCalorie and Calorie Mama.</p><h2 id="snapcalorie-better-numbers-same-problems">SnapCalorie: better numbers, same problems</h2><p><a href="https://www.snapcalorie.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">SnapCalorie</a> did immediately assuage some skepticism by suggesting a much more reasonable daily calorie target of 1,900 calories, compared to Cal AI's problematic weight loss messaging. However, this accuracy comes at a steep price—$79.99 per year after just a one-week free trial, making it the most expensive option I tested.</p><p>The app does offer one interesting feature: an "add note" function that lets you provide additional context about ingredients the camera can't see. In theory, this addresses one of the fundamental limitations of photo-based tracking.</p><div>

<p>When I tested SnapCalorie with the same Pink Lady apple, it performed much better than Cal AI, estimating 115 calories. But the Greek salad test revealed familiar problems. SnapCalorie's initial estimate was an absurdly low 257 calories. When I photographed a smaller portion—the same sub-quarter serving that had stumped Cal AI—SnapCalorie estimated 184 calories. The math still didn't work; this smaller portion should have been roughly 25% of the larger serving, not 70%.</p><p>Determined to give the app a fair shot, I used the note feature to manually specify "full container of tofu, feta, chickpeas and olive oil." With this human intervention, SnapCalorie bumped its estimate to 761 calories—much more reasonable and accurate, though still on the low side. </p><p>But this raises the obvious question: If I need to manually input detailed ingredient information to get accurate results, what exactly is the photo accomplishing? I'm essentially doing the work of traditional calorie counting while going through the motions of taking pictures.</p><div data-ga-click="" data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

<h2 id="calorie-mama-when-ai-doesnt-even-try">Calorie Mama: when AI doesn't even try</h2><p>Calorie Mama provided the most frustrating and laughable experience of the three apps. The interface feels rudimentary, and the AI's performance is so poor that the app essentially abandons the premise of automated photo analysis.</p><p>After uploading a photo, Calorie Mama requires you to manually confirm not just the food items but also their portion sizes. This defeats the entire purpose of photo-based logging—you're doing all the work that manual entry would require anyway.</p><p>When I uploaded my Greek salad photo, Calorie Mama identified it simply as "tofu"—ignoring the vegetables, feta cheese, chickpeas, and dressing entirely. The app then asked me to manually adjust the portion size and seemed to consider the logging complete, as if a complex mixed dish contained nothing but plain tofu.</p><p>This wasn't just inaccurate; it was useless. At least Cal AI and SnapCalorie attempted to recognize multiple ingredients, even if their calorie estimates were off. Calorie Mama appeared to give up on the core challenge entirely, relegating the AI to little more than a gimmicky photo storage system.</p><h2 id="ai-powered-calorie-counting-wasted-my-time">AI-powered calorie counting wasted my time</h2><p>The promise of AI-powered calorie counting is efficiency—snap and go, no manual entry required. But my experience revealed a different reality. I spent considerable time correcting ingredient identifications, adjusting portion sizes, and second-guessing the app's estimates. In many cases, I would have been faster using traditional manual logging with a food scale and database search.</p><p>This creates a frustrating conundrum: If you don't scrutinize the AI's results, you'll get wildly inaccurate data. But if you do verify every entry, you lose the time-saving benefit that justified using the technology in the first place. It's the worst of both worlds—the effort of manual tracking combined with the uncertainty of automated guessing.</p><p>Perhaps most concerning is what happens when users don't have the background to recognize inaccurate estimates. My years of calorie counting experience—<a href="https://lifehacker.com/fuck-noom-1848442892" target="_blank">problematic as that history may be</a>—gave me the knowledge to spot when Cal AI's numbers were off. But what about users who trust the technology?</p><p>Systematic underestimation of calories could be particularly harmful for people trying to lose weight, as it might lead them to believe they're eating less than they actually are. Conversely, overestimation could cause unnecessary restriction or anxiety around food. Either way, inaccurate data undermines the entire purpose of tracking.</p><p>The fundamental issue with AI calorie counting apps isn't just technical—it's philosophical. These tools emerge from and reinforce the idea that precise calorie tracking is both necessary and beneficial for health. But <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28214452/#:~:text=Findings%20highlight%20associations%20between%20use,Fitness%20tracking%3B%20Health%20tracking%20technology." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that obsessive calorie counting may do more harm than good for many people.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-intuitive-eating-1832765380" target="_blank">Intuitive eating</a>, which focuses on internal hunger and satiety cues rather than external metrics, has shown promise as a more sustainable and psychologically healthy approach to nutrition. This framework emphasizes developing a healthy relationship with food based on how it makes you feel rather than hitting specific numerical targets.</p><p>For most people, understanding general principles of balanced nutrition—eating plenty of vegetables, choosing whole grains over refined ones, including adequate protein—provides better long-term outcomes than meticulous calorie tracking. </p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>AI-powered calorie counting apps promise to solve human error in dietary tracking, but they introduce new forms of inaccuracy while maintaining many of the old problems. If your goal is simply to get a rough estimate of how many calories are in generic foods, these apps might provide some value. But for anyone seeking precision in their intake tracking, traditional methods combined with food scales remain more reliable.</p><p>More importantly, I'd question whether precise calorie counting serves your health goals at all. For many people, developing a more intuitive relationship with food—one based on satisfaction, energy levels, and overall well-being rather than numerical targets—leads to better physical and mental health. Maybe the old-fashioned approach of listening to our bodies works better than any algorithm. </p>
