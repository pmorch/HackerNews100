<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>I’ve reached a point in my setup where most of the devices that I use are
based around the coveted USB-C port. This meant that I had a valid reason to get
a few extra because I didn’t yet have a stockpile of good USB-C cables.</p>
<p>That’s when I found out that there exist cables that have little screens on them
that show the power consumption of the connected device. This is a great little
addition
to <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/05/02/smartplugs/">my power consumption monitoring addiction.</a>
It’s also a simple way to understand if your device is charging at the speed
that you expect it to.</p>
<p>The cable I ordered cost 6.72 EUR. It is a bit stiff and hard to work with,
probably due to its supposed USB 4 support requiring actually good cabling and
shielding. It works well enough for an USB-C dock with a DisplayPort
connection that’s running a 3440x1440 display at 60 Hz.</p>
<p>It’s too early to give a definitive answer about the longevity of the cable.</p>
<p>You should be able to find these types of cables with a search query like “USB 4
Cable with LED Display”.</p>
<p>The paranoid side of me suspects that a cable like this one would be an ideal
place to hide a malicious chip. That’s the only downside that I can think of.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in going more in depth with measuring the power consumption
over USB, then you might want to look at other options.
<a href="https://github.com/fqueze/usb-power-profiling?tab=readme-ov-file#power-meters-known-to-work">This GitHub repository lists a few examples of these types of measuring devices.</a></p>

<em>Author: <a href="https://ideogram.ai/">IdeogramAI</a> Prompt: The image shows a typical Google Takeout interface with a large error message indicating that the service is unavailable. In the background, there are frustrated users trying to download their data with unsuccessful attempts, represented by repeated “Failed” and “Retry” notifications.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My current data setup is centered around Google Cloud as a place where I store my data. That’s also related to how I use the whole vendor ecosystem.</p>
<p>The main issue I have with keeping the data only in Google Cloud is data safety. I just don’t want either identity theft or accidental block on my account (by Google) to cut me off from all of my previous photos. You might think it’s something close to impossible, but there are numerous examples of that happening to people - eg. look here <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html</a> And ok, this might be a reasonable approach from Google, but who knows what else can trigger that kind of blockage.</p>
<p>So, to be safe against anything similar or just any other data lose, it would be good to have some backup in place.</p>
<p>An ideal solution right now would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy all the photos to some other cloud</li>
<li>have an offline copy of those files/photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally both of those should happen automatically, according to some predefined schedule. Of course be as maintenance-free as possible.</p>
<p>I have ~200GB of data that I would like backed up on a regular basis. I’d imagine this is not the biggest set of photos a person can have stored there.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>My first approach was to synchronize all the files and all the photos using some syncing tools. Store them on a local hard drive, for future use. But that was less then satisfying. Mainly due to how long the process would take for my size of data.</p>
<p>There’s this open-source python tool <a href="https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync">https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync</a> - but I’m yet to try that. Although they also note on their project page issues with the backup process. Citing from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos are transcoded to lower quality</li>
<li>Raw or Original photos are converted to ‘High Quality’</li>
<li>GPS info is removed from photos metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad, but I could live with that, if treating this as a backup.</p>
<p>There’s also a paid tool <a href="https://photovaultone.com/">https://photovaultone.com/</a> - but it’s just another small vendor lock-in. I’d like to avoid getting deeper into other vendor to be protected from Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-theres-google-takeout">So there’s Google Takeout</h2>
<p>And yet, there’s this Google-offered option, that’s designed as a way to take all your data out of Google Cloud and potentially go to some other vendor, or host that on your own. Great idea! Of course Google, as other BigTech companies was coherced to implement it mainly due to GDPR restrictions - so that any user can take the data he/she owns and move out to other place.
Naturally, I thought I’d use this approach to backup my data.
This seemed even more amazing, as there’s an option to backup directly to other providers - the options are Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Box.</p>
<p>I thought that using Microsoft OneDrive is a good alternative! Especially in terms of provider diversification. Also, the options of the backup would allow me to create a couple of bigger files - and copying those to my local backup would be much easier then doing so with hundreds of thousands of photos.</p>
<p>Choosing Microsoft OneDrive as an intermediate solution is just using another vendor. But the goal is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have the data backed up in another cloud</li>
<li>be able to download the data in bigger chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, it looks nice. You can create a scheduled backup process - that may happen at specified intervals, or you can do it one-time.
You can select data you want to export - be it just Photos, or maybe whole Google Drive, and Calendar, Gmail. Everything is there.</p>
<p>But when it actually needs to happen - that’s where the issues happen.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>the process always fails - no matter what’s the size of a chunk I choose</li>
<li>the logs are kept only for some time, afer 7 days I’m not able to see what happened with the chunks. It’s easy to spot missing files - when you have parts from 1 to 10, but there’s a 7th missing. But what if there are 10 parts but should be 11?</li>
<li>no logs of the process</li>
<li>errors are very cryptic “Failed to backup”</li>
<li>tech support is non-existent - I’ve reached out to the tech support, but they were just passing my issue between different support divisions. Ultimately there were hints like “reinstall your operating system”, “turn it off and on”</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all I don’t see this whole process as <strong>extremely</strong> hard. Also, I totally understand those things may fail. But we, as an industry, know what to do with that. There are retries, informative logging. And here I got none of the above.</p>
<p>So for me, this broadly looks like Google just does not want people to backup their data outside of their cloud, which is super bad!</p>
<h2 id="important-considerations-that-i-may-have-missed">Important considerations that I may have missed</h2>
<p>I share my photo collection with my closest family. I suspect that Google Takeout won’t backup those shared photos. But my purpose <strong>is</strong> to do also copy those.</p>
<p>If I’ll be able to make this process reliable, I’d need to think of data retention on target.</p>
<p>Right now I backup just Google Photos - wanted to move to other parts of the ecosystem, when the backup issues are sorted out.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-actions">Follow-up actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>try other providers - I don’t want to use Dropbox, but perhaps Box would work better then OneDrive?</li>
<li>are there tools that I’ve missed that might actually work?</li>
<li>schedule separate backup processes for other parts of the data stored in Google - they’ll be smaller and maybe that will result in successful backups</li>
<li>monitor the backup process state - based on target drive contents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h2>
<p>So, for know I still do the backups. I accept the issues with Google Takeout. It’s just better to have majority of my data, then to not have any of that.</p>

<h2 id="a-microcontroller-macintosh">A microcontroller Macintosh</h2>

<p>This all started from a conversation about the RP2040 MCU, and building a simple desktop/GUI for it.  I’d made a comment along the lines of “or, just run some old OS”, and it got me thinking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">original Macintosh</a>.</p>

<p>The original Macintosh was released 40.5 years before this post, and is a pretty cool machine especially considering that the hardware is very simple.  <a href="https://www.stevenlevy.com/insanely-great">Insanely Great</a> and <a href="https://folklore.org/">folklore.org</a> are fun reads, and give a glimpse into the Macintosh’s development.  Memory was a squeeze; the original 128KB version was underpowered and only sold for a few months before being replaced by the <em>Macintosh 512K</em>, arguably a more appropriate amount of memory.</p>

<p>But, the 128 still runs <em>some</em> real applications and, though it pre-dates MultiFinder/actual multitasking, I found it pretty charming.  As a tourist.  In 1984 the Mac cost roughly 1/3 as much as a VW Golf and, as someone who’s into old computers and old cars, it’s hard to decide which is more frustrating to use.</p>

<p>So back to this £3.80 RPi Pico microcontroller board:  The RP2040’s 264KB of RAM gives a lot to play with after carving out the Mac’s 128KB – how cool would it be to do a quick hack, and play with a Mac on it?</p>

<p>Time passes.  A lot of time.  But I totally delivered on the janky hack front:</p>

<h2 id="what-is-pico-mac">What is pico-mac?</h2>

<p>A Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller (on a Pico board), driving monochrome VGA video and taking USB keyboard/mouse input, emulating a <em>Macintosh 128K</em> computer and disc storage.  The RP2040 has easily enough RAM to house the Mac’s memory, plus that of the emulator; it’s fast enough (with some tricks) to meet the performance of the real machine, has USB host capability, and the PIO department makes driving VGA video fairly uneventful (with some tricks).  The basic Pico board’s 2MB of flash is plenty for a disc image with OS and software.</p>

<p>Here’s the Pico MicroMac in action, ready for the paperless office of the future:</p>

<p>I hadn’t really used a <em>Mac 128K</em> much before; a few clicks on a museum machine once.  But I knew they ran MacDraw, and MacWrite, and MacPaint.  All three of these applications are pretty cool for a 128K machine; a largely WYSIWYG word processor with multiple fonts, and a vector drawing package.</p>

<p>A great way of playing with early Macintosh system software, and applications of these wonderful machines is via <a href="https://infinitemac.org/">https://infinitemac.org</a>, which has shrinkwrapped running the Mini vMac emulator by emscriptening it to run in the browser.  Highly recommended, lots to play with.</p>

<p>As a spoiler, MicroMac does run MacDraw, and it was great to play with it on “real fake hardware”:</p>

<h2 id="the-journey">The journey</h2>

<p>Back up a bit.  I wasn’t committed to building a Pico thing, but was vaguely interested in whether it was feasible, so started tinkering with building a <em>Mac 128K emulator</em> on my normal computer first.</p>

<h3 id="the-three-rules">The three rules</h3>

<p>I had a few simple rules for this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It had to be fun.  It’s OK to hack stuff to get it working, it’s not as though I’m being paid for this.</li>
  <li>I like writing emulation stuff, but I really don’t want to learn 68K assembler, or much about the 68K.  There’s a lot of love for 68K out there and that’s cool, but meh I don’t adore it as a CPU.  So, right from the outset I wanted to use someone else’s 68K interpreter – I knew there were loads around.</li>
  <li>Similarly, there are a load of OSes whose innards I’d like to learn more about, but the shittiest early Mac System software isn’t high on the list.  Get in there, emulate the hardware, boot the OS as a black box, done.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ended up breaking 2 of and sometimes all 3 of these rules during this project.</p>

<h3 id="the-mac-128k">The Mac 128K</h3>

<p>The machines are generally pretty simple, and of their time.  I started with schematics and <em>Inside Macintosh</em>, PDFs of which covered various details of the original Mac hardware, memory map, mouse/keyboard, etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tinkerdifferent.com/resources/macintosh-128k-512k-schematics.79/">https://tinkerdifferent.com/resources/macintosh-128k-512k-schematics.79/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vintageapple.org/inside_o/">https://vintageapple.org/inside_o/</a> <em>Inside Macintosh Volumes I-III</em> are particularly useful for hardware information; also <em>Guide to Macintosh Family Hardware 2nd Edition</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Macintosh has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Motorola 68000 CPU running at <del>7.whatever MHz</del> roughly 8MHz</li>
  <li>Flat memory, decoded into regions for memory-mapped IO going to the 6522 VIA, the 8530 SCC, and the IWM floppy controller.  (Some of the address decoding is a little funky, though.)</li>
  <li>Keyboard and mouse hang off the VIA/SCC chips.</li>
  <li>No external interrupt controller: the 68K has 3 IRQ lines, and there are 3 IRQ sources (VIA, SCC, programmer switch/NMI).</li>
  <li>“No slots” or expansion cards.</li>
  <li>No DMA controller: a simple autonomous PAL state machine scans video (and audio samples) out of DRAM.  Video is fixed at 512x342 1BPP.</li>
  <li>The only storage is an internal FDD (plus an external drive), driven by the IWM chip.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three Mac models are extremely similar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>Mac 128K</em> and <em>Mac 512K</em> are the same machine, except for RAM.</li>
  <li>The <em>Mac Plus</em> added SCSI to a convenient space in the memory map and an 800K floppy drive, which is double-sided whereas the original was a single 400K side.</li>
  <li>The <em>Mac Plus</em> ROM also supports the 128K/512K, and was an upgrade to create the <em>Macintosh 512Ke</em>.  ‘e’ for Extra ROM Goodness.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Mac Plus</em> ROM supports the HD20 external hard disc, and HFS, <em>and</em> Steve Chamberlin has <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/rom-adapter/plus-rom-listing.asm">annotated a disassembly of it</a>.  This was the ROM to use:  I was making a <em>Macintosh 128Ke</em>.</p>

<h3 id="mac-emulator-umac">Mac emulator: umac</h3>

<p>After about 8 minutes of research, I chose the <a href="https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi">Musashi</a> 68K interpreter.  It’s C, simple to interface to, and had a simple out-of-box example of a 68K system with RAM, ROM, and some IO.  <em>Musashi</em> is structured to be embedded in bigger projects: wire in memory read/write callbacks, a function to raise an IRQ, call execute in a loop, done.</p>

<p>I started building an emulator around it, which ultimately became the <a href="https://github.com/evansm7/umac">umac</a> project.  The first half (of, say, five halves) went pretty well:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A simple commandline app loading the ROM image, allocating RAM, providing debug messages/assertions/logging, and configuring <em>Musashi</em>.</li>
  <li>Add address decoding: CPU reads/writes are steered to RAM, or ROM.  The “overlay” register lets the ROM boot at <code>0x00000000</code> and then trampoline up to a high ROM mirror after setting up CPU exception vectors – this affects the address decoding.  This is done by poking a VIA register, so decoded just that bit of that register for now.</li>
  <li>At this point, the ROM starts running and accessing more non-existent VIA and SCC registers.  Added more decoding and a skeleton for emulating these devices elsewhere – the MMIO read/writes are just stubbed out.</li>
  <li>There are some magic addresses that the ROM accesses that “miss” documented devices: there’s a manufacturing test option that probes for a plugin (just thunk it), and then we witness the RAM size probing.  The <em>Mac Plus</em> ROM is looking for up to 4MB of RAM.  In the large region devoted to RAM, the smaller amount of actual RAM is mirrored over and over, so the probe writes a magic value at high addresses and spots where it starts to wrap around.</li>
  <li>RAM is then initialised and filled with a known pattern.  This was an exciting point to get to because I could dump the RAM, convert the region used for the video framebuffer into an image, and see the “diagonal stripe” pattern used for RAM testing!  <em>“She’s alive!”</em></li>
  <li>Not all of the device code enjoyed reading all zeroes, so there was a certain amount of referring to the disassembly and returning, uh, <code>0xffffffff</code> sometimes to push it further.  The goal was to get it as far as accessing the IWM chip, i.e. trying to load the OS.</li>
  <li>After seeing some IWM accesses there and returning random rubbish values, the first wonderful moment was getting the “Unknown Disc” icon with the question mark – real graphics!  The ROM was <em>REALLY DOING SOMETHING!</em></li>
  <li>I <em>think</em> I hadn’t implemented any IRQs at this point, and found the ROM in an infinite loop: it was counting a few Vsyncs to delay the flashing question mark.  Diversion into a better VIA, with callbacks for GPIO register read/write, and IRQ handling.  This also needed to wire into <em>Musashi</em>’s IRQ functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was motivating to get to – remembering rule #1 – and “graphics”, even though via a manual memory dump/ImageMagick conversion, was great.</p>

<p>I knew the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Woz_Machine">IWM</a> was an “interesting” chip, but didn’t know details.  I planned to figure it out when I got there (rule #1).</p>

<h4 id="iwm-68k-and-disc-drivers">IWM, 68K, and disc drivers</h4>

<p>My god, I’m glad I put IWM off until this point.  If I’d read the “datasheet” (vague register documentation) first, I’d’ve just gone to the pub instead of writing this shitty emulator.</p>

<p>IWM is very clever, but very very low-level.  The disc controllers in other contemporary machines, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital_FD1771">WD1770</a>, abstract the disc physics.  At one level, you can poke regs to step to track 17 and then ask the controller to grab sector 3.  Not so with IWM:  first, the discs are Constant Linear Velocity, meaning the angular rotation needs to change appropriate to whichever track you’re on, and second the IWM just gives the CPU a firehose of crap from the disc head (with minimal decoding).  I spent a while reading through the disassembly of the ROM’s IWM driver (breaking rule #2 and rule #1): there’s some kind of servo control loop where the driver twiddles PWM values sent to a DAC to control the disc motor, measured against a VIA timer reference to do some sort of dynamic rate-matching to get the correct bitrate from the disc sectors.  I think once it finds the track start it then streams the track into memory, and the driver decodes the symbols (more clever encoding) and selects the sector of interest.</p>

<p>I was sad.  Surely <em>Basilisk II</em> and <em>Mini vMac</em> etc. had solved this in some clever way – they emulated floppy discs.  I learned they do not, and do the smart engineering thing instead:  avoid the problem.</p>

<p>The other emulators do quite a lot of ROM patching: the ROM isn’t run unmodified.  You can argue that this then isn’t a perfect hardware emulation if you’re patching out inconvenient parts of the ROM, but so what.  I suspect they were also abiding by a rule #1 too.</p>

<p>I was going to do the same:  I figured out a bit of how the Mac driver interface works (gah, rule #3!) and understood how the other emulators patched this.  They use a custom <em>paravirtualised</em> 68K driver which is copied over the ROM’s IWM driver, servicing <code>.Sony</code> requests from the block layer and routing them to more convenient host-side code to manage the requests.  <em>Basilisk II</em> uses some custom 68K opcodes and a simple driver, and <em>Mini vMac</em> a complex driver with trappy accesses to a custom region of memory.  I reused the <em>Basilisk II</em> driver but converted to access a trappy region (easier to route: just emulate another device).  The driver callbacks land in the host/C side and some cut-down <em>Basilisk II</em> code interprets the requests and copies data to/from the OS-provided buffers.  Right now, all I needed was to read blocks from one disc:  I didn’t need different formats (or even write support), or multiple drives, or ejecting/changing images.</p>

<p>Getting the first block loaded from disc took waaaayyy longer than the first part.  And, I’d had to learn a bit of 68K (gah), but just in the nick of time I got a Happy Mac icon as the System software started to load.</p>

<p>This was still a simple Linux commandline application, with zero UI.  No keyboard or mouse, no video.  Time to wrap it in an SDL2 frontend (the <code>unix_main</code> test build in the <code>umac</code> project), and I could watch the screen redraw live.  I hadn’t coded the 1Hz timer interrupt into the VIA, and after adding that it booted to a desktop!</p>

<figcaption>The first boot</figcaption></figure>

<p>As an aside, I try to create a dual-target build for all my embedded projects, with a native host build for rapid prototyping/debugging; libSDL instead of an LCD.  It means I don’t need to code <em>at</em> the MCU, so I can code in the garden.  :)</p>

<p>Next was mouse support.  <em>Inside Macintosh</em> and the schematics show how it’s wired, to the VIA (good) and the SCC (a beast).  The SCC is my second least-favourite chip in this machine; it’s complex and the datasheet/manual seems to be intentionally written to hide information, piss off readers, get one back at the world.  (I didn’t go near the serial side, its main purpose, just external IRQ management.  But, it’ll do all kinds of exciting 1980s line coding schemes, offloading bitty work from the CPU.  It was key for supporting things like AppleTalk.)</p>

<p>Life was almost complete at this point; with a working mouse I could build a new disc image (using <em>Mini vMac</em>, an exercise in itself) with <em>Missile Command</em>.  This game is pretty fun for under 10KB on disc.</p>

<p>So:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Video works</li>
  <li>Boots from disc</li>
  <li>Mouse works, Missile Command</li>
</ul>

<p>I had no keyboard, but it’s largely working now.  Time to start on sub-project numero due:</p>

<h3 id="hardware-and-rp2040">Hardware and RP2040</h3>

<p>Completely unrelated to <code>umac</code>, I built up a circuit and firmare with two goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Display 512x342x1 video to VGA with minimal components,</li>
  <li>Get the TinyUSB HID example working and integrated.</li>
</ol>

<p>This would just display a test image copied to a framebuffer, and <code>printf()</code> keyboard/mouse events, as a PoC.  The video portion was fun:  I’d done some <code>I2S</code> audio PIO work before, but here I wanted to scan out video and arbitrarily control Vsync/Hsync.</p>

<p>Well, to test I needed a circuit.  VGA wants 0.7V max on the video R,G,B signals and (mumble, some volts) on the syncs.  The R,G,B signals are 75Ω to ground:  with some maths, a 3.3V GPIO driving all three through a 100Ω resistor is roughly right.</p>

<p>The day I started soldering it together I needed a VGA connector.  I had a DB15 but wanted it for another project, and felt bad about cutting up a VGA cable.  But when I took a walk at lunchtime, no shitting you, I passed some street cables.  I had a VGA cable – the rust helps with the janky aesthetic.</p>

<figcaption>Free VGA cable</figcaption></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/evansm7/pico-mac/blob/main/src/pio_video.pio">VGA PIO side</a> was pretty fun.  It ended up as PIO reading config info dynamically to control Hsync width, display position, and so on, and then some tricks with DMA to scan out the config info interleaved with framebuffer data.  By shifting the bits in the right direction and by using the byteswap option on the RP2040 DMA, the big-endian Mac framebuffer can be output directly without CPU-side copies or format conversion.  Cool.  This can be fairly easily re-used in other projects: see <a href="https://github.com/evansm7/pico-mac/blob/main/src/video.c">video.c</a>.</p>

<p>But.  I ended up (re)writing the video side three times in total:</p>

<p>First version had two DMA channels writing to the PIO TX FIFO.  The first would transfer the config info, then trigger the second to transfer video data, then raise an IRQ.  The IRQ handler would then have a short time (the FIFO depth!) to choose a new framebuffer address to read from, and reprogram DMA.  It worked OK, but was highly sensitive to other activity in the system.  First and most obvious fix is that any latency-sensitive IRQ handler <em>must</em> have the <code>__not_in_flash_func()</code> attribute so as to run out of RAM.  But even with that, the design didn’t give much time to reconfigure the DMA:  random glitches and blanks occurred when moving the mouse rapidly.</p>

<p>Second version did double-buffering with the goal of making the IRQ handler’s job trivial: poke in a pre-prepared DMA config quickly, then after the critical rush calculate the buffer to use for next time.  Lots better, but still some glitches under some high load.  Even weirder, it’d sometimes just blank out completely, requiring a reset.  This was puzzling for a while; I ended up printing out the PIO FIFO’s <code>FDEBUG</code> register to try to catch the bug in the act.  I saw that the <code>TXOVER</code> overflow flag was set, and this should be impossible: the FIFOs pull data from DMA on demand with DMA requests and a credited flow-contr…OH WAIT.  If credits get messed up or duplicated, too many transfers can happen, leading to an overflow at the receiver side.</p>

<p>Well, I’d missed a subtle rule in the RP2040 DMA docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another caveat is that multiple channels should not be connected to the same DREQ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the third version…… doesn’t break this rule, and is more complicated as a result:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One DMA channel transfers to the PIO TX FIFO</li>
  <li>Another channel programs the first channel to send from the config data buffer</li>
  <li>A third channel programs the first to send the video data</li>
  <li>The programming of the first triggers the corresponding “next reprogram me” channel</li>
</ul>

<p>The nice thing – aside from no lock-ups or video corruption – is that this now triggers a Hsync IRQ during the video line scan-out, greatly relaxing the deadline of reconfiguring the DMA.  I’d like to further improve this (with yet another DMA channel) to transfer without an IRQ per line, as the current IRQ overhead of about 1% of CPU time can be avoided.</p>

<p>(It would’ve been simpler to just hardwire the VGA display timing in the PIO code, but I like (for future projects) being able to dynamically-reconfigure the video mode.)</p>

<p>So now we have a platform and firmware framework to embed <code>umac</code> into, HID in and video out.  The hardware’s done, fuggitthat’lldo, let’s throw it over to the software team:</p>

<figcaption>How it all works</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="back-to-emulating-things">Back to emulating things</h3>

<p>A glance at the native <code>umac</code> binary showed a few things to fix before it could run on the Pico:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Musashi</em> constructed a <em>huge</em> opcode decode jumptable at runtime, in RAM.  It’s never built differently, and never changes at runtime.  I added a <em>Musashi</em> build-time generator so that this table could be <code>const</code> (and therefore live in flash).</li>
  <li>The disassembler was large, and not going to be used on the Pico, so another option to build without.</li>
  <li><em>Musashi</em> tries to accurately count execution cycles for each instruction, with more large lookup tables.  Maybe useful for console games, but the Mac doesn’t have the same degree of timing sensitivity.  <em>REMOVED</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(This work is in my <a href="https://github.com/evansm7/Musashi/commits/small-build/">small-build</a> branch.)</p>

<p><code>pico-mac</code> takes shape, with the ROM and disc image in flash, and enjoyably it now builds and runs on the Pico!  With some careful attention to not shoving stuff in RAM, the RAM use is looking pretty good.  The emulator plus HID code is using about 35-40KB on top of the Mac’s 128KB RAM area – there’s 95+KB of RAM still free.</p>

<p>This was a good time to finish off adding the keyboard support to <code>umac</code>.  The Mac keyboard is interfaced serially through the VIA ‘shift register’, a basic synchronous serial interface.  This was logically simple, but frustrating because early attempts at replying to the ROM’s “init” command just were persistently ignored.  The ROM disassembly was super-useful again: reading the keyboard init code, it looked like a race condition in interrupt acknowledgement if the response byte appears too soon after the request is sent.  Shoved in a delay to hold off a reply until a later poll, and then it was just a matter of mapping keycodes (boooooorrrriiiiing).</p>

<p>With a keyboard, the end-of-level MacWrite boss is reached:</p>

<p><a href="https://axio.ms/images/umac/umac_macwrite.jpg"> 
    <img src="https://axio.ms/assets/resized/2048/umac_macwrite.jpg" srcset="            https://axio.ms/assets/resized/480/umac_macwrite.jpg 480w,            https://axio.ms/assets/resized/800/umac_macwrite.jpg 800w,            https://axio.ms/assets/resized/1400/umac_macwrite.jpg 1400w,            https://axio.ms/assets/resized/2048/umac_macwrite.jpg 2048w,    " width="100%" alt=" ">
 </a></p>

<p>One problem though:  it totally sucked.  It was suuuuper slow.  I added a 1Hz dump of instruction count, and it was doing about 300 KIPS.</p>

<p>The 68000 isn’t an amazing CPU in terms of IPC.  Okay, there are some instructions that execute in 4 cycles.  But you want to use those extravagant addressing modes don’t you, and touching memory is spending those cycles all over the place.  Not an expert, but targeting about 1 MIPS for an about 8MHz 68000 seems right.  Only 3x improvement needed.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>I didn’t say I wasn’t gonna cheat:  let’s run that Pico at 250MHz instead of 125MHz.  Okay better, but not 2x better.  From memory, only about 30% better.  Damn, no free lunch today.</p>

<p><em>Musashi</em> has a lot of configurable options.  My first goal was to get its main loop (as seen from disassembly/post-compile end!) small:  the Mac doesn’t report Bus Errors, so the registers don’t need copies for unwinding.  The opcodes are always fetched from a 16b boundary, so don’t need alignment checking, and can use halfword loads (instead of two byte loads munged into a halfword!).  For the Cortex-M0+/<code>armv6m</code> ISA, reordering some of the CPU context structure fields enabled immediate-offset access and better code.  The CPU type, mysteriously, was dynamically-changeable and led to a bunch of runtime indirection.</p>

<p>Looking better, maybe 2x improvement, but not enough.  <em>Missile Command</em> was still janky and the mouse wasn’t smooth!</p>

<p>Next, some naughty/dangerous optimisations: remove address alignment checking, because unaligned accesses don’t happen <em>in this constrained environment</em>.</p>

<p>(Then, this work is in my <a href="https://github.com/evansm7/Musashi/commits/umac-hacks">umac-hacks</a> branch.)</p>

<p>But the real perf came from a different trick.  First, a diversion!</p>

<h4 id="rp2040-memory-access">RP2040 memory access</h4>

<p>The RP2040 has fast RAM, which is multi-banked so as to allow generally single-cycle access to multiple users (2 CPUs, DMA, etc.).  Out of the box, most code runs via XIP from external QSPI flash.  The QSPI usually runs at the core clock (125MHz default), but has a latency of ~20 cycles for a random word read.  The RP2040 uses a relatively simple 16KB cache in front of the flash to protect you from horrible access latency, but the more code you have the more likely you are to call a function and have to crank up QSPI.  When overclocking to 250MHz, the QSPI can’t go that fast so stays at 125MHz (I think).  Bear in mind, then, that your 20ish QSPI cycles on a miss become 40ish CPU cycles.</p>

<p>The particular rock-and-a-hard-place here is that <em>Musashi</em> build-time generates a ton of code, a function for each of its 1968 opcodes, plus that 256KB opcode jumptable.  Even if we make the inner execution loop completely free, the opcode dispatch might miss in the flash cache, and the opcode function itself too.  (If we want to get 1 MIPS out of about 200 MIPS, a few of these delays are going to really add up.)</p>

<p>The <code>__not_in_flash_func()</code> attribute can be used to copy a given function into RAM, guaranteeing fast execution.  At the very minimum, the main loop and memory accessors are decorated:  every instruction is going to access an opcode and most likely read or write RAM.</p>

<p>This improves performance a few percent.</p>

<p>Then, I tried decorating whole classes of opcodes: <code>move</code> is frequent, as are branches, so put ‘em in RAM.  This helped a lot, but the remaining free RAM was used up very quickly, and I wasn’t at my goal of much above 1 MIPS.</p>

<p>Remember that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC architecture</a> is gonna change everything?</p>

<p>We want to put some of those 1968 68K opcodes into RAM to make them fast.  What are the top 10 most often-used instructions?  Top 100?  By adding a 64K table of counters to <code>umac</code>, booting the Mac and running key applications (okay, playing <em>Missile Command</em> for a bit), we get a profile of dynamic instruction counts.  It turns out that the 100 hottest opcodes (5% of the total) account for 89% of the execution.  And the top 200 account for a whopping 98% of execution.</p>

<p>Armed with this profile, the <code>umac</code> build post-processes the <em>Musashi</em> auto-generated code and decorates the top 200 functions with <code>__not_in_flash_func()</code>.  This adds only 17KB of extra RAM usage (leaving 95KB spare), and hits about 1.4 MIPS!  Party on!</p>

<p>At last, the world can enjoy <em>Missile Command</em>’s dark subject matter in performant comfort:</p>

<h3 id="what-about-macpaint">What about MacPaint?</h3>

<p>Everyone loves MacPaint.  Maybe <em>you</em> love MacPaint, and have noticed I’ve deftly avoided mentioning it.  Okay, FINE:</p>

<p><img src="https://axio.ms/images/umac/macpaint_mem.png" alt="There is not enough memory for MacPaint!"></p>

<p>It doesn’t run on a <em>Mac 128Ke</em>, because the <em>Mac Plus</em> ROM uses more RAM than the original.  :sad-face:</p>

<p>I’d seen this thread on 68kMLA about a “Mac 256K”: <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/the-mythical-mac-256k.46149/">https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/the-mythical-mac-256k.46149/</a>  Chances are that the <em>Mac 128K</em> was really a <em>Mac 256K</em> in the lab (or maybe even intended to have 256K and cost-cut before release), as the OS functions fine with 256KB.</p>

<p>I wondered, does the Mac ROM/OS need a power-of-two amount of RAM?  If not, I have that 95K going spare.  Could I make a “Mac 200K”, and then run precious MacPaint?</p>

<p>Well, I tried a local hack that patches the ROM to update its global <code>memTop</code> variable based on a given memory size, and yes, System 3.2 is happy with non-power-of-2 sizes.  I booted with 256K, 208K, and 192K.  However, there were some additional problems to solve:  the ROM memtest craps itself without a power-of-2 size (totally fair), and NOPping that out leads to other issues.  These can be fixed, though also some parts of boot access off the end of RAM.  A power-of-2 size means a cheap address mask wraps RAM accesses to the valid buffer, and that can’t be done with 192K.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I then tested MacPaint it <em>still</em> wouldn’t run because it wanted to write a scratch file to the read-only boot volume.  This is totally breaking rule #1 by this point, so we are staying with 128KB for now.</p>

<p>However, a 256K MicroMac is extremely possible.  We just need an MCU with, say, 300KB of RAM…  Then we’d be cooking on gas.</p>

<p>The <b>bouba/kiki effect</b>, or <b>kiki/bouba effect</b>, is a non-arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(psychology)" title="Association (psychology)">mental association</a> between certain speech sounds and certain visual shapes. Most narrowly, it is the tendency for people, when presented with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_word" title="Nonsense word">nonsense words</a> <i>bouba</i>  and <i>kiki</i> , to associate <i>bouba</i> with a rounded shape and <i>kiki</i> with a spiky shape. Its discovery dates back to the 1920s, when psychologists documented experimental participants as connecting nonsense words to shapes in consistent ways. There is a strong general tendency towards the effect worldwide; it has been robustly confirmed across a majority of cultures and languages in which it has been researched,<sup id="cite_ref-Cwiek_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Cwiek-1">[1]</a></sup> for example including among English-speaking American university students, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> speakers in India, speakers of certain languages with no writing system, young children, infants, and (though to a much lesser degree) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_blindness" title="Congenital blindness">congenitally blind</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cwiek_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Cwiek-1">[1]</a></sup> It has also been shown to occur with familiar names.

He describes the different "strategies" participants developed to match words to drawings and quotes their reasoning. He also describes situations where participants described very specific forms that they associated with a nonsense word, without reference to the shown drawings. He develops a theory of four factors that influence the way names for objects are decided.
</p><p>In total, there were 42 words. For one particular drawing, 45% picked the same word. For three others, the percentages were 40%. Uznadze points out that this is significantly more overlap than one could expect, given the high number of possible words. He speculates that there must therefore be certain regularities "which the human soul follows in the process of name-giving".

<p>In 2001, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._S._Ramachandran" title="V. S. Ramachandran">V. S. Ramachandran</a> and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words "kiki" and "bouba" and asked American college undergraduates and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> speakers in India, "Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as "bouba" and the jagged one as "kiki", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds consistently.<sup id="cite_ref-Rama2001_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Rama2001-7">[7]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s).

</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Maurer" title="Daphne Maurer">Daphne Maurer</a> and colleagues showed that even children as young as 2<span><span>1</span>⁄<span>2</span></span> years old may show this preference.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> More recent work by Ozge Ozturk and colleagues in 2013 showed that even 4-month-old infants have the same sound–shape mapping biases as adults and toddlers.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Infants are able to differentiate between congruent trials (pairing an angular shape with "kiki" or a curvy shape with "bubu") and incongruent trials (pairing a curvy shape with "kiki" or an angular shape with "bubu"). Infants looked longer at incongruent pairings than at congruent pairings. Infants' mapping was based on the combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant" title="Consonant">consonants</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel" title="Vowel">vowels</a> in the words, and neither consonants nor vowels alone sufficed for mapping. These results suggest that some sound–shape mappings precede <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition" title="Language acquisition">language learning</a>, and may in fact aid in language learning by establishing a basis for matching labels to referents and narrowing the hypothesis space for young infants. Adults in this study, like infants, used a combination of consonant and vowel information to match the labels they heard with the shapes they saw. However, this was not the only strategy that was available to them. Adults, unlike infants, were also able to use consonant information alone and vowel information alone to match the labels to the shapes, albeit less frequently than the consonant–vowel combination. When vowels and consonants were put in conflict, adults used consonants more often than vowels.
</p><p>The effect has also been shown to emerge in other contexts, such as when words are paired with evaluative meanings (with "bouba" words associated with positive concepts and "kiki" words associated with negative concepts)<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> or when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as "Molly" with round silhouettes, and names such as "Kate" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (e.g., easygoingness with "round names"; determination with "sharp names"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

<p>Other research suggests that this effect does not occur in all communities,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The bouba/kiki effect seems to be dependent on a long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period" title="Critical period">sensitive period</a>, with high visual capacities in childhood being necessary for its typical development. Although the congenitally blind have been reported to show a bouba/kiki effect, they show a much smaller one for touched shapes than sighted individuals do for visual shapes.<sup id="cite_ref-Fryer2014_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fryer2014-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hamilton-Fletcher2018_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hamilton-Fletcher2018-15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.<sup id="cite_ref-Rama2001_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Rama2001-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 17">: 17 </span></sup> The rounded shape may most commonly be named "bouba" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sounds in "kiki".<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Alternatively, the distinction may be between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_consonant" title="Coronal consonant">coronal</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_consonant" title="Dorsal consonant">dorsal</a> consonants like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_stop" title="Voiceless velar stop">/k/</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant" title="Labial consonant">labial</a> consonants like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_bilabial_stop" title="Voiced bilabial stop">/b/</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The launch of the highly anticipated Starlink Mini dish is imminent. Last week, Starlink got <a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2AWHPW231/7390216.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approval from the FCC</a> for the Mini’s Wifi router. Today, Starlink updated their app with some juicy new details. In this post, I’m going to dive into what we know so far, and show you the first images of the Mini.</p><p>Based on previous FCC documents filed by SpaceX, we know the size of Starlink Mini to be 11.4″ x 9.8″, or about the size of a laptop. Here is a graphic I made to compare the size of the Standard and the Mini:</p><div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.starlinkhardware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-5368&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1920,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1080,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Starlink Standard vs Starlink Mini Size Comparison&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Starlink Standard vs Starlink Mini Size Comparison&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3.jpg" alt="Starlink Standard vs Starlink Mini Size Comparison" srcset="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3.jpg 1920w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Starlink-Standard-Gen-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption>Dimensions of the Standard dish (left) vs Mini dish (right)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Based on the size of the dish, it looks like Starlink Mini will be aimed at portable use cases, such as camping, RV’s, vans, hiking, etc. It’s designed to be easy to store, transport, and deploy. I’m hoping Starlink listens to customer feedback and offers a DC power supply accessory, but many details are still unknown.</p><p>What I do know at this point comes to us from a recent Starlink app update. The app update shows a new shop page for the upcoming Mini dish, as well as developer mode pages. This gives us our first look at the Mini:</p><div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.starlinkhardware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/IMG_3293.jpeg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-6199&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1179,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:704,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Starlink Mini&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Starlink Mini&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1179" height="704" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3293.jpeg" alt="Starlink Mini" srcset="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3293.jpeg 1179w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3293-400x239.jpeg 400w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3293-1024x611.jpeg 1024w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3293-768x459.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1179px) 100vw, 1179px"></figure></div><div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.starlinkhardware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/IMG_3292.jpeg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-6200&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1179,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:693,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Starlink Mini Side View&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Starlink Mini Side View&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1179" height="693" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3292.jpeg" alt="Starlink Mini Side View" srcset="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3292.jpeg 1179w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3292-400x235.jpeg 400w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3292-1024x602.jpeg 1024w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3292-768x451.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1179px) 100vw, 1179px"></figure></div><p>As you can see, the Mini is very similar to the Standard dish, just smaller. It has a similar shape, and even a kickstand.</p><p>The Starlink app update gives us more details about the Mini. If you go into developer mode and play around with the Mini network settings, you notice something interesting. There is no separate router. Devices are connected to the dish itself:</p><div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.starlinkhardware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/IMG_3294.jpeg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-6198&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1179,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:670,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Starlink Mini network page showing connected devices&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Starlink Mini network page showing connected devices&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1179" height="670" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3294.jpeg" alt="Starlink Mini network page showing connected devices" srcset="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3294.jpeg 1179w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3294-400x227.jpeg 400w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3294-1024x582.jpeg 1024w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3294-768x436.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1179px) 100vw, 1179px"></figure></div><p>That can only mean one thing: The Starlink Mini will feature a built-in Wifi router. I’m guessing that, in order to make the Mini as portable as possible, Starlink decided it was best to simplify the system and limit the number of components.</p><p>There are more Wifi details that have been revealed, and that is mesh compatibility. For those of you that might be interested in using the Mini at home, or for larger events where you need additional Wifi coverage, the Mini’s built-in router will be compatible with Starlink mesh. You’ll be able to wirelessly pair another Starlink router to the Mini, as seen in this Starlink app graphic:</p><div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.starlinkhardware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/IMG_3295.jpeg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-6197&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:474px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1179,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1187,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Starlink Mini paired with a mesh router&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Starlink Mini paired with a mesh router&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1017" height="1024" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295-1017x1024.jpeg" alt="Starlink Mini paired with a mesh router" srcset="https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295-1017x1024.jpeg 1017w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295-397x400.jpeg 397w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295-768x773.jpeg 768w, https://www.starlinkhardware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3295.jpeg 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px"></figure></div><p>There you have it, we’ve now seen what the Mini will look like, and how practical it will be for camping and other activities where portability is key. I speculate that Starlink will launch the Mini within the next several weeks, based on the familiar pattern we’ve seen from other product launches. The fact that Starlink created the shop page and updated the app suggests we are very close.</p><p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on the images and details shared in this post. Let’s discuss it in the comments below!</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <section id="numpy-2-0-0-release-notes">

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The release of 2.0 is in progress and the current release overview and
highlights are still in a draft state. However, the highlights should
already list the most significant changes detailed in the full notes below,
and those full notes should be complete (if not copy-edited well enough
yet).</p>
</div>
<p>NumPy 2.0.0 is the first major release since 2006. It is the result of X months
of development since the last feature release by Y contributors, and contains a
large amount of exciting new features as well as a large amount of changes to
both the Python and C APIs.</p>
<p>This major release includes breaking changes that could not happen in a regular
minor (feature) release - including an ABI break, changes to type promotion
rules, and API changes which may not have been emitting deprecation warnings
in 1.26.x. Key documents related to how to adapt to changes in NumPy 2.0, in
addition to these release notes, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html#numpy-2-migration-guide"><span>NumPy 2.0 migration guide</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/depending_on_numpy.html#numpy-2-abi-handling"><span>NumPy 2.0-specific advice</span></a> in
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/depending_on_numpy.html#for-downstream-package-authors"><span>For downstream package authors</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<section id="highlights">
<h2>Highlights<a href="#highlights" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new variable-length string dtype, <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.dtypes.html#numpy.dtypes.StringDType" title="numpy.dtypes.StringDType"><code><span>StringDType</span></code></a> and a new
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.strings.html#module-numpy.strings" title="numpy.strings"><code><span>numpy.strings</span></code></a> namespace with performant ufuncs for string operations,</p></li>
<li><p>Support for <code><span>float32</span></code> and <code><span>longdouble</span></code> in all <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.fft.html#module-numpy.fft" title="numpy.fft"><code><span>numpy.fft</span></code></a> functions,</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the array API standard in the main <code><span>numpy</span></code> namespace.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Performance improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sorting functions (<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html#numpy.sort" title="numpy.sort"><code><span>sort</span></code></a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html#numpy.argsort" title="numpy.argsort"><code><span>argsort</span></code></a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.partition.html#numpy.partition" title="numpy.partition"><code><span>partition</span></code></a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.argpartition.html#numpy.argpartition" title="numpy.argpartition"><code><span>argpartition</span></code></a>)
have been accelerated through the use of the Intel x86-simd-sort and Google
Highway libraries, and may see large (hardware-specific) speedups,</p></li>
<li><p>macOS Accelerate support and binary wheels for macOS &gt;=14, with significant
performance improvements for linear algebra operations on macOS, and wheels
that are about 3 times smaller,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.char.html#module-numpy.char" title="numpy.char"><code><span>numpy.char</span></code></a> fixed-length string operations have been accelerated by
implementing ufuncs that also support <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.dtypes.html#numpy.dtypes.StringDType" title="numpy.dtypes.StringDType"><code><span>StringDType</span></code></a> in
addition to the the fixed-length string dtypes,</p></li>
<li><p>A new tracing and introspection API, <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lib.introspect.opt_func_info.html#numpy.lib.introspect.opt_func_info" title="numpy.lib.introspect.opt_func_info"><code><span>opt_func_info</span></code></a>,
to determine which hardware-specific kernels are available and will be
dispatched to.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Python API improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A clear split between public and private API, with a new
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/module_structure.html#module-structure"><span>module structure</span></a>, and each public function now
available in a single place,</p></li>
<li><p>Many removals of non-recommended functions and aliases. This should make
it easier to learn and use NumPy. The number of objects in the main
namespace decreased by ~10% and in <code><span>numpy.lib</span></code> by ~80%,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.types.html#canonical-python-and-c-types"><span>Canonical dtype names</span></a> and a new
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.isdtype.html#numpy.isdtype" title="numpy.isdtype"><code><span>isdtype</span></code></a> introspection function,</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>C API improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/c-api/array.html#dtype-api"><span>public C API for creating custom dtypes</span></a>,</p></li>
<li><p>Many outdated functions and macros removed, and private internals hidden to
ease future extensibility,</p></li>
<li><p>New, easier to use, initialization functions:
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI" title="PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI"><code><span>PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI</span></code></a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/c-api/ufunc.html#c.PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI" title="PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI"><code><span>PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI</span></code></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Improved behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improvements to type promotion behavior was changed by adopting <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/NEP50">NEP
50</a>. This fixes many user surprises about promotions which
previously often depended on data values of input arrays rather than only
their dtypes.  Please see the NEP and the <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html#numpy-2-migration-guide"><span>NumPy 2.0 migration guide</span></a>
for details as this change can lead to changes in output dtypes and lower
precision results for mixed-dtype operations.</p></li>
<li><p>The default integer type on Windows is now <code><span>int64</span></code> rather than <code><span>int32</span></code>,
matching the behavior on other platforms,</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum number of array dimensions is changed from 32 to 64</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reference guide navigation was signficantly improved, and there is now
documentation on NumPy’s <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/module_structure.html#module-structure"><span>module structure</span></a>,</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/building/index.html#building-from-source"><span>building from source</span></a> documentation was
completely rewritten,</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore there are many changes to NumPy internals, including continuing to
migrate code from C to C++, that will make it easier to improve and maintain
NumPy in the future.</p>
<p>The “no free lunch” theorem dictates that there is a price to pay for all these
API and behavior improvements and better future extensibility. This price is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Backwards compatibility. There are a significant number of breaking changes
to both the Python and C APIs. In the majority of cases, there are clear
error messages that will inform the user how to adapt their code. However,
there are also changes in behavior for which it was not possible to give
such an error message - these cases are all covered in the Deprecation and
Compatibility sections below, and in the <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html#numpy-2-migration-guide"><span>NumPy 2.0 migration guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that there is a <code><span>ruff</span></code> mode to auto-fix many things in Python code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Breaking changes to the NumPy ABI. As a result, binaries of packages that
use the NumPy C API and were built against a NumPy 1.xx release will not
work with NumPy 2.0. On import, such packages will see an <code><span>ImportError</span></code>
with a message about binary incompatibiliy.</p>
<p>It is possible to build binaries against NumPy 2.0 that will work at runtime
with both NumPy 2.0 and 1.x. See <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/depending_on_numpy.html#numpy-2-abi-handling"><span>NumPy 2.0-specific advice</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>All downstream packages that depend on the NumPy ABI are advised to do a
new release built against NumPy 2.0 and verify that that release works with
both 2.0 and 1.26 - ideally in the period between 2.0.0rc1 (which will be
ABI-stable) and the final 2.0.0 release to avoid problems for their users.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Python versions supported by this release are 3.9-3.12.</p>

This includes functions for acquiring and releasing mutexes which lock access
to the string data, as well as packing and unpacking UTF-8 bytestreams from
array entries.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>NPY_NTYPES</span></code> has been renamed to <code><span>NPY_NTYPES_LEGACY</span></code> as it does not
include new NumPy built-in DTypes. In particular the new string DType
will likely not work correctly with code that handles legacy DTypes.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25347">gh-25347</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The C-API now only exports the static inline function versions
of the array accessors (previously this depended on using “deprecated API”).
While we discourage it, the struct fields can still be used directly.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25789">gh-25789</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>NumPy now defines <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_Pack" title="PyArray_Pack"><code><span>PyArray_Pack</span></code></a> to set an individual memory
address.  Unlike <code><span>PyArray_SETITEM</span></code> this function is equivalent to setting
an individual array item and does not require a NumPy array input.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25954">gh-25954</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code><span>-&gt;f</span></code> slot has been removed from <code><span>PyArray_Descr</span></code>.
If you use this slot, replace accessing it with
<code><span>PyDataType_GetArrFuncs</span></code> (see its documentation and the
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html#numpy-2-migration-guide"><span>NumPy 2.0 migration guide</span></a>). In some cases using other functions like
<code><span>PyArray_GETITEM</span></code> may be an alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>PyArray_GETITEM</span></code> and <code><span>PyArray_SETITEM</span></code> now require the import of the
NumPy API table to be used and are no longer defined in <code><span>ndarraytypes.h</span></code>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25812">gh-25812</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to runtime dependencies, the definition for functionality accessing
the dtype flags was moved from <code><span>numpy/ndarraytypes.h</span></code> and is only available
after including <code><span>numpy/ndarrayobject.h</span></code> as it requires <code><span>import_array()</span></code>.
This includes <code><span>PyDataType_FLAGCHK</span></code>, <code><span>PyDataType_REFCHK</span></code> and

<li><p>The dtype flags on <code><span>PyArray_Descr</span></code> must now be accessed through the
<code><span>PyDataType_FLAGS</span></code> inline function to be compatible with both 1.x and 2.x.
This function is defined in <code><span>npy_2_compat.h</span></code> to allow backporting.
Most or all users should use <code><span>PyDataType_FLAGCHK</span></code> which is available on
1.x and does not require backporting.
Cython users should use Cython 3.  Otherwise access will go through Python
unless they use <code><span>PyDataType_FLAGCHK</span></code> instead.</p>

these arguments from static constants. The <code><span>types</span></code> and <code><span>data</span></code> arguments are

<p><code><span>NPY_MAXDIMS</span></code> is now 64, you may want to review its use.  This is usually
used in a stack allocation, where the increase should be safe.
However, we do encourage generally to remove any use of <code><span>NPY_MAXDIMS</span></code> and

For the conversion helper and C-API functions mirroring Python ones such as
<code><span>take</span></code>, <code><span>NPY_MAXDIMS</span></code> was used to mean <code><span>axis=None</span></code>. Such usage must be

<p>Since <code><span>NPY_MAXARGS</span></code> was increased, it is now a runtime constant and not

it now must be replaced with a custom constant using <code><span>NPY_MAXARGS</span></code> as an

<h3>Improved CPU optimization tracking<a href="#improved-cpu-optimization-tracking" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A new tracer mechanism is available which enables tracking of the enabled
targets for each optimized function (i.e., that uses hardware-specific SIMD
instructions) in the NumPy library. With this enhancement, it becomes possible
to precisely monitor the enabled CPU dispatch targets for the dispatched
functions.</p>
<p>A new function named <code><span>opt_func_info</span></code> has been added to the new namespace

<h3>A new Meson backend for <code><span>f2py</span></code><a href="#a-new-meson-backend-for-f2py" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><code><span>f2py</span></code> in compile mode (i.e. <code><span>f2py</span> <span>-c</span></code>) now accepts the <code><span>--backend</span> <span>meson</span></code>
option. This is the default option for Python &gt;=3.12. For older Python versions,
<code><span>f2py</span></code> will still default to <code><span>--backend</span> <span>distutils</span></code>.</p>
<p>To support this in realistic use-cases, in compile mode <code><span>f2py</span></code> takes a
<code><span>--dep</span></code> flag one or many times which maps to <code><span>dependency()</span></code> calls in the
<code><span>meson</span></code> backend, and does nothing in the <code><span>distutils</span></code> backend.</p>
<p>There are no changes for users of <code><span>f2py</span></code> only as a code generator, i.e. without <code><span>-c</span></code>.</p>

<p>The various FFT routines in <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.fft.html#module-numpy.fft" title="numpy.fft"><code><span>numpy.fft</span></code></a> now do their calculations natively in
float, double, or long double precision, depending on the input precision,
instead of always calculating in double precision. Hence, the calculation will
now be less precise for single and more precise for long double precision.
The data type of the output array will now be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all FFT routines have gained an <code><span>out</span></code> argument that can be used
for in-place calculations.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The underlying C types for all of NumPy’s complex types have been changed to
use C99 complex types.</p></li>
<li><p>While this change does not affect the memory layout of complex types, it
changes the API to be used to directly retrieve or write the real or
complex part of the complex number, since direct field access (as in <code><span>c.real</span></code>
or <code><span>c.imag</span></code>) is no longer an option. You can now use utilities provided in
<code><span>numpy/npy_math.h</span></code> to do these operations, like this:</p>

<li><p>A new public <code><span>np.lib.array_utils</span></code> submodule has been introduced and it

<h3>Representation of NumPy scalars changed<a href="#representation-of-numpy-scalars-changed" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As per <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0051-scalar-representation.html#nep51" title="(in NumPy Enhancement Proposals)"><span>NEP 51</span></a>, the scalar representation has been
updated to include the type information to avoid confusion with
Python scalars.</p>
<p>Scalars are now printed as <code><span>np.float64(3.0)</span></code> rather than just <code><span>3.0</span></code>.
This may disrupt workflows that store representations of numbers
(e.g., to files) making it harder to read them. They should be stored as
explicit strings, for example by using <code><span>str()</span></code> or <code><span>f"{scalar!s}"</span></code>.
For the time being, affected users can use <code><span>np.set_printoptions(legacy="1.25")</span></code>
to get the old behavior (with possibly a few exceptions).
Documentation of downstream projects may require larger updates,
if code snippets are tested.  We are working on tooling for
<a href="https://github.com/scientific-python/pytest-doctestplus/issues/107">doctest-plus</a>

<section id="truthiness-of-numpy-strings-changed">
<h3>Truthiness of NumPy strings changed<a href="#truthiness-of-numpy-strings-changed" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>NumPy strings previously were inconsistent about how they defined
if the string is <code><span>True</span></code> or <code><span>False</span></code> and the definition did not
match the one used by Python.
Strings are now considered <code><span>True</span></code> when they are non-empty and
<code><span>False</span></code> when they are empty.
This changes the following distinct cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Casts from string to boolean were previously roughly equivalent
to <code><span>string_array.astype(np.int64).astype(bool)</span></code>, meaning that only
valid integers could be cast.
Now a string of <code><span>"0"</span></code> will be considered <code><span>True</span></code> since it is not empty.
If you need the old behavior, you may use the above step (casting
to integer first) or <code><span>string_array</span> <span>==</span> <span>"0"</span></code> (if the input is only ever <code><span>0</span></code> or <code><span>1</span></code>).
To get the new result on old NumPy versions use <code><span>string_array</span> <span>!=</span> <span>""</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>np.nonzero(string_array)</span></code> previously ignored whitespace so that
a string only containing whitespace was considered <code><span>False</span></code>.
Whitespace is now considered <code><span>True</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This change does not affect <code><span>np.loadtxt</span></code>, <code><span>np.fromstring</span></code>, or <code><span>np.genfromtxt</span></code>.
The first two still use the integer definition, while <code><span>genfromtxt</span></code> continues to
match for <code><span>"true"</span></code> (ignoring case).
However, if <code><span>np.bool_</span></code> is used as a converter the result will change.</p>
<p>The change does affect <code><span>np.fromregex</span></code> as it uses direct assignments.</p>

<p>Due to the actual use of these types almost always matching the use of

This has no effect on the vast majority of machines since the size

<p>NumPy will pass <code><span>copy</span></code> to the <code><span>__array__</span></code> special method in situations where

<h3>Cleanup of initialization of <code><span>numpy.dtype</span></code> with strings with commas<a href="#cleanup-of-initialization-of-numpy-dtype-with-strings-with-commas" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The interpretation of strings with commas is changed slightly, in that a
trailing comma will now always create a structured dtype.  E.g., where
previously <code><span>np.dtype("i")</span></code> and <code><span>np.dtype("i,")</span></code> were treated as identical,
now <code><span>np.dtype("i,")</span></code> will create a structured dtype, with a single
field. This is analogous to <code><span>np.dtype("i,i")</span></code> creating a structured dtype
with two fields, and makes the behaviour consistent with that expected of
tuples.</p>
<p>At the same time, the use of single number surrounded by parenthesis to
indicate a sub-array shape, like in <code><span>np.dtype("(2)i,")</span></code>, is deprecated.
Instead; one should use <code><span>np.dtype("(2,)i")</span></code> or <code><span>np.dtype("2i")</span></code>.
Eventually, using a number in parentheses will raise an exception, like is the
case for initializations without a comma, like <code><span>np.dtype("(2)i")</span></code>.</p>

the sign of the imaginary part was returned).  Like for real numbers,

<p>Functions that returned a list of ndarrays have been changed to return a tuple

<p><code><span>np.can_cast</span></code> cannot be called with Python int, float, or complex instances
anymore.  This is because NEP 50 means that the result of <code><span>can_cast</span></code> must
not depend on the value passed in.
Unfortunately, for Python scalars whether a cast should be considered
<code><span>"same_kind"</span></code> or <code><span>"safe"</span></code> may depend on the context and value so that
this is currently not implemented.
In some cases, this means you may have to add a specific path for:
<code><span>if</span> <span>type(obj)</span> <span>in</span> <span>(int,</span> <span>float,</span> <span>complex):</span> <span>...</span></code>.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing problems due to an upstream header including NumPy,
the solution is to make sure you <code><span>#include</span> <span>"numpy/ndarrayobject.h"</span></code> before

<p>A pairwise observation approach is currently used in <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ma.corrcoef.html#numpy.ma.corrcoef" title="numpy.ma.corrcoef"><code><span>ma.corrcoef</span></code></a> to
calculate the standard deviations for each pair of variables. This has been

<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ma.cov.html#numpy.ma.cov" title="numpy.ma.cov"><code><span>ma.cov</span></code></a>, which does not consider the observations for each variable in a
pairwise manner, rendering it unnecessary. The normalisation has been
replaced by the more appropriate standard deviation for each variable,
which significantly reduces the wall time, but will return slightly different
estimates of the correlation coefficients in cases where the observations
between a pair of variables are not aligned. However, it will return the same
estimates in all other cases, including returning the same correlation matrix
as <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html#numpy.corrcoef" title="numpy.corrcoef"><code><span>corrcoef</span></code></a> when using a masked array with no masked values.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Some time last year while watching a video I got jumpscared by a logo that used a font that is immediately recognizable as <!-- --><em>the Quake font<!-- --></em>, and they used it at the very least 20+ years before Quake 1 even came out. This made me realize that <!-- --><em>the Quake font<!-- --></em> wasn't drawn completely from scratch and that it's probably possible to find it, most likely in a book or a digitization by someone.<!-- --></p><div><hr>

This has been nagging me for some time and I've made several unsuccessful attempts at trying to find it before, but recently I've come across Dan X. Solo's "The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces", 1992, and under "Stencil fonts" on the page 119 surprisingly actually found a sample for a font named "Visa", as pictured above. Checking Dan X. Solo's other books lead me to an earlier book named "Stencil Alphabets: 100 Complete Fonts", published in 1988, and turns out there's an entire page dedicated to this font showing the entire alphabet and numbers and other characters.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/cb178dcc-fea9-403a-bcba-bebb404b8d7d/e9780486168883_i0098.jpg" alt=""><br>
While differences between this sample and both the Schott logo and final result in Quake are present, similarities between most of letterforms and some really specific ones like X and Y make me believe that Visa (or, more likely, its progenitor or a derivative because legally it's a typography free-for-all out there with everyone ripping off each other) was in fact used as a base for the Quake font.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>edit: According to <!-- --><a href="http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44242.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Luc Devroye's "On Snot and Fonts"<!-- --></a>, original Visa font's designer is Raphael Boguslav.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p>His typeface Avia (VGC) was an expansion of a logofont he did for Abex Corporation, almost like a stencil. It is now at Font Bureau, where Jill Pichotta has added the Light and Bold in 2000. His typeface Visa (1966, VGC) won the Second Prize in the 1966 VGC National Type Face Design Competition. Others (thanks, Alexander Tochilovsky) confirm what I thought---that Visa and Avia are the same thing.<!-- --></p>

The reverse is also true: Japanese people find a curious phonetic correspondence between their language and most African languages.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKGPHxg2vWy_cisaKH6ry9hPwULEtZsaqTseBZKfXidmXOCmczY4FhHYhBB4f3SsDiS_W8EM8IQH2qg_toA94ez_WmAjh69UqBLReN2PKz6nh2y75l3YLZZ0VueHnz0YURpn5NaREe4v-8ol88tML1L1ob6Xk-d025Ja5ImTrpasCFXpq5eODfrRfA/s960/Japanese%20and%20Africans.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="720" data-original-width="960" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKGPHxg2vWy_cisaKH6ry9hPwULEtZsaqTseBZKfXidmXOCmczY4FhHYhBB4f3SsDiS_W8EM8IQH2qg_toA94ez_WmAjh69UqBLReN2PKz6nh2y75l3YLZZ0VueHnz0YURpn5NaREe4v-8ol88tML1L1ob6Xk-d025Ja5ImTrpasCFXpq5eODfrRfA/s16000/Japanese%20and%20Africans.jpg"></a></p><p>The most famous example of this is the name Obama, a Luo name from Kenya, which is also the name of a town in Japan. When Barack Obama was elected US president in 2008, the town shot to international prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>We later learned that Obama means a “small beach” in the Japanese language. (There’s also a town called Obama in Nigeria’s River State).</p><p>Until relatively recently, I used to think Ajinomoto, whose seasoning was omnipresent in Nigerian kitchens when I lived there, was a Nigerian company that derived its name from a Nigerian language.</p><p>In fact, just yesterday, I asked my wife, who is half Nigerian (Igbo) and half American, to guess what language Ajinomoto came from. She said with cocksure certainty that it had to be Yoruba! (She spent three years in Ogbomosho and speaks some Yoruba). She was shocked to realize that Ajinomoto is Japanese.</p><p>Japanese brands like Suzuki, Yamaha, Kawasaki, etc. resonated with us when I was growing up in Nigeria because they sounded every bit African, even Nigerian.</p><p>But it gets even more interesting. Japanese capital Tokyo used to be called Edo, the name of a state and people in midwestern Nigeria.&nbsp;</p><p>The Japanese also bear person names like Chika, an Igbo name; Aina, a Yoruba name; Fumi, a Yoruba name; Ikimi, an Edo name; Yaru, a Borgu name; Sambo, a Fulani name; Maitama, a Hausa name; Adachi, a Nupe/Igala name; and so on.</p><p>Tutor-World also identified several more Japanese personal names that are either also personal names, names of common things, or names of towns in Nigeria, including: Azuka, Baba, Duro, Eijiro, Emiko, Femi, Fuji, Gobe, Goro, Haruna, Imoko, Iyamu, Kano, Kwashi, Mabuchi, Maduka, Mai, Obi, Oba, Ogi, Okada, Osahon, Sada, Ta-Daura (even Buhari’s adopted hometown made the list!), Waka, and Zoro.</p><p>Many people have pointed out that most words and names in a Black African language has a phonetic, and sometimes semantic, match in a Japanese word or name—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for an example, the word Yoruba, the name of a major ethnic group in Nigeria. It also occurs in Japanese and can be translated as a “night horse,” according to the Sundaland Research Society, which says “yoru” means night and “ba” means horse in Japanese.</p><p>&nbsp;Several random words in Japanese can also have meanings, often unrelated to the original, in several African languages.</p><p>In spite of the uncanny congruence between the speech sounds of Black African languages and Japanese, there is no evidence that it’s anything more than a pleasantly giant phono-semantic accident.</p><p>It’s similar to the similarities in sound and rhythm between Plateau State languages and the Sino-Tibetan languages of China and its neighbors.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Plateau State names can pass for Mandarin names. A former Plateau journalist I used to be fond of (because of the exotic musicality of his name) is called Shok Jok. That name could pass for a Mandarin or Cantonese name.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also a Professor Pam Dung Sha who teaches political science at the University of Jos. People who pay attention to politics are probably familiar with the late Senator Gyang Nyam Shom Pwajok. Names can’t get more Chinese than that!&nbsp;</p><p>How about Plateau names like Chuwang and Vongkong that Chinese people actually bear? The popular Plateau name Gyang sounds similar to a place in Tibet called Qungdo’gyang.</p><p>Similarly, many Plateau toponyms such as Qua'an Pan, Pankshin, Shendam, etc. sound distinctly Chinese. (This is also true of the toponyms and sometimes personal names in southern Kaduna and southern Adamawa.)</p><p>The first time I visited Jos in the late 1990s, I stayed at a hotel called Kufang Chindi International Hotel. I honestly thought it was a Chinese-owned hotel, more so that it had “international” in its name, but its name is actually native to Plateau!</p><p>I read about a Japanese linguist who was intrigued by the sounds of Plateau names and decided to map the glottochronology of the languages.&nbsp;</p><p>His lexicostatistical analysis found that less than 30 percent of the similar-sounding words between Plateau State languages and China’s Sino-Tibetan languages share similar meanings. Linguists call these kinds of similarities "accidental evidence."&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, the researcher found that there was no evidence of even a remote common origin for Chinese and the Plateau languages. It was merely a case of accidental similarities in sound.</p><p>Interestingly, Chinese-sounding Plateau languages and the Japanese language don’t belong to the major language families of their locations. They are both what linguists call language isolates.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<cite>Brian Harvey<br>University of California, Berkeley</cite>

<p>In 2011, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of MIT, the <i>Boston Globe</i>
made a list of the most important innovations developed there.  They asked me
to explain the importance of <i>SICP,</i> and this is what I sent them:

</p><p>SICP was revolutionary in many different ways.  Most importantly, it
dramatically raised the bar for the intellectual content of introductory
computer science.  Before SICP, the first CS course was almost always
entirely filled with learning the details of some programming language.
SICP is about standing back from the details to learn big-picture ways
to think about the programming process.  It focused attention on the
central idea of <i>abstraction</i> -- finding general patterns from specific
problems and building software tools that embody each pattern.  It made
heavy use of the idea of <i>functions as data</i>, an idea that's hard to learn
initially, but immensely powerful once learned.  (This is the same idea,
in a different form, that makes freshman calculus so notoriously hard even
for students who've done well in earlier math classes.)  It fit into the
first CS course three different <i>programming paradigms</i> (functional,
object oriented, and declarative), when most other courses didn't even
really discuss even one paradigm.

</p><p>Another revolution was the choice of Scheme as the programming language.
To this day, most introductions to computer science use whatever is the
"hot" language of the moment: from Pascal to C to C++ to Java to Python.
Scheme has never been widely used in industry, but it's the perfect
language for an introduction to CS.  For one thing, it has a very simple,
uniform notation for everything.  Other languages have one notation for
variable assignment, another notation for conditional execution, two or
three more for looping, and yet another for function calls.  Courses that
teach those languages spend at least half their time just on learning the
notation.  In my SICP-based course at Berkeley, we spend the first hour
on notation and that's all we need; for the rest of the semester we're
learning ideas, not syntax.  Also, despite (or because of) its simplicity,
Scheme is a very versatile language, making it possible for us to examine
those three programming paradigms and, in particular, letting us see how
object oriented programming is implemented, so OOP languages don't seem
like magic to our students.  Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, so it's great
at handling functions as data, but it's a stripped-down version compared
to the ones more commonly used for professional programming, with a
minimum of bells and whistles.  It was very brave of Abelson and Sussman
to teach their introductory course in the best possible language <i>for
teaching</i>, paying no attention to complaints that all the jobs were in
some other language.  Once you learned the big ideas, they thought, and
this is my experience also, learning another programming language isn't
a big deal; it's a chore for a weekend.  I tell my students, "the language
in which you'll spend most of your working life hasn't been invented yet,
so we can't teach it to you.  Instead we have to give you the skills you
need to learn new languages as they appear."

</p><p>Finally, SICP was firmly optimistic about what a college freshman can be
expected to accomplish.  SICP students write interpreters for programming
languages, ordinarily considered more appropriate for juniors or seniors.
The text itself isn't easy reading; it has none of the sidebars and colored
boxes and interesting pictures that typify the modern textbook aimed at
students with low attention spans.  There are no redundant exercises; each
exercise teaches an important new idea.  It uses big words.  But it repays a
close reading; every sentence matters.

</p><p>Statistically, SICP-based courses have been a small minority.  But the book
has had an influence beyond that minority.  It inspired a number of later
textbooks whose authors consciously tried to live up to SICP's standard.  The
use of Scheme as a language for learners has been extended by others over a
range from middle school to graduate school.  Even the more mainstream courses
have become sensitive to the idea of programming paradigms, although most of
them concentrate on object oriented programming.  The idea that computer
science should be about ideas, not entirely about programming practice, has
since widened to include non-technical ideas about the context and social
implications of computing.

</p><p>SICP itself has had a longevity that's very unusual for introductory CS
textbooks.  Usually, a book lasts only as long as the language fad to which it
is attached.  SICP has been going strong for over 25 years and shows no sign
of going out of print.  Computing has changed enormously over that time, from
giant mainframe computers to personal computers to the Internet on cell
phones.  And yet the big ideas behind these changes remain the same, and they
are well captured by SICP.

</p><p>I've been teaching a SICP-based course since 1987.  The course has changed
incrementally over that time; we've added sections on parallelism, concurrency
control, user interface design, and the client/server paradigm.  But it's
still essentially the same course.  Every five years or so, someone on the
faculty suggests that our first course should use language X instead; each
time, I say "when someone writes the best computer science book in the world
using language X, that'll be fine" and so far the faculty have always voted to
stay with the SICP course.  We'll find out pretty soon whether the course can
survive my own retirement.

</p><ul><li>(Footnote: Nope.  Berkeley's new first course for majors uses Python,
with lecture notes that try to keep the ideas (and some of the text) of SICP.)
</li></ul>

<p>The discussion has been sharper recently because MIT underwent a major
redesign of their lower division EECS curriculum.  People outside MIT tend to
summarize that redesign as "MIT decided to switch to Python," but that's not a
perceptive description.  What MIT decided was to move from a curriculum
organized around topics (programming paradigms, then circuits, then signal
processing, then architecture) to a curriculum organized around applications
(let's build and program a robot; let's build and program a cell phone).
<i>Everything</i> about their courses had to be reorganized; the choice of
programming language was the least of those decisions.  Their new approach is
harder to teach; for one thing, each course requires a partnership of
Electrical Engineering faculty and Computer Science faculty.  Perhaps in time
the applications-first approach will spark a revolution as profound as the one
that followed SICP, but it hasn't happened yet.

</p><p>In my experience, relatively few students appreciate how much they're
learning in my course while they're in it.  But in surveys of all our
CS students, it turns out to be among the most popular courses in
retrospect, and I regularly get visits and emails from long-gone students
to tell me about how they're using in their work ideas that they thought
were impractical ivory-tower notions as students.  The invention of the
MapReduce software for data parallelism at Google, based on functional
programming ideas, has helped eliminate that ivory-tower reputation.

Edinburgh’s city council voted to <a href="https://democracy.edinburgh.gov.uk/documents/s70730/9.1%20Policy%20on%20Advertising%20and%20Sponsorship%20-%20Proposed%20Amendments.pdf" target="_blank">ban fossil fuel advertisements</a> on city property, undermining the ability of not only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/13/house-democrats-probe-pr-industry-role-advertising-big-oil/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank">oil companies</a>, but also car manufacturers, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/02/02/sustainable-aviation-fuel-future/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank">airlines</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/09/28/green-cruises-environment/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank">cruise ships</a>, to promote their products. The ban targeted arms manufacturers as well.</p></div><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQM4JNVRWFAPJD2JQWJTA3RBW4" data-el="text" dir="null">Edinburgh is not alone. <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/05/20/amsterdam-becomes-first-city-in-the-world-to-ban-this-type-of-advert" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://www.adnews.com.au/news/city-of-sydney-votes-to-end-fossil-fuel-advertising" target="_blank">Sydney</a> have cracked down on advertisements for fossil fuels and high-emissions products. France also limited the promotion of coal, gas and hydrogen made from fossil fuels. Even the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, has joined in, endorsing a ban on fossil fuel ads this month in a speech in New York this month: “Stop the Mad Men from fueling the madness.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LJIYXFY3EVCDLPP4BNACCOPQCM" data-el="text" dir="null">“There’s a moment happening here,” said Ben Parker, the Edinburgh city councilor who spearheaded the ban and a member of the Scottish Green Party. “It’s a way of saying fossil fuel companies and arms manufacturers are not welcome in our city.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BIJKKZVQFNAXTECEJMO4TRTVCM" data-el="text" dir="null">A local ban on fossil fuel advertisements might seem minor at a time when carbon emissions — and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/05/global-temperatures-1-5-celsius-record-year/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8" target="_blank">temperatures</a> — continue to march upward. But there is evidence that sweeping advertising bans, such as those targeting tobacco products in many countries, can change how consumers view and purchase certain products. The question is whether the new fossil fuel advertising bans are substantial enough to have an impact.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N5OGPPP4DRC57AOZICGCHWXQUI" data-el="text" dir="null">“A lot of these bans that are being put forward are at the municipal and city level,” said Timothy Dewhirst, professor of marketing and consumer studies at the University of Guelph. “And partial bans have proven to be ineffective.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2MX33FQJRBF67LDBQQQPBOT5HY" data-el="text" dir="null">Fossil fuel producers counter that they are focused on addressing climate change. “Our industry is focused on continuing to produce affordable, reliable energy while tackling the climate challenge, and any allegations to the contrary are false,” Scott Lauermann, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMM7ZG63PZHHRL5A5OG2W25KTA" data-el="text" dir="null">Proponents of advertising bans seek to accomplish<b> </b>two goals: convince people not to use<b> </b>the product, and lower the reputation of an industry or company. Given how embedded fossil fuels are in modern society, some experts see the latter goal as more achievable.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2MSLJH52FDKRETQAJDF5FXAP4" data-el="text" dir="null">At the individual level, seeing fewer advertisements for gas-guzzling cars or international trips could make people less likely to opt for those products. “What you are doing is reducing the amount of consumption that is coming from those advertisements,” said Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute and a campaigner for fossil fuel ad bans.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PR5KYC5F2VHPBMJ5IO65D4J2JI" data-el="text" dir="null">There’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629608000155?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">evidence</a> that this works. Starting in the 1970s, the constant drumbeat of new findings on the health effects of cigarettes triggered a lengthy process where nations restricted advertisements for cigarettes on TV, the radio and in public spaces. In the United States, bans began with cigarette advertising on television, and grew to covering the sponsorship of events, public transit ads and more.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BNZVWICBFARJLY3XWD3MTUDNM" data-el="text" dir="null">Today, dozens of countries — including the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-guidance-regulations/advertising-and-promotion" target="_blank">United States</a>,<b> </b><a href="https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/china" target="_blank">China</a> and the <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/tobacco/ban-cross-border-tobacco-advertising-and-sponsorship_en" target="_blank">European Union</a><b> — </b>have bans, restrictions or other limitations on selling tobacco products. There is even an <a href="https://fctc.who.int/who-fctc/overview" target="_blank">international treaty</a> under the World Health Organization, adopted in 2003,<b> </b>that urges all countries to enact bans that target all forms of tobacco advertising. There are currently 168 signatories on the treaty; the<b> </b>United States has signed on the treaty but not ratified it.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JOY3PX4PRZGEHEGXVR4YQMOPKI" data-el="text" dir="null">Research shows that those bans that block TV, radio, print and in-store advertising — as well as sponsorship of events — are most effective at stopping smoking, particularly among young people who have yet to start smoking in the first place. As of 2017, full bans were implemented in less than 20 percent of countries worldwide.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVWP7M35TJHP3AL725OTGVECA4" data-el="text" dir="null">But bans that are partial, such as those that only target TV commercials, are less effective. Companies may just reallocate their advertising budgets to other media, or shift to sponsoring sports teams and similar.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4QV5CMPSZRBGFGXAYE5DTBPUXI" data-el="text" dir="null">“It’s like a tube of toothpaste,” said David Hammond, a professor of public health at the University of Waterloo. “If you press in just one spot, it just squeezes to another part of the tube.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I25TBOYU2VB4XGZL6BF3C7COGQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Fossil fuels also present a particular challenge: While an individual can choose not to smoke, it is almost impossible to disconnect from an electricity grid that runs partly on fossil fuels. Ad bans can target some discretionary spending, like cruise ships and air travel, but oil, gas and coal are deeply embedded in everyday life.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="II7OMBGFZ5H6TMYA5PJZHESDRQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Parker, the city councilor, says that there are still reasons to target sources of global warming. “We protect people from things like gambling, alcohol, and tobacco,” he said. “Climate change is a different type of harm, but it’s still a harm.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NBEDPX22FCCTLYGNBNSA2553U" data-el="text" dir="null">Meanwhile, some advocates and scholars emphasize that advertising allows companies to shape their public image, which can protect them from stricter regulation.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI4ESXJ4LFAT5K36RPXITCKRTI" data-el="text" dir="null">Researchers say that fossil fuel companies use ads to maintain their “social license to operate” — a shorthand for a corporation’s ability to be seen as acceptable by society and policymakers. By showing ads connecting their operations to clean energy, jobs, or energy security — and sponsoring popular events — fossil fuel companies can bolster their reputations in the public sphere.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2V2LR5FUEZCLXK5QJ6MRRR2UHU" data-el="text" dir="null">“Political scientists refer to fossil fuel advertising as a form of ‘outside’ lobbying,” said Geoffrey Supran, associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. “It complements lobbying inside the Hill and in state governments and so on.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R7TNUGIUYRA5VN4CEXOHFHXQXM" data-el="text" dir="null">Earlier this month, for example, the fossil fuel company Chevron sponsored the annual Congressional Baseball Game — which was interrupted by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/12/congressional-baseball-game-arrests-climate-activists/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32" target="_blank">climate protesters</a>.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZYTXPN4XDBBKRBK7GWJBLHBSLI" data-el="text" dir="null">Robert Brulle, a visiting professor of environment and society at Brown University, says that advertising allows fossil fuel companies to help define the solutions to climate change — such as things like carbon capture from oil and gas plants. “They’re saying ‘We need to be part of the solution, we have the technical know-how,’” Brulle explained.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3ETU2DQF3FCQXDVG64OPJTE5ZM" data-el="text" dir="null">In one <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-019-02582-8" target="_blank">study</a> by Brulle and his co-authors, the researchers found that fossil fuel companies increased their advertising spending in response to congressional attention to and media coverage of climate change.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LF53Y2HKRVA7BHQEM4GUHLQHLY" data-el="text" dir="null">Even if there were substantial advertising bans instituted for fossil fuels, it would be difficult to measure how such bans affect a company’s reputation. But some experts believe that it could make a difference. “It would be monumental,” said Supran. “It could loosen the stranglehold of the industry in a way that would politically and financially open the door to lower carbon technologies.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YQFY2ZL6GFDE5BR6LZC7SGS4BE" data-el="text" dir="null">For now, ad bans are still only instituted in a small number of cities and nations worldwide — in a manner not so different from how tobacco advertising bans began. “It happened incrementally,” said Hammond. “It was a multi-decade process.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I've always been fond of the idea of the Raspberry Pi. An energy efficient, small, cheap but capable computer. An ideal home server. Until the Pi 4, the Pi was not that capable, and only with the relatively recent Pi 5 (fall 2023) do I feel the Pi is OK performance wise, although still hampered by SD card performance<sup id="fnref:good"><a href="#fn:good">1</a></sup>. And the Pi isn't that cheap either.</p>
<p>The Pi 5 can be fitted with an NVME SSD, but for me it's too little, too late.
Because I feel there is a type of computer on the market, that is much more compelling than the Pi. </p>
<p>I'm talking about the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">tinyminimicro</a> home lab 'revolution' started by
<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/">servethehome.com</a> about four years ago (2020).</p>
<p><img alt="mini pc" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm01.webp"></p>
<p><em>A 1L mini PC (Elitedesk 705 G4) with a Raspberry Pi 5 on top</em></p>
<p>During the pandemic, the Raspberry Pi was in short supply and people started looking for alternatives. The people at servethehome realised that these small enterprise desktop PCs could be a good option. Dell (micro), Lenovo (tiny) and HP (mini) all make these small desktop PCs, which are also known as 1L (one liter) PCs.</p>
<p>These Mini PC are not cheap<sup id="fnref:cheap"><a href="#fn:cheap">2</a></sup> when bought new, but older models are sold at a very steep discount as enterprises offload old models by the thousands on the second hand market (through intermediates).</p>
<p>Although these computers are often several years old, they are still much faster than a Raspberry Pi (including the Pi 5) and can hold more RAM.</p>
<p>I decided to buy two HP Elitedesk Mini PCs to try them out, one based on AMD and the other based on AMD.</p>

<p>The AMD-based system is cheaper, but you 'pay' in higher idle power usage. In absolute terms 10 watt is still decent, but the Intel model directly competes with the Pi 5 on idle power consumption. </p>
<p><a href="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm03.webp"><img alt="inside the mini pic" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm03_small.webp"></a></p>
<p><em>Elitedesk 705 left, Elitedesk 800 right (click to enlarge)</em></p>
<p>Regarding display output, these devices have two fixed displayport outputs, but there is one port that is configurable. It can be displayport, VGA or HDMI. Depending on the supplier you may be able to configure this option, or you can buy them separately for €15-€25 online.</p>
<p><a href="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/HPEliteDesk800G3DesktopMini.pdf"><img alt="back800" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm06.webp"></a>

<em>Click on image for official specs in PDF format</em></p>
<p>Both models seem to be equipped with socketed CPUs. Although options for this formfactor are limited, it's possible to upgrade.</p>
<h3>Comparing cost with the Pi 5</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 with (max) 8 GB of RAM costs ~91 Euro, almost exactly the same price as the AMD-based mini PC<sup id="fnref:psu"><a href="#fn:psu">3</a></sup> in its base configuration (8GB RAM). Yet, with the Pi, you still need:</p>
<ol>
<li>power supply (€13)</li>
<li>case (€11)</li>
<li>SD card or NVME SSD (€10-€45)</li>
<li>NVME hat (€15) (optional but would be more comparable)</li>
</ol>
<p>It's true that I'm comparing a new computer to a second hand device, and you can decide if that matters in this case. With a complete Pi 5 at around €160 including taxes and shipping, the AMD-based 1L PC is clearly the cheaper and still more capable option.</p>
<h3>Comparing performance with the Pi 5</h3>
<p>The first two rows in this table show the Geekbench 6 score of the Intel and AMD mini PCs I've bought for evaluation. I've added the benchmark results of some other computers I've access to, just to provide some context.</p>

<p>Sure, these mini PCs won't come close to modern hardware like the Apple M2 or the intel i9. But if we look at the performance of the mini PCs we can observe that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Intel i5-6500T CPU is 13% faster in single-core than the AMD Ryzen 3 PRO</li>
<li>Both the Intel and AMD processors are 42% - 62% faster than the Pi 5 regarding single-core performance.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Storage (performance)</h3>
<p>If there's one thing that really holds the Pi back, it's the SD card storage.
If you buy a decent SD card (A1/A2) that doesn't have terrible random IOPs performance, you realise that you can get a SATA or NVME SSD for almost the same price that has more capacity and much better (random) IO performance.</p>
<p>With the Pi 5, NVME SSD storage isn't standard and requires an extra hat. I feel that the missing integrated NVME storage option for the Pi 5 is a missed opportunity that - in my view - hurts the Pi 5.</p>
<p>Now in contrast, the Intel-based mini PC came with a SATA SSD in a special mounting bracket. That bracket also contained a small fan(1) to keep the underlying NVME storage (not present) cooled. </p>
<p><a href="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm04.webp"><img alt="inside the mini pic" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm04_small.webp"></a></p>
<p><em>There is a fan under the SATA SSD (click to enlarge)</em></p>
<p>The AMD-based mini PC was equipped with an NVME SSD and was not equipped with the SSD mounting bracket. The low price must come from somewhere...</p>
<p>However, both systems have support for SATA SSD storage, an 80mm NVME SSD and a small 2230 slot for a WiFi card. There seems no room on the 705 G4 to put in a small SSD, but there are adapters available that convert the WiFi slot to a slot usable for an extra NVME SSD, which might be an option for the 800 G3.</p>
<h3>Noice levels (subjective)</h3>
<p>Both systems are barely audible at idle, but you will notice them (if you sensitive to that sort of thing). The AMD system seems to become quite loud under full load. The Intel system also became loud under full load, but much more like a Mac Mini: the noise is less loud and more tolerable in my view.</p>
<h2>Idle power consumption</h2>
<h3>Elitedesk 800 (Intel)</h3>
<p>I can get the Intel-based Elitedesk 800 G3 to 3.5 watt at idle. Let that sink in for a moment. That's about the same power draw as the Raspberry Pi 5 at idle!</p>
<p>Just installing Debian 12 instead of Windows 10 makes the idle power consumption drop from 10-11 watt to around 7 watt. </p>
<p>Then on Debian, you:</p>
<ol>
<li>run <code>apt install powertop</code></li>
<li>run <code>powertop --auto-tune</code> (saves ~2 Watt)</li>
<li>Unplug the monitor (run headless) (saves ~1 Watt)</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to put the <code>powertop --auto-tune</code> command in /etc/rc.local:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
powertop<span> </span>--auto-tune
<span>exit</span><span> </span><span>0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then apply <code>chmod +x /etc/rc.local</code></p>
<p>So, for about the same idle power draw you get so much more performance, and go beyond the max 8GB RAM of the Pi 5.</p>
<h3>Elitedesk 705 (AMD)</h3>
<p>I managed to get this system to 10-11 watt at idle, but it was a pain to get there. </p>
<p>I measured around 11 Watts idle power consumption running a preinstalled Windows 11 (with monitor connected). After installing Debian 12 the system used 18 Watts at idle and so began a journey of many hours trying to solve this problem. </p>
<p>The culprit is the integrated Radeon Vega GPU. To solve the problem you have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure the 'bios' to only use UEFI</li>
<li>Reinstall Debian 12 using UEFI</li>
<li>install the appropriate firmware with <code>apt install firmware-amd-graphics</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If you boot the computer using legacy 'bios' mode, the AMD Radeon firmware won't load no matter what you try. You can see this by issuing the commands:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>rmmod<span> </span>amdgpu
modprobe<span> </span>amdgpu
</code></pre></div>

<p>You may notice errors on the physical console or in the logs that the GPU driver isn't loaded because it's missing firmware (a lie).</p>
<p>This whole process got me to around 12 Watt at idle. To get to <strong>~10 Watts idle</strong> you need to do also run <code>powertop --auto-tune</code> and disconnect the monitor, as stated in the 'Intel' section earlier.</p>
<p>Given the whole picture, 10-11 Watt at idle is perfectly okay for a home server, and if you just want the cheapest option possible, this is still a fine system.</p>
<h2>KVM Virtualisation</h2>
<p>I'm running vanilla KVM (Debian 12) on these Mini PCs and it works totally fine. I've created multiple virtual machines without issue and performance seemed perfectly adequate. </p>
<h2>Boot performance</h2>
<p>From the moment I pressed the power button to SSH connecting, it took 17 seconds for the Elitedesk 800.</p>
<p>The Elitedesk 705 took 33 seconds until I got an SSH shell.</p>
<p>These boot times include the 5 second boot delay within the GRUB bootloader screen that is default for Debian 12.</p>
<h2>Remote management support</h2>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> (ILO, DRAC, and so on) which is standard on most servers. But there is also similar technology for (enterprise) desktops.</p>
<p>Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">AMT/ME</a> is a technology used for remote out-of-band management of computers. It can be an interesting feature in a homelab environment but I have no need for it. If you want to try it, you can follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>For most people, it may be best to disable the AMT/ME feature as it has a history of security vulnerabilities. This may not be a huge issue within a trusted home network, but you have been warned.</p>
<p>The AMD-based Elitedesk 705 didn't came with equivalent remote management capabilities as far as I can tell.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>The models discussed here are older models that are selected for a particular price point. Newer models from Lenovo, HP and Dell, equip more modern processors which are faster and have more cores. They are often also priced significantly higher. </p>
<p>If you are looking for low-power small formfactor PCs with more potent or customisable hardware, you may want to look at second-hand NUC formfactor PCs.</p>
<h2>Stacking multiple mini PCs</h2>
<p>The AMD-based Elitedesk 705 G4 is closed at the top and it's possible to stack other mini PCs on top. </p>
<p>The Intel-based Elitedesk 800 G3 has a perforated top enclosure, and putting another mini pc on top might suffocate the CPU fan.</p>
<p><img alt="topbottom" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/tmm/tmm07_small.webp"></p>
<p>As you can see, the bottom/foot of the mini PC doubles as a VESA mount and has four screw holes. By putting some screws in those holes, you may effectively create standoffs that gives the machine below enough space to breathe (maybe you can use actual standoffs).</p>
<h2>Evaluation and conclusion</h2>
<p>I think these second-hand 1L tinyminimicro PCs are better suited to play the role of home (lab) server than the Raspberry Pi (5). </p>
<p>The increased CPU performance, the built-in SSD/NVME support, the option to go beyond 8 GB of RAM (up to 32GB) and the price point on the second-hand market really makes a difference. </p>
<p>I love the Raspberry Pi and I still have a ton of Pi 4s. This <a href="https://louwrentius.com/i-made-my-blog-solar-powered-then-things-escalated.html">solar-powered</a> blog is hosted on a Pi 4 because of the low power consumption and the availability of GPIO pins for the solar status display. </p>
<p>That said, unless the Raspberry Pi becomes a lot cheaper (and more potent), I'm not so sure it's such a compelling home server.</p>

Mory, Inc.</a></strong></em><span> yesterday. The case mostly revolves around an employer firing a union organizer that became employed at the company with the goal of organizing his coworkers (also known as “salting”). The union salt in this case lied about his employment history to get hired, declared he was a union organizer after being hired, and then was fired. Salting is protected activity, lying about your employment history to salt is also protected activity, and firing someone for salting is an unfair labor practice. Thus, Judge Karpinen ordered that the employer rehire the salt with backpay.</span></p><p><span>As part of litigating this case, the General Counsel (GC) of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) also alleged that the employer’s non-compete clause and coworker non-solicitation clause were illegal work rules under the </span><em><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583af43bd.pdf" rel="">Stericycle</a></em><span> standard. The GC has been pursuing this </span><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583a87168.pdf" rel="">particular legal theory</a><span> since early last year, but this is the first time the theory has been put in front of an ALJ and also the first time an ALJ has ruled that these kinds of clauses are unfair labor practices that violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).</span></p><p>The non-compete clause in question states that:</p><blockquote><p>(A) For a period of twelve (12) months following termination or separation of employment for any reason, Employee will not directly or indirectly, on Employee's behalf or on behalf of others:  … (iii) Engage in, be employed by, or become interested in, in any manner or capacity, as a principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, consultant, independent contractor, advisor or in any other capacity, with any insurance agency, insurance business or in any other business similar or competitive with Employer’s business as the same may exist at any time during the term of this Agreement, this covenant restricting Employee’s employment being limited to Employer’s service area which is defined as the county of the office where the Employee is located and to all contiguous counties thereto. If, during Employee’s employment, Employee is employed in any other of Employer’s locations, then these restrictions shall also apply to the county in which such office is located, and to all contiguous counties to that location. The parties expressly agree that the restrictions above set forth are fair and reasonable with regard to scope, time periods, geographic area and in all other respects.</p></blockquote><p>The ALJ determined that this clause was illegal with the following reasoning:</p><blockquote><p><span>The non-compete provision in Provision 2(A) is overly broad in scope and would deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity by barring employees from directly or indirectly, and in any capacity, engaging in, being employed by, or becoming interested in any enterprise that is “similar or competitive” to the employer’s business. Not only is this provision ridiculously broad in scope (could an employee indirectly engage with a competitor by sending a family member to buy something from its store?), but </span><strong>it would also cause a reasonable employee to refrain from engaging in protected activities that come with a risk of retaliation. If an employee knows they are barred from being involved in any capacity with any company that operates a similar business to Respondent, they will logically be more fearful of being fired and less willing to rock the boat because they face the prospect of being unable to find any work in their geographic area if they are fired or forced to leave their job.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The coworker non-solicitation clause in question states that:</p><blockquote><p>(C) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 24 months after termination of employment for any reason, Employee will not, either directly or indirectly for himself or on behalf of others, solicit, encourage, or attempt to persuade any other employee of Employer to leave the employ of Employer. This is intended to prevent “pirating” of Employer employees.</p></blockquote><p>The ALJ determined that this clause was illegal with the following reasoning:</p><blockquote><p><span>The prohibition in Provision 1(C) on soliciting employees to leave Respondent’s employ would </span><strong>dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity like telling their coworkers about the wages and benefits offered by the Union out of a reasonable fear that Respondent might accuse them of inducing other employees to quit</strong><span>. See </span><strong><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d45800b7ca9.pdf" rel="">M.J. Mechanical Services, 325 NLRB 1098, 1106 (1998)</a></strong><span> (telling employees about union benefits, encouraging them to engage in salting activities, and referring them to union hall protected even when it resulted in one employee going to work for a union contractor). </span><strong>It may also deter employees from asking their coworkers to make a concerted threat to quit unless their working conditions improve.</strong><span> See </span><strong><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583883f78.pdf" rel="">Morgan Corp., 371 NLRB No. 142, slip op. at 5 (2022)</a></strong><span> (employee who told supervisor that he and his co-workers would quit over demand for higher wages was “indisputably” engaged in protected concerted activity).</span></p></blockquote><p>Despite all the discussion about the FTC banning non-competes, there still seems to be little recognition that non-competes for non-supervisory workers are effectively impossible to enforce at the moment due to the policies of the NLRB GC.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Scotland follows England, Wales and Northern Ireland in exonerating wrongfully convicted subpostmasters en masse</h2>
</div><div id="content-center">

</ul> <section id="content-body">
<p>Former subpostmasters and Post Office branch staff who were wrongfully convicted of crimes based on flawed computer evidence in Scotland have had their convictions quashed.</p>

<p>Emergency legislation to exonerate wrongfully convicted Post Office workers has completed its journey through Scottish Parliament and each will now receive initial compensation of £600,000, with the ability to claim more as financial redress for their suffering.</p>
<p>This mirrors <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366573392/Unprecedented-bill-to-exonerate-hundreds-of-wrongly-convicted-Post-office-workers-arrives">legislation in Westminster</a>, which covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Westminster, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366586358/Over-700-wrongful-subpostmaster-convictions-overturned-by-new-legislation">emergency legislation was pushed through</a> last month to overturn the convictions of hundreds of former subpostmasters and their staff. Prime minister Rishi Sunak promised the blanket exoneration after an ITV drama and documentary about the scandal angered the public.</p>
<p>Scotland’s justice secretary, Angela Constance, wrote to subpostmasters to set out the next steps. “Of course, no amount of compensation can fully mend the lives that were torn apart by this miscarriage of justice,” she said.</p>
<p>“I will be writing to those affected to tell them their convictions have been quashed and ensuring court records are changed, so the victims of this scandal can have their good names restored as quickly as possible. They have already waited too long for justice.”</p>
<p>In September 2020, following a large number of cases referred for appeal by England’s Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the Scottish CCRC took what it described as an “unusual step” and wrote to more than 70 people with potential wrongful convictions. It&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252497665/Potential-miscarriages-of-justice-of-Scottish-subpostmasters-move-to-full-review">began reviewing the first set of cases</a>&nbsp;in March 2021.</p>
<p>Scotland has a separate legal system, and the Scottish CCRC is traditionally about 10% of the size of the CCRC in England in terms of cases.</p>
<section data-menu-title="Successful appeal">
<h2><i data-icon="1"></i>Successful appeal</h2>
<p>The first wrongful conviction of a subpostmaster in Scotland was <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366553756/First-subpostmaster-Horizon-conviction-overturned-in-Scotland">overturned in September</a>. Susan Sinclair, who previously ran a branch in north-east Scotland, saw her appeal against conviction successful at the High Court in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In the UK, between 2000 and 2015, 736 subpostmasters were convicted of crimes including theft and false accounting after the Post Office prosecuted them using evidence from the Horizon retail and accounting system used in thousands of branches.</p>
<p>The Horizon system was proved to be error-prone during a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252451492/Why-subpostmasters-and-Post-Office-are-battling-it-out-in-the-High-Court">High Court legal battle that began in 2018</a>. Led by former subpostmaster Alan Bates, a group of 555 members of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280090846/Post-masters-form-action-group-after-accounts-shortfall">Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance</a>&nbsp;(JFSA) sued the Post Office to prove that errors in the Horizon system were causing unexplained accounting discrepancies.</p>
<p>The CCRC began reviewing English cases in 2015, and the first convictions to be overturned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252493522/History-made-as-subpostmasters-wrongly-prosecuted-in-Horizon-IT-scandal-have-convictions-quashed">came in December 2020</a>. Since then, more than 100 former subpostmasters and branch staff have had convictions overturned. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366553756/First-subpostmaster-Horizon-conviction-overturned-in-Scotland">first wrongful conviction of a subpostmaster overturned in Scotland</a>&nbsp;came in September 2023.</p>
<p>The Post Office scandal was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240089230/Bankruptcy-prosecution-and-disrupted-livelihoods-Postmasters-tell-their-story">first exposed by Computer Weekly in 2009</a>, revealing the stories of seven subpostmasters and the problems they suffered due to accounting software. It is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British history (<i>see below for timeline of Computer Weekly articles about the scandal, since 2009</i>).</p>

I mean, I think I have an "eye" or a "nose" for detecting good and bad things in advance, but I developed so many different things during my career that I am not an expert in anything in particular. In Spanish, we have a saying, "Maestro Liendre: De tó sabe, pero de ná entiende." I don't really know (and don't want) to translate it because it loses its punch, but it fits perfectly here.</p><p>Maybe that's why I had that saying in mind before every single meeting I had over the past few years.<strong><em> "Do not try to be the smartest in the room; try to be the kindest."</em></strong></p><blockquote>What does that mean? Well, the main point is always being willing to help.</blockquote><p>This might seem like obvious advice, but in the business world of winning and losing, that many people still use "war" concepts to refer to meetings and negotiations. This soft skill is a game changer.</p><p>Here's what I expect from someone <em>kind</em> in a meeting, we cold call it "The kind Framework" or "El Framework Güenagent":</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Listening</strong>. This is very important and pretty difficult to find in meetings. Many people arrive with a speech in their heads and are just waiting for their turn to spit out the words without any link or context to others' points of view.</li><li><strong>Being respectful</strong>. Being nice is the new punk, and respect and understanding of other realities are the Rosetta Stone. We should not only try to be respectful but also demand this from others.</li><li><strong>Being empathetic</strong>. This is closely linked to listening. You need to understand the background of the topics or issues people bring to the table and put yourself in their shoes.</li><li><strong>Being resolutive</strong>. A meeting that doesn't end with a solution on the table is just a waste of time for everyone involved. Applying points 1, 2, and 3 in a killer combo can lead to a solution you probably didn't have in mind at the very beginning.</li></ul><p>For me, this is by default. And honestly, it's more common to find "nice" people than those with other, less pleasant traits. And guess what? Niceness is contagious. When you apply these aptitudes, you can expect the same from others, spreading the nice framework across teams.</p><p>So, this is my particular way of being nice in meetings, and I can tell you something: </p><blockquote>just a few people are going to miss the smartest in the room, but everyone is going to miss someone kind.</blockquote><p>‍</p></div><div id="w-node-_977870d7-14c7-5fa2-7568-051a69247d26-a9ef052d"><p>This article is tagged with:</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <time datetime="2023-12-13T00:00:00Z">2023-12-13</time>
  <p>CIA produced a fantastic book during the peak of World War 2 called <a href="https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf">Simple Sabotage</a>. It laid out various ways for infiltrators to ruin productivity of a company. Some of the advice is timeless, for instance the section about “General interference with Organizations and Production”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insist on doing everything through “channels”. Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.</li>
<li>Make “speeches”. Talk as frequently as possible and at lengths. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experience. Never hesitate to make a few “patriotic” comments.</li>
<li>When possible, refer all matters to committees for “further study and consideration”. Attempt to make committees as large as possible — never less than five.</li>
<li>Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</li>
<li>Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</li>
<li>Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.</li>
<li>Advicate “caution”. Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</li>
<li>Be worried about the propriety of any decision — raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess I've always been fascinated with how well this has stood the test of time? I even got this particular section framed and hung up at our office:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/simple_sabotage.jpeg" alt="simple sabotage"></p>
<h2 id="your-mission">Your mission</h2>
<p>Let's say you were employed as a CTO behind the front lines and you wanted to destroy productivity for as long as you can without getting caught. You can of course make a series of <em>obviously</em> bad decisions, but you'd get fired quickly. The real goal here is to sap the company of its productivity slowly, while maintaining a façade of plausibility and normalcy. What are some things you can do?</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<ul>
<li>When joining, require a 6-18 months rewrite of core systems. Blame the previous CTO.</li>
<li>Encourage everyone use their own language and frameworks.</li>
<li>Split systems along arbitrary boundaries: maximize the number of systems involved in any feature.</li>
<li>Encourage a complex dev setup: running a service mesh with a dozen services at a minimum.</li>
<li>Make sure production environment differs from developer environments in as many ways as possible.</li>
<li>Deploy as infrequently as possible. Urge extreme caution about deployments. Leverage any production issue as a reason to “pull the brakes”.</li>
<li>Introduce very complex processes for code change and common workflows. Blame it on “security” or “compliance”.</li>
<li>Make sure every task is tracked in a task tracker and has been reviewed, prioritized, and signed off by a group of at least five people.</li>
<li>Disallow anything outside the scope of the original task, such as code cleanup or other drive-by improvements.</li>
<li>Build in-house versions of almost anything that's <em>not</em> a core competency. Justify it by “avoiding vendor lock-in”.</li>
<li>Insist on adding abstraction layers on top of everything. Use vendors that are themselves abstractions and then add extra layers of abstractions.</li>
<li>Encourage technical decisions based on wildly optimistic expectations of scale. Plan for at least 3 orders of magnitude more load than you have.</li>
<li>Encourage communal ownership of systems. Make sure no one feels responsible for maintenance.</li>
<li>Insist on centralizing almost everything as a “platform” owned by the “platform team”. Understaff the platform team and prevent other teams from building anythings that the platform might “own”.</li>
<li>Make the platform team iterate on APIs frequently and mandate that other teams refactor their code to the latest version as frequently as possible.</li>
<li>Hire “architects” and require even small changes to have an “architecture review”.</li>
<li>Require even small changes to have a “security review”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="product">Product</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dismiss useful metrics on academic grounds (e.g. “biased” or “lagging indicator”).</li>
<li>Pick vanity metrics with little or no correlation with business value and high amount of noise.</li>
<li>Insist on anything to be done as a “big bet” and insist on everything to be completely done before deployed.</li>
<li>Consider every feature a “must-have” and critical part of “version zero”. Do not budge.</li>
<li>Develop incredibly detailed “strategic” plans.</li>
<li>Pivot frequently.</li>
<li>Dismiss obvious improvements as “local optimization”.</li>
<li>Use latest trends to tie up resources. Kickstart a vacuous “AI strategy” that seems plausible at the surface. Spend heavily on vendors and consultants for these.</li>
<li>Encourage product managers to spend most of their time on “strategy” and “planning”.</li>
<li>Make it hard/impossible for engineers and product manager to use the product internally.</li>
<li>Dismiss users as “stupid” internally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link compensation to title, and title to to team size, in order to incentivize bloat.</li>
<li>Make big talk about strategies, features, or technical complexity.</li>
<li>Make expensive acquisitions to enter new product areas. Refer to “synergies”. Shut down the acquired product.</li>
<li>Use lots of dotted lines in the reporting structure.</li>
<li>As much as possible, have people to report into managers in other teams, locations, or functions. Make sure managers are ill-equipped to supervise their reports.</li>
<li>Frequently reassign underperformers to other teams.</li>
<li>Put high performers on highly speculative R&amp;D projects with unclear deliverables.</li>
<li>Always require a meeting for any decision, no matter how trivial.</li>
<li>Insist that every “stakeholder” needs to be present in the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hiring">Hiring</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a hiring process that seems plausibly objective but in reality subjective.</li>
<li>Reject the best people based on “poor culture fit” or other vague criteria.</li>
<li>Hire the weakest candidates based on “potential” or “attitude” or other vague criteria.</li>
<li>Recruit very expensive senior leaders with large headcount promises.</li>
<li>Use inflated titles and made-up roles to attract opportunists.</li>
<li>Hire highly specialized “experts”, then create contrived projects to prevent them from quitting.</li>
<li>Use specialization as a justification to hire other, complementary people.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-management">Project management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Require very detailed estimates for any project.</li>
<li>Encourage projects that span as many teams as possible, ideally in different locations.</li>
<li>Add new requirements that depend on work done by other teams.</li>
<li>Frequently make use of expensive agencies. Make the scope ambigious and hand over unfinished prototypes on the in-house team for them to finish.</li>
<li>Build complex “self-service” systems for stakeholders in other teams.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h2>
<p>It's a hard job to pull it off! But if you can parachute behind the enemy front lines, and land a job as a CTO, you can make this happen.</p>
<p>For the non-saboteur: this is obviously a story about how to get the most out of your team. Productivity in general is a story of a thousand cuts, and none of these things are in themselves the thing that will ruin the productivity. But productivity adds up on a logarithmic scale, meaning that all these things compound in a multiplicative way. Basically, do 100 things that each is a 5% tax on productivity, and you just slowed everything down by 131x! The only way to keep engineers happy is to say no to 100 minor cuts that each sound plausible and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsOO8j8NK0">specious</a>.</p>

                            Within the EU, many laws and framework conditions are set by the EU, which helps to cover a large market without having to consider large country-specific differences. It is also easier to enforce your rights against another company located in the EU.

Normally once they provided an introduction the client could <i>only</i> engage you via the recruiter - even if the role was also available through other recruiters or advertised directly by the client and you could have found it elsewhere as well.</p><p>That meant you could find a great client and have a deal lined up with all the key terms agreed and everyone ready to go and then at the last minute the recruitment agency could send you a terrible contract and refuse to negotiate. Then you'd not only have wasted your time going through possibly quite a long process with the recruiter but you'd also be blocked from working with a client who also wanted to work with you for a long time, which makes no business or economic sense at all.</p><p>This had been less of a problem a few years earlier when more contracts were direct with clients but the whole software contracting industry was becoming increasingly toxic here in the UK thanks to IR35 and the like. As a result many contracts - particularly with the larger clients who tend to be slightly more reliable about actually starting the work and having the budget for it - have only been available through the client's preferred suppler/recruiter list for some time.</p><p>I think if the whole contract recruitment industry got regulated almost out of existence it would probably be a huge boon to the sector. Or just declare that if intermediaries offer contracts in bad faith and won't negotiate - maybe with a list of specific hostile practices that are automatically considered bad faith - then any non-compete terms with either the worker or the client become unenforceable. In fact it might be better just to make the intermediaries generally liable if they act in bad faith because then the ones who waste your time with roles that are never really there and do shady things just to harvest CVs for their database could also be sued for the wasted time at the contractor's normal rate.</p></div></td></tr>

If you're a dev and you go to developer meetups, there's a strong chance a lot of the room is doing what you're doing and looking for what you're looking for. Instead, attend meetups where people are likely to need your skillset but won't have it - agency owners, startups, SEO events, whatever.</p><p>It's kind of obvious in hindsight, but you have to fish where the fish are. If you're a guy looking to pick up girls, a sports bar filled with guys is probably a terrible choice of a night out. If you're a girl looking to pick up guys, maybe it's a great choice.</p><p>Be brave about conversation (you have nothing to lose!), introduce yourself to people, then just listen and ask questions. People love to talk about themselves, listen to their work and problems (of course talk about you, be natural, just talk less than they do!). Thank them for being really interesting to talk to, get their contact details. If you think there's work there, email them the next day: "It was really lovely meeting to you and chatting. I've been thinking about your problem with X, I'd probably approach it like Y. If you want to grab a drink and chat it through, we absolutely should."</p><p>There's little worse/more off-putting than meeting someone at an event and they immediately trying to sell themselves. Establish a rapport and follow up after. Even if you have nothing to offer you can contact them and say it was lovely to meet them. Some of the best people in your network will be the ones you meet like this, stay in touch with, then remember you when the timing is right (and vice versa).</p><p>Just my 2c! Good luck!</p></div></td></tr>

It’s so much easier to meet people and build a network in person. Don’t be the pushy guy looking for work, they will instantly turn people off and they’ll remember that about you. Just be friendly and get to know people and talk about technical stuff. You want to be the knowledgeable helpful person who is easy to get along with so that when someone is looking for help you’re a natural person to recommend.</p><p>I don’t know how it is these days but I used to get a huge amount of work through the monthly “seeking freelancers” threads. I’d just post my ad and get a bunch of enquires every month. You can probably find some of those ads if you look back through my post history.</p><p>Having a website can help especially if you do something that’s currently hot. I got loads of work by being on the first or second page of google (not even top of the page!) for “[technology] programmer in [town]”. React Native was definitely one of those technologies for a little bit around here, but that changes so it’ll be a little bit luck and a little bit judgement in making sure you describe your self the right way.</p><p>Even sites like upwork (rentacoder was the site that was current last time I did this) have worked for me in the past. My strategy then was to be amongst the most expensive for any project and wait for the people frustrated with low quality cheap workers wanting to try the other end.</p><p>Do keep in mind that a large part of the “job” of being a freelancer is networking and marketing yourself. It requires constant attention even when you do start to get work (a common pitfall is to get some work and stop looking, then it ends and your back to square one). If you’re not willing to make that as much a part of skill set as the stuff you’re hoping to get paid to do then I wouldn’t recommend freelancing. But if you are happy with that it can be fun and varied and not a bad way to work!</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Upwork also plays favourites to agencies - there appears to be some sort of non-transparent relationship there that they don't want the general public-marketplace knowing about, but if you use Upwork long enough you'll hit its various boundaries and faults; I'm guessing they don't disclose this in their public documentation to shareholders - as would match the other unethical-shady pattern of behavour I've experienced on that platform.</p>

                  <p>I was lurking in an open source project's Discord and one day someone asked if anyone was willing to customize a feature for them. Turned out I also wanted the feature myself. So I replied to them and business was conducted via GitHub Sponsors. They also offered to pay via cryptocurrency. I wrote the code, sent the patch to them via Discord and eventually got a version of it upstreamed.</p>

If seeking freelance work you get put at the bottom of the pay stack!
2. If you research the target buyers and create a buyable sellable service then the pay lever is back in your hands.</p><p>Look even Setty states this implied in all the books he has authored.</p><p>Now the third point:</p><p>3. Product as a service means you have recurring revenue which means less searching for work or in short words. Yes, at first you have a lot of marketing work resulting in 80 hour weeks...but over time that decreases as you get more recurring service contracts...</p></div></td></tr>
