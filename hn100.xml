<p dir="auto">HyperDX can be deployed as part of ClickStack, which includes ClickHouse,
HyperDX, OpenTelemetry Collector and MongoDB.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 docker.hyperdx.io/hyperdx/hyperdx-all-in-one"><pre>docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 docker.hyperdx.io/hyperdx/hyperdx-all-in-one</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Afterwards, you can visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> to access the HyperDX UI.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you already have an existing ClickHouse instance, want to use a single
container locally, or are looking for production deployment instructions, you
can view the different deployment options in our
<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment" rel="nofollow">deployment docs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If your server is behind a firewall, you'll need to open/forward port 8080,
8000 and 4318 on your firewall for the UI, API and OTel collector
respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We recommend at least 4GB of RAM and 2 cores for testing.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hosted ClickHouse Cloud</h3><a id="user-content-hosted-clickhouse-cloud" aria-label="Permalink: Hosted ClickHouse Cloud" href="#hosted-clickhouse-cloud"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also deploy HyperDX with ClickHouse Cloud, you can
<a href="https://console.clickhouse.cloud/signUp" rel="nofollow">sign up for free</a> and get started in
just minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instrumenting Your App</h2><a id="user-content-instrumenting-your-app" aria-label="Permalink: Instrumenting Your App" href="#instrumenting-your-app"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get logs, metrics, traces, session replay, etc into HyperDX, you'll need to
instrument your app to collect and send telemetry data over to your HyperDX
instance.</p>
<p dir="auto">We provide a set of SDKs and integration options to make it easier to get
started with HyperDX, such as
<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks/browser" rel="nofollow">Browser</a>,
<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks/nodejs" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a>,
and

<p dir="auto">You can find the full list in
<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack" rel="nofollow">our docs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenTelemetry</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, HyperDX is compatible with
<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="nofollow">OpenTelemetry</a>, a vendor-neutral standard for
instrumenting your application backed by CNCF. Supported languages/platforms
include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Elixir</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">(Full list <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto">Once HyperDX is running, you can point your OpenTelemetry SDK to the
OpenTelemetry collector spun up at <code>http://localhost:4318</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We welcome all contributions! There's many ways to contribute to the project,
including but not limited to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Opening a PR (<a href="https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution Guide</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/issues/new">Submitting feature requests or bugs</a></li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our mission is to help engineers ship reliable software. To enable that, we
believe every engineer needs to be able to easily leverage production telemetry
to quickly solve burning production issues.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, in our experience, the existing tools we've used tend to fall short in
a few ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>They're expensive, and the pricing has failed to scale with TBs of telemetry
becoming the norm, leading to teams aggressively cutting the amount of data
they can collect.</li>
<li>They're hard to use, requiring full-time SREs to set up, and domain experts
to use confidently.</li>
<li>They requiring hopping from tool to tool (logs, session replay, APM,
exceptions, etc.) to stitch together the clues yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We hope you give HyperDX in ClickStack a try and let us know how we're doing!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contact</h2><a id="user-content-contact" aria-label="Permalink: Contact" href="#contact"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">HyperDX collects anonymized usage data for open source deployments. This data
supports our mission for observability to be available to any team and helps
support our open source product run in a variety of different environments.
While we hope you will continue to support our mission in this way, you may opt
out of usage data collection by setting the <code>USAGE_STATS_ENABLED</code> environment
variable to <code>false</code>. Thank you for supporting the development of HyperDX!</p>

In a pilot program launched in Singapore, the tech giant now blocks the installation of certain sideloaded apps‚Äîparticularly those requesting sensitive permissions such as SMS access or accessibility services‚Äîif they are downloaded via web browsers, messaging apps, or file managers. The move, developed in partnership with Singapore‚Äôs Cyber Security Agency, is designed to prevent fraud and malware-enabled scams.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="7:1-7:398">In parallel, Google has rolled out its Play Integrity API, which allows developers to limit app functionality when sideloaded, effectively pushing users to install apps only through the Google Play Store. These policies reinforce Google‚Äôs control over Android‚Äôs ecosystem under the guise of security but have sparked renewed concern over digital autonomy, innovation suppression, and user rights.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="9:1-9:377">Critics argue that while these measures may reduce malicious activity, they also further consolidate Google‚Äôs monopolistic grip over app distribution‚Äîrestricting user freedom, innovation, and competition. Sideloading, a longstanding pillar of Android‚Äôs openness, is now being marginalized, placing the Android platform closer to the walled-garden approach of Apple‚Äôs iOS.</p><h2>A Secure, Private Alternative: Purism‚Äôs PureOS, Secure Apps, and Librem Phones</h2><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="11:1-12:398">In response to the increasing surveillance, manipulation, and corporate overreach embedded in mainstream mobile ecosystems, Purism offers a privacy-respecting solution. Powered by PureOS, a Debian-based Linux operating system, the Librem 5 and Liberty Phones enable full user autonomy, privacy, and data sovereignty‚Äîfree from the predatory surveillance capitalism that fuels targeted advertising.</p><p><img src="https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop.png" alt="" width="700" height="438" srcset="https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop.png 700w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/l5-front-apps-shadow-crop-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="14:1-14:318">PureOS supports secure, free and open source applications that do not rely on exploitative data mining, addictive algorithms, or behavioral manipulation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Like many other self-styled thinky programmer guys, I like to imagine myself as
a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes">Holmesian</a> genius,
making trenchant observations, collecting them, and then synergizing them into
brilliant deductions with the keen application of my powerful mind.</p>
<p>However, several years ago, I had an epiphany in my self-concept.  I finally
understood that, to the extent that I <em>am</em> usefully clever, it is less in a
Holmesian idiom, and more, shall I we,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Monk">Monkesque</a>.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with either of the respective franchises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holmes is a towering intellect honed by years of training, who catalogues
  intentional, systematic observations and deduces logical, factual conclusions
  from those observations.</li>
<li>Monk, on the other hand, while also a reasonably intelligent guy, is highly
  neurotic, wracked by unresolved trauma and profound grief.  As both a
  consulting job and a coping mechanism, he makes a habit of erratically
  wandering into crime scenes, and, driven by a carefully managed jenga tower
  of mental illnesses, leverages his dual inabilities to solve crimes.  First,
  he is unable to filter out apparently inconsequential details, building up a
  mental rat‚Äôs nest of trivia about the problem; second, he is unable to let go
  of any minor incongruity, obsessively ruminating on the collection of facts
  until they all make sense in a consistent timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, this tendency serves both this fictional wretch of a
detective, and myself, reasonably well.  I find annoying incongruities in
abstractions and I fidget and fiddle with them until I end up building
something that <a href="https://twisted.org/">a lot of people like</a>, or perhaps
something that a smaller number of people get <a href="https://automat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><em>really</em> excited
about</a>.  At worst, at least <a href="https://fritter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><em>I</em>
eventually understand what‚Äôs going
on</a>.  This is a self-soothing
activity but it turns out that, managed properly, it can very effectively
soothe others as well.</p>
<p>All that brings us to today‚Äôs topic, which is an incongruity I cannot smooth
out or fit into a logical framework to make sense.  I am, somewhat reluctantly,
a <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html">genAI</a>
<a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/03/a-bigger-database.html">skeptic</a>.  However, I am, <em>even more</em>
reluctantly, exposed to genAI Discourse every damn minute of every damn day.
It is relentless, inescapable, and exhausting.</p>
<p>This preamble about personality should hopefully help you, dear reader, to
understand how I usually address problematical ideas by thinking and thinking
and fidgeting with them until I manage to write some words ‚Äî or perhaps a new
open source package ‚Äî that logically orders the ideas around it in a way which
allows my brain to calm down and let it go, and how that process is important
to me.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, however, genAI has defeated me.  I cannot make it
make sense, but I need to stop thinking about it anyway.  It is too much and I
need to give up.</p>
<p>My goal with this post is not to <em>convince</em> anyone of anything in particular ‚Äî
and we‚Äôll get to why that is a bit later ‚Äî but rather:</p>
<ol>
<li>to set out my current understanding in one place, including all the various
   negative feelings which are still bothering me, so I can stop repeating it
   elsewhere,</li>
<li>to explain <em>why</em> I cannot build a case that I think <em>should</em> be particularly
   convincing to anyone else, particularly to someone who actively disagrees
   with me,</li>
<li>in so doing, to illustrate why I think the discourse is so fractious and
   unresolvable, and finally</li>
<li>to give myself, and hopefully by proxy to give others in the same situation,
   permission to just peace out of this nightmare quagmire corner of the
   noosphere.</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, just because I can‚Äôt <em>prove</em> that my interlocutors are <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">Wrong On The
Internet</a>, doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt explain why I <em>feel</em>
like they are wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-antis">The Anti-Antis</h2>
<p>Most recently, at time of writing, there have been a spate of ‚Äúthe genAI
discourse is bad‚Äù articles, almost exclusively written from the perspective of,
not <em>boosters</em> exactly, but pragmatically minded (albeit concerned) genAI
users, wishing for the skeptics to be more pointed and accurate in our
critiques.  This is anti-anti-genAI content.</p>
<p>I am not going to link to any of these, because, as part of their
self-fulfilling prophecy about the ‚ÄúgenAI discourse‚Äù, they‚Äôre <em>also</em> all bad.</p>
<p>Mostly, however, they had very little worthwhile to respond to because they
were straw-manning their erstwhile interlocutors.  They are all getting annoyed
at ‚Äúbad genAI criticism‚Äù while failing to engage with ‚Äî and often failing to
even <em>mention</em> ‚Äî most of the actual <em>substance</em> of any serious genAI
criticism.  At least, any of the criticism that I‚Äôve personally read.</p>
<p>I understand wanting to avoid a callout or Gish-gallop culture and just express
your own ideas.  So, I understand that they didn‚Äôt link directly to particular
sources or go point-by-point on anyone else‚Äôs writing.  Obviously I get it,
since that‚Äôs exactly what this post is doing too.</p>
<p>But if you‚Äôre going to talk about how bad the genAI conversation is, without
even <em>mentioning</em> huge categories of problem like ‚Äúclimate impact‚Äù or
‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù<sup id="fnref:1:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:1:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> even once, I honestly don‚Äôt know what conversation you‚Äôre
even talking about.  This is peak ‚Äúmake up a guy to get mad at‚Äù behavior, which
is especially confusing in this circumstance, because there‚Äôs an absolutely
<em>huge</em> crowd of actual people that you could already be mad at.</p>
<p>The people writing these pieces have historically seemed very thoughtful to me.
Some of them I know personally.  It is worrying to me that their critical
thinking skills appear to have substantially degraded <em>specifically</em> after
spending a bunch of time intensely using this technology which I believe has a
<em>scary</em> risk of <a href="https://skepchick.org/2025/05/chatgpt-is-creating-cult-leaders/">degrading one‚Äôs critical thinking
skills</a>.
Correlation is not causation or whatever, and sure, from a rhetorical
perspective this is ‚Äúpost hoc ergo propter hoc‚Äù and maybe a little ‚Äúad hominem‚Äù
for good measure, but correlation can still be <em>concerning</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, I cannot <em>effectively</em> respond to these folks, because they are making a
<em>practical</em> argument that I cannot, despite my best efforts, find compelling
evidence to refute categorically.  <em>My</em> experiences of genAI are all extremely
bad, but that is barely even anecdata.  <em>Their</em> experiences are
neutral-to-positive.  Little scientific data exists.  How to resolve this?<sup id="fnref:2:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:2:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-aesthetics">The Aesthetics</h2>
<p>As I begin to state my <em>own</em> position, let me lead with this: my factual
analysis of genAI is hopelessly negatively biased.  I find the vast majority of
the aesthetic properties of genAI to be <em>intensely</em> unpleasant.</p>
<p>I have been trying <em>very</em> hard to correct for this bias, to try to pay
attention to the facts and to have a clear-eyed view of these systems‚Äô
capabilities. But the feelings are visceral, and the effort to compensate is
tiring.  It is, in fact, the desire to stop making this <em>particular</em> kind of
effort that has me writing up this piece and trying to take an intentional
break from the subject, despite its intense relevance.</p>
<p>When I say its ‚Äúaesthetic qualities‚Äù are unpleasant, I don‚Äôt just mean the
aesthetic elements of output of genAIs themselves. The aesthetic quality of
genAI writing, visual design, animation and so on, while <em>mostly</em> atrocious, is
also highly variable.  There are cherry-picked examples which look‚Ä¶ fine.
Maybe even good.  For years now, there have been, famously, literally
award-winning aesthetic outputs of genAI<sup id="fnref:3:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:3:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While I am ideologically predisposed to see any ‚Äúgood‚Äù genAI art as accruing
the benefits of either a survivorship bias from thousands of terrible outputs
or simple plagiarism rather than its own inherent quality, I cannot deny that
in many cases it <em>is</em> ‚Äúgood‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, I am not just talking about the product, but the process; the
aesthetic experience of interfacing with the genAI system itself, rather than
the aesthetic experience of the outputs of that system.</p>
<p>I am not a visual artist and I am not really a writer<sup id="fnref:4:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:4:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup>, particularly not a
writer of fiction or anything else whose experience is primarily aesthetic.  So
I will speak directly to the experience of software development.</p>
<p>I have seen very few successful examples of using genAI to produce whole,
working systems.  There are no shortage of highly public <a href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny/114622547164112473">miserable
failures</a>, particularly
from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/">the vendors of these systems
themselves</a>,
where the outputs are confused, self-contradictory, full of subtle errors and
generally unusable.  While few studies exist, it sure <em>looks</em> like this is an
automated way of producing a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?NetNegativeProducingProgrammer">Net Negative Productivity
Programmer</a>, throwing out
chaff to slow down the rest of the team.<sup id="fnref:5:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:5:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Juxtapose this with my aforementioned psychological motivations, to wit, I want
to have everything in the computer be <em>orderly</em> and <em>make sense</em>, I‚Äôm sure most
of you would have no trouble imagining that sitting through this sort of
practice would make me <em>extremely</em> unhappy.</p>
<p>Despite this plethora of negative experiences, executives are aggressively
mandating the use of AI<sup id="fnref:6:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:6:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:6">6</a></sup>.  It looks like <em>without</em> such mandates, most
people will not bother to use such tools, so the executives will need muscular
policies to enforce its use.<sup id="fnref:7:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:7:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Being forced to sit and argue with a robot while it struggles and fails to
produce a working output, while you have to rewrite the code at the end anyway,
is incredibly demoralizing.  This is the kind of activity that activates <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/6-causes-of-burnout-and-how-to-avoid-them">every
single major cause of
burnout</a> at
once.</p>
<p>But, at least in that scenario, the thing <em>ultimately doesn‚Äôt work</em>, so there‚Äôs
a hope that after a very stressful six month pilot program, you can go to
management with a pile of meticulously collected evidence, and shut the whole
thing down.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that, in fact, it doesn‚Äôt work well enough to be used
this way, and that we are going to see a big crash.  But that is not the most
aesthetically distressing thing.  The most distressing thing is that maybe it
<em>does</em> work; if not well enough to actually do the work, at least ambiguously
enough to fool the executives long-term.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#written-using-claude">This
project</a>,
in particular, stood out to me as an example.  Its author, a self-professed ‚ÄúAI
skeptic‚Äù who ‚Äúthought LLMs were glorified Markov chain generators that didn‚Äôt
actually understand code and couldn‚Äôt produce anything novel‚Äù, did a
green-field project to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Now, this particular project is not <em>totally</em> inconsistent with a world in
which LLMs cannot produce anything novel.  One could imagine that, out in the
world of open source, perhaps there is enough ‚ÄúOAuth provider written in
TypeScript‚Äù blended up into the slurry of ‚Äúborrowed<sup id="fnref:8:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:8:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:8">8</a></sup>‚Äù training data that the
minor constraint of ‚Äúmake it work on Cloudflare Workers‚Äù is a small tweak<sup id="fnref:9:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:9:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:9">9</a></sup>. It
is not fully dispositive of the question of the viability of ‚ÄúgenAI coding‚Äù.</p>
<p>But it is a data point related to that question, and thus it did make me
contend with what might happen if it <em>were</em> actually a fully demonstrative
example.  I reviewed the commit history, as the author suggested.  For the sake
of argument, I tried to ask myself if I would like working this way.  Just for
clarity on this question, I wanted to suspend judgement about everything else;
assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>the model could be created with ethically, legally, voluntarily sourced
  training data</li>
<li>its usage involved consent from labor rather than authoritarian mandates</li>
<li>sensible levels of energy expenditure, with minimal CO2 impact</li>
<li>it is substantially more efficient to work this way than to just write the
  code yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on, and so on‚Ä¶ would I <em>like</em> to use this magic robot that could mostly
just emit working code for me?  Would I use it if it were <em>free</em>, in all senses
of the word?</p>
<p>No. I absolutely would not.</p>
<p>I found the experience of reading this commit history and imagining myself
using such a tool ‚Äî without exaggeration ‚Äî nauseating.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i+hate+code+review">many programmers</a>, I love
code review.  I find that it is one of the best parts of the process of
programming.  I can help people learn, and develop their skills, and learn
<em>from</em> them, and appreciate the decisions they made, develop an impression of a
fellow programmer‚Äôs style.  It‚Äôs a great way to build a mutual theory of mind.</p>
<p>Of course, it can still be really annoying; people make mistakes, often can‚Äôt
see things I find obvious, and in particular when you‚Äôre reviewing a lot of
code from a lot of different people, you often end up having to repeat
explanations of the <em>same</em> mistakes.  So I can see why many programmers,
particularly those more introverted than I am, hate it.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, when I review their code and work hard to provide clear and
actionable feedback, people learn and grow and it‚Äôs worth that investment in
inconvenience.</p>
<p>The process of coding with an ‚Äúagentic‚Äù LLM appears to be the process of
carefully distilling all the worst parts of code review, and removing and
discarding all of its benefits.</p>
<p>The lazy, dumb, lying robot asshole keeps making the same mistakes over and
over again, never improving, never genuinely reacting, always obsequiously
<em>pretending</em> to take your feedback on board.</p>
<p>Even when it ‚Äúdoes‚Äù actually ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù and manages to load your instructions
into its context window, 200K tokens later it will slide cleanly out of its
memory and you will have to say it again.</p>
<p>All the while, it is attempting to trick you.  It gets most things right, but
it consistently makes mistakes in the places that you are least likely to
notice.  In places where a person <em>wouldn‚Äôt</em> make a mistake.  Your brain keeps
trying to develop a theory of mind to predict its behavior but there‚Äôs no mind
there, so it always behaves infuriatingly randomly.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_2C2CNmK7dQ">I don‚Äôt think I am the only one who feels this way.</a></p>
<h2 id="the-affordances">The Affordances</h2>
<p>Whatever our environments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">afford</a>,
we tend to do more of.  Whatever they resist, we tend to do less of.  So in a
world where we were all writing all of our code and emails and blog posts and
texts to each other with LLMs, what do they afford that existing tools do not?</p>
<p>As a weirdo who enjoys code review, I also enjoy process engineering.  The
central question of almost all process engineering is to continuously ask: how
shall we shape our tools, to better shape ourselves?</p>
<p>LLMs are an affordance for <em>producing more text, faster</em>.  How is that going to
shape us?</p>
<p>Again arguing in the alternative here, assuming the text is free from errors
and hallucinations and whatever, it‚Äôs all correct and fit for purpose, that
means it reduces the pain of circumstances where you have to repeat yourself.
Less pain!  Sounds great; I don‚Äôt like pain.</p>
<p>Every codebase has places where you need boilerplate.  Every organization has
defects in its information architecture that require repetition of certain
information rather than a link back to the authoritative source of truth.
Often, these problems persist for a very long time, because it is difficult to
overcome the institutional inertia required to make real progress rather than
going along with the status quo.  But this is often where the highest-value
projects can be found. <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/408900.html">Where there‚Äôs muck, there‚Äôs
brass</a>.</p>
<p>The process-engineering function of an LLM, therefore, is to prevent
fundamental problems from ever getting fixed, to reward the rapid-fire
overwhelm of infrastructure teams with an immediate, catastrophic cascade of
legacy code that is now much harder to delete than it is to write.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a scene in Game of Thrones where Khal Drogo kills himself.  He does so
by replacing a stinging, burning, therapeutic antiseptic wound dressing with
some cool, soothing mud.  The mud felt nice, addressed the immediate pain,
removed the discomfort of the antiseptic, and immediately gave him a lethal
infection.</p>
<p>The pleasing feeling of immediate progress when one prompts an LLM to solve
some problem feels like cool mud on my brain.</p>
<h3 id="the-economics">The Economics</h3>
<p>We are in the middle of a <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html">mania</a> around
this technology.  As I have written about before, I believe the mania will end.
There will then be a crash, and a ‚Äúwinter‚Äù.  But, as I may not have stressed
sufficiently, this crash will be the biggest of its kind ‚Äî so big, that it is
arguably not of a kind at all.  The level of investment in these technologies
is <em>bananas</em> and the possibility that the investors will recoup their
investment seems close to zero.  Meanwhile, that cost keeps going up, and up,
and up.</p>
<p>Others have reported on this in detail<sup id="fnref:10:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:10:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:10">10</a></sup>, and I will not reiterate that all
here, but in addition to being a looming and scary industry-wide (if we are
lucky; more likely it‚Äôs probably ‚Äúworld-wide‚Äù) economic threat, it is also
going to drive some panicked behavior from management.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_panic">Panicky behavior from management</a>
stressed that their idea is not panning out is, famously, the cause of much
human misery.  I expect that even in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù scenario, where <em>some</em> profit
is ultimately achieved, will still involve mass layoffs rocking the industry,
panicked re-hiring, destruction of large amounts of wealth.</p>
<p>It feels bad to think about this.</p>
<h3 id="the-energy-usage">The Energy Usage</h3>
<p>For a long time I believed that the energy impact was overstated.  I am even on
record, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/112242020641010867">about a year ago</a>,
saying I didn‚Äôt think the energy usage was a big deal.  I think I was wrong
about that.</p>
<p>It initially seemed like it was letting regular old data centers off the hook.
But recently I have learned that, while the numbers are incomplete because the
vendors aren‚Äôt sharing information, they‚Äôre also <em>extremely</em> bad.<sup id="fnref:11:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:11:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:11">11</a></sup></p>

emergency nightmare, but that‚Äôs not the version that the general public has
access to today.</p>
<h2 id="the-educational-impact">The Educational Impact</h2>
<p>LLMs are making academic cheating <em>incredibly</em> rampant.<sup id="fnref:12:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:12:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Not only is it so common as to be nearly universal, it‚Äôs also extremely harmful
to learning.<sup id="fnref:13:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:13:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>For learning, genAI is a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samhalpert.bsky.social/post/3lmt3coqvqk2w">forklift at the
gym</a>.</p>
<p>To some extent, LLMs are simply revealing a structural rot within education and
academia that has been building for decades if not centuries.  But it was
within those inefficiencies and the inconveniences of the academic experience
that real learning <em>was</em>, against all odds, still happening in schools.</p>
<p>LLMs produce a frictionless, streamlined process where students can
effortlessly glide through the entire credential, learning nothing.  Once
again, they dull the pain without regard to its cause.</p>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<h2 id="the-invasion-of-privacy">The Invasion of Privacy</h2>
<p>This is obviously only a problem with the big cloud models, but then, the big
cloud models are the only ones that people actually use.  If you are having
conversations about anything private with ChatGPT, you are sending all of that
private information directly to Sam Altman, to do with as he wishes.</p>
<p>Even if you don‚Äôt think he is a particularly bad guy, maybe he won‚Äôt even
create the privacy nightmare on purpose.  Maybe he will be forced to do so as a
result of some bizarre kafkaesque accident.<sup id="fnref:14:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:14:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Imagine the scenario, for example, where a woman is tracking her cycle and
uploading the logs to ChatGPT so she can chat with it about a health concern.
Except, surprise, you don‚Äôt have to imagine, you can just search for it, as <em>I</em>
have personally, organically, seen three separate women on YouTube, at least
one of whom <em>lives in Texas</em>, not only do this on camera but <em>recommend doing
this to their audiences</em>.</p>
<p>Citation links withheld on this particular claim for hopefully obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I assure you that I am neither particularly interested in menstrual products

distressingly large trend.</p>

<p>The training data for LLMs is stolen.  I don‚Äôt mean like ‚Äúpirated‚Äù in the sense

<h2 id="the-fatigue">The Fatigue</h2>
<p>I have provided references to numerous articles outlining rhetorical and
sometimes data-driven cases for the existence of certain properties and
consequences of genAI tools.  But I can‚Äôt <em>prove</em> any of these properties,
either at a point in time or as a durable ongoing problem.</p>
<p>The LLMs themselves are simply too large to model with the usual kind of
heuristics one would use to think about software.  I‚Äôd sooner be able to
predict the physics of dice in a casino than a 2 trillion parameter neural
network.  They resist scientific understanding, not just because of their size
and complexity, but because unlike a natural phenomenon (which could of course
be considerably larger and more complex) they <em>resist experimentation</em>.</p>
<p>The first form of genAI resistance to experiment is that every discussion is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy">motte-and-bailey</a>.  If
I use a free model and get a bad result I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs because I should have
used the paid model.  If I get a bad result with ChatGPT I should have used
Claude. If I get a bad result with a chatbot I need to start using an agentic
tool. If an agentic tool deletes my hard drive by putting <code>os.system(‚Äúrm -rf
~/‚Äù)</code> into <code>sitecustomize.py</code> then I guess I should have built my own MCP
integration with a completely novel heretofore never even considered security
sandbox or something?</p>
<p>What configuration, exactly, would let me make a categorical claim about these
things?  What specific methodological approach should I stick to, to get
reliably adequate prompts?</p>
<p>For the record though, if the idea of the free models is that they are going to
be provocative demonstrations of the impressive capabilities of the commercial
models, and the results are consistently dogshit, I am finding it increasingly
<a href="https://ioc.exchange/@kevinriggle/114617713278070348">hard to care</a> how much
better the paid ones are supposed to be, especially since the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù-ness
cannot really be quantified in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>The motte-and-bailey doesn‚Äôt stop there though.  It‚Äôs a war on all fronts.
Concerned about energy usage?  That‚Äôs OK, you can use a local model.  Concerned
about infringement?  That‚Äôs okay, somewhere, somebody, maybe, has figured out
how to train models consensually<sup id="fnref:18:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:18:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:18">18</a></sup>.  Worried about the politics of enriching
the richest monsters in the world?  Don‚Äôt worry, you can always download an
‚Äúopen source‚Äù model from Hugging Face.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that many of these
properties are mutually exclusive and attempting to fix one breaks two others;
there‚Äôs always an answer, the field is so abuzz with so many people trying to
pull in so many directions at once that it is legitimately difficult to
understand what‚Äôs going on.</p>
<p>Even here though, I can see that characterizing everything this way is unfair
to a hypothetical sort of person.  If there is someone working at one of these
thousands of AI companies that have been springing up like toadstools after a
rain, and they <em>really are</em> solving one of these extremely difficult problems,
how can I handwave that away?  We need people working on problems, that‚Äôs like,
the whole point of having an economy.  And I really don‚Äôt like shitting on
other people‚Äôs earnest efforts, so I try not to dismiss whole fields.  Given
how AI has gotten into <em>everything</em>, in a way that e.g. cryptocurrency never
did, painting with that broad a brush inevitably ends up tarring a bunch of
stuff that isn‚Äôt even really AI at all.</p>
<p>The second form of genAI resistance to experiment is the inherent obfuscation
of productization.  The models themselves are already complicated enough, but
the <em>products</em> that are built around the models are evolving extremely rapidly.
ChatGPT is not just a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù, and with the rapid<sup id="fnref:19:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:19:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:19">19</a></sup> deployment of Model
Context Protocol tools, the edges of all these things will blur even further.
Every LLM is now just an enormous unbounded soup of arbitrary software doing
arbitrary whatever.  How could I possibly get my arms around that to understand
it?</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>I have woefully little experience with these tools.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried them out a little bit, and almost every single time the result has
been a disaster that has not made me curious to push further.  Yet, I keep
hearing from all over the industry that I should.</p>
<p>To some extent, I feel like the motte-and-bailey characterization above is
fair; if the technology itself can really do real software development, it
ought to be able to do it in multiple modalities, and there‚Äôs nothing anyone
can <em>articulate</em> to me about GPT-4o which puts it in a fundamentally different
class than GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>But, also, I consistently hear that the <em>subjective experience</em> of using the
premium versions of the tools is actually good, and the free ones are actually
bad.</p>
<p>I keep struggling to find ways to try them ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù, the way that people
I know and otherwise respect claim to be using them, but I haven‚Äôt managed to
do so in any meaningful way yet.</p>
<p>I do not want to be using the cloud versions of these models with their
potentially hideous energy demands; I‚Äôd like to use a local model.  But there
is obviously not a nicely composed way to use local models like this.</p>
<p>Since there are apparently <em>zero</em> models with ethically-sourced training data,
and litigation is ongoing<sup id="fnref:20:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:20:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:20">20</a></sup> to determine the legal relationships of training
data and outputs, even if I can be comfortable with some level of plagiarism on
a project, I don‚Äôt feel that I can introduce the existential legal risk into
<a href="https://pypi.org/user/glyph/">other people‚Äôs infrastructure</a>, so I would need
to make a <em>new</em> project.</p>
<p>Others have differing opinions of course, including some within my dependency
chain, which does worry me, but I still don‚Äôt feel like I can freely contribute
further to the problem; it‚Äôs going to be bad enough to unwind any impact
upstream.  Even just for my own sake, I don‚Äôt want to make it worse.</p>
<p>This especially presents a problem because I have <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/112498550495367755">way too much stuff going
on</a> already.  A new project
is not practical.</p>
<p>Finally, even if I <em>did</em> manage to satisfy all of my quirky<sup id="fnref:21:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:21:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:21">21</a></sup> constraints,
would this experiment really be worth anything?  The models and tools that
people are raving about are the big, expensive, harmful ones.  If I proved to
myself yet again that a small model with bad tools was unpleasant to use, I
wouldn‚Äôt really be addressing my opponents‚Äô views.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm stuck.</p>
<h2 id="the-surrender">The Surrender</h2>
<p>I am writing this piece to make <em>my</em> peace with giving up on this topic, at
least for a while.  While I do idly hope that some folks might find bits of it
convincing, and perhaps find ways to be more mindful with their own usage of
genAI tools, and consider the harm they may be causing, that‚Äôs not actually the
goal.  And that is not the goal because it is just so much goddamn <em>work</em> to
prove.</p>
<p>Here, I must return to my philosophical hobbyhorse of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)">sprachspiel</a>.  In
this case, specifically to use it as an analytical tool, not just to understand
<em>what</em> I am trying to say, but what the <em>purpose</em> for my speech is.</p>
<p>The concept of sprachspiel is most frequently deployed to describe the <em>goal</em>
of the language game being played, but in game theory, that‚Äôs only half the
story.  Speech ‚Äî particularly rigorously justified speech ‚Äî has a <em>cost</em>, as
well as a benefit.  I can make shit up pretty easily, but if I want to do
anything remotely like scientific or academic rigor, that cost can be
astronomical.  In the case of developing an abstract understanding of LLMs, the
cost is just too high.</p>
<p>So what is my goal, then?  To be king Canute, standing astride the shore of
‚Äútech‚Äù, whatever that is, commanding the LLM tide not to rise?  This is a
multi-trillion dollar juggernaut.</p>
<p>Even the rump, loser, also-ran fragment of it has the power to literally
suffocate us in our homes<sup id="fnref:22:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6"><a href="#fn:22:i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now-2025-6" id="fnref:22">22</a></sup> if they so choose, completely insulated from any
consequence.  If the power curve starts there, imagine what the <em>winners</em> in
this industry are going to be capable of, irrespective of the technology
they‚Äôre building - just with the resources they have to hand.  Am I going to
write a blog post that can rival their propaganda apparatus?  Doubtful.</p>
<p>Instead, I will just have to concede that maybe I‚Äôm wrong.  I don‚Äôt have the
skill, or the knowledge, or the energy, to demonstrate with any level of rigor
that LLMs are generally, in fact, hot garbage.  Intellectually, I will have to
acknowledge that maybe the boosters are right.  Maybe it‚Äôll be OK.</p>
<p>Maybe the carbon emissions aren‚Äôt so bad.  Maybe everybody is keeping them
secret in ways that they don‚Äôt for other types of datacenter for perfectly
legitimate reasons.  Maybe the tools really can write novel and correct code,
and with a little more tweaking, it won‚Äôt be so difficult to get them to do it.
Maybe by the time they become a mandatory condition of access to developer
tools, they won‚Äôt be miserable.</p>
<p>Sure, I even sincerely agree, intellectual property really has been a pretty
bad idea from the beginning.  Maybe it‚Äôs OK that we‚Äôve made an exception to
those rules.  The rules were stupid anyway, so what does it matter if we let a
few billionaires break them?  Really, everybody should be able to break them
(although of course, regular people can‚Äôt, because we can‚Äôt afford the lawyers
to fight off the MPAA and RIAA, but that‚Äôs a problem with the legal system, not
tech).</p>
<p>I come not to praise ‚ÄúAI skepticism‚Äù, but to bury it.</p>
<p>Maybe it really is all going to be fine.  Perhaps I am simply catastrophizing;
I have been known to do that from time to time.  I can even sort of believe it,
in my head.  Still, even after writing all this out, I can‚Äôt quite manage to
believe it in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that feeling is not something that you, or I, can argue with.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This spring, a new business opened on the main drag of my West Philadelphia neighborhood, provoking both excitement and trepidation.</p><p>‚ÄúI saw it just the other day and feared it,‚Äù one friend texted. ‚ÄúLike what the actual fuck is that shit,‚Äù said another. ‚ÄúWhy?!!!‚Äù said a third. ‚ÄúWho is that for?‚Äù</p><p>Until last summer, the corner storefront at Baltimore Avenue and S. Melville Street was a moderately overpriced hipster vintage store. After it closed, it sat empty for nearly a year. Then, in March, it sprang to life.&nbsp;</p><p>A ‚Äúgrand opening‚Äù banner went up over the door. A miniature wacky inflatable tube man flailed around outside. Posters with the logos for Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy covered the windows, declaring ‚ÄúCRAZY DEALS, AMAZING BINZ.‚Äù I had to check it out.</p><p>AMAZING BINZ is on the first floor of a rowhome, narrow and long. There‚Äôs one central aisle, and on either side, big wooden tray tables‚Äîthe proverbial binz‚Äîoverflowing with undifferentiated piles of consumer <em>stuff</em>: unopened Halloween costumes, an ice mold shaped like a penis, a banner of many glittery penises wearing grass skirts, a staggering number of ‚Äúreusable hot and cold gel compression sleeve[s] for elbow,‚Äù a single loose pregnancy test, something called Wokaar for ‚Äúwaxing the nose beard.‚Äù</p><p>At least half the products are still in boxes, and there are signs on the walls warning customers to NOT OPEN THE BOXES, so you have to scan the barcode with your phone or decipher clipped product descriptions: ‚Äúmodule stool,‚Äù ‚Äúgratitude journal,‚Äù ‚ÄúXmas tea light green.‚Äù But the great innovation of Amazing Binz is its pricing structure, which is splashed across the facade in Spanish and English and makes good on the promise of CRAZY DEALS. On Fridays, when the bins are freshly stocked, everything costs $10. On Saturdays, $8. Sundays: $6. Mondays: $4. Tuesdays: $2. Wednesdays: $1. Thursday is bin store Sabbath, when the shop is closed and restocked.&nbsp;</p><p>The store is like nothing else on the block, which boasts, among other things, a yoga studio, two vape shops, a volunteer-run book store <em>and </em>a Marxist reading room, and no fewer than four Ethiopian joints.&nbsp;</p><p>Where did all this stuff come from? Who opened this store, and why? Is it profitable? What does it mean for the uneven gentrification of Baltimore Avenue and West Philadelphia? I decided to spend a week visiting Amazing Binz every day. Here is what I found.</p><h2><strong>Thursday: Restock Day</strong></h2><p>On Thursdays, Amazing Binz is closed. One of the owners, Ahmed, has graciously allowed me to observe the restock. Overall, Ahmed has been very gracious about my fixation on his store.</p><p>When I arrive at 10:30 a.m., he‚Äôs smoking a cigarette and nervously awaiting a delivery truck with 18 pallets of mixed merchandise from Target. Amazing Binz gets its inventory from major corporations‚Äô overstock and returned products, taking advantage of the vast weird world of ‚Äúreverse logistics.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚Äú‚ÄäYou've got the front end, where you order the product, it comes into the port, it goes to a warehouse, to a store, and then to our front door,‚Äù says Cathy Roberson, a researcher at the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry trade group. ‚ÄúWhat if once it hits our front door, we don't like it, or it's broken or something? That's the reverse part.‚Ää‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Returns, repairs, refurbished products, and even recalls fall into the purview of reverse logistics. They are joined there by products that never made it to a consumer because the season ended, or a box was a little dented, or the purchaser never picked up their order, or a retailer was just running out of room in their warehouse.</p><p>That pile of excess stuff is growing. About 17 percent of all merchandise gets returned, according to the National Retail Federation. That‚Äôs up from just eight percent in 2019. For online purchases, it‚Äôs almost 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquidators are nothing new: T.J. Maxx, Ocean State Job Lot, Nordstrom Rack. But as the scale of the excess grows, the reverse logistics industry is expanding, and methods of disposal are diversifying. Some corporations, like Amazon, do their own reselling through a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Bulk-Liquidations/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=23511005011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bulk liquidation page</a>. There are middlemen like <a href="https://bstock.com/amazoneu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B-Stock</a>, an eBay-like site where anyone can shop for truckloads of unwanted stuff. Influencers are buying pallets to unbox on stream, capitalizing on both the goods and the views. It‚Äôs a whole universe of brokers, wholesalers, and secondhand retail all trying to claw back a little bit of money from the growing pile. That‚Äôs where Amazing Binz comes in.</p><p>‚ÄúThe goal for all the reverse logistics stuff,‚Äù says Roberson, ‚Äúis to keep things out of the landfill.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Ahmed is expecting half a truckload with about 3,500 to 4,500 individual pieces, ranging from kitchen appliances to toys to clothing; he doesn‚Äôt know exactly what. The semi-truck pulls up right on time, and Ahmed unloads it with a forklift, cigarette still in mouth. Pallets fill the sidewalk, glistening shrink-wrapped towers of stuff: air fryers, microwaves, a vacuum, a sled, a machine that tosses a football, My Little Pony-branded diapers, and a go-kart.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Shrinkwrapped pallets outside the bin store." src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2282.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><p>Inside the store, the bins are still half-full from the last truckload, which came from Amazon. There are many products I‚Äôve only ever seen on the internet: a carrying case and monogrammed straw cover for a Stanley cup, a big plastic grinder for shredding chicken, silicone molds for making the viral Dubai chocolate bar at home.&nbsp;</p><p>For this restock, Ahmed was hoping for a different caliber of item. It‚Äôs a mixed success: some quality products, but more clothing and returned items than he was hoping for. Electronics are the holy grail; appliances and home goods do well, too. The best items are the ones that retain their value, because Ahmed sees his customers as agents in the reverse logistics economy, too.</p><p>‚ÄúYou can buy stuff from here and then you can resell it,‚Äù Ahmed tells me. ‚ÄúThrough eBay or Amazon. You can sell on Facebook market. You will get your money back in less than one day if you wanna resell it. Which is a good thing for everybody right now, for the public. A lot of people need to work.‚Äù</p><p>It‚Äôs a slog of a day. I leave after a few hours, and come back at 6:00 p.m., nearly eight hours into this operation. Ahmed and two helpers are still unloading and stocking. They won‚Äôt be done until after 10:00 p.m.</p><h2><strong>Friday: $10</strong></h2><p>I get to Amazing Binz at 9:35 a.m. It opens at 10:00 a.m. Already, two people are standing at the door with their faces pressed to the glass.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, six people are waiting, then a dozen. A woman and her kids show up in a taxi. At least one person has come from the county over. Amazing Binz <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amazingbinz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts their new hauls on Instagram</a>, so some people have already scouted what they want: a kid‚Äôs scooter, a shower caddy. Fridays offer the highest upside: a chance to score something really valuable for just $10. All the real shoppers are lined up this morning, looking for an edge.&nbsp;</p><p>People are arriving every minute; the line swells to 25. Most of the people waiting are middle-aged black men and women. Some are resellers, and many seem well-versed in Philadelphia‚Äôs liquidation economy. A few bring up <a href="https://turn7.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 7</a>, a giant liquidation warehouse with a bin model that closed last month. I learn about another bin store in New Jersey, and one in Northeast Philly called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackfridayoutletphilly/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday Outlet</a>, a nationwide bin store chain. Someone tells me there‚Äôs another bin store opening up <em>today</em>, just 10 blocks away.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen I first got into this industry, there were no more than 10 bin stores in the entire country,‚Äù says Nebraska-based wholesaler and content creator Colton Carlson, who opened his first store in 2018. ‚ÄúFast forward a few years, [and] there ended up being 3,000 bin stores.‚Äù Today, he thinks there could be as many as 10,000 in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>Bin stores are distinguished by their pricing model‚Äîa set price per item or weight, and falling prices to incentivize quick sales‚Äîand by their agnostic approach to inventory. They‚Äôll take nearly anything and everything.</p><p>‚ÄúOnce people caught on that you could buy a truckload of inventory, you dump it in your bins and you make a ton of money, then they really just started opening that rapid-fire at that point,‚Äù says Carlson.</p><p>The explosion of online returns got the bin-store craze started, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Factory shutdowns and slowdowns at ports meant for weird lags in the supply chain that led to seasonal products arriving past their season, or goods just being abandoned at port. To try and weather the uncertainty, and keep up with exploding online shopping, retailers overstocked on inventory.</p><p>‚ÄúIn the beginning of the pandemic, we bought everything in sight,‚Äù says Roberson. ‚ÄúThen all of a sudden we, the consumer, decided we've had enough. We've bought everything. We've gotta tighten our belts now.‚Äù</p><p>Consumer spending dropped, and retailers were left holding the bag in overstuffed warehouses. Some, like Target, ‚Äú‚Ääkind of got caught with their pants down,‚Äù says Roberson. They were stuck with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/target-markdowns-plan-to-cut-inventory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so much excess inventory</a>, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The secondhand market flooded with more cheap stuff than normal, creating opportunities for resellers.</p><p>‚ÄúOn opening day, we had about 300 people lined up down the street,‚Äù says Carlson, who thinks his was the biggest bin store in the country at the time. ‚ÄúEvery weekend from that, it was just the same thing: a line down the street with 200, 300 people ready to find a deal.‚Äù</p><figure><img alt="Wokaar nose hair waxing kit on top of a pile of goods." src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1842.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><p>This Friday morning at Amazing Binz, there are now over 30 people waiting to be let inside.</p><p>Finally, the doors open and the crowd floods into the narrow shop, honing in on the premier items. Scooters and grills and Target-branded home goods fly out of the bins. People are hauling around air fryers so no one else can take them. It is, frankly, a bit of a mad house. One reseller, who didn‚Äôt find anything he wanted, says, ‚ÄúOne of these days, someone‚Äôs going to get shot.‚Äù A woman declares, ‚ÄúI will never do this again.‚Äù</p><p>Generally, people seem happy with their finds. The guy who wanted the scooters gets the scooters; the woman who wanted the shower caddy gets the shower caddy. It all happens fast. By the end of the day, the first two bins are completely empty.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Saturday: $8</strong></h2><p>It‚Äôs farmer‚Äôs market day in West Philadelphia, Baltimore Avenue‚Äôs busiest day. The store is much calmer than Friday morning, but still doing a brisk business. Where yesterday there were piles of home goods and appliances, the bins have been restocked with less high-end fare: soccer balls, bike inner tubes, sand art kits, clothing, shoes.</p><p>I want to get a sense of how neighbors are feeling. Once, while digging in the bins, I heard a young guy muttering to himself. ‚ÄúThis is so weird. What am I looking at?‚Äù We made eye contact. ‚ÄúHave you ever seen a store like this?‚Äù he asked me. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt feel right. I don‚Äôt think this will be here long.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>I check West Willy, the easily parodied local Facebook group. A post about Amazing Binz has over 50 comments, ranging from ‚Äúomg I am EXCITED,‚Äù to ‚ÄúMaybe I can find things I need and not weep over the price,‚Äù to ‚ÄúNo offense to the owners but this store feels like where late stage capitalism goes for one final hurrah.‚Äù</p><p>I ask the book vendor who sets up outside the Marxist storefront how he feels about Amazing Binz. ‚ÄúIt shows the corporation‚Äôs incursion into the neighborhood at every level, big to small,‚Äù he says. He adds that he likes that it‚Äôs a minority-owned business.</p><p>I ask a resident who happens to be walking by, a long-timer who moved to the neighborhood in the 1970s when it was, as he says, Philadelphia‚Äôs answer to Haight-Ashbury. ‚ÄúIt means a potential downturn of the local market that had been popping up with restaurants and boutiques,‚Äù he says.</p><p>Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that‚Äôs a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city‚Äôs most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I‚Äôve lived here, I‚Äôve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an ‚Äúamazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices‚Äù (their first Google review) or ‚Äúa place that sells crap‚Äù (a post on West Willy).&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs an odd location for a store like this. Liquidators usually look for huge spaces, in industrial areas or big shopping centers at the edge of town. When I ask Ahmed how he came to open Amazing Binz here, he said it was actually not his first choice. He wanted to open a cafe or a sweet shop, but says he couldn‚Äôt get the permits or the zoning. The landlord wouldn‚Äôt give him a break on rent, which is nearly $4,000 a month.&nbsp;</p><p>So after about eight months of sitting on the location, Ahmed decided he needed to open something with low overhead and little startup capital. There‚Äôs a few bin stores in Northeast Philly, where he lives, so he‚Äôd seen this model before, and thought it would be good for the neighborhood. At the start of this week, he hung a Free Palestine flag behind the counter. He‚Äôs from the West Bank and felt comfortable hanging the flag because, he says, ‚ÄúOur neighbors support us.‚Äù</p><p>Nearly every time I‚Äôm here, there are happy customers, usually quite a few. There's a real mix of the neighborhood. Serious diggers, often in headphones, methodically overturn every pile. A PTA mom sends her husband home for the car after she fills three baskets with school supplies. Some gigglers revel in the slop and the strangely sentimental: the Dick Pics in Nature calendar, the crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message.</p><figure><figure><img alt="Dick Pics in Nature calendar" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1925.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2303.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But there are haters. At parties and potlucks across West Philadelphia, my neighbors split into camps: for or against the bin store. Houses divide against themselves. Pros: It‚Äôs cheap, it‚Äôs fun, and at least the stuff isn‚Äôt getting thrown away. Cons: An uncanny feeling of glimpsing the collective consumer psyche, AI slop in consumer form, the horrors of production for production‚Äôs sake.&nbsp;</p><p>At the farmer‚Äôs market, a friend of a friend calls Amazing Binz ‚Äúdark and sinister,‚Äù and compares it to a big sifting funnel. All the consumer drivel of the world goes in at the top, and all the unsaleable, undigested, unwanted stuff just falls out the bottom. ‚ÄúThe bin store,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis like the last step before they just throw it in the ocean.‚Äù</p><h2><strong>Sunday: $6</strong></h2><p>When I get to Amazing Binz, Omran‚ÄîAmazing Binz‚Äôs social media hype man‚Äîis <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIZPZP2PCee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming a video</a> with a shopper who found the toner she usually buys at Sephora, for $65, here in the bins for $6.</p><p>This is one of Omran‚Äôs Instagram shticks. He asks customers what they bought and how much they paid, and then replies, ‚ÄúI know daht‚Äôs right,‚Äù a phrase also tagged on all the posts.&nbsp;</p><p>Omran does some of the ordering for Amazing Binz. He says he buys his inventory through direct relationships with people at warehouses, not through auction sites, where the prices are often higher. Ahmed tells me the average truckload costs about $16,000, and will contain thousands of individual pieces. The key is to keep the cost per item at around $2, and to get a mix of higher- and lower-value items so they balance each other out.&nbsp;</p><p>Most bin stores do a hybrid model, where they sell higher-quality stuff on the side at prices above $10. Amazing Binz calls it the VIP section. With this week‚Äôs Target haul, I assumed that the nicer items would end up there. But no, the owners priced most of it at $10, hoping the allure of a huge discount on a big-ticket item draws people in and gets them to spend more.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the bin-store promise: teasing the chance to find Oura rings and AirPods for just $10. Once, while I talked to Ahmed,<strong> </strong>a neighbor walked by and waved. ‚ÄúShe got those Beats headphones here,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTen dollars. She was so happy.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>But the price flattening works in both directions, I realize on a $6 Sunday. A friend is shopping for a mermaid-themed bachelorette party, and we find plenty: That previously mentioned garland of penises is still here (two, actually), as well as a sheet of mermaid stickers and a curly straw that spells "BRIDE."</p><p>The problem is that $6 is too expensive for a straw, especially a straw that I know has been here for three weeks, at least. This is one effect of the bin store: There‚Äôs plenty of legitimately good stuff, at good prices, but that&nbsp; usually gets snapped up in the first few days. Anything that remains through the whole pricing cycle and back again is revealed to be worth nothing at all.</p><p>My friend, digging for penis straws, says maybe it‚Äôs good to see. We have to confront this stuff. This is the cost of our collective Amazon addiction.&nbsp;</p><p>There are times when the bin store does feel like an art installation, a message, or a warning. Wander through it for a few days and you will start to feel like you are in a room in a haunted house, one where the corporeal forms of the world economy‚Äôs least-wanted products are trapped, unable to move on.</p><p>With or without Amazing Binz, all of this stuff is just out there, already made. A lot of it is useful but excessive, rendered obsolete by an overheated economy. Shopping here can feel a bit like fighting the last, losing battle of reverse logistics. What can still be made useful enough to be kept out of the landfill, just a little longer?</p><h2><strong>Monday: $4</strong></h2><p>It‚Äôs a slow day at Amazing Binz, again. This week has been big on gloomy weather, and low on foot traffic. I find a Trump 2024 Punisher logo drink koozie in the pile. These have been popping up in the bins since that first Amazon haul, along with MAGA and Let‚Äôs Go Brandon flags. Every time a customer points one out to the owners, they throw it away.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1851.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><p>A woman approaches the counter with a pair of leopard-print flats, but the two shoes are connected by a stretchy white loop of elastic that‚Äôs gotten tangled up with at least five other pairs‚Äô elastic, creating an unholy rats nest of shoes that she needs help untangling.&nbsp;</p><p>On slower days, it‚Äôs hard not to wonder how long Amazing Binz will last. Philadelphia may be behind the times. In the rest of the country, the bin-store bubble has started to burst. On YouTube, I find a cadre of wholesale and reselling influencers, including a bin-store niche. I watch their videos touting the model, how easy it is to start one, and how to succeed. Then I watch them change their tunes.</p><p>‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9US81xrM8&amp;t=10s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unpopular opinion: Bin stores really suck right now</a>,‚Äù declared creator Lindey Glenn in November 2023. She linked to Carlson‚Äôs most recent video: ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfFRAfKmTfQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bin store burnout</a>.‚Äù</p><p>After opening his first store in late 2018, Carlson had a few good years riding high on the novelty of the business model and the glut of unwanted pandemic-era merchandise. But as more bin stores opened, the demand and prices for the same truckloads went up. Colton says that after a while, he was just breaking even on the bins, which at his store, started at a high of only $5.&nbsp;</p><p>He found other revenue streams, like selling entire pallets to resellers, and sorting out the niche and expensive products to flip on Poshmark or eBay. But the challenges persisted. The bin store is a finely tuned operation. A broker might promise a great haul with new electronics, and then deliver a bunch of dirty and broken returns. A truckload could arrive late, or not at all, leaving owners in the lurch on what should be their most profitable day. These problems are exacerbated in small stores, like Amazing Binz, where it‚Äôs hard to store extra merchandise to weather that uncertainty.</p><p>And the stuff itself creates logistical headaches. Boxes get opened, sometimes from theft, sometimes just from jostling around in the bins. Pieces get lost, trash and detritus build up alongside the unsold products, the difference between them increasingly hard to discern. In fact, when it was time to clear his bins, Carlton would dump all of the unsold inventory mixed with trash back onto a pallet and sell the whole thing for $50, with the caveat that the buyer had to go toss the garbage somewhere else.</p><p>Carlson saw the writing on the wall. He sold his bin store in 2023. Now he‚Äôs focusing on his wholesale business, and opening a side-by-side discount grocery and clothing store, which is where he thinks the secondhand retail trends are headed.</p><p>The Reverse Logistics Association has also seen a decline in bin-store fortunes. Roberson says they lost a few bin-store members because of bankruptcy. After the pandemic, ‚Äúit was getting more difficult to buy up that excess inventory because there really wasn't excess inventory.‚Äù</p><p>But economic shocks are good for the secondhand economy. Roberson thinks tariffs could, eventually, lead to another bin-store bump. At the start of 2025, she says, many retailers overstocked on inventory again, filling their warehouses to get ahead of price hikes. That could mean they‚Äôll soon be sitting on overstock, especially if consumers decide they‚Äôre not willing to pay higher prices. Supply chain disruptions will produce more excess. Already, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/importers-china-trade-chaos-tariffs-b3463832?st=XFNmLu&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goods are stalled</a> at ports around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Roberson predicts a temporary dip in the fortunes of bin-store owners, as secondhand goods get more expensive along with everything else, and then a resurgence. Carlson agrees. ‚Äú‚ÄäI think the secondhand market is going to keep growing because that's the whole reason people are shopping at these stores [to see] if they can save $10. I don't see consumer spending going down for this industry, or even like thrift stores at all. I think that's gonna continuously go up. However, the problem's gonna lie on whoever owns the bin store.‚Äù</p><h2><strong>Tuesday: $2</strong></h2><p>Ahmed seems extremely tired today. He‚Äôs barely taken a day off since they opened, not even for Eid. Everything is pretty picked over. The sand art is all gone, the bedding and curtains. There‚Äôs just two soccer balls left. I do my customary scan of the bins, from the back of the store to the front. There‚Äôs nothing new, just increasingly empty boxes of gel compression elbow sleeves, loose whippit canisters,<strong> </strong>and batteries rolling across the bottom.</p><figure><figure><img alt="A bin overflowing with items" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_1920.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="A pregnancy test in a bin" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/IMG_2107.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Jen Kinney</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>According to Ahmed, the cost of pallets is going up. On a recent load of electronics, he paid $12 per item. For the time being, Amazing Binz is just breaking even, but it‚Äôs not sustainable. Ahmed says he may have to raise prices, and that he‚Äôll even have to reevaluate the whole business in a few months. ‚ÄúThis type of business, it‚Äôs not for this neighborhood,‚Äù he says.</p><p>Omran, ever the salesman, is darkly optimistic that they can keep prices low. "Anything to save the community some money,‚Äù he says. ‚Ää"We're not looking to get rich. Being rich is pointless nowadays. It's about, how can you survive? How can I feed my kids? How can we pay our bills?‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôm reminded of a conversation I had with the truck driver, Nick, who dropped off the Target load. He used to drive a taxi, until Uber ruined that. He prefers truck driving, but it was better at the height of the pandemic, when everyone was shopping online.&nbsp;</p><p>Around that time, Nick‚Äôs wife was a third-party seller on Amazon. She stocked her inventory based on social media trends, a task complicated by the algorithm. The more she looked at videos of, say, people showing off their Stanley cup accessories, the more TikTok fed her those videos, until it was hard to know if people were actually buying them in the real world, or if she was just in an online feedback loop. Plus, Amazon charges high storage fees, so unsold product just sitting in their warehouse cost her money. She quit, and abandoned her merchandise. That‚Äôs where a lot of the stuff in the Amazing Binz came from: failing third-party vendors, looking to offload the detritus of brief and bygone trends.</p><p>For a second, an image of the 21st century economy seems to come into focus here at the bin store. Nick, his wife, Amazing Binz‚Äôs owners, and even me, a freelance journalist, we‚Äôre all supposedly free agents, ‚Äúentrepreneurs,‚Äù but in reality, we‚Äôre limited to buying whatever gets kicked down the funnel, and flipping it for all it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs like I can see our labor getting discounted by the day. Already, I've asked my editor if I can resell a version of this story elsewhere, to recoup a little more of my Amazing Binz investment.</p><h2><strong>Wednesday: $1</strong></h2><p>At 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday, a little over an hour until closing time, the shop is packed. Everything is now one dollar.</p><p>An elderly woman finds a shoe she likes, a black slide with gold studs all over. But it's just one shoe. Ahmed is insisting she buy it, and says he‚Äôll keep the other shoe for her when he finds it. ‚ÄúFor a dollar you can‚Äôt beat it,‚Äù he says. He‚Äôs in a good mood, joking with this woman and her daughter. She‚Äôs apparently been looking for three days.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThose shoes are really cute,‚Äù I tell her.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúDo you work here?‚Äù she asks. Maybe I‚Äôve been here too long.</p><p>After days of finding empty boxes, I finally find a loose elbow gel sleeve. It is heavy, slinky, comforting. After this, I find many of them, hiding in the bins like eels. Everything swims around the piles, and I revisit them as old friends, including the unopened boxes, known only by their clipped epithets: ‚ÄúKiss Me I‚Äôm Irish wooden sign with lights,‚Äù ‚ÄúLazy Susan for Refrigerator New.‚Äù The Jujube Enucleator box is full one day, and empty the next, without me ever seeing what was inside. The Dick Pics in Nature calendar remains, week after week. Who knows how many times these items have been bought and sold before they arrived here, how many more times they might be bought and sold. I imagine it all ending up in the same places eventually: the landfill or the waterways, where it will exist forever, first as choking hazard, then as nurdle.&nbsp;</p><p>In the dwindling bins, I find another Trump flag, folded in plastic but unmistakable. Omran says I can have it. I unfurl it, stiff and plasticky, creased into a grid. I don‚Äôt want it, but what am I supposed to do? It will end up in the garbage one way or another. I stuff it in my bag.&nbsp;</p><p>I ask, ‚ÄúHow long have you guys been open?‚Äù It‚Äôs April 16, and Omran says they opened the doors on March 21.</p><p>‚ÄúI thought it was more than a month,‚Äù says Ahmed.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long month,‚Äù says Omran.</p><p>The Trump flag joins a small museum of items I have purchased since the bin store opened: a cat bed ($10), a felted flower garland ($6), four post-Valentine heart-shaped chocolate boxes ($5 for all), two small spring-form pans ($4 each), a large penis-shaped ice cube mold ($4), four bike inner tubes ($2 each), a box of ant traps that don‚Äôt work ($2).&nbsp;</p><p>Did I need any of these things? Maybe the ant traps, if they‚Äôd worked, maybe the inner tubes. Mostly, I bought them because they were there, the same way I watch an Instagram reel because it pops up next. The irony is that if I were in the market for new pans or bedding, Amazing Binz would at this point be my best local option. It‚Äôs also simultaneously the most fun and most unsettling store on Baltimore Avenue, a combination that I find addictive, as many bin enjoyers do.</p><p>I take one last lap, back into the farthest corner of the store, where the oldest stuff has accumulated in deep drifts, where the Wokaar lives, now separated from its box. Looking for what? I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs concentrated back here, layers of unwanted product, filtered all the way down the supply chain to this last bin, where it‚Äôs piling up like sand. As I stare at the piles, I almost expect them to start breaking down in front of me, each individual item decomposing into a pool of microplastics, what remains of its value finally depleted. I leave the store, and the bins where they are. They‚Äôll be full again tomorrow.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The simple version: the newt is in an arms race with the common garter snake, <em>Thamnophis sirtalis</em>.&nbsp; The garter snake is a small-to-medium sized snake that is common all over North America.&nbsp; It‚Äôs a slim, elegant little creature that is usually found in or near water.&nbsp; And while it will eat pretty much anything it can catch, the garter snake particularly likes amphibians: small frogs, salamanders and newts.&nbsp; And in the Pacific Northwest, it <em>really</em> likes snacking on the Rough-Skinned Newt.</p><p>So the garter snakes of the Pacific Northwest have been evolving resistance to tetrodotoxin.&nbsp; (As you may recall, tetrodotoxin is the stuff that <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/03/14/occasional-paper-the-interesting-home-life-of-the-blue-ringed-octopus/">makes the blue-ringed octopus so deadly</a>.&nbsp; It‚Äôs produced by symbiotic bacteria that live in the newt‚Äôs body, mostly on its skin.)&nbsp; And as the garter snakes evolve resistance, the newts have to evolve ever greater toxicity.&nbsp; And as the newts get more toxic‚Ä¶ right.&nbsp; Feedback loop!&nbsp; That‚Äôs the simple version.</p><p>Except this is biology, so of course it‚Äôs not that simple.</p><div><p>One thing to keep in mind is that nothing in nature is free. The newt‚Äôs toxicity comes with a cost: the metabolic load of supporting all those bacteria.&nbsp; More toxicity means more bacteria means more load.&nbsp; A very toxic newt has to consume more calories than its less-toxic cousin.</p><p>Meanwhile, evolving resistance also comes at a cost.&nbsp; We don‚Äôt know that directly, but we can infer it pretty well.&nbsp; If resistance to tetrodotoxin were cheap and easy, everything would evolve it.&nbsp; </p><p>There have actually been attempts to measure the effect on the snakes!&nbsp; They haven‚Äôt found them, but keep in mind that tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxin.&nbsp; To resist it, you have to make changes to the biochemistry of your nervous system.&nbsp; Even a small snake has a very very complex nervous system, where those changes might show up in ways that are hard to measure.&nbsp; Like, if the resistant snakes were clumsier or had slower reflexes, sure, we could see that.&nbsp; But maybe they‚Äôre suffering from much more subtle neurological effects, like being prone to insomnia or hallucinations or sexual dysfunction.&nbsp; Or maybe they‚Äôre just a bit dim.&nbsp; </p><p>We don‚Äôt know, but we‚Äôre pretty sure there must be something.&nbsp; &nbsp;We know that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-024-01517-7?fromPaywallRec=true">garter snakes outside of the Pacific Northwest are much less resistant to tetrodotoxin</a>.&nbsp; They‚Äôll drop dead from doses that their Oregon cousins simply ignore.&nbsp; So evolving the resistance must have some cost or drawback.</p><p>(Note that this means the newt is double-whammied:&nbsp; not only does it suffer the metabolic load of carrying around all those bacteria, but it also has to evolve resistance to tetrodotoxin, accepting whatever negative effects that brings.&nbsp; And things are only going to get worse.)</p><p>Now: when the snakes eat Rough-Skinned Newts, they may sometimes show signs of discomfort. The snake may visibly gag.&nbsp; It may writhe in obvious unease.&nbsp; In some cases, it may go into respiratory distress.&nbsp; Eating the newt looks pretty unpleasant.&nbsp; Yet the snakes persist.</p><p>Okay then ‚Äî if evolving toxin resistance carries a cost, and if&nbsp;<em>even with resistance</em> eating the newts is unpleasant, then why then do garter snakes insist on eating newts?&nbsp; They cheerfully eat frogs, fish, and other non-toxic prey items.&nbsp; Why don‚Äôt they just eat those, and leave the poor newts alone?</p><p>Turns out there is an answer:&nbsp; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JOEC.0000045585.77875.09">the garter snakes sequester the tetrodotoxin</a>, storing it in their livers.&nbsp; This makes them toxic to their own predators.&nbsp; (Of which there are plenty.&nbsp; They‚Äôre not large snakes, so they‚Äôre hunted by everything from raccoons to ravens.)&nbsp; But they don‚Äôt harbor the bacteria, so they don‚Äôt produce tetrodotoxin of their own. So eventually, the toxin that they‚Äôve ingested breaks down.&nbsp; And then they need to eat another newt to refresh their defense.</p><p>(If you are That Guy:&nbsp; now you can name a snake that is poisonous without being venomous.)</p><p>So this explains why the snakes go after the newts particularly, preferring them to less toxic prey.&nbsp; They <em>want</em> to eat toxic newts.&nbsp; And it explains why the newts keep evolving to be more toxic: the snake may want to eat newts generally, but if an individual newt packs enough of a wallop, the snake <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00049-010-0057-z">may just retch it up and go after a different one</a>.&nbsp; Newts with weaker poison?&nbsp; They get eaten.&nbsp; Snakes with less resistance?&nbsp; Have trouble finding newts they can choke down, and don‚Äôt get to steal their poison.&nbsp; So the arms race continues.</p><p>This also explains why the newts, despite being very toxic to anything that‚Äôs not a garter snake, haven‚Äôt evolved aposematic coloring or signals.&nbsp; ‚ÄúAposematic‚Äù is just a fancy word for ‚Äúwarning‚Äù, meaning something ‚Äî usually color ‚Äî that tells the world Do Not Mess With Me:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Frainforest-cruises%2Fimages%2Fc_fill%2Cg_auto%2Ff_auto%2Cq_auto%2Fw_2560%2Ch_1861%2Fv1627055916%2FPoison-Dart-Frogs-Facts-rana-de-dardo-envenenada-amarillenta%2FPoison-Dart-Frogs-Facts-rana-de-dardo-envenenada-amarillenta.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=08b23ddaf5aa7edcd44506b627b0819a1169f932e06f09d41f146f6d24d69d9c" alt="13 Interesting Poison Dart Frogs Facts - Rainforest Cruises" width="237" height="172"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fguloinnature.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F08%2F8-1-e1664541955412.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=7a5788815878ecb746369fb7609cbab7d9ef55e63314cba4ceef46de08284727" alt="What is aposematic coloration? | Gulo in Nature" width="273" height="174"></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.color-meanings.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F06%2Fstriped-lionfish-close-up-blue-background-14878-768x491.jpeg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=d517fafecdfbd90d6e7acca301a9ab884dc3355231a4a71a2e0461e46de29459" alt="Aposematic Coloration: Nature's Brightly Colored Warning Signs | Color ..." width="361" height="231"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newbeautifulera.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gary-larsen.png?w=500" alt="Gary Larsen" width="181" height="232"><br>[The Far Side by Gary Larsen, copyright 1984]</p><p>The Rough-Skinned Newt, like many newts, has a brightly colored underside that it can flash when threatened.&nbsp; But the rest of it is a dull mottled grey, camouflage.&nbsp; Presumably that‚Äôs because if the newt ever tried to evolve full-body colors like an Amazonian poison dart frog, it would just be a big ‚Äúcome eat me‚Äù sign to garter snakes.&nbsp; Probably a certain number of newts get eaten by birds or fish or whatever anyway because they‚Äôre not aposematic enough.&nbsp; The bird or fish may not survive the experience, but that‚Äôs not much comfort to the newt.</p><p>In sum: the unfortunate newt is not once, not twice, but three times screwed over here.&nbsp; They have to be extra-toxic, carrying that metabolic load, just to <em>maybe</em> make the garter snakes think twice about eating them.&nbsp; Then they have to evolve defenses against their own toxin.&nbsp; But they can‚Äôt evolve aposematic coloring, because that‚Äôll just lead to the snakes gobbling them all up.&nbsp; And finally, they can‚Äôt go back to being not-very-toxic, because the snakes will just eat more of them to gain the same amount of tetrodotoxin.&nbsp; They can‚Äôt win, they can‚Äôt break even, and they can‚Äôt leave the game.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcaliforniaherps.com%2Fsalamanders%2Fimages%2Ftgranulosaventmend.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=3790a4834b4a97caa8b5adfb847fac5f6910139893a2e6b08515baa8fbceb8fd" alt="Rough-skinned Newt - Taricha granulosa" width="351" height="234"><br>[Copyright Gary Nafis, 2019]</p><p>There is even more going on here.&nbsp; There are literally dozens of papers about this snake-newt interaction.&nbsp; And we still haven‚Äôt reached the end of it!&nbsp; Just a few examples:</p><p>‚Äî The newts that live in the northern end of their range, up in Alaska, don‚Äôt have garter snakes around.&nbsp; As expected, they mostly aren‚Äôt very toxic.&nbsp; But only mostly!&nbsp; One paper found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2068">odd little pockets of unexpectedly toxic newts</a> up there.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; We don‚Äôt know.</p><p>‚Äî Meanwhile, the newts of Vancouver Island, offshore, also aren‚Äôt very toxic.&nbsp; Because there are no snakes there?&nbsp; Ha ha, no.&nbsp; There are three different species of garter snake on Vancouver.&nbsp; But&nbsp; for some reason, the newts and snakes there seem to be living in harmony.&nbsp; Well, relative harmony.&nbsp; The snakes of Vancouver do eat newts.&nbsp; But so far, the snakes and newts don‚Äôt seem to have started an arms race like they have on the mainland.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; We don‚Äôt know.</p><p>‚Äî A question that occurred, digging through these papers:&nbsp; if the garter snakes are becoming toxic from eating newts, might the <em>snake</em>&nbsp; begin to evolve aposematic coloring?&nbsp; And sure enough, when I look at photos of Oregon garter snakes, a lot of them seem to have bright orange markings that look a bit aposematic:</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://2img.net/h/stevenbolgartersnakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Thamnophis-sirtalis-concinnus-11.jpg" width="423" height="282"><br>[copyright Stephen Bol, 2023]</p><p>But on the other hand garter snake markings vary wildly.&nbsp; Lots of garter snakes outside the Pacific Northwest have orange spots or stripes, and lots of snakes within the region don‚Äôt.&nbsp; And as far as I can tell, nobody has even tried to research this yet.</p><p>‚Äî A thing to keep in mind: the Pacific Northwest, where all this is playing out, is a very young ecosystem in geological terms.&nbsp; Just 20,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, the Pacific coast of Washington and Oregon looked a lot like Greenland today: a thin coastal strip of cold tundra,&nbsp; everything else covered by an ice cap.&nbsp; The newts and the snakes are relatively recent colonists.&nbsp; So we may be catching a snapshot of a relationship that is still evolving, and that may not be long-term stable.</p><p>‚Äî And finally, I have oversimplified this whole thing, because there are other species of newt in the genus <em>Taricha&nbsp;</em>that are pretty toxic ‚Äî not as crazy deadly as their Rough-Skinned cousins, but still more toxic than normal newts ‚Äî while the garter snake genus <em>Thamnophis </em>is just a taxonomic mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, we‚Äôve learned a lot, but mysteries still abound.&nbsp;</p><p>And that is probably enough about newts for now.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44191591">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Edit: Twitter could improve this significantly with very few changes - I wrote about that <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71933.html">here</a>. It's unclear why they'd launch without doing that, since it entirely defeats the point of using HSMs)</p><p>When Twitter[1] launched encrypted DMs a couple <br>of years ago, it was the worst kind of end-to-end <br>encrypted - <em>technically</em> e2ee, but in a way that made it relatively easy for Twitter to inject new encryption keys and get everyone's messages anyway. It was also lacking a whole bunch of features such as "sending pictures", so the entire thing was largely a waste of time. But a couple of days ago, Elon <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929238157872312773">announced</a> the arrival of "XChat", a new encrypted message platform <q>built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture</q>. Maybe this time they've got it right?</p><p>tl;dr - no. Use Signal. Twitter can probably obtain your private keys, and admit that they can MITM you and have full access to your metadata.</p><p>The new approach is pretty similar to the old one in that it's based on pretty straightforward and well tested cryptographic primitives, but merely using good cryptography doesn't mean you end up with a good solution. This time they've pivoted away from using the underlying cryptographic primitives directly and into higher level abstractions, which is probably a good thing. They're using <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">Libsodium's boxes</a> for message encryption, which is, well, fine? It doesn't offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">forward secrecy</a> (if someone's private key is leaked then all existing messages can be decrypted) so it's a long way from the state of the art for a messaging client (Signal's had forward secrecy for over a decade!), but it's not inherently broken or anything. It is, however, written in C, not Rust[2].</p><p>That's about the extent of the good news. Twitter's old implementation involved clients generating keypairs and pushing the public key to Twitter. Each client (a physical device or a browser instance) had its own private key, and messages were simply encrypted to every public key associated with an account. This meant that new devices couldn't decrypt old messages, and also meant there was a maximum number of supported devices and terrible scaling issues and it was pretty bad. The new approach generates a keypair and then stores the private key using the <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">Juicebox</a> protocol. Other devices can then retrieve the private key. </p><p>Doesn't this mean Twitter has the private key? Well, no. There's a PIN involved, and the PIN is used to generate an encryption key. The stored copy of the private key is encrypted with that key, so if you don't know the PIN you can't decrypt the key. So we brute force the PIN, right? Juicebox actually protects against that - before the backend will hand over the encrypted key, you have to prove knowledge of the PIN to it (this is done in a clever way that doesn't directly reveal the PIN to the backend). If you ask for the key too many times while providing the wrong PIN, access is locked down.</p><p>But this is true only if the Juicebox backend is trustworthy. If the backend is controlled by someone untrustworthy[3] then they're going to be able to obtain the encrypted key material (even if it's in an HSM, they can simply watch what comes out of the HSM when the user authenticates if there's no validation of the HSM's keys). And now all they need is the PIN. Turning the PIN into an encryption key is done using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2id</a> key derivation function, using 32 iterations and a memory cost of 16MB (the Juicebox white paper says 16KB, but (a) that's laughably small and (b) the <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-sdk/blob/main/rust/sdk/src/pin.rs#L54">code</a> says 16 * 1024 in an argument that takes kilobytes), which makes it computationally and moderately memory expensive to generate the encryption key used to decrypt the private key. How expensive? Well, on my (not very fast) laptop, that takes less than 0.2 seconds. How many attempts to I need to crack the PIN? Twitter's chosen to fix that to 4 digits, so a maximum of 10,000. You aren't going to need many machines running in parallel to bring this down to a very small amount of time, at which point private keys can, to a first approximation, be extracted at will.</p><p>Juicebox attempts to defend against this by supporting sharding your key over multiple backends, and only requiring a subset of those to recover the original. </p><s>I can't find any evidence that Twitter's does seem to be making use of this,</s><p>Twitter uses three backends and requires data from at least two, but all the backends used are under x.com so are presumably under Twitter's direct control. Trusting the keystore without needing to trust whoever's hosting it requires a trustworthy communications mechanism between the client and the keystore. If the device you're talking to can prove that it's an HSM that implements the attempt limiting protocol and has no other mechanism to export the data, this can be made to work. Signal makes use of something along these lines using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a> for contact list and settings storage and recovery, and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/SecurityofPasskeysintheGooglePasswordManager.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102651">Apple</a> also have documentation about how they handle this in ways that make it difficult for them to obtain backed up key material. Twitter has no documentation of this, and as far as I can tell does nothing to prove that the backend is in any way trustworthy. (Edit to add: The Juicebox API does support authenticated communication between the client and the HSM, but that relies on you having some way to prove that the public key you're presented with corresponds to a private key that only exists in the HSM. Twitter gives you the public key whenever you communicate with them, so even if they've implemented this properly you can't prove they haven't made up a new key and MITMed you the next time you retrieve your key)</p><p>On the plus side, Juicebox <em>is</em> written in Rust, so Elon's not 100% wrong. Just mostly wrong.</p><p>But ok, at least you've got viable end-to-end encryption even if someone can put in some (not all that much, really) effort to obtain your private key and render it all pointless? Actually no, since you're still relying on the Twitter server to give you the public key of the other party and there's no out of band mechanism to do that or verify the authenticity of that public key at present. Twitter can simply give you a public key where they control the private key, decrypt the message, and then reencrypt it with the intended recipient's key and pass it on. The <a href="https://help.x.com/en/using-x/encrypted-direct-messages">support page</a> makes it clear that this is a known shortcoming and that it'll be fixed at some point, but they said that about the original encrypted DM support and it never was, so that's probably dependent on whether Elon gets distracted by something else again. And the server knows who and when you're messaging even if they haven't bothered to break your private key, so there's a lot of metadata leakage.</p><p>Signal doesn't have these shortcomings. Use Signal.</p><p>[1] I'll respect their name change once Elon respects his daughter</p><p>[2] There are implementations written in Rust, but Twitter's using the C one with <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium">these</a> JNI bindings </p><p>[3] Or someone nominally trustworthy but who's been compelled to act against your interests - even if Elon were absolutely committed to protecting all his users, his overarching goals for Twitter require him to have legal presence in multiple jurisdictions that are not necessarily above placing employees in physical danger if there's a perception that they could obtain someone's encryption keys</p></div></div>]]></description>

<dd>
<p>Marcus Mendes, in a piece at 9to5Mac with multiple spoilers for next week‚Äôs keynote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is working on supporting the ability to export notes in
Markdown from Apple Notes, which is something third-party apps
have supported for years. Granted, this is a niche feature, but as
a fierce participant in the niche, I can confirm: this is huge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this story first started spreading this morning, it was getting repeated as Notes ‚Äúgaining Markdown support‚Äù, which implied something like <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, where you can type Markdown syntax characters while editing, and perhaps optionally see the Markdown syntax in your notes. ‚ÄúMarkdown notes app‚Äù is really like a class of notes apps unto itself.</p>

<p>Some people find this surprising, but I personally don‚Äôt want to use a Markdown notes app. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown">I created Markdown two decades ago</a> and have used it ever since for one thing and one thing only: writing for the web at Daring Fireball. My <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original description</a> of what it is still stands: ‚ÄúMarkdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.‚Äù Perhaps an even better description of Markdown is Matthew Butterick‚Äôs, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/quick-tour.html#%28part._.Markdown_mode%29">from the documentation for Pollen</a>: ‚ÄúMarkdown is a simplified notation system for HTML.‚Äù</p>

<p>The other great use case for Markdown is in a context where you either <em>need</em> or just <em>want</em> to be saving to a plain text file or database field. That‚Äôs not what Apple Notes is or should be. I can see why many technically-minded people want to use Markdown ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. It‚Äôs quite gratifying that Markdown has not only become so popular, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">after 21 years</a>, seemingly continues to grow in popularity, to the point now where there clearly are a lot of people who seemingly enjoy writing in Markdown more than even I do. But I think it would be a huge mistake for Apple to make Apple Notes a ‚ÄúMarkdown editor‚Äù, even as an option. It‚Äôs trivial to create malformed Markdown syntax; it shouldn‚Äôt be possible to have a malformed note in Apple Notes. I <em>craft</em> posts for Daring Fireball; I dash off notes in Apple Notes.</p>

<p>Apple Notes offers a great WYSIWYG rich text editing interface that works great on an iPhone and even better on a Mac, which I think is exactly appropriate. Particularly clever are the limited formatting options, where you don‚Äôt pick a font per se, but rather only from a set of predefined styles, like headings, lists, and block quote. It‚Äôs not nerdy at all. That‚Äôs the Macintosh way. (But that‚Äôs why I think Apple Notes‚Äôs use of hashtags, rather than real tokenized tags <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/tag-files-and-folders-mchlp15236/mac">like in the Finder</a>, was an enormous mistake on Apple‚Äôs part. Real tokenized tags can contain spaces (so a multi-word tag can just be ‚ÄúWords Written Naturally‚Äù not ‚Äú#WordsCrammedTogether‚Äù) and don‚Äôt need to be prefixed with an ugly, nerdy-looking <code>#</code> character. Notes using hashtags is like if the Finder disallowed spaces and uppercase letters in filenames.)</p>

<p>But Markdown <em>export</em> from Notes? That sounds awesome. Frankly, perhaps the biggest problem with Apple Notes is that its export functionality is rather crude‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/export-or-print-notes-iphdf551cfa2/ios">PDF and, of all formats, Pages</a>. Exporting and/or copying the selected text as Markdown would be pretty cool. Very curious to see how they handle images though, if this rumor is true.</p>

Coming from C, Python, and JavaScript, I never looked back. Two Rust-based startups and 500k lines of Rust later, here are some reflections on the milestone.</p><h2>The early days were painful</h2><p>Version compatibility was poor‚Äîboth between crates and with the compiler itself. A bug-fix update could force a compiler bump, which in turn dragged in unstable crates like <a href="https://github.com/serde-deprecated/syntex/tree/master" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>syntex</code></a> (<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/02/Rust-1.15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once</a> a key <code>serde</code> dependency) and their dependents. In practice we ‚Äúupdated the world‚Äù and temporally pinned when a critical bug fix or feature demanded it‚Äîearly on this was as often as every 6-week compiler release cycle. An awful lot of time was wasted binary-searching for compatible version combinations.</p><p>‚ÄúFighting the borrow checker‚Äù was real for me. Traits came naturally given background in C++, Java and Objective-C, but lifetimes and the idea of ‚Äúproofs‚Äù that (<a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2017/07/08/lifetime-dispatch/#cant-we-just-rule-out-bad-specializations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">*mostly</a>) don‚Äôt affect codegen took a while to grok. Patient friends and colleagues made this easier!</p><p>After a couple years of our codebase and team growing, compile times became painful. Large types were a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recurring</a> issue (and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/140944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still are</a>, occasionally), requiring diagnosis and mitigation. Investments brought it down for us, but iteration cycles still took a hit and rapid prototyping generally required effort to set up.</p><h2>The people were and are exceptional</h2><p>The Rust ecosystem has an impressive amount of programming ‚Äútaste‚Äù, manifesting in dependencies with relatively simple builds, elegant implementations, and fast and robust performance. Reaching for TypeScript or Python is a relative exercise in frustration. There‚Äôs a reason Rust has taken the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#admired-and-desired" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‚Äúmost loved/admired language‚Äù</a> title for nine years now!</p><p>‚ÄúWhat went right‚Äù is an essay in itself, but the evolving cadre of dedicated, opinionated and earnest volunteers, with strong mores around saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù, are I think the crux of it.</p><p>I reaped the benefits as an employer. We‚Äôve been fortunate to be one of few Rust opportunities in London, with a pipeline of talented engineers keen to work in their favourite language.

Rust feels like a passion project, a labour of love by and for programmers.</p><p>10 years ago could we have predicted this? Well, I think some did. Pained by the status quo, some saw the potential of a language, an ecosystem, designed <i>well</i> by people like them. They volunteered their time and made Rust what it is. As Graydon Hoare, one of Rust‚Äôs original authors, <a href="https://rustfoundation.org/media/10-years-of-stable-rust-an-infrastructure-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Rust today is the result of significant investments made by forward-looking institutions and the efforts of thousands of individuals who shared a belief in the long-term payoff of what they were building.</p></blockquote><p>I bet my time and (my investors‚Äô) money on Rust 10 years ago because I believed in this payoff. The enthusiasm was infections, the potential palpable, and smart minds were converging. I‚Äôm so glad that has only grown, and so grateful to <a href="https://github.com/topics/rust" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everyone</a> who‚Äôs <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contributed</a> to it.</p><h2>What I‚Äôm looking forward to over the next 10 years</h2><h3>Simpler and faster builds</h3><p>With growing engineering and testing bandwidth we can continue to replace battle-tested but complex or slow dependencies with simpler and faster ones.

This creates untested code paths and potential compile failures, alongside annoyances like fragmented and incomplete documentation, impaired IDE functionality and <code>unused_imports</code> warnings.</p><p>A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1868-portability-lint.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lint</a> was proposed to mitigate this. A mooted better approach is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41619#issuecomment-2056902943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moving <code>#[cfg()]</code> into the trait system</a> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lkgoyk/comment/gnjufff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cc</a>) with bounds like <code>where Platform: Unix</code> and <code>where Platform: Avx2</code>. With this the compiler naturally guarantees compilation under all supported options, targets and features. Specializing items with OS-specific or architecture-specific implementations can be done via, appropriately, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialization</a>. Metadata can be shared between dev/test/release, different feature combination and different platform builds, resulting in less recompilation, faster CI, and bringing a crates.io MIR <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5hav0q/towards_a_worldwide_precompiled_crate_cache_for/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cache</a> closer to reality.</p><h3>Everything being <code>const</code></h3><p>Constant evaluation reduces dependence on macros and build scripts, and brings forward run-time work and panics to compile-time. Currently we only scratch the surface of this as only a small subset of Rust code is supported (no traits, no allocation), and that which is supported runs <a href="https://docs.rs/hex-literal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too slowly</a> for nontrivial use cases.</p><p>Assuming portability all code can be evaluated during compilation (<a href="https://docs.rs/crabtime/latest/crabtime/#-one-shot-evaluation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cc</a>). Unportable code like FFI or assembly without a generic fallback is getting less common. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/issues/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Various</a> effects-inspired attempts to enable ubiquitous <code>const</code> have been <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67792" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/110395" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reverted</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3762" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attempted again</a>. I hope we dodge this extra language complexity with the simple assumption that ‚Äúeverything can be executed in a <code>const</code> context‚Äù.

For most domains though I think it‚Äôs a matter of time. Adoption hurdles remain for GUIs, machine learning, and <a href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game development</a> due to entrenched ecosystems, high switching costs, cultural inertia, and established tooling. But those barriers aren‚Äôt permanent. Rust continues to mature and steadily break into these domains, thanks to relentless community efforts and innovation.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Looking forward the trajectory is clear and exciting. The positive feedback loop of adoption boosting engineering and testing bandwidth, which then fuels further adoption, is accelerating. The upcoming decade promises further refinement, faster compile times, broader domain adoption, and an increasingly seamless developer experience. At Tably, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with Rust, excited to witness‚Äîand contribute to‚Äîthe language‚Äôs next chapter.

You also can‚Äôt combine affine transformation matrices together to create this shape.</figcaption></figure></div><p>How can we approximate the transform? Here are some ideas I mulled over that could achieve a good result:</p><ul><li><p>Redraw the image with the distortion. This is potentially expensive and means that we can‚Äôt use SVGs as the images without converting them to bitmaps. It also means that things might look ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù</p></li><li><p>Ray trace everything! By projecting a ray to compute each pixel for the image, I could get a very conventional 3d renderer. This doesn‚Äôt achieve my goal of lightweight SVGs though</p></li><li><p>Subdivide the image and project each subdivision in the most locally-correct affine transformation. Use projected polygon clip paths to cut off the edges of regions.</p></li></ul><p>I was really curious how the last bullet point could work, and I could think of no other ideas that didn‚Äôt require rasterization. So with OpenAI O3‚Äôs help I implemented it into the vanilla Typescript 3D renderer. To test it, we‚Äôre going to project a checkerboard pattern onto a cube.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

These bodies are faint and not directly observed, but their existence is inferred from observations of long-period comets (LPCs; J. H. Oort <a href="#apjadbf9bbib28" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib28">1950</a>). The so-called new LPCs, which are observed during their first perihelion passage through the inner solar system, often have the semimajor axes between 20,000 and 100,000 au.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn1">5</a></sup>
 They are thought to have relatively recently evolved, due to the effects of the Galactic tide (J. Heisler &amp; S. Tremaine <a href="#apjadbf9bbib13" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib13">1986</a>; Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a> here), onto high-eccentricity/low-perihelion orbits. The new LPCs have a nearly isotropic distribution of orbital inclinations, suggesting that the outer Oort cloud at <em>r</em> &gt; 10,000 au is roughly spherical (see L. Dones et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib7" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib7">2015</a> for a review).</p><p>Oort cloud formation dates back to early stages of the solar system some 4.6 Gyr ago (M. Duncan et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib9" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib9">1987</a>; L. Dones et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib8" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib8">2004</a>; D. Vokrouhlick√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>). First, as the outer planets cleared their orbital neighborhood, small bodies were scattered onto very eccentric orbits with perihelion distances <em>q</em> ‚â≤ 30 au and semimajor axes <em>a</em> ‚â≥ 1‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã000 au (orbital eccentricities <em>e</em> ‚â≥ 0.97). Second, the Galactic tide raised the perihelion distances of these bodies, effectively decoupling them from planetary perturbations, and tilted their orbits. Third, encounters of the Sun with stars in the Galactic neighborhood thoroughly mixed the orbits in the outer Oort cloud, producing a relatively homogeneous and isotropic source for LPCs.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn2">6</a></sup>

</p><p>Dynamical simulations reveal formation of the inner Oort cloud at 1000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au (M. Duncan et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib9" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib9">1987</a>; H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>; D. Vokrouhlick√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn3">7</a></sup>
 The inner Oort cloud forms in much the same way as the outer Oort cloud, except that the timescale on which the Galactic tide changes orbits at 1000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au is long, comparable to the age of the solar system. This explains why the inner Oort cloud is not a dominant source of LPCs (D. Vokrouhlick√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>): bodies from this region evolve too slowly and are ejected by planets before they can reach <em>q</em> ‚â≤ 3 au, heat up, and become active comets (J. G. Hills <a href="#apjadbf9bbib16" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib16">1981</a>, but see N. A. Kaib &amp; T. Quinn <a href="#apjadbf9bbib17" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib17">2009</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn4">8</a></sup>
 In addition, the orbits with 1‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au, which are more strongly bound to the Sun, are less affected by stellar encounters. The inner Oort cloud is therefore often portrayed as a relatively flat disk, roughly aligned with the ecliptic (H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>), that retained memory of its initial conditions (e.g., M. Fouchard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>).</p><p>In the inner Oort cloud at 1‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au, structures in the spatial distribution of bodies can form and "freeze" over timescales comparable to the age of the solar system. This raises the question of how the inner Oort cloud would look to a distant observer and/or whether there are any diagnostic features that would facilitate its detection. Here we show that the inner Oort cloud is a slightly warped disk, roughly 15,000 au across, inclined <em>i</em> ‚àº 30¬∞ to the ecliptic (nearly polar in the Galactic reference system; Galactic inclination <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ‚àº 90¬∞). The disk, when viewed from a distance, would appear as a spiral structure with two twisted arms. The spiral structure was first identified by examining the simulation in the Hayden Planetarium in preparation for a new space show that describes and visualizes the Oort cloud.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn5">9</a></sup>
 In Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs2">2</a>, we discuss the results of dynamical simulations‚Äîdescribed in the <a href="#apjadbf9bapp1">Appendix</a>‚Äîto illustrate the inner Oort cloud structure. The analytic model of S. Breiter &amp; R. Ratajczak (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib5" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib5">2005</a>; also see A.

Nesvorn√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib27" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib27">2017</a>, <a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>; D. Vokrouhlick√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>). The spiral is long-lived: it emerges in the first hundreds of megayears after the formation of the solar system and persists over billions of years. The same spiral structure appears in simulations with different sequences of stellar encounters, indicating that the spiral is not related to stellar encounters. Instead, as we establish below, the spiral is a consequence of the Galactic tide. To simulate the Galactic tide, the Galaxy simulation in D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>) adopted the mass density of 0.15 <em>M</em><sub>Sun</sub> pc<sup>‚àí3</sup> in the solar neighborhood. By comparing the results of simulations with different mass densities, we found that the spiral becomes smaller (larger) for higher (lower) stellar densities in the solar neighborhood. This suggests a direct involvement of the Galactic tide.</p><p>We studied formation of the Oort spiral by inspecting orbital histories of bodies contributing to the spiral. They were first scattered to 1000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au by migrating planets (Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn). The scattered orbits had relatively low orbital inclinations with respect to the ecliptic (<em>i</em> ‚â≤ 30¬∞), low perihelion distances (<em>q</em> ‚â≤ 30 au), and high eccentricities (<em>e</em> ‚â≥ 0.97). The initial nodal longitude and initial perihelion argument of orbits in the ecliptic frame were chosen to be uniformly random. Consequently, the population of scattered bodies initially appeared as a relatively thin disk near the ecliptic, and this‚Äîwhen looked at by an observer in the ecliptic node<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn6">10</a></sup>

These orbits can be stable over long timescales. They stay in the inner Oort cloud and continue to evolve by Kozai cycles. As <em>e</em> decreases in a Kozai cycle, <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> increases from the initial value of <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ‚àº 60¬∞, and the orbit becomes nearly polar in the Galactic frame. This is when the orbital changes due to Galactic tide become exceedingly slow and orbits freeze (Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a>). This explains the twisted arms of the Oort spiral in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> that reach away from the ecliptic plane toward the Galactic poles.</p><p>The ascending node of the ecliptic on the Galactic plane is located near the Galactic longitude <em>l</em> = 186¬∞ (and, by definition, at the Galactic latitude <em>b</em> = 0). In the Galaxy simulation, we observe that orbits in the inner Oort cloud (1000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au) start with the nodal longitude Œ©<sub>G</sub> ‚âÉ 186¬∞. Subsequently, if <em>œâ</em><sub>G</sub> has the right value (see above) and the orbit decouples from planetary perturbations, Œ©<sub>G</sub> slowly rotates in the retrograde sense (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>). Thus, over time, orbits move away from the ecliptic plane, and their initially nearly perfect alignment is (slightly) smeared. The observer looking at the structure along the ecliptic node will then not see the disk exactly edge on, which is the situation shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a>. For example, for <em>a</em> ‚àº 3000 au, the characteristic rotation of Œ©<sub>G</sub> over 4.6 Gyr is broadly centered at ‚àº30¬∞ (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>).</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf3" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf3" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf3_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 3."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 3.

At the same time, as <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> of the orbit increases (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf5">5</a>), the orbit becomes nearly polar and practically freezes (red dots in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf5">5</a>). This is a consequence of Equation (<a href="#apjadbf9beqn2">2</a>), where <em>C</em> ‚Üí 0 when <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ‚Üí 90¬∞, and the orbit evolution becomes exceedingly slow. Two examples of this are shown in Figure 3 in A. Higuchi et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib15" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib15">2007</a>). The analytic model therefore explains why orbits in the Oort spiral often have <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> = 75¬∞‚Äì90¬∞ (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>). The slow retrograde circulation of Œ©<sub>G</sub> that starts near Œ©<sub>G</sub> = 186¬∞ and stalls when <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ‚âÉ 90¬∞ complements the picture. It explains why orbits in the inner Oort cloud often have Œ©<sub>G</sub> = 120¬∞‚Äì180¬∞ (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn8">12</a></sup>

The reflected light from large bodies in the inner Oort cloud can be detected by large telescopes. For example, S. S. Sheppard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib32" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib32">2019</a>) used the 8.2 m Subaru telescope to discover 541132 LeleƒÅk≈´honua with <em>a</em> = 1085 au, <em>e</em> = 0.94, and <em>i</em> = 11<span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bieqn7.gif" alt="$\mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000B0}}$"></span></span></span>7 (original barycentric elements).

We infer that the orbit of 541132 LeleƒÅk≈´honua must have had a more complex history than simple planet scattering plus Kozai cycles. This is because 541132 LeleƒÅk≈´honua does not have nearly as polar an orbit in the Galactic frame as the bulk of inner Oort cloud objects in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>. M. Saillenfest et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib31" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib31">2019</a>) already showed that objects with <em>a</em> ‚àº 1000 au are in a transition region where the effects of Galactic and planetary potentials combine to produce dynamical chaos.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn9">13</a></sup>

</p><p>It may have been scattered away from the ecliptic such that the initial inclination was <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 50¬∞. The Kozai cycles would then plausibly produce the current orbit by decreasing <em>e</em> and increasing <em>i</em><sub>G</sub>. Complicating factors include the effects of stellar encounters, stellar cluster, and the possible planet 9 (S. S. Sheppard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib32" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib32">2019</a>). In any case, the Oort spiral is mainly contributed by bodies with large perihelion distances and <em>a</em> &gt; 2000 au. The telescopic observations would therefore need to detect objects on even more extreme orbits than 541132 LeleƒÅk≈´honua, and obtain sufficient statistics for these bodies, to be able to piece together their spatial distribution. This task will have to wait for the next generation of telescopic surveys (e.g., the Vera C.

For a more continuous distribution such as the one shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf8">8</a>, ‚à£<em>a</em><sub>2,‚àí1</sub>‚à£ ‚â≥ ‚à£<em>a</em><sub>2,2</sub>‚à£.</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf8" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf8" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf8_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 8."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 8.

For shorter wavelengths, <em>Œª</em> ‚â≤ 100 <em>Œº</em>m, the large-scale thermal emission is dominated by the zodiacal light (e.g., D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib24" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib24">2010</a>; Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib29" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib29">2014</a>). For longer wavelengths, <em>Œª</em> ‚â≥ 500 <em>Œº</em>m, the thermal emission is dominated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic sources (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib30" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib30">2020</a>). The CMB shows an anomalous quadrupole term that is somewhat smaller than the expectations from the best-fit cosmological model (D. N. Spergel et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib33" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib33">2003</a>; Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib30" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib30">2020</a>). The quadrupole moment expected from the inner Oort cloud emission has nearly the opposite orientation on the sky (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>) to that of the CMB quadrupole and would therefore‚Äîat least in principle‚Äîact to decrease the CMB quadrupole. In practice, however, we estimate that the amplitude of the inner Oort quadrupole should be some 3 orders below that of the CMB quadrupole (‚àº10 Jy sr<sup>‚àí1</sup> for Oort versus‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã ‚àº10 kJy sr<sup>‚àí1</sup> for CMB at frequencies <em>ŒΩ</em> ‚àº 160 GHz) and therefore negligible.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn10">14</a></sup>

</p><p>The best chances to detect thermal emission from the inner Oort cloud are near wavelengths ‚àº300‚Äì400 <em>Œº</em>m (E. J. Baxter et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>). This is where the spectral radiance of both the zodiacal and CMB emissions is reduced by a factor of ‚â≥10<sup>3</sup> from their peak values. The small particles in the inner Oort cloud, ‚àº10‚Äì100 <em>Œº</em>m, would have temperatures <em>T</em> ‚àº 10 K and efficiently emit at these wavelengths. To isolate this component from the zodiacal cloud, one would have to search for an anomalous quadrupole signature corresponding to a distribution that is not completely smooth in the ecliptic longitude and peaks near the expected directions (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>). To separate it from the CMB, one would have to demonstrate that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole moment decreases‚Äîrelative to lower and higher multipole moments‚Äîfor these intermediate wavelengths.</p><p>The high-frequency instrument on board the Planck satellite observed at 857 GHz, which translates to <em>Œª</em> ‚âÉ 350 <em>Œº</em>m. A careful analysis of these observations could perhaps unveil some interesting features. But even here the prospects of the inner Oort cloud detection are feeble. A complication arises because the thermal signal from the inner Oort particles scales with 1/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> and temperature <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bieqn13.gif" alt="$T\simeq 280/\sqrt{r}$"></span></span></span>. Thus, even though these particles spend more time near aphelion, where they contribute to the Oort spiral, they are much more easily detectable when they approach the terrestrial observer during their perihelion passage. This creates a strong bias in detectability of particles with small perihelion distances; these particles have high eccentricities and a different distribution on the sky than the one shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>. Unfortunately, we do not have enough statistics in the Galaxy simulation to accurately predict the expected signature from this population.</p><p>Finally, we briefly comment on E. J. Baxter et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>), who used the high-frequency Planck detector (545 and 857 GHz) to search for signatures of exo-Oort clouds around nearby (hot) stars. They found several candidates but pointed out that the rate of false positives in these observations is expected to be relatively high. They argued that future CMB surveys and targeted observations with far-infrared and millimeter wavelength telescopes have the potential to detect exo-Oort clouds or other extended sources of thermal emission beyond ‚àº1000 au from the parent stars. Here we point out that resolving a spiral-like signature such as the one shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> or Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a> would potentially represent more definitive evidence for the existence of the (inner) exo-Oort cloud around a nearby star. For the exo-Oort spiral to form, there needs to be a planetary system capable of ejecting small bodies to ‚àº1000‚Äì10,000 au from its host star, and the orbital plane of the ejected bodies needs to be significantly inclined to the Galactic plane for the Kozai cycles to happen.</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf9" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf9" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf9_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 9."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 9.

					</a></span></figcaption></figure></figure></div><div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>We used numerical simulations and analytical methods to demonstrate that the inner Oort cloud is a warped disk with a spiral structure roughly 15,000 au in length (Figures <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> and <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a>). The spiral forms when small bodies are scattered by planets to 1000‚Äì10,000 au and orbitally evolve by the Galactic tide. At 1000‚Äì10,000 au, where the dynamical timescales are comparable to the age of the solar system, the Galactic tide acts to (a) raise perihelion distances and decouple bodies from planetary perturbations, (b) rotate orbital planes such that they evolve to become nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane (and Œ©<sub>G</sub> = 120¬∞‚Äì180¬∞; Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>), and (c) favor long-term stability of orbits with 90¬∞ &lt; <em>œâ</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 180¬∞ and 270¬∞ &lt; <em>œâ</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 360¬∞. Item (b) implies that the inner Oort cloud would look like a disk to a distant observer. Item (c) implies two preferred directions for orbits distributed in the disk. As the preferred directions depend on the period of Kozai oscillations (Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a> and A. Higuchi et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib15" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib15">2007</a>), which in turn depends on the semimajor axis, the inner Oort cloud bodies appear to be concentrated in two spiral arms (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a>).</p><p>In retrospect, the existence of the Oort cloud spiral could have been inferred from Figure 3 in M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>), where the nonuniformity of orbital angles corresponds to the spiral structure reported here. The structure was not present in Figure 1 of M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>), which corresponds to an initially isotropic Oort cloud, showing that the spiral structure is indeed linked to the initial state of the Oort cloud (i.e., orbital scattering of bodies from the outer planet region along the ecliptic). Additionally, M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>, <a href="#apjadbf9bbib11" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib11">2023</a>) identified a related group of LPCs (B3) with properties that would reflect the structure of the inner Oort cloud‚Äîthe so-called "empty ecliptic" feature; this feature was identified in LPC catalogs (M. Fouchard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib11" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib11">2023</a>). In this sense, the Oort cloud spiral has (indirectly) been detected.</p><p>Direct observational detection of the Oort spiral is difficult. Either (i) this structure can be pieced together from detection of a large number of objects with <em>a</em> &gt; 1000 au and <em>q</em> &gt; 30 au, or (ii) the thermal emission from small particles in the Oort spiral will be separated from various foreground and background sources. As for (ii), perhaps the best chance is to scrutinize emission at intermediate wavelengths (<em>Œª</em> ‚àº 100‚Äì500 <em>Œº</em>m; e.g., Planck's 857 GHz detector) and demonstrate excess emission that is not fully continuous in ecliptic longitude (i.e., not from the zodiacal cloud) and deviates in some significant way from the low-degree multipoles observed at longer wavelengths (i.e., not a CMB quadrupole). Observational detection of Oort spirals around Milky Way stars is similarly challenging (E. J. Baxter et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>).</p></div><p>The Galaxy simulation was performed on the NASA Pleiades Supercomputer.

J.F., J.P., and C.E. acknowledge the support from NASA grant #80NSSC23K0602.</p><div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>Here we make use of the dynamical model from D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>). To start with, we disregard their cases with the stellar cluster and focus on the simulation called Galaxy. This simulation included the (1) migration model for the outer planets, (2) effects of planet scattering on disk planetesimals, and (3) Galactic potential and stellar encounters. The model results were calibrated on Dark Energy Survey (DES) detections of objects in the trans-Neptunian region (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>). Here is a brief description of these components:</p><p>(1)<em> Migration model.</em> The numerical simulations consisted of tracking the orbits of the four giant planets (Jupiter to Neptune) and a large number of planetesimals. Uranus and Neptune were initially placed inside of their current orbits and were migrated outward. The <tt>swift_rmvs4</tt> code, part of the Swift <em>N</em>-body integration package (H. F. Levison &amp; M. J. Duncan <a href="#apjadbf9bbib22" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib22">1994</a>), was used to follow all orbits. The code was modified to include artificial forces that mimic the radial migration and damping of planetary orbits. The migration history of planets was informed by the best models of planetary migration/instability. Specifically, they adopted the migration model s10/30j from D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib26" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib26">2020</a>) that worked well to satisfy many constraints. See that work for a detailed description of the migration parameters (e.g., migration <em>e</em>-fold timescale <em>œÑ</em> = 10 Myr for <em>t</em> &lt; 10 Myr and instability at <em>t</em> = 10 Myr). The migration model also accounted for the jitter that Neptune's orbit experienced due to close encounters with massive bodies (D. Nesvorn√Ω &amp; D. Vokrouhlick√Ω <a href="#apjadbf9bbib25" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib25">2016</a>).</p><p>(2)<em> Planetesimal Disk.</em> The simulations included one million disk planetesimals distributed from 4 au to beyond 30 au. Such a high resolution was needed to obtain good statistics for the Oort cloud. The initial surface density of disk planetesimals was assumed to follow the truncated power-law profile from D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib26" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib26">2020</a>; also see R. S. Gomes et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib12" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib12">2004</a>). The step in the surface density at 30 au was parameterized by the contrast parameter <em>c</em> ‚àº 10<sup>3</sup>, which is simply the ratio of surface densities on either side of 30 au (the planetesimals with initial <em>a</em> &gt; 30 au are not an important source for the Oort cloud). The initial eccentricities and inclinations of orbits were set according to the Rayleigh distribution with scale parameters <em>œÉ</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> = 0.1 and <em>œÉ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 0.05. The disk bodies were assumed to be massless such that their gravity did not interfere with the migration/damping routines.</p><p>(3)<em> Galactic potential and stellar encounters.</em> The Galaxy was assumed to be axisymmetric, and the Sun followed a circular orbit in the Galactic midplane (the Sun's migration in the Galaxy was not included; N. A. Kaib et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib18" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib18">2011</a>). The Galactic tidal acceleration was taken from J. Heisler &amp; S. Tremaine (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib13" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib13">1986</a>; see also P. Wiegert &amp; S. Tremaine <a href="#apjadbf9bbib35" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib35">1999</a>; H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>). The stellar mass density in the solar neighborhood was set to <em>œÅ</em><sub>0</sub> = 0.15 <em>M</em><sub>‚äô</sub> pc<sup>‚àí3</sup>. The simulations accounted for the effect of stellar encounters. The stellar mass and number density of different stellar species were computed from J. Heisler et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib14" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib14">1987</a>). The stars were released and removed at the heliocentric distance of 1 pc (206,000 au). For each species, the velocity distribution was approximated by the isotropic Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. The dynamical effect of passing molecular clouds was ignored.</p><p>(4)<em> Calibration on observations.</em> The Galaxy simulation was run over 4.6 Gyr, at which point the orbital distribution of bodies in the trans-Neptunian region was compared with DES observations (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>). DES covered a contiguous 5000 deg<sup>2</sup> of the southern sky between 2013 and 2019, with the majority of the imaged area being at high ecliptic latitudes. The search for outer solar system objects yielded 812 KBOs with well-characterized discovery biases, including over 200 SDOs with <em>a</em> &gt; 50 au. The DES survey simulator<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn11">15</a></sup>
 (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>) was used to bias the model in the same way as the data. D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>) made use of DES observations to calibrate the magnitude distribution of trans-Neptunian objects and establish that the dynamical model results were consistent with DES observations. The model fidelity was previously tested from observations of short-period comets (D. Nesvorn√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib27" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib27">2017</a>) and LPCs (D. Vokrouhlick√Ω et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>).</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

their training set, then they‚Äôll fade into irrelevance anyway. So let‚Äôs extend this line of thinking out. If you think (like we probably all do) that your soup du jour is better than the other guy‚Äôs, then guess what? Either the LLMs will get ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough to </span><strong>realize it too</strong><span>, or you‚Äôll </span><strong>eat all the vibe coder‚Äôs lunch because they never figure it out.</strong></p><p><span>Yes and no. I know there are a lot of people who will hate what I‚Äôm about to say. People I respect, and whose opinions I value despite how incorrect they are on this front. ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is going to significantly change what it looks like to build software. I‚Äôm not worried about how I‚Äôm going to stack up against the ‚Äú</span><strong>Giving into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that code even exists</strong><span>‚Äù folks, but I </span><strong>am</strong><span> aware that there are significant new tools &amp; variables at play here. Not factoring them in is how you become a dinosaur. Which, for what it's worth, is fully your prerogative. </span></p><p>With that in mind, if we want our tools to succeed in this space, we need to invest in it as well. Not exclusively, maybe even not significantly. But being relevant here is non-optional IMHO.</p><p><span>I‚Äôm the author of an application framework for Elixir called </span><a href="https://ash-hq.org/" rel="">Ash Framework</a><span>. This article is not about Ash, but my work on it and the support that I provide for it have given me some potentially unique insights. Over the last few months I‚Äôve observed:</span></p><ul><li><p>a new item on the rubric for tools: the quality of answers from Claude &amp; ChatGPT about it</p></li><li><p>a huge increase in fully off the wall and weird questions driven by LLM hallucinations</p></li><li><p>methodologies for working with LLM agents that are making me wish *more* of my users used them, not *less*</p></li></ul><p>People are finding that the magic word smusher gives surprisingly good results for things like Typescript &amp; Rust. All of a sudden, they have a new thing to factor in when making their decisions. FOMO is a powerful thing, so I think this plays a bigger factor than we‚Äôd like. Folks are worrying even more than ever about the future-proofing of their knowledge in the context of a major industry shift. If I invest my time to learn something that ‚ÄúAI‚Äù can‚Äôt help me with, will I be left behind? It‚Äôs a very real and important question, and I think to succeed these days, you have to alleviate the concern in some way.</p><p>Fairly often these days I get questions about code that no one would ever have had a reason to think should work. These cases are clearly coming from folks asking LLMs how to do something, or using an agentic assistant. The first knee-jerk response here is to tell people that we don‚Äôt answer questions about ‚ÄúAI‚Äù generated code. And in some cases, if it‚Äôs clear that the person asking the question did zero research on their own, they‚Äôll get a response like that. But what if there was another way?</p><p><span>Ultimately you should not be relying on an LLM as a source of ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù. This is true effectively </span><strong>always</strong><span>, even for popular tools, because LLMs won‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù about recent changes, but is magnified when asking questions about things that are more esoteric. </span></p><p>The key to succeeding with LLMs is to treat them as if they are only capable of doing things like summarization and pattern transformation. Assume that, before extracting an ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to your question, you must first do something that would *place* that answer into its context window, making its job the summarization and/or reformatting of the information into some desired result/effect. Here are some real things you can do to this effect.</p><p>Here is a concrete example of using LLMs ‚Äúbadly‚Äù.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png" width="568" height="562.5384615384615" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1442,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:295003,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.zachdaniel.dev/i/164927613?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cd5ed29-49ee-4d89-9b3c-bb98d11b3f47_1488x1474.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Looks plausible enough right?

Think of it as giving your LLM a direct hotline to your running code - not just static documentation, but your actual living application.</p><p>Here's what this looks like in practice. Instead of asking Claude "How do I create a user in this app?" and getting a generic answer that might be outdated, Tidewave lets the LLM use tools like:</p><ul><li><p><code>project_eval</code><span> - runs code snippets directly in your application context</span></p></li><li><p><code>run_sql_query</code><span> - executes database queries using your app's actual schema and tooling</span></p></li><li><p><code>search_hex_docs</code><span> - searches the documentation of your specific package versions</span></p></li></ul><p>This means your agent might do things like search the hex docs of your dependencies to see how Ash works, use the `project_eval` tool to poke around in your running app, try creating a user using your app to see if it works, and then run a SQL query after the fact to make sure the user exists in the database. Wildly powerful stuff.</p><p>This one is easy, and you can try it on your own apps today. Often when you end up building new features, they bear resemblance to one or more of the other things in your application. LLMs are very good at synthesis, summary, and categorization. So put them to work at it! A really excellent prompt to kick off an agent‚Äôs task often looks like this:</p><pre><code>I'd like to make a feature to track user activity. Let's start with "last_login_at" and "last_seen_at". To start, we'll need a new plug in our router, kind of like @/path/to/similar/plug.ex, except instead of X it does Y. For the fields, take a look at `last_updated` for an example of the kind of field we want, except this one should be accepted as input when updating a user.</code></pre><p><span>I'm trying to push a new pattern for Elixir packages that I think could be game-changing. The concept is simple: any library can include a </span><code>usage-rules.md</code><span> file - essentially very terse documentation designed specifically for LLM context windows, explaining what to and what not to do when using the library.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png" width="598" height="257.51785714285717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:627,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:598,&quot;bytes&quot;:64317,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.zachdaniel.dev/i/164927613?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We've done this for the main Ash packages, and the transformation is remarkable. We went from LLM agents being practically useless for Ash development to being able to generate idiomatic, production-ready code. The dichotomy of "meet my standards" versus "let the LLM do it" simply disappeared.</p><p>This isn't just about Ash or even Elixir. This is a template for how any technology community can turn LLMs from a threat into their most effective growth tool.</p><p>We can go even further. Instead of just helping LLMs use Elixir better, we can help train them to be better at Elixir in the first place. This is something we discussed at the contributors summit, so it is the product of many minds, not just mine.</p><p>The Elixir community could build evaluation datasets that test real-world scenarios: GenServer supervision trees, OTP fault tolerance patterns, Phoenix LiveView reactivity, writing Ecto queries, building applications with Ash. When companies like Anthropic and OpenAI train their models, they need diverse, high-quality benchmarks - and right now, they're mostly testing on Python and JavaScript.</p><p><span>If we get these evaluations to a degree of quality and scale, we get a bunch of benefits. We can determine which models are the best at writing Elixir. If done well enough, companies like OpenAI and Anthropic may even opt to use it to train their private models (something we should encourage in this scenario). You can find collections of benchmarks in various places, like: </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/" rel="">Hugging Face</a><span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/leobeeson/llm_benchmarks" rel="">GitHub</a><span>. I see plenty of python stuff there, but not no Elixir ü§î.</span></p><p>Here's the kicker: Elixir's runtime makes it perfect for performance-based evals. We can build harnesses that don't just check if code compiles, but whether it actually handles concurrent load properly, recovers from crashes gracefully, or manages memory efficiently.</p><p>As models get better at Elixir through these evaluations, they become better advocates for it. We would be going beyond just making LLMs write better Elixir - we'd be making them recommend Elixir when it's the right choice.</p><p>If I can make LLMs a force to be reckoned with not only for Elixir but for the niche-within-a-niche that is Ash Framework, I think it's safe to say that LLMs are not, in-and-of-themselves, an existential threat to Elixir.</p><p>In fact, I think we're looking at this backwards. The real opportunity isn't surviving the LLM revolution - it's using it as a force multiplier. Better technologies have lost adoption battles because they had steeper learning curves or less accessible documentation, but maybe LLMs can flatten that learning curve if we do the work to make our tools competitive in this space.</p><p>The question isn't whether LLMs will change how we build software. They already have. The question is whether we'll shape that change or let it shape us.</p></div></div>]]></description>
