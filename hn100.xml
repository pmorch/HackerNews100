<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div>  <p>October is in the bag, and we merged 217 PRs from 43 contributors. Let’s look at some highlights!</p>

<p>Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="https://axept.io/">Axeptio</a> with $10,000 (<a href="https://www.axept.io/blog/ladybird-open-web">their announcement</a>) </li>
<li> <a href="https://gravwell.io/">Gravwell</a> with $5,000 </li>
 </ul>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please <a href="mailto:contact@ladybird.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3 id="web-platform-tests-wpt"> Web Platform Tests (WPT) </h3>
<p>We’ve continued to make solid progress on <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">WPT</a> this month. There has been a significant
increase in passing subtests, with <strong> 111,431 </strong> new passing subtests bringing our total to <strong> 1,964,649 </strong>.</p>
<p>The majority of this increase comes from a large update to the test suite itself, with <strong> 100,751 </strong> subtests being added -
mainly due to the Wasm core tests being updated to Wasm 3.0.</p>
<p>This bump has seen us pass over 90% of all WPT subtests for the first time! An important milestone, as this is one of
the criteria Apple uses to determine eligibility for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">alternative browser engines on iOS</a>.</p>
<p>For context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs. one month ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-wpt.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="http-disk-cache"> HTTP disk cache </h3>
<p>Last month, we enabled our in-memory HTTP cache. This cache lives in a single WebContent process, and does not persist
across browser restarts.</p>
<p>We’ve now begun work on a persistent disk cache! (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6435">#6435</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6487">#6487</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6579">#6579</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6645">#6645</a>). This provides a second layer of caching, which will
make visits to the same websites much faster.</p>
<h3 id="performance-work"> Performance work </h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of performance improvements this month. Some examples:</p>
<ul> 
<li> JS string performance optimizations (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6396">#6396</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6400">#6400</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6401">#6401</a>) </li>
<li> JS object property assignment optimization (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6413">#6413</a>) </li>
<li> Inline caching for JS object property access in C++ (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6474">#6474</a>) </li>
<li> Faster add/subtract/multiply of two Int32 values when result overflows (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6414">#6414</a>) </li>
<li> Ignore repaints inside iframes with <code>visibility: hidden</code> (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6555">#6555</a>) </li>
<li> Discard heavy UTF-32 buffers after parsing HTML (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6561">#6561</a>) </li>
 </ul>
<h3 id="trusted-types-in-the-dom"> Trusted Types in the DOM </h3>
<p>Continuing work from previous months, Trusted Types support was added to several DOM APIs:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <code>HTMLIFrameElement</code>: <code>srcdoc</code> </li>
<li> <code>Element</code>: <code>setAttribute</code>, <code>setAttributeNS</code>, <code>setHTMLUnsafe</code>, <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code>, and <code>insertAdjacentHTML</code> </li>
<li> <code>Document</code>: <code>write</code>, <code>writeln</code>, and <code>parseHTMLUnsafe</code> </li>
<li> <code>ShadowRoot</code>: <code>setHTMLUnsafe</code> and <code>innerHTML</code> </li>
<li> <code>DOMParser</code>: <code>parseFromString</code> </li>
<li> <code>Range</code>: <code>createContextualFragment</code> </li>
<li> <code>Worker</code>, <code>SharedWorker</code>, and <code>ServiceWorker</code> constructors </li>
 </ul>
<p>(PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6057">#6057</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6424">#6424</a>)</p>
<h3 id="initial-support-for-xpath-evaluations"> Initial support for XPath evaluations </h3>
<p>Some basic support for <code>XPathEvaluator</code>, <code>XPathExpression</code>, <code>XPathResult</code>, <code>XPathNSResolver</code>, and <code>Document.evaluate</code> was added this month.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2">libxml2</a> under the hood to run XPath evaluations on an XML tree compatible with the library that is created from our parsed XML tree. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6342">#6342</a>)</p>
<p>This is a short-term solution to bring initial support to these classes, because there are differences between the DOM and XML implementations of XPath that are not possible to work around with libxml2.</p>
<p>This enables the <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> library to work in Ladybird:</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-xpath-htmx.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="audiovideo-synchronization-multi-track-support"> Audio/Video synchronization, multi-track support </h3>
<p>Previously, our media playback implementation relied on separate, unrelated audio and video playback systems to play media files where both are present. This meant that it was possible for audio and video to desynchronize very easily, especially when their seeking behavior was inconsistent.</p>
<p>That implementation has now been replaced with a single new system that controls audio and video playback together, ensuring they remain in sync at all times. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6410">#6410</a>)</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-av-playback.mp4"></video>
<p>As part of this reimplementation, several aspects of playback have improved:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Seeking is done asynchronously, and can therefore complete much faster. Scrubbing the timeline now previews the new playback position instantly, instead of waiting for the mouse button to be released. </li>
<li> Media elements now support the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks">audioTracks</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks">videoTracks</a> properties, which allow scripts to interact with multiple audio or video tracks in a file, toggling them at will. The playback system mixes any enabled audio tracks into one output. </li>
<li> The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/fastSeek">fastSeek()</a> function now follows spec with regard to seeking forward when the target is later than the current position. </li>
 </ul>
<h3 id="pinch-to-zoom-support"> Pinch-to-zoom support </h3>
<p>Ladybird now supports pinch-to-zoom on macOS (AppKit UI). The <code>VisualViewport</code> API exposes the zoom transform.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pinch-to-zoom.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="accessibility-devtools"> Accessibility DevTools </h3>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-a11y-devtools.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since switching away from our own inspector to using Firefox’s developer tools, we’ve been missing a few features. This month we reimplemented inspection of the accessibility tree - a structure parallel to the usual
element tree that represents how tools like screen readers see the page. We don’t yet support such tools, but being able
to examine what’s going on inside Ladybird will make that easier. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6462">#6462</a>)</p>
<h3 id="css-typed-om-progress"> CSS Typed OM progress </h3>
<p>Continuing from last month, we’re still working on the CSS Typed OM API, which allows authors to get and set style
properties using objects instead of strings. Ladybird now supports setting style with most types of <code>CSSStyleValue</code>.
(PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6370">#6370</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6378">#6378</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6440">#6440</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6466">#6466</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sibling-count-and-sibling-index"> <code>sibling-count()</code> and <code>sibling-index()</code> </h3>
<p>These are relatively new CSS functions that enable authors to style or animate elements differently depending on how
many siblings they have and where they appear in that list.
This month we implemented support for these. (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6426">#6426</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6526">#6526</a>)</p>
<h3 id="css-and-svg-gradients"> CSS and SVG gradients </h3>
<p>This month we’ve improved support for both CSS repeating linear gradients and SVG gradients with coordinates expressed
in <code>objectBoundingBox</code> units. This results in many such gradients looking crisper and more correct! (PRs
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6533">6533</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6592">6592</a>)</p>
<h3 id="canvaspattern"> CanvasPattern </h3>
<p>We had preliminary support in place for <code>CanvasPattern</code>, a way to create an image pattern based on an arbitrary image
source such as a canvas, an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or even a video frame. We did not actually use this pattern in drawing commands
though, causing some significant graphical artifacts. We do now, which causes the background on
<a href="https://slither.io/">slither.io</a> to finally render correctly!
(PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6548">#6548</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-slither-io.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="improved-webgl2-buffer-support"> Improved WebGL2 buffer support </h3>
<p>We’ve improved support for the WebGL2 <code>.readPixels()</code> method and implemented the <code>.getBufferSubData()</code> method, which
are used to transfer pixel data between arbitrary buffers by libraries such as <a href="https://sparkjs.dev/">SparkJS</a>. (PR
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6637">#6637</a>)</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-sparkjs.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="improved-offscreen-webgl-framebuffer-support"> Improved offscreen WebGL framebuffer support </h3>
<p>An issue with offscreen framebuffers being cleared after frame presentation caused the demo on the <a href="https://pixijs.com/">PixiJS homepage</a> not to display the masked/warped image of stars/nebulae. This has been fixed, so the demo appears correctly now:</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pixijs-home.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="webgl-progress-on-google-maps"> WebGL progress on Google Maps </h3>
<p>There were some targeted WebGL fixes for Google Maps Globe View, including:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Respecting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/pixelStorei">UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL</a> </li>
<li> Returning null for missing uniforms instead of -1 </li>
<li> Calculating the correct pitch for 16-bit textures </li>
 </ul>
<p>This resulted in far fewer visual issues in Globe View; the sky still does not render and remains the biggest outstanding issue.</p>

<p>(PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6558">#6558</a>)</p>
<h3 id="progress-on-windows-support"> Progress on Windows support </h3>
<p>While Windows support is not the focus for the alpha release in 2026, the community has continued to improve it.</p>
<p>This month, Ladybird ran on Windows for the first time:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Standing in the middle of a field, we can easily forget that we live on a round planet. We’re so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.</p>
<p>The world is full of such shapes — ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.</p>
<p>This new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces — leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis and physics.</p>
<p>Today, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They’re as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said <a href="https://people.cs.dm.unipi.it/bianchi/">Fabrizio Bianchi</a>, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”</p>
<p>So what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?</p>
<h2><strong>Ideas Taking Shape</strong></h2>
<p>For millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space’ meant ‘physical space,’” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain — the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.</p>
<p>In Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.</p>
<p>But by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces — ones that aren’t flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle’s angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.</p>
<p>The mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.</p>
<p>But some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology — his father was a pastor — before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.</p>

<p>In 1854, Riemann was required to deliver a lecture to secure a teaching position at the University of Göttingen. His assigned topic: the foundations of geometry. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss’ ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions).</p>
<p>Gauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann’s ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,’” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann’s lecture didn’t appear in print until 1868, two years after his death.</p>
<p>But by the end of the 19th century, mathematical greats like Henri Poincaré had recognized the importance of Riemann’s ideas. And in 1915, Albert Einstein used them in his general theory of relativity, bringing them out of the realm of philosophical abstraction and into the real world. By the middle of the 20th century, they had become a mathematical staple.</p>
<p>Riemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space.</p>
<p>A manifold.</p>
<h2><strong>Charted Territory</strong></h2>
<p>The term “manifold” comes from Riemann’s <em>Mannigfaltigkeit</em>, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”</p>
<p>A manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. An ant living on the circle will never know that it’s actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point that it’s not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.</p>
<p>Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it’ll look like a flat 2D plane. But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected at their tips — is not a manifold.</p>

    </figure>

<p>Manifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape’s properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). For instance, lay a piece of string on a table, and connect its ends without lifting it. You’ll get a simple loop. Now hold the string in the air and tie its ends together. By considering the string in three dimensions, you can pass it over and under itself before you connect the ends, creating all sorts of knots beyond the simple loop. They all represent the same one-dimensional manifold — the looped string — but they have different properties when considered in two versus three dimensions.</p>
<p>Mathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold’s intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds — that at any point, they look Euclidean — is immensely helpful on that front. Because it’s possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it.</p>

<p>To do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart” — a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold’s dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas.</p>
<p>You can then use this atlas — whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space — to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you’re seeking.</p>
<p>Today, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics.</p>
<h2><strong>Manifold Uses</strong></h2>
<p>Manifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein described space-time as a four-dimensional manifold, and gravity as that manifold’s curvature. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we’re <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-the-geometry-of-the-universe-20200316/">still trying to figure out</a> its global shape.</p>
<p>Even in cases where manifolds don’t seem to be present, mathematicians and physicists try to rewrite their problems in the language of manifolds to make use of their helpful properties. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said <a href="https://gravity.princeton.edu/people/jonathan-sorce">Jonathan Sorce</a>, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. “And often in surprising ways.”</p>
        
        
<p>Consider a double pendulum, which consists of one pendulum hanging from the end of another. Small changes in the double pendulum’s initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. But if you represent the configuration of the pendulum with just two angles (one describing the position of each of its arms), then the space of all possible configurations looks like a doughnut, or torus — a manifold. Each point on this torus represents one possible state of the pendulum; paths on the torus represent the trajectories the pendulum might follow through space. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles and more.</p>
<p>Similarly, mathematicians often view the solutions to complicated algebraic equations as a manifold to better understand their properties. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets — such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain — by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.</p>
<p>Asking how scientists use manifolds is akin to asking how they use numbers, Sorce said. “They are at the foundation of everything.”</p>

<div><p>Since we're doing PSAs, isn't it also now just a completely broken platform on mobile for everyone who isn't logged in?</p><p>&gt; Something went wrong, but don't fret - let's give it another shot.</p><p>This is all I've seen for literally years now.  No real error, does not even say to login or install an app, just blames it on my privacy extensions (I don't actually have any) and offers a button to pointlessly try again.  No big loss, but surprising!  On the one hand, it's the only time big tech isn't engaged in obnoxious harassment, but it's also a conspicuously dumb oversight in the funnel</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45808311"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45808311" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45808311&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45807775"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Sorry, are you actually five years old? Until just a few years ago Twitter was entirely open. You could view any and all public tweets, replies, threads. All exactly like you were logged in. Their APIs were open and you could literally plug the entire stream of all tweets from all users on the actual planet in real time into your own application.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45810782"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="5"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td><center><a id="up_45810782" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45810782&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45807775"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Actually, you definitely could not plug the entire stream of all tweets from all users in real time into your own application (without huge cost). You only would ever see a subset of tweets via twitters API's and search results, if you wanted the full thing you had to pay for 'the firehose' which was very expensive.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45808394"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="4"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td><center><a id="up_45808394" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45808394&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45807775"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Come on, pre-Elon you could click on a Twitter link and read the entire thread as well as the replies, now you just get a single tweet with no context above/below.</p><p>And if you click on an account you just get top posts of all time instead of a chronological feed, so it's impossible to even find the context while being logged off.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45808363"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45808363" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45808363&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45807775"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>This is not true, this change is a recent phenomenon, I believe it came into effect sometime around 2021-2023 (maybe earlier even).

Jevons observed that, the cheaper and faster we got at producing coal, the more coal we ended up using - demand </span><em>more than</em><span> eclipsed the cost savings, and the coal market grew rapidly as it fed the Second Industrial Revolution in England and abroad.</span></p><p>Today we all know Moore’s Law, the best contemporary example of Jevons paradox. In 1965, a transistor cost roughly $1. Today it costs a fraction of a millionth of a cent. This extraordinary collapse in computing costs – a billionfold improvement – did not lead to modest, proportional increases in computer use. It triggered an explosion of applications that would have been unthinkable at earlier price points. At $1 per transistor, computers made sense for military calculations and corporate payroll. At a thousandth of a cent, they made sense for word processing and databases. At a millionth of a cent, they made sense in thermostats and greeting cards. At a billionth of a cent, we embed them in disposable shipping tags that transmit their location once and are thrown away. The efficiency gains haven’t reduced our total computing consumption: they’ve made computing so cheap that we now use trillions times more of it.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png" width="1347" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1347,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XtfD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a544d8-177d-4878-93eb-1e8f5b059ecf_1347x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>We’re all betting that the same will happen with the cost of tokens, just like it happened to the cost of computing, which in turn unlocks more demand than can possibly be taken up by the existing investment.

And that huge new supply of viable, productive opportunity is our starting point to understand the other half of our economic puzzle: what happens everywhere else.</span></p><p>Agatha Christie once wrote that she never thought she’d be wealthy enough to own a car, or poor enough to not have servants. Whereas, after a century of productivity gains, the average American middle-class household can comfortably manage a new car lease every two years, but needs to split the cost of a single nanny with their neighbors. </p><div><p><span>How did this happen? 100 years after Jevons published his observation on coal, William Baumol published a short paper investigating why so many orchestras, theaters, and opera companies were running out of money. He provocatively asserted that the String Quartet had become </span><em>less productive</em><span>, in “real economy” terms, because the rest of the economy had become </span><em>more productive</em><span>, while the musicians’ job stayed exactly the same. The paper struck a nerve, and became a branded concept: “Baumol’s Cost Disease”. </span></p><p><span>This is a tricky concept to wrap your head around, and </span><a href="https://www.mercatus.org/marginal-revolution-podcast/baumol-effect" rel="">not everyone buys it</a><span>. But the basic argument is, over the long run all jobs and wage scales compete in the labor market with every other job and wage scale. If one sector becomes hugely productive, and creates </span><em>tons</em><span> of well-paying jobs, then every other sector’s wages eventually have to rise, in order for their jobs to remain attractive for anyone.</span></p></div><p><span>The String Quartet is an odd choice of example, because there are so many ways to argue that music </span><em>has</em><span> become more productive over the past century: recorded and streaming music have brought consumption costs down to near zero, and you could argue that Taylor Swift is “higher quality” for what today’s audiences are looking for (even if you deplore the aesthetics.) But </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/05/the-baumol-effect.html" rel="">the overall effect is compelling nonetheless</a><span>. As some sectors of the economy get more attractive, the comparatively </span><em>less</em><span> attractive ones get more expensive anyway.</span></p><p>Once you’ve heard of Baumol’s, it’s like you get to join a trendy club of economic thinkers who now have someone to blame for all of society’s problems. It gets to be a successful punching bag for why labor markets are weird, or why basic services cost so much - “It’s a rich country problem.”</p><p><span>But the odd thing about Baumol’s is how rarely it is juxtaposed with the </span><em>actual driving cause </em><span>of those productivity distortions, which is the </span><em>massive increase</em><span> in productivity, in overall wealth, and in overall consumption, that’s required for Baumol’s to kick in. In a weird way, Jevons </span><em>is necessary</em><span> for Baumol’s to happen.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif" width="730" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:730,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:164976,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://a16z.substack.com/i/177698479?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3Jd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa627f078-5b43-411f-8621-df0e2dc8b18f_730x330.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>For some reason, we rarely see those two phenomena juxtaposed against each other, but they’re related. For the Baumol Effect to take place as classically presented, there must be a </span><em>total </em><span>increase in productive output and opportunity; not just a </span><em>relative</em><span> increase in productivity, from the booming industry and the new jobs that it creates. But when that does happen, and we see a lot of consumption, job opportunities, and prosperity get created by the boom, you can safely bet that Baumol’s will manifest itself in faraway corners of the economy. </span><a href="https://acjsissons.medium.com/the-baumol-effect-not-a-disease-but-a-cure-c63d0ae0b481" rel="">This isn’t all bad; it’s how wealth gets spread around</a><span> and how a rising tide lifts many boats. (There’s probably a joke here somewhere that Baumol’s Cost Disease is actually the most effective form of Communism ever tried, or something.)</span></p><p>So, to recap:</p><ul><li><p>“Jevons-type effects” created bountiful new opportunity in everything that got more productive; and</p></li><li><p><span>“Baumol-type effects” means that everything that </span><em>didn’t</em><span> get more productive got more expensive anyway, but we consume more of it all the same because society as a whole got richer.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>As explained in one job: our explosion of demand for data centres means there’s infinite work for HVAC technicians. So they get paid more (even though they themselves didn’t change), which means they charge more on </span><em>all</em><span> jobs (even the ones that have nothing to do with AI), but we can afford to pay them (because we got </span><em>richer</em><span> overall, mostly from technology improvements, over the long run). Furthermore, the next generation of plumber apprentices might decide to do HVAC instead; so now </span><em>plumbing</em><span> is more expensive too. And so on.</span></p><p><span>Now let’s think about what’s going to happen with widespread AI adoption, if it pays off the way we all think it will. First of all, it’s going to drive a lot of productivity gains in </span><em>services</em><span> specifically. (There is precedent for this; e.g. the railroads made the mail a lot more productive; the internet made travel booking a lot more productive.) </span><em>Some</em><span> services are going to get pulled into the Jevons vortex, and just rapidly start getting more productive, and unlocking new use cases for those services. (The key is to look for </span><em>elastic-demand </em><span>services, where we plausibly could consume 10x or more of the service, along some dimension. Legal services, for example, plausibly fit this bill.)</span></p><p><span>And then there are other kinds of services that are not going to be Jevons’ed, for some reason or another, and for </span><em>those</em><span> services, over time, we should expect to see wildly high prices for specific services that have no real reason to AI whatsoever. Your dog walker has nothing to do with AI infrastructure; and yet, he will cost more. But you’ll pay it anyway; if you love your dog.</span></p><p>The last piece of this economic riddle, which we haven’t mentioned thus far, is that elected governments (who appoint and direct employment regulators) often believe they have a mandate to protect people’s employment and livelihoods. And the straightforward way that mandate gets applied, in the face of technological changes, is to protect human jobs by saying, “This safety function must be performed or signed off by a human.”</p><p><span>When this happens (which it certainly will, across who knows how many industries, we’ll see a Baumol’s type effect take hold </span><em>within single jobs. </em><a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy" rel="">Here’s Dwarkesh, on his recent interview with Andrej Karpathy</a><span>: (Excerpted in full, because it’s such an interesting thought):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“With radiologists, I’m totally speculating and I have no idea what the actual workflow of a radiologist involves. But one analogy that might be applicable is when Waymos were first being rolled out, there’d be a person sitting in the front seat, and you just had to have them there to make sure that if something went really wrong, they’d be there to monitor. Even today, people are still watching to make sure things are going well. Robotaxi, which was just deployed, still has a person inside it.</em></p><p><em>Now we could be in a similar situation where if you automate 99% of a job, that last 1% the human has to do is incredibly valuable because it’s bottlenecking everything else. If it were the case with radiologists, where the person sitting in the front of Waymo has to be specially trained for years in order to provide the last 1%, their wages should go up tremendously because they’re the one thing bottlenecking wide deployment. Radiologists, I think their wages have gone up for similar reasons, if you’re the last bottleneck and you’re not fungible. A Waymo driver might be fungible with others. So you might see this thing where your wages go up until you get to 99% and then fall just like that when the last 1% is gone. And I wonder if we’re seeing similar things with radiology or salaries of call center workers or anything like that.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Just like we have really weird economies in advanced countries (where we can afford supercomputers in our pockets, but not enough teachers for small class sizes), we could see a strange thing happen where the last 1% that </span><em>must be a human</em><span> in a job (the “Dog Walker” part, as opposed to the “Excel” part) becomes the essential employable skillset.</span></p><p>In an interesting way, this hints at where Baumol’s will finally run out of steam - because at some point, these “last 1% employable skills” no longer become substitutable for one another. They’ll become strange vestigial limbs of career paths; in a sense. We have a ways to go until we get there, but we can anticipate some very strange economic &amp; political alliances that could get formed in such a world. Until then, let’s keep busy on the productivity part. Because that’s what matters, and what makes us a wealthy society - weird consequences and all.</p><p><em>Views expressed in “posts” (including podcasts, videos, and social media) are those of the individual a16z personnel quoted therein and are not the views of a16z Capital Management, L.L.C.

<p>After eight glorious weeks of freedom, I got rehired.</p>
</div>
<p>First thing I did was walk over to the machine shop to look for my F-150. The oil stain was there but the truck wasn’t. It wasn’t in the rock lot where the bulldozers parked either.</p>
<p>Who would have stooped so low as to co-opt that piece of shit? It had no heat and no air-conditioning. The radio bubbled static. Door handles were missing. Floorboards, fenders, and frame all rusted and rotted. It certainly hadn<span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>t been what could be called roadworthy. And, my God, the smell.</p>
<p>I went into the machine shop. One of the welders lifted his hood and told me the bad news—they’d had to move the truck for a rebar delivery and the engine on that old thing finally blew, so the truck got dragged to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>In a dusty corner, I saw a pile of salvaged tools from the truck. I took some wrenches and my tape measure but didn’t see what I was really looking for—my Truck Desk<sup>®</sup>. Oh well.</p>

<p>I caught a ride out to the unit with the foreman and the rest of the crew. Our goal for the day was <span lang="DE">to unbolt </span>components from a heat exchanger and fly them off with a crane. Once the exchanger was apart and inspected, we’d begin our real repairs.</p>
<p>The morning went well. The mornings always go well. Everybody knows what they’re doing. We’re professionals, equals. Same pay. Same benefits. All working together toward retirement. We look out for each other. Whoever has the hardest task in this crew today could be the foreman tomorrow, and vice versa. Nobody wants to be the boss, so our bosses are the best kind.</p>
<p>At first break we packed into our truck and drove shoulder-to-shoulder back to the trailer compound for coffee. During the five-minute drive, I couldn’t help but think how good I’d had it when I had the luxury of using that piece of shit F-150.</p>
<p>See, the truck nobody else wanted had been my office. I’d built a portable desk inside it. My truck desk, I called it. A couple of planks screwed together, our union sticker slapped on, the whole deal sealed with shellac. I’d built the desk so it slid into the bottom of the steering wheel and sat across the armrests. I used to hang back at the job and sneak in some creative work while the rest of the crew went to break. My desk—which I’d taken far too long to build and perfect through many prototypes—had been stowed behind the driver’s seat when the truck was hauled off by the wrecker.</p>
<p>Back at the break trailer, I took my old seat and joined in on the jokes, insults, tall tales. That trailer was, to me, the best place for storytelling in the world—but, as always, it was too loud, too raucous, too fun to do any writing or reading, which is all I ever want to do on break. At lunch, I retreated into the relative quiet of the machine shop. I sat down by the drill press and took out my cell phone and started writing. Just like I used to do.</p>
<p>For nearly two decades I’ve worked off and on at this petrochemical plant as a mechanic and welder. The union dispatched me here: When it gets slow, I get laid off; when work picks up, I boomerang back. And the whole time, I’ve written stories and parts of my novels during breaks—fifteen minutes for coffee and then half an hour for lunch. I’ve also made use of the heaven-sent delays brought on by lightning, severe rainstorms, evacuations, permitting problems, equipment issues, and so on. I’m thankful for each and every delay that happens on this construction site, and, believe me, there are many.</p>
<p>Most artists I know are like this. Finding time to make art while working another job, or taking care of loved ones. They improvise. They get better. They get worse. They get better again.</p>
<p>Really it mostly comes down to that first thing: finding time. When I talk to people who want to find more time, I repeat something an old-timer said to me early on: “You’ve gotta make your own conditions.”</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well. Is it raining? You can either stand out in the rain and get wet, or you can find a coil of tie-wire and hang up tarps for a hooch.</p>
<p>There’s another expression I like, which goes: “Let your wallet be your guide.” I try to remember that every time I feel the urge to quit my job and never return.</p>
<p>So ever since cell phones got smart, I’ve sat somewhere quiet, semi-on-the-clock, texting myself poems, paragraphs that became stories and novels, and things about my life, or I should say just <i>life</i>, like this thing you’re reading right now.</p>
<p>Writing on my cell phone, pecking away, was good enough for many years, but then after a rightfully humbling decade of manual labor, I started having irrational fantasies about convenience and comfort.</p>
<p>Of course I have a desk in my apartment, but I couldn’t help myself. Somehow I’d gotten seduced by the prospect of attaining my very own cubicle amid this massive junkyard full of toxic waste.</p>
<p>One day I walked into the payroll trailer where the secretaries and site manager sat. There wasn’t an explicit sign that said <small>NO CONTRACTORS ALLOWED</small>, but it was an unspoken rule. The trailer had a few unused old cubicles tucked to the side. I sat down in one and happily pecked away with my thumbs. Every break for a week I went in and worked on my writing. After a few days I started to feel like I should hang pictures of my mom and dad and my wife inside it. But I didn’t dare.</p>
<p>Then things really heated up. I brought in a Bluetooth keyboard and wrote a whole story that day on my breaks. There was no going back. My heart soared. I thought I should adopt a brown dog with a bandanna around his neck just so I could thumbtack his picture to the cubicle wall. I hadn’t interacted with any of the office staff, but they’d seen me. They’d followed my oily bootprints down the hallway and begun to leer. Who is this diesel-stinking contractor? He’s probably the one who’s been eating Janelle’s Oreos. He raided the mango-kiwi yogurt from the fridge. He glommed all the sporks. I knew my cubicle dreams were over the morning I found the site manager waiting in “my” cubicle.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked.</p>
<p>In all my years working at that place, I’d never seen the site manager out on the site. I’m not sure he knew what it was or where it was. You went to him to order tools; he was the one who said no. I’d only ever seen him at a urinal or buying bacon and eggs off the lunch truck. But if I had ever seen him out on the site, it would have never occurred to me to ask him what he was doing there. He was wearing a blue polo shirt and khakis, and I was in his world—and he was asking.</p>
<p>“Office work,” I said.</p>
<p>“What kind, exactly?”</p>
<p>How can you explain literary fiction to a site manager?</p>
<p>“Little bit of everything,” I said.</p>
<p>I started writing in the machine shop again. It wasn’t the same. Once I’d been infected by the cubicle virus, there was no going back. Out of scrap lumber I gathered from various dumpsters, I built a proper desk for myself in the northeast corner of the shop. That desk was a huge leap forward in possibility and productivity. In the evenings, if I wrote something by hand or on my typewriter at home, I could now use my time at work to retype it at my shop desk.</p>
<p>The shop desk was not ideal. Some days I arrived to find someone had disassembled a small motor on top of it, gaskets and hardware spread out on newspaper. Other times I found pneumatic guns taken apart, or electrical devices with wiring splayed in a colorful tangle, or—fair enough—important blueprints laid out the entire length of the desk.</p>
<p>Right around this time I first saw the F-150. One of the workers had abandoned it by the shop. I put a battery in. That lasted one shift. Then I took an alternator out of another junk truck and, lo and behold, I had my own four wheels. The fan belt screamed. The engine smoked. The brakes worked when they wanted to. It was mine that whole dangerous year.</p>
<p>Then, one day, my luck changed.</p>
<div>
<p>A crate full of chain falls got delivered. It was a glorious crate, made of sanded spruce. I unscrewed some of the planking and built my first Truck Desk prototype.</p>
<div id="attachment_172062"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172062" src="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1-2-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 62.5em) 67vw, 100vw"></p><p id="caption-attachment-172062">Photograph courtesy of Bud Smith.</p></div>
</div>
<p>It was made of three boards cut at twenty-four inches. Light and compact. Sealed with shellac. It slid into the bottom of the steering wheel, one side supported by a curved rebar I welded into a nut that fit exactly in a recess on the driver’s door. The center console supported the other side of the desk. I kept it stored behind the seat. Whenever break time came and the crew drove back to the trailer compound, I stayed parked on the unit and got at least ten extra minutes to write.</p>
<p>Now that I had my Truck Desk, that vehicle was my very own rolling cubicle.</p>
<p>Having that truck reminded me of when I lived on 173rd Street in New York City. Back then I used to drive around endlessly looking for street parking. I would see men and women sitting in their cars. They weren’t leaving, though; they were reading a book or a magazine, smoking cigarettes, playing Sudoku, scribbling love letters. They were the wisest men and women in the entire city, using their vehicles as a kind of office down on the street, a sanctuary where they could do their real work.</p>
<p>After the F-150 was scrapped, I never got a replacement truck. I never found that first Truck Desk either, even when I called the scrapyard.</p>
<p>What I did do, though, was go over to the carpenter’s side of the shop and cut a scaffold plank at twenty-nine inches. This simple plank fits across the armrests of whatever Chevy or Ford pickup the crew has that day. This dramatic redesign of Truck Desk into Truck Plank<sup>®</sup> took all of ten seconds. I didn’t bother with the sticker or shellac.</p>
<p>The years on the job have rolled on. Now editors send me Word documents with comments and questions and tracked changes. I bring my backpack to work with my laptop inside.</p>
<div>
<p>Every morning, when I find out what crew I’m in, I bring that plank with me. I stick it on the dashboard and climb into the driver’s seat. I drive us all out to the job and at break time I take them to the trailer. I clean my hands with pumice wipes and sit alone in whoever’s truck it is that day, pulling the plank off the dashboard and setting it across the armrests. Within a minute or so, I’ve got the laptop out and I’m working. If somebody from the crew is still in the back seat, bandanna over their eyes, snoozing, I do my best to keep extra quiet. And if they begin to snore, I don’t let that bother me at all.</p>

The newsletter recently passed 60,000 subscribers — a number we can’t believe. Huge thanks to everyone who’s chosen to come along as we look into animation from all over the world.</p><p>With that, let’s go!</p><p>Before YouTube, TikTok or social media as a whole, there was Flash. </p><p>It changed the internet. The Shockwave Flash (.SWF) file format allowed animation and even games to run on dial-up connections. It’s all been retired now — but, in its heyday, web designers everywhere used Flash to make sites feel slick. </p><p>There was another group that took to Flash, too: amateur animators. The program was easy to use, and creations with it were easy to share. This caused the first online animation boom. A solo artist with only a home computer could reach millions.</p><p><span>That was a big deal in the United States — but it was, in some ways, a </span><em>bigger</em><span> deal in China. Flash arrived there in the late ‘90s, and it became era-defining. The so-called “Flashers” (闪客) spoke with the bold, new voice of the younger generation. Their work fascinated the press and public alike.</span></p><p><span>“Chinese underground films and rock ‘n’ roll music were once the expression of rebellious passions in the pursuit of ... new cultural dimensions,” scholar Weihua Wu once wrote, “but today these passions are expressed through the channels of Flash.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-1-177710349" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>China’s internet cafes were packed with Flash-watchers by the early 2000s.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-2-177710349" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> And one of their favorites was </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> (2000–2002), a violent action series about stick figures. It was simple, utterly of its time and copied to infinity. Quickly, it outgrew China and became a phenomenon around the world.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif" width="900" height="430" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:430,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3137377,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/177710349?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EK0Y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11380e14-c910-4db9-95fe-eae28db8013d_900x430.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>A snippet from </span><em><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/40932" rel="">Xiao Xiao No. 5</a></em><span>, with Zhu Zhiqiang’s stylish animation on display</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>For people of a certain age, who grew up online, </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> and its clones were part of life. The series isn’t deep and has little to say: it’s just kung fu, firefights, blood and chaos. But it was the height of cool to its (mostly young) audience. It was also a gateway to Flash animation for many.</span></p><p><span>That was true inside </span><em>and</em><span> outside China. </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> was a hit on Western sites like Newgrounds and Albino Blacksheep, which hosted Flash files. It did numbers across Taiwan, Korea, Japan and beyond. These brutal little stick figures — and their moves reminiscent of Hong Kong action movies and </span><em>The Matrix</em><span> — connected worldwide.</span></p><p><span>Still, the series </span><em>is</em><span> Chinese. Its creator, Zhu Zhiqiang, was a man in his mid-20s. And he was an unlikely star.</span></p><p>Zhu wasn’t trained in animation. Before he discovered Flash, he eked out a living as a graphic designer. He wasn’t tech-y, either. Zhu first encountered computers only in 1997, after his move from Jilin City (in the Northeast) to Beijing.</p><p><span>Those were hard years. Zhu had dropped out after junior high, and his first Beijing job paid 800 yuan per month — something like $181 after inflation. He was clocking endless overtime to make up the difference. In fact, for him, getting work </span><em>at all</em><span> could mean telling lies. He landed one job by claiming he’d graduated from a “technical secondary school” but hadn’t brought his diploma.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-3-177710349" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>Still, Zhu had a passion. He loved stick figures. He’d started animating them in 1989, at age 14 — drawing in the corners of book after book, flipping the pages to make his characters move. His inspirations were partly Jackie Chan films, partly his childhood love of </span><em>Dragon Ball</em><span>. </span></p><p>Around the turn of the century, Zhu revisited that passion through software.</p><p><span>A lot was happening when he made his first virtual stick-figure fight, </span><em><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/42801" rel="">Dugu Qiubai</a></em><span>, in April 2000. The Flash scene was just taking off in China through sites like Flash Empire. A few months earlier, a violent Flash called </span><em>Gangster’s Paradise</em><span> got popular, launching a new era of ambition for Flashers.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-4-177710349" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> Its creator became Zhu’s “idol.” </span></p><p><span>Zhu animated </span><em>Dugu Qiubai</em><span> with Corel Painter, but he quickly switched to Flash. He basically started from zero. Not long before, he said, “I had no computer skills, my English was not good, I couldn’t program and my drawing [ability] was average.” He learned Flash mostly alone, using a mouse to create each frame. That became his process. In mid-2000, Zhu made a sequel to </span><em>Dugu Qiubai</em><span> called </span><em>Xiao Xiao No. 2</em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-5-177710349" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>These early projects were popular, and they got Zhu a web design job at Sohu, the Beijing company that hosted his work. As 2000 went on, the press noticed China’s Flash scene, and he was one of the artists they profiled.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-6-177710349" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> But all of this was only a tee-up for </span><em>Xiao Xiao No. 3 </em><span>— the project that made Zhu’s stick figures world-famous.</span></p><p><span>Zhu put seven months into </span><em>Xiao Xiao No. 3</em><span>. It was a hobby project, made in his spare time. The film is simply drawn, and there’s no plot or acting here: just a giant brawl, as a lone stickman takes down a small army. The </span><em>cool</em><span> factor was unprecedented for a Flash animation back then, though. It counted for a lot. There’s something a little mesmerizing even today about the movement of Zhu’s fighters.</span></p><p><span>When </span><em>Xiao Xiao No. 3</em><span> appeared in April 2001, the reaction was immediate, even in the States. Forum users were calling it “mind blowing,” and getting their threads locked because so many people had already posted about it. A Nintendo fansite went off-script to show this “l33t animation” to its readers. Later in the year, it hit the </span><em>Detroit Free Press</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Just when you thought you’d seen the most Flash animations could do online, along comes </em><span>Xiao Xiao No. 3</span><em>. Put simply, it’s a Jackie Chan-style gang-against-one martial arts fight among stick figures. </em></p><p><em>If that sounds silly, the choreography is truly Chan-worthy, with figures running up walls, doing 360-degree kicks and generally showing off the best that martial arts offer. ... Even the cinematography is inspiring: 3D shots, slow-motion and a </em><span>Matrix</span><em>-style camera wraparound that’ll have you asking for more.</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-7-177710349" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p></blockquote><p>Zhu could tell that he’d hit upon something. He’d burned his email address into the video, and viewers used it to contact him. “The part that made the deepest impression,” Zhu recalled, “was on the third day, I received 1,200 emails in one day. There was no junk in them, and 80% of them were not written by Chinese people, but by people from all over the world.”</p><p><span>Even though the internet was small at the time, </span><em>Xiao Xiao No. 3</em><span>’s numbers remain impressive. By late 2001, it had 800,000-plus views on Flash Empire and more than half a million on Newgrounds, not counting the (many) other sites that hosted it. Over the years, the Newgrounds upload alone would climb upward of 5 million. A writer for Flash Empire noted, “I don’t know how the author made such a good work.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-8-177710349" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span></p><p><span>Without warning, Zhu had turned into an early e-celebrity. The </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> series blew up just as Flash was taking over the mainland. Some called 2001 “the year of Chinese Flash,” and one magazine named Zhu the “Internet Person of the Year.”  </span></p><p><span>Hearing all the buzz, Zhu’s father went to an internet cafe to see </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> for himself. He was shocked. It was the same stuff, he realized, that Zhu had drawn in the corners of those books.</span></p><p><span>Zhu soon became a freelance animator — and he started to make money.

In the ‘90s, the Western site Stick Figure Death Theatre hosted exactly what its name implied. But </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>, and its mix of Jackie Chan with Jet Li with </span><em>The Matrix</em><span>, perfected the idea. (Also, Zhu denied having seen the foreign stickman work beforehand — after all, he’d done these himself since age 14.)</span></p><p><span>Either way, it was </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> that made “stick fights” massive online. Clones were rampant — even Stick Figure Death Theatre had them. As one paper reported in 2002:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The Web’s legions of part-time Flash animators have begun producing their own copies of </em><span>Xiao Xiao</span><em> — so many, in fact, that there’s a whole portal dedicated to them. Stick Figure Death Theatre ... has so many stick man knockoffs, you have to wonder why Zhu doesn’t just give up.</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-11-177710349" target="_self" rel="">11</a></span></p></blockquote><p><span>The competition didn’t shrink </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>, though. As Zhu made new episodes through 2001 and 2002 (a shooting game here, a kung fu film there), his work still towered. And he was getting more ambitious. His code was better, and episodes seven and eight are full of 3D camerawork — done with the help of 3ds Max. </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> remained totally style-over-substance, but that style continued to excite the internet.</span></p><p>A question hung over the Flashers, though. Where was all of this headed? </p><p><span>The Flash scene in China was defined by self-expression. As Zhu said, “TV is made for everyone to watch; Flash is made for oneself to watch.” That ethos made the scene bigger and bigger — by 2003, Flash Empire had its own show on television.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-12-177710349" target="_self" rel="">12</a></span><span> Yet these artists needed to make </span><em>money</em><span>, too. Otherwise, it could only be a hobby.</span></p><p><span>Money was the hard problem. Getting hired to do Flash animation wasn’t a guarantee, and the rates for this work weren’t always the best. Zhu noted that “most Flashers have very difficult lives.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-13-177710349" target="_self" rel="">13</a></span><span> There was the problem of ownership, too. A lot of Flashers freely swiped copyrighted sound, music and characters. How could they ever charge?</span></p><p><span>Zhu tried to answer those questions. His “matchstick man,” the pitch-black stick figure that leads </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>, was a recognizable character. Brands wanted to associate with it, and Zhu wanted to profit from it. He kept his work as original as possible, copyrighted his films and, in 2003, submitted a trademark application for the stickman.</span></p><p>By then, though, the Nike ads were already airing abroad.</p><p><span>In early 2003, Nike rolled out the “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-jnFi4eUg8" rel="">Stickman</a><span>” campaign.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-14-177710349" target="_self" rel="">14</a></span><span> It stars an animated stick figure much like the one in </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>, and its flashy moves are, at times, suspiciously similar to Zhu’s ideas. When this campaign hit China, he contacted Nike about it. That went nowhere, so he sued.</span></p><p>Nike was defiant when the story hit the papers. “It is obvious that the plaintiff intended to promote himself and his Flash works by accusing a famous multi-national company,” said one Nike lawyer. </p><p><span>Meanwhile, Zhu said that the Stickman character was so similar to his own, people assumed he’d done the ads himself. Plus, he called stick figures like these a “perfect” fit for sports advertising — which meant trouble for him. “Once Nike uses [these characters], how is anyone going to come to me to make them?” he asked. Already, a publisher had backed out of his book project thanks to Nike’s ads, Zhu claimed.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-15-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-15-177710349" target="_self" rel="">15</a></span></p><p><span>Although Zhu kept releasing a little </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>-branded commercial work, there were no new episodes in 2003. “I’ll resume after the lawsuit is over,” he said.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-16-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-16-177710349" target="_self" rel="">16</a></span><span> The case turned into a yearslong ordeal. He saw its outcome as critical to his future.</span></p><p>In early 2004, a Chinese outlet reported this:</p><blockquote><p><em>Zhu Zhiqiang told reporters that he has already drawn up a bright “career blueprint” for “Matchstick Man,” but the most important thing right now is to win the lawsuit. After all, these bright prospects are all based on the confirmation of the copyright to “Matchstick Man.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Zhu initially won in court. Then the appeals process ran until 2006, when he finally lost. The stick figures were too different, according to the judges, and the imagery was too simple to copyright. Nike was in the clear. Zhu faced thousands of dollars in court fees.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-17-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-17-177710349" target="_self" rel="">17</a></span></p><p><span>After this, he didn’t animate much.

If the roadmap from viral success to solid income is faint today, it didn’t exist at all in 2003. Getting a </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>-sized hit now would, most likely, give someone a shot at starting a business. Zhu had none of the tools necessary to do so.</span></p><p><span>The Stickman campaign was just another layer of the problem. It was the era when a major company could brush off the bad PR that comes with copying a major online artist. Is it believable that </span><em>no one</em><span> involved in the Nike ads had seen </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span>? Not really — it was popular with young people worldwide. Yet Zhu was new media at a time when </span><em>old</em><span> media ruled. What could he do?</span></p><p><span>All that said, the </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> story isn’t one of failure, first and foremost. It has to be emphasized: this series was </span><em>huge</em><span>. It inspired people around the world. That happened in China (Bu Hua, the creator of </span><em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-flash-animation-that-moved-china" rel="">Cat</a></em><span>, was a big </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> fan) and abroad.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-19-177710349" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/when-stick-figures-fought#footnote-19-177710349" target="_self" rel="">19</a></span></p><p><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> is definitely shallow, and its look isn’t adventurous. But that simplicity made it approachable. Any young person could watch it, </span><em>get</em><span> it and copy it. Other defining hits from China’s Flash scene — </span><em><a href="https://archive.org/details/bigfish_202505" rel="">Big Fish &amp; Chinese Flowering Crab Apple</a></em><span>, </span><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLuR6ham6xK9LEB0DehN0rLonuoWvlv1f" rel="">The Black Bird</a></em><span> and so on — could be too complex or specific to China for the world to imitate. </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> wasn’t. Back then, anyone could understand a stick-figure fight.</span></p><p>Zhu may not have reaped the benefits of this series himself, but he absolutely paved the way for the Flash scene — which paved the way for what came next.</p><p><span>Chinese Flash, which </span><em>Xiao Xiao</em><span> helped to pioneer, trained a new generation of animators and filmmakers. Lots of key people started there, including Zhang Ping, whose </span><em>Legend of Hei II</em><span> made a serious dent in the box office this year. Flash artists abroad were no less impacted by the success of Zhu’s work.</span></p><p><span>A couple of years ago, an archivist named Ben Latimore put out an ebook. Since Adobe began the retirement of Flash in 2017, he’s been preserving .SWF files and the history around them. His book is a chronicle of the Flash era, which he sees as a lost golden age.

                    <p>An error fare to Iceland pops up. It's cheap enough to feel like a typo and most likely will be gone in minutes. I'm moderately obsessed with ways to travel on budget, so I keep an eye on these.<br>
Before I click Buy, I need to know (fast!) if it actually works for me: would I need a visa, are there any odd passport requirements, can I quickly sort out the driving permit, would it affect my Schengen 90/180 window, break UK presence tests or accidentally prevent a tax residency I am chasing.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It isn’t one check, it’s a stack of small unfriendly ones, and takes around 20 minutes to process. Some bits are fun, like hunting for a seat upgrade, but mostly it’s counting midnights and expiry dates so a cheap weekend doesn’t become an expensive lesson.</p>
<p>I've been doing this dance for a decade now. In 2015 I made a spreadsheet for a US visa application that wanted ten years of travel history, down to the day. The spreadsheet grew: UK work visa, Indefinite Leave to Remain and citizenship applications, Canadian work permits. Any government form that asked "where have you been?" got its answer from the same battered CSV. It worked well enough, in the sense that I was never detained.</p>
<p>It also made me think that this was a solvable problem I was solving badly. I built a ledger to answer “where was I on 15 March 2023?” Instead, I ran simulations to check, “if I book this, what breaks later?”</p>
<p>The only question is whether the computer can answer all of faster than I do, and leave December, the next border control, and the end of the tax year blissfully uneventful.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-trip-compile%3F">Does this trip compile? <a href="#does-this-trip-compile%3F">¶</a></h2>
<p>That twenty-minute panic before buying a flight comes from one basic problem: none of the systems that judge you will tell you your state.</p>
<p>Schengen is running one check. The UK is running another. Tax residency is running a third. Your passport is running its own quiet clock in the background. None of them explain themselves, and none of them agree on what “a day” even is.</p>
<p>Schengen cares about presence across rolling windows. The UK counts how many midnights you were physically in the country in a tax year that, for historical reasons <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, starts on 6 April out of all options. Some countries track how many days you’ve spent in certain places and change the medical paperwork they expect from you once you cross a threshold. Meanwhile your passport might fail you with its expiry date, validity rules that may apply on arrival or departure depending on routing, and a finite number of blank facing pages that some countries require.</p>
<p>None of that is easily exposed. The officer at the desk can see it but you can’t. That's parsing the <em>State</em>—both kinds. The government's view of you, and the state machine that tracks it.</p>
<h3 id="the-bureaucratic-edge-cases">The bureaucratic edge cases <a href="#the-bureaucratic-edge-cases">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rules aren't just complex—they're occasionally specific in ways that make you regret leaving the house in the first place.</p>
<p>To apply for British citizenship, you need to prove you were physically in the UK on your application date but five years ago. Not approximately five years, not that week—that exact day when you press "submit" on the form minus five years. Miss it by 24 hours and your application is reject after months of waiting, and you have to pay a hefty fee to re-apply.</p>
<p>Transiting through a UK airport? Leaving the terminal doesn't count as presence unless you do something "unrelated to your travel"—buy a sausage roll at Greggs, see a play in West End, meet a friend. The guidance doesn't even specify a minimum spend.</p>
<figure>
  <p><img src="https://drobinin.com/assets/curl-theatre_test.png" width="500" alt="Quote from gov.uk explaining how tax residency on transit is counted">
  </p>
  <figcaption>RFIG20730, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/residence-and-fig-regime-manual/rfig20730">see on gov.uk</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Morocco runs on UTC+1 most of the year but switches to UTC during Ramadan to shorten the fasting day. Which means "days spent in Morocco" depends on your timezone database version and whether you remembered to update it.</p>
<p>It would be alright with a single source of truth, but all these facts are scattered across (semi)official websites and PDFs, and you're supposed to figure it out yourself.</p>
<p>So the job isn't "log trips" (I already did that for ten years in a spreadsheet). The job is: given what I've already done and what I'm about to do, does this plan quietly break anything, and if so, where, and by how much.</p>
<p>"You're at 56 days because Amsterdam contributed 12, Prague 3, Barcelona 10, Iceland would add a month, and February doesn't count anymore" is something I can trust, argue with, or fix. "You're fine" isn't.</p>
<p>That's where this stops being a spreadsheet and starts being a linter. Apparently I want the compiler warning before I press Buy.</p>
<h2 id="counting-the-right-midnight">Counting the right midnight <a href="#counting-the-right-midnight">¶</a></h2>
<p>If I want a compiler warning I trust, the compiler has to agree with the officer about what a day is.</p>
<p>For the past five years I've been working on an app for people with epilepsy, managing timezones, medication reminders, and edge cases. We juggled multiple sources of truth and multiple storage styles (some records in UTC, some in local time with timezones stored separately—historical reasons, obviously).</p>
<p>This time, I tried to learn from that: facts are stored as instants, reasoning happens in local days of the jurisdiction that cares.</p>
<figure>
  <p><img src="https://drobinin.com/assets/curl-sensible_flight.png" width="500" alt="A very sensible flight itinerary with a few stops (DUB → EWR → MEX → LHR → TFS)">
  </p>
  <figcaption>DUB → EWR → MEX → LHR → TFS is a decent way to get from Dublin to Tenerife, don't @ me</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Take this routing: depart Dublin morning of November the 17th, brief Newark layover, a longer one in Mexico City, 23-hour Heathrow stop, then Tenerife. Ask five immigration systems "how many tax residency days?" and you get five answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ireland: zero (under 30 days/year threshold).</li>
<li>US: zero (foreign-to-foreign transit under 24 hours).</li>
<li>Mexico: two (you cross midnight twice).</li>
<li>UK: zero (even though you cross midnight once), unless you went landside for non-travel reasons, then one.</li>
<li>Schengen: one (entry day counts, exit day will count too, even if both are only for 15 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each stop has same or similar conditions, but different state machines are asking different questions. I pin the timezone database version that produced each result, and when rules or clocks shift, I recompute so I could show both answers if needed. Yesterday should stay reproducible even when tomorrow disagrees.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="parsing-the-state">Parsing the State <a href="#parsing-the-state">¶</a></h2>
<p>In other words, the linter is meant to answer the same question in various disguises: "what happens if I do this?"</p>
<p>Can I book Christmas in the Alps with three summer weekends planned in Europe? Does it matter if I leave UK before the tax year ends? What passport should I travel on? Does anything expire between booking and boarding?</p>
<p>Every question has the same shape: simulate forward, find what breaks, decide if you care. The goal isn't to convince border officers—it's to not make mistakes they'd catch. Trips get assembled from whatever I can verify later: geotagged photos, background location, manual entries. A resolver turns that into "present on this local day" and keeps track of why.</p>
<p>I don't hardcode rules, I ship interpretations instead: each jurisdiction has a small versioned blob that says what counts, how the window is measured, where that reading came from.</p>
<p>The paperwork gets the same treatment because documents are state machines too. A passport isn’t just means of identity; it has constraints and timers. Some requirements, like six months validity are legacy and usually exist to keep deportations possible without issuing emergency documents, but still need to be checked. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

  </p>
</figure>
<p>Before I buy anything the linter should tell me that I don't have the correct flavour of IDP (and man, getting those in Scotland since they delegated it from Post Offices to corner shops is tough), that a Dubai connection flips a “valid on arrival” buffer into “invalid on departure”. Quiet warnings, early enough to change dates or renew the right booklet, and clear enough that I won't have to improvise at a counter.</p>
<p>If the world changes—new examples, revised guidance, a delayed system finally launches—I don’t rewrite history. I version the assumption, keep both answers recorded, and move on.</p>
<p>Keeping all those rules up-to-date is hard, so rather than maintaining rules for every country, I parse a few databases, then let users configure their own tracking goals. A user emailed about Cyprus's fast-tracked tax residency scheme; another pointed out I'd missed a few countries entirely. The app gets better as people use it, which feels more honest than pretending to be a global authority on 195 countries' immigration rules.</p>
<h2 id="making-things-public">Making things public <a href="#making-things-public">¶</a></h2>
<p>The app is local by default. Calculations happen on-device, and if you're in airplane mode, it still works. Network is always the bottleneck, and I'm the person who <a href="https://drobinin.com/posts/how-i-accidentally-became-puregyms-unofficial-apple-wallet-developer/">spent a weekend reverse-engineering gym entry to save 44 seconds</a>. I'm not adding server round-trips when you're standing at a gate.</p>
<p>Being local also means no liability. Personal immigration history is exactly the kind of data governments might want. Keeping it off my servers means nobody can demand I hand it over. Some friends asked about cloud sync: I keep saying no. Not because sync is hard—it is, though surely Claude Code can do that for me <sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>—but because the moment you add a server you add retention policies, jurisdiction questions, and a magnet for legal demands. If you want it on another device, export a file and move it yourself like the ancestors did it.</p>
<p>The first version just counted Schengen days, then I added the UK's midnight arithmetic because I needed it for my own calculations. Then documents with their expiry rules because I was tired of manually looking them up. Then the what-if layer because adding and deleting trips to see impact felt like manually diffing state. Then visa requirements and IDP rules: none of this was planned, it accumulated from use, the same way <a href="https://drobinin.com/posts/designing-software-for-things-that-rot/">my fermentation tracker grew from "can I eat this?" to HACCP compliance documents</a>.</p>
<p>I shipped it because keeping it private felt unfinished, and because I'd like fewer people spending twenty minutes researching whether a £62 return flight will cause problems six months later.</p>

  </p>
</figure>
<p>That Iceland error fare? I bought it. The app told me I wouldn't need an IDP, that the trip wouldn't push me over any Schengen threshold, that I'd leave with 34 days of margin in my 90/180 window, and—importantly—that booking it would mean I'd stop being a UK tax resident given my upcoming Canada move. Useful things to know before clicking purchase. The officer at Keflavík looked at his screen, agreed with his systems, and waved me through.</p>
<p>I called the app Residency and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/residency-days-tracker/id6749048224">you can get it here</a>. No subscriptions, costs less than an airport martini, and you'll likely regret it less a few hours later.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>You can't <code>cURL</code> a border. But you can track your own state carefully enough that when the governments know the answer, so do you.</p>

                                        <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Until last week, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the Israeli army’s top lawyer.

Instead, it triggered fierce criticism from Israel’s hard-line political leaders. After Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned under pressure last week, her critics continued to heave personal insults.</p>
    
<p>She left a cryptic note for her family and abandoned her car near a beach. That led to fears she had taken her own life and prompted an intensive search that included the use of military drones.</p>



<p>She was found alive at the beach Sunday night, at which point more vitriol against her was unleashed.</p><p>“We can resume the lynch,” right-wing TV personality Yinon Magal, an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, posted on X with a winking-face emoji.</p>
    
    
    
<p>After it was revealed that one of Tomer-Yerushalmi’s phones had disappeared, right-wing politicians and commentators began to accuse her of staging a suicide attempt as a way to destroy potential evidence.</p><p>The extraordinary episode shows two years of devastating war have done little to heal a country that was deeply divided even before Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It also makes Tomer-Yerushalmi the latest in a long line of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-01-21-2025-f836d6eb2d939c3c4bd241c79cad1ee2">top security officials</a></span> who have either left office or been forced out, most of them to be replaced by people considered loyal to Netanyahu and his hardline government.</p>
    
<h2>Anger over leak distracts from severe abuse at heart of case</h2><p>At a court hearing Monday, the judge said Tomer-Yerushalmi’s detention would be extended until Wednesday on suspicion of committing fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. While the investigation into her actions continues, she is being held at a women’s prison in central Israel.</p><p>Israeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested in connection with the leak investigation. The prime minister’s office has refused to comment on Solomesh’s arrest. </p><p>The fury over the leaked video reveals the depth of polarization in Israel — and at least for the moment, keeps the media and the public focused on the leak and not the allegations of abuse. </p>
    
<p>The assault occurred on July 5, 2024, at the Sde Teiman military prison, according to the indictment against the accused soldiers. The AP has investigated allegations <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://Ten%20soldiers%20were%20initially%20arrested,%20but%20only%20five%20were%20indicted,%20and%20the%20court%20case%20is%20ongoing.%20The%20indictment%20said%20the%20five%20soldiers%20assaulted%20him%20and%20sodomized%20him%20with%20a%20knife,%20causing%20multiple%20injuries.%20A%20medical%20staffer%20familiar%20with%20the%20case%20who%20requested%20anonymity%20for%20fear%20for%20his%20own%20safety%20said%20the%20detainee%20arrived%20to%20the%20civilian%20hospital%20in%20life-threatening%20condition%20with%20blunt%20trauma%20to%20the%20abdomen%20and%20the%20chest%20and%20rib%20fractures." target="_blank" rel="noopener">of inhumane treatment and abuse</a></span> at Sde Teiman that predate those in the surveillance video. </p><div data-align-center="">

The indictment said the soldiers assaulted the Palestinian prisoner and sodomized him with a knife, causing multiple injuries.</p><p>A medical staffer familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety said the detainee arrived at a civilian hospital in life-threatening condition with blunt trauma to the abdomen and the chest and fractured ribs.</p><p>He said the detainee underwent surgery for a perforated rectum and was released back to Sde Teiman days later. The staffer said it was the most extreme abuse case he was familiar with from Sde Teiman.</p><p>When military police came to Sde Teiman in July to detain the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-29-07-2024-844aac9711be878604afca5c53abc9f2">soldiers</a></span> suspected of abuse, they scuffled with protesters opposed to the arrests. Later, hundreds of violent protesters <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-29-07-2024-844aac9711be878604afca5c53abc9f2">broke into the detention center.</a></span></p>
    
<p>In her resignation letter, Tomer-Yerushalmi wrote that she had exposed evidence of the abuse to counter the idea that the military was unfairly targeting its own soldiers. That idea was creating a danger to the military’s law enforcement, she said, citing the break-in.</p><p>She wrote that the military had a “duty to investigate when there is reasonable suspicion of violence against a detainee.</p><p>“Unfortunately, this basic understanding — that there are actions which must never be taken even against the vilest of detainees — no longer convinces everyone,” she wrote.</p><p>The Palestinian detainee who was the subject of the alleged abuse in the video was released back to Gaza last month as part of an exchange between living hostages and Palestinian prisoners, according to documents from the military prosecutor’s office obtained by the AP. </p><p>The case is still pending before the military court.</p>
    
<h2>A web of legal issues</h2><p>Three separate legal issues must be sorted out as part of Israel’s investigation into what happened at Sde Teiman, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute.</p><p>The first relates to evidence that Israeli soldiers abused Palestinian detainees while they were in detention. The second is whether Israeli civilians, including members of parliament, tried to disrupt the investigation by breaking into the military base where the soldiers accused of the actions were being held. The third is whether Tomer-Yerushalmi allegedly committed a host of offenses, including fraud, to undermine the investigation into how the surveillance video was leaked to the media.</p><p>The intense rhetoric over the past few days is reminiscent of what it was like in Israel immediately before the Oct. 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza, Plesner said. At the time, the public was deeply divided over Netanyahu’s push to overhaul the judiciary.</p><p>The concern for a few hours Sunday night about Tomer-Yerushalmi’s fate should serve as a “stop sign” to the Israeli public — and especially to commentators who derided her personally, Plesner said.</p><p>“It was very sad to see how the internal discourse can bring about such potentially tragic outcome on a personal level,” Plesner said.</p><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>The diode might be the most neglected component in the electronics curriculum today. Pages upon pages have been written about the mechanics of resistors, capacitors, and inductors; on this blog alone, we covered the components’ </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/primer-core-concepts-in-electronic" rel="">fundamental equations</a><span>, the model of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/impedance-part-2-why-do-lcr-meters" rel="">complex impedance</a><span>, the behavior of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-101-of-analog-signal-filtering" rel="">R-C filters</a><span>, and more. As for semiconductors, the diode’s more useful sibling — the transistor — hogs the limelight.</span></p><p>The diode is given neither the mathematical rigor of linear circuits nor the red-carpet treatment of the transistor. To the extent that the component is marveled at all, it’s usually in the context of exotic inventions such as the Gunn diode or the tunnel diode — both of which are almost never encountered in real life.</p><p>Today, let’s pay the “normal” diode a small tribute.</p><p><em><span>If you’re rusty on concepts such as voltage, current, or impedance, I suggest reviewing </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/primer-core-concepts-in-electronic" rel="">this article</a><span> first.</span></em></p><p><span>In an earlier post about the </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/how-do-transistors-work-anyway" rel="">physics of semiconductors</a><span>, I noted that pure silicon is a poor conductor of electricity. This is because the material lacks long-lived, mobile charge carriers. Some conduction is still possible due to the short-lived thermal excitation of valence electrons that briefly pop into a higher-energy state, but these electrons can’t travel far before returning to a lower-energy level, so the effect is more or less negligible.</span></p><p>The conductivity of the material is improved by the addition of dopants. Some dopants contribute long-lived electrons that occupy higher energy levels with no lower-energy vacancies to return to; this is what’s called an n-type semiconductor. Other additives create easily-accessible valence band vacancies (“holes”); in such a p-type material, lower-energy electrons can slither around from atom to atom without needing to be knocked into a higher-energy state.</p><p>When an n-type material is brought into contact with a p-type semiconductor, higher-energy electrons from the n-side randomly diffuse to the p-side and then promptly fall into the abundant lower-energy holes. This produces a thermodynamic equilibrium with an internal electric field across the junction. There is a positive charge on the n-side and a negative charge on the p-side:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png" width="1456" height="832" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:832,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:348782,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/177769958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPuz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e699340-22a2-41a1-94dc-5fe209da5360_2000x1143.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A simple illustration of a p-n junction.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The field pushes any mobile electrons that wander into the depletion region back to the n-side. The result is a thin, poorly conductive depletion region at the boundary.</p><p>The field of a p-n junction can be offset by an externally-applied voltage; if we make the p-side sufficiently more positive than the n-side, some current will flow. In the case of silicon, the junction becomes markedly conductive when the forward voltage reaches about 600 mV, although microamp-range currents will be flowing sooner than that.</p><p>A conventional diode is just a p-n junction. The component can be thought of as a rudimentary voltage-controlled gate: when the voltage is below a certain threshold, it presents itself as a very high resistance — typically in excess of 100 kΩ — so virtually no current can flow. When the threshold is cleared, the diode admits current that’s roughly proportional to the “excess” applied voltage, an ohmic behavior that’s a consequence of the resistance of the material itself:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:68374,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/177769958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LmhS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49b8118d-9fef-4d92-bffd-3d6d9117a8cc_2344x1563.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>The plot of voltage to current for a forward-biased 1N4148 diode.

If the diode is reverse-biased — that is, if the p-side is more negative than the n-side — the component notionally remains nonconductive. Well… up to a point.</span></p><p>One of the possible reverse-bias scenarios is that if the reverse voltage becomes high enough, the electric field can accelerate the odd charge carrier in the depletion region to a point where the particle knocks other electrons into conduction band, producing an avalanche-like effect.

The diode remains non-conductive under normal operating conditions, but experiences electrical breakdown — and thus temporarily starts conducting — when the input voltage exceeds a safe limit. In effect, the diode acts as a crowbar that dissipates energy and protects more delicate components downstream. Diodes designed for this purpose are often marketed as </span><em>transient voltage suppressors</em><span> (TVS) and are particularly important for protecting semiconductors against static discharge. Another application is the suppression of voltage spikes that happen when we abruptly cut the current supplied to motors and other inductive loads.</span></p><p><span>A single diode can only be used to protect inputs where the input signal has a defined polarity – that is, where one rail is always more positive than the other. To provide overvoltage protection for AC signals with alternating polarity, we instead rely a two-diode arrangement shown on the right in the illustration above. This arrangement of components is also available in a single package known as a </span><em>bidirectional TVS</em><span>. </span></p><p>In the latter circuit, regardless of the polarity of the applied voltage, the “crowbar” path always consists of a forward-biased diode in series with a reverse-biased one. It follows that positive and negative conduction thresholds are the same: they’re equal to the diode’s reverse-bias breakdown voltage, plus roughly 600 mV.</p><p>Yet another protection technique is shown in the bottom panel. A regular forward-biased diode with a high reverse breakdown voltage is placed in series with the supply; this arrangement prevents damage to sensitive components if the polarity of the supply is accidentally reversed, for example if the batteries are inserted the wrong way. The trade-off is the inevitable voltage drop across the p-n junction, along with resistive heating if the current is high, so a transistor-based solution is typically preferred, especially in low-voltage circuits.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, most diodes are designed to withstand very high reverse-bias voltages, often in excess of -100 V; that said, a special category of products — Zener diodes — is designed to start conducting earlier than that.</p><p>When forward-biased, such a diode behaves the same as its conventional counterpart, becoming markedly conductive around 600 mV. When reverse-biased, it starts conducting at a low voltage of the manufacturer’s choice, with common low-voltage options ranging from 1.8 V to 30 V.</p><p>The V-I plots shown earlier in the article tell us that once reverse breakdown begins, a small change in the applied voltage can produce a comparatively large swing in the current flowing through. We can also look at it another way: if the current through the diode is limited in some way, fluctuations in that current will have a comparatively minor effect on the voltage that develops across the diode’s terminals.</p><p>This observation lends itself to the use of diodes as voltage references. We take an unregulated power supply — for example, a battery — and in the simplest variant, use a resistor to roughly limit the current flowing through the diode. Depending on the voltage you want, you can use one or more forward-biased diodes, a Zener diode, or some combination thereof.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png" width="1075" height="695" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:695,&quot;width&quot;:1075,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:48268,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/177769958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NHvW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c32a55-c248-4eb1-9a55-140c64e4c647_1075x695.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A simple diode-based voltage reference.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>From Ohm’s law, the current admitted by the resistor will change linearly with the supply voltage (I = V/R), but these current fluctuations affect the diode voltage to a much lower extent.

half-cycle, diodes D1 and D2 are initially forward-biased; this allows the capacitor to charge to the AC peak voltage (minus the summed voltage drop of two diodes). During the negative half-cycle, diodes D3 and D4 become forward-biased, which connects the output B to the upper supply terminal. Meanwhile, the bottom supply terminal, which is currently at a higher voltage, is connected to point A. This allows the capacitor to continue charging in the same polarity as before.</p><p>A simulation of the process is shown below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png" width="1456" height="970" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:123337,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/177769958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uFAm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F059f744e-57d4-4215-a7de-2c9ebe78f67f_2813x1875.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>The behavior of a full-wave rectifier.

To elaborate: for energy to be stored in a capacitor, there must be a symmetry in the motion of charges flowing onto and off the plates. This way, the resulting electrostatic fields – increasingly positive on one plate and increasingly negative on another – largely cancel out, allowing a non-trivial charge to be moved with the help of a modest voltage.</span></p><p><span>If one of the capacitor’s is left floating, the device can’t be charged or discharged; instead, its previous charge state persists as a voltage across its terminals. If we take a capacitor charged to 1 V and connect one of its legs to a 10 V supply, the other leg will read 11 V in reference to the ground. If we connect it to a -5 V supply, we’ll get a reading of -4 V. It’s no different from putting a battery in series with another voltage source. In our circuit, the initial </span><em><span>V</span><sub>cap</sub></em><span> = 0 V, so in the positive half-cycle, the capacitor adds nothing, and the voltage on the output leg A simply follows the input waveform.</span></p><p><span>In the following negative half-cycle, once the voltage at point A reaches about -600 mV, the diode starts to conduct (top right). This clamps the voltage at point A while simultaneously allowing the capacitor to charge so that its left terminal becomes negative in relation to the right terminal. If we measure </span><em><span>V</span><sub>cap</sub></em><span> left to right, the resulting voltage is positive and is equal to the peak amplitude of the supply signal (minus the diode voltage drop).</span></p><p><span>In the subsequent positive cycle, the diode becomes reverse-biased again, so the capacitor must hold its previous charge; this means that </span><em><span>V</span><sub>cap</sub></em><span> remains unchanged and that the voltage at point A is necessarily offset from the input waveform by that amount. If the input waveform runs -</span><em><span>V</span><sub>peak</sub></em><span> to +</span><em><span>V</span><sub>peak</sub></em><span>, the output will be now moving from roughly -600 mV to </span><em><span>V</span><sub>peak </sub></em><span>· 2 – 600 mV.</span></p><p>The role of the optional load resistor is that it controls the circuit’s ability to respond to gradual shifts in signal amplitude. Without it, the circuit would theoretically be stuck forever at a voltage offset dictated by the largest encountered single-cycle swing in the input waveform. With a resistor, the capacitor can discharge over time, so the offset can change if the envelope of the waveform changes in some way.</p><p>In practice, the diode’s leakage current and the capacitor’s self-discharge rate are typically enough to make the circuit behave reasonably even without an output resistance. If you wish to play around with this layout, I recommend using a 10-100 µF capacitor and either skipping the resistor or using a large one (1 MΩ).</p><p><span>An OR gate is a circuit with two or more inputs that produces a positive voltage when any of the inputs is positive. An AND gate, in contrast, outputs a positive signal only if </span><em>all </em><span>the inputs are positive. Many readers are probably familiar with the application of this concept in computing, but more simply: a practical application of an OR gate might be a circuit that raises alarm if any of the door or window sensors are triggered. An application of an AND gate might be a system that illuminates a “PARKING FULL” sign when all the spots are occupied.</span></p><p>There are simple ways to implement this logic with diodes:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png" width="1456" height="548" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:548,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:155984,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/177769958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uCXe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a9b0fb9-4a3d-4768-90f1-601f4f94e554_1885x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Logic pseudo-gates constructed with diodes.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the case of an OR circuit (left), if the positive supply rail is connected to any of the input terminals, this forward-biases the corresponding diode and causes a current to flow through a resistor.

<h2 id="a-friendly-tour-of-process-memory-on-linux">A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux</h2>

<p>You run a program. It reads and writes addresses as if a giant, continuous slab of memory had been waiting there all along. It didn’t. Linux builds that illusion on the fly, one page at a time. This is a walk through what your process actually owns, what happens on the first touch of a byte, how protections and huge pages fit in, how to see the truth from <code>/proc</code>, and why modern kernels do a little extra dance to defend against <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown</a>.</p>

<p>Note: This tour targets Linux on x86‑64, other architectures differ in details (page sizes, cache rules), but the ideas carry over.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The picture below is a quick introduction. It is a simple map you can keep in mind as you read.</p>

<p>Physical RAM is the real memory. It is a bunch of frames scattered around.
The virtual view is the clean line your program sees. It does not match the real layout.
The page table is a list. It tells which spot on the virtual line points to which frame in RAM.
Disk is extra space the system can use when RAM is full.</p>

<p>Here is how it plays out.
When you read or write, the CPU looks in the page table. If there is an entry it goes to that frame. If there is no entry you get a page fault. The system then fills a frame and adds the entry, or it stops you with an error. We will explain faults later.</p>

<p>When RAM is tight the system makes room. It moves pages you have not used in a while to disk, or drops file pages it can load again. If you touch one of those later it brings it back.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.0xkato.xyz/assets/virtual-momory-show-case.png" alt="Markdown Image"></p>

<p>Tiny explainers appear throughout so anyone can follow along, regardless of background.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>/proc</code></strong><br>
<code>/proc</code> is a virtual filesystem the kernel builds in memory. It exposes process and kernel state as files. You can read them with normal tools like <code>cat</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-floor-plan-you-never-see">The floor plan you never see</h2>

<p>Inside the kernel, your process owns one object that represents its whole address space. Think of it as a floor plan. Each room on that plan is a virtual memory area (VMA) a contiguous range with the same permissions (read, write, execute) and the same kind of backing (anonymous memory or a file).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: VMA</strong><br>
A VMA is a continuous virtual address range with one set of rights and one kind of backing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the plan sit the page tables that the hardware reads to translate your virtual addresses to real page frames.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: page tables and PTE</strong><br>
Page tables are lookup structures the CPU walks to translate addresses. A page table entry (PTE) maps one virtual page to one physical page and holds bits like present and writable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All threads in the process share the same plan. When the scheduler runs you, the CPU is pointed at your page tables, so pointer dereferences don’t need a syscall once a mapping exists, the hardware does the translation on its own.</p>

<p>You change the plan in three ways: <code>mmap</code> draws a room, <code>mprotect</code> changes the sign on its door (R/W/X), and <code>munmap</code> tears it down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>mmap</code></strong><br>
<code>mmap</code> reserves a virtual range with given permissions and a backing source.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: <code>mprotect</code></strong><br>
<code>mprotect</code> changes the permissions on an existing range.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: <code>munmap</code></strong><br>
<code>munmap</code> removes a mapping from the address space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything else (creating pages, reading file data, swapping) happens lazily when you touch memory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: page</strong><br>
Hardware manages memory in fixed chunks called pages. On many x86‑64 machines a base page is 4 KiB. Bigger pages exist at 2 MiB and 1 GiB.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-quick-glance-at-your-own-house">A quick glance at your own house</h2>

<p>Run:<br>
<code>cat /proc/self/maps | sed -n '1,80p'</code></p>

<p>You’ll see your main binary’s segments (code, data, bss), the heap, anonymous mappings (allocators use these for big chunks), shared libraries, and thread stacks near the top.</p>

<p>You’ll typically also see two small regions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[vdso]</code>: a tiny shared object the kernel maps in so a few calls like <code>gettimeofday</code> can run without a kernel trap.</li>
  <li><code>[vvar]</code>: read‑only data those helpers use.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>vdso</code> and <code>vvar</code></strong><br>
<code>vdso</code> is code the kernel maps into your process to make some syscalls fast. <code>vvar</code> holds data that code reads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re why asking the time is fast.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mmap-without-the-fog"><code>mmap</code>, without the fog</h2>

<p>When you call <code>mmap</code>, you’re not “allocating memory” so much as drawing a promise on the floor plan. You say give me a range of addresses with these rights and back it by this file plus offset or by anonymous memory. Linux picks an address, makes sure it doesn’t collide, adjusts VMAs so each remains uniform, and records the promise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: ASLR</strong><br>
Address Space Layout Randomization places mappings at randomized locations to make exploits harder.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: anonymous vs file mapping</strong><br>
Anonymous memory is not tied to a file and starts as zeros. File mappings mirror file contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does not allocate pages yet. That comes later at first touch.</p>

<p>Two gotchas come up over and over:</p>
<ul>
  <li>File mappings: <code>offset</code> must be page aligned or <code>mmap</code> returns <code>EINVAL</code>.</li>
  <li>Mapping past end of file is allowed, but touching beyond the true end raises <code>SIGBUS</code>. The VMA exists, the data does not.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> and <code>MAP_SHARED</code></strong><br>
<code>MAP_SHARED</code> means writes go back to the file and are visible to others that share it. <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> means you see the file but writes go to private copy‑on‑write pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anonymous mappings start life as zeroes. File mappings mirror the file. If the file ends mid page the tail of that last page reads as zeros but still belongs to the file.</p>

<p><code>MAP_FIXED</code> means exactly here and it overwrites anything already mapped at that address. Prefer <code>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</code> to fail instead of clobbering. Without either flag your <code>addr</code> is just a hint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</code></strong><br>
Ask for an exact address and fail if something is already there. Safer than overwriting.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-first-touch">The first touch</h2>

<p>Imagine <code>*p = 42;</code> to a fresh mapping. The CPU tries to translate the address. It finds no entry so it raises a page fault that includes the address and an error code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: page fault</strong><br>
A page fault is the CPU asking the kernel to handle a missing or illegal translation for an address.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kernel’s handler runs on your behalf and asks three questions in this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is the address inside any VMA<br>
If not you are poking a hole in the plan → <code>SIGSEGV</code>.</li>
  <li>Do the rights allow this access<br>
Write to a read only page or execute from non exec → <code>SIGSEGV</code>.</li>
  <li>If it is valid but missing make it real<br>
For an anonymous mapping the kernel allocates a zero filled physical page, wires a page table entry with your requested permissions, and returns to your instruction. For a file mapping it first checks the page cache. If the data is not in RAM it reads from storage, then installs the translation and retries your instruction. Your store lands. You keep going.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: page cache</strong><br>
The page cache is the kernel’s cache of file data in RAM. File mappings read and write through it.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: zero page</strong><br>
Some reads from fresh anonymous memory can be satisfied by a shared read only page of zeros. A private page is created on the first write.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People count these faults:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A minor fault means the data was already in RAM and only the translation was missing.</li>
  <li>A major fault means the kernel had to wait for I/O which is expensive.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: stack guard</strong><br>
User stacks have a guard page. Touching just below the current stack can grow it. Touching far below looks like a bug and gets a <code>SIGSEGV</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This same lazy first touch explains how memory is shared after <code>fork()</code> and how <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> works. The next section shows that path.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="copy-on-write-with-fork-and-map_private">Copy on write with <code>fork()</code> and <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code></h2>

<p>Why this is here. We just talked about first touch. The same rule explains why pages do not copy on <code>fork</code> and why <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> does not change the file.</p>

<p><code>fork</code> does not duplicate pages. The child points at the same physical pages as the parent. The kernel flips those pages to read only for both. The first write hits a copy on write fault. The kernel allocates a new page, copies the bytes, updates the writer’s page table entry to the new page with write permission, and returns. Reads still share the original page. That is why RSS stays flat after <code>fork</code> until you write.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: RSS</strong><br>
Resident Set Size is how many pages of this process are currently in RAM.
<strong>Tiny explainer: copy on write</strong><br>
Share the same page for reads. Make a private copy only when a write happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> uses the same idea. You read file data through the page cache. When you write, the kernel gives you a private page. The file stays unchanged.</p>

<p>Things you will also run into:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>fork</code> then <code>execve</code>. The child replaces its whole address space soon after. That avoids most CoW work.</li>
  <li><code>vfork</code>. The child runs in the parent’s address space until it calls <code>exec</code> or <code>_exit</code>. The parent waits. Do not touch memory in the child.</li>
  <li><code>clone</code> with <code>CLONE_VM</code>. This makes a thread. One address space. No copy.</li>
  <li><code>MAP_SHARED</code>. Writes go to the shared page and to the file or shmem. No CoW.</li>
  <li><code>MADV_DONTFORK</code>. Leave this mapping out of the child.</li>
  <li><code>MADV_WIPEONFORK</code>. The child sees zeros for this mapping.</li>
  <li>Transparent huge pages. Breaking CoW on a huge page may split it first. Small extra cost.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="changing-rights-and-the-little-pause-you-feel">Changing rights, and the little pause you feel</h2>

<p>Why you care. JITs and loaders flip a region from writable to executable after codegen which is W^X. That flip is not free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: W^X</strong><br>
Write xor Execute is a policy. A page is never writable and executable at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>mprotect(addr, len, prot)</code> changes permissions. Internally the kernel may split VMAs so each remains uniform, edits the page table entries for the range, and then does one more necessary thing. It invalidates old translations from the CPU’s small cache of address translations which is the TLB. That invalidation is the small pause you sometimes feel when a JIT flips RW to RX or back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: TLB</strong><br>
The Translation Lookaside Buffer caches recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables every time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most systems enforce W^X. A page should not be writable and executable at the same time. JITs keep to that by flipping after codegen or by keeping two virtual mappings of the same memory so no single mapping is both.</p>

<p>Remember there are two layers of permission checks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Filesystem or mount policy like <code>noexec</code></li>
  <li>Page permissions like <code>PROT_EXEC</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Either layer can block execution.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="seeing-whats-really-mapped">Seeing what’s really mapped</h2>

<p>For everyday questions the friendly view is enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code> shapes: addresses, rights, file names</li>
  <li><code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/smaps</code> and <code>smaps_rollup</code> add per region accounting like how much is resident which is RSS, private vs shared, and whether huge pages were used like <code>AnonHugePages</code> and <code>FilePmdMapped</code></li>
</ul>

<p>When you need truth at the per page level Linux exposes sharper tools.</p>

<p><code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/pagemap</code> has one 64 bit entry per virtual page. It tells you whether a page is present, swapped, soft dirty, exclusively mapped with caveats for huge pages, whether it is write protected via userfaultfd, or part of a guard region. It can also reveal the page frame number which is PFN but modern kernels hide PFNs from unprivileged users. You need the right capability or root.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: PFN</strong><br>
Page Frame Number is the physical page index used inside the kernel.
<strong>Tiny explainer: userfaultfd</strong><br>
A file descriptor that lets a userspace thread handle faults and write protect events for a range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>/proc/kpagecount</code> is indexed by PFN and tells you how many mappings point at a given physical page.</p>

<p><code>/proc/kpageflags</code> is also indexed by PFN and tells you what kind of page it is and what is happening to it like anonymous or file backed, part of a transparent huge page, in the LRU, dirty, under writeback, a page table page, or the shared zero page.</p>

<h3 id="common-wrinkles">Common wrinkles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sparse files. To tell hole vs data, combine <code>mincore()</code> which says resident or not with <code>lseek(..., SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)</code> on the backing file.</li>
  <li>Shared memory and swap. Shared and shmem pages may be non present at the PTE level while still logically allocated. Expect swap entries and non present PTEs.</li>
  <li>Privileges. Modern kernels restrict PFN and some flag visibility to privileged users for security.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>mincore</code></strong><br>
<code>mincore</code> tells you which pages of a mapping are in RAM.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: <code>SEEK_DATA</code> and <code>SEEK_HOLE</code></strong><br>
File offsets that let you skip to the next data chunk or the next hole in a sparse file.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: soft dirty vs written</strong><br>
Soft dirty marks pages dirtied by userland but it can get lost across swaps or VMA merges. Newer kernels offer an ioctl named <code>PAGEMAP_SCAN</code> that scans a range for pages written since last write protect and can in the same step write protect them again. It pairs with userfaultfd write protect to give fast and race free userspace dirty tracking for snapshotting and live migration.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="when-your-page-suddenly-gets-bigger">When your page suddenly gets bigger</h2>

<p>Your CPU would rather cover more ground with fewer entries in its TLB. Linux can help by backing hot memory with bigger pages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: THP</strong><br>
Transparent Huge Pages automatically try to use larger pages for performance when safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Transparent Huge Pages do this automatically for anonymous memory and shmem or tmpfs. A fault can be satisfied with a 2 MiB page instead of 512 small ones. A background thread named khugepaged can also collapse adjacent base pages into a huge page when it is safe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>khugepaged</code></strong><br>
A kernel thread that scans and merges adjacent small pages into huge pages when conditions are right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern kernels add multi size THP which is mTHP on some architectures. Groups of base pages like 16 KiB or 64 KiB reduce fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. They are still PTE mapped but behave as larger folios inside the VM.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: mTHP</strong><br>
Multi size THP allows variable order large folios so you get some of the benefit without a full 2 MiB page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can ask for THP in a region with <code>madvise(..., MADV_HUGEPAGE)</code> or opt out with <code>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</code>. System wide behavior lives under <code>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/</code> with per size controls. <code>enabled</code> can be <code>always</code>, <code>madvise</code>, <code>never</code>, or <code>inherit</code>. Shmem or tmpfs have their own knobs like a <code>huge=</code> mount option with <code>always</code>, <code>advise</code>, <code>within_size</code>, <code>never</code>.</p>

<p>How to tell if it worked. In <code>/proc/self/smaps</code> the lines for a region include <code>AnonHugePages</code> for anonymous THP and <code>FilePmdMapped</code> for file or shmem huge mappings. System wide <code>/proc/meminfo</code> has <code>AnonHugePages</code>, <code>ShmemPmdMapped</code>, and <code>ShmemHugePages</code>. <code>/proc/vmstat</code> keeps a diary of THP events allocated on fault, fell back, split, swapped as a whole, and so on.</p>

<p>Controls plain map:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Top level: <code>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled</code> which is <code>always</code> or <code>madvise</code> or <code>never</code></li>
  <li>Defrag effort: <code>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag</code> tunes how hard the kernel tries on the fault path vs deferring to khugepaged</li>
  <li>Shmem or tmpfs: <code>huge=always|within_size|advise|never</code> plus shmem specific knobs</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern kernels may also create variable order large folios that are bigger than 4 KiB but PTE mapped not full 2 MiB PMD. This reduces fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. Behavior differs by kernel and architecture.</p>

<p>One trade off. Assembling a huge page may require compaction which moves other pages to free a contiguous chunk and this can add a small pause. If first touch latency matters more than steady state speed the defrag knob lets you temper how hard the kernel tries which pushes work to khugepaged instead of doing it inline.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: THP vs hugetlbfs</strong><br>
THP is automatic and pageable. Explicit huge pages from <code>MAP_HUGETLB</code> or hugetlbfs are quota managed and non swap.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="dirtytracking-in-userspace-without-racing-the-kernel">Dirty‑tracking in userspace, without racing the kernel</h2>

<p>Imagine you want to copy only the pages an application modified since your last snapshot.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give yourself the ability to catch write protect faults with userfaultfd in write protect mode.</li>
  <li>Use <code>PAGEMAP_SCAN</code> over your range with the category written since last write protect. Ask the kernel to write protect matching pages and to return compact ranges of what it found.</li>
  <li>Copy those ranges. When the app later writes to one of them userfaultfd wakes your thread. Log the dirtied page, clear write protect, and let it proceed.</li>
</ol>

<p>This avoids walking every PTE and avoids the classic race where a page is dirtied while you were looking. It is also fast because scan plus write protect happens as one atomic operation inside the kernel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>PAGEMAP_SCAN</code></strong><br>
An ioctl that scans a virtual range for pages with properties like written since last protect and can also apply write protect in the same step.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-tlb-and-why-mprotect-costs-a-little">The TLB, and why <code>mprotect</code> costs a little</h2>

<p>The Translation Lookaside Buffer remembers recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables on every access. If Linux changes a mapping or its permissions it must make sure stale entries are not used.</p>

<p>On x86 there are two broad ways to do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Precise invalidation. Invalidate one page at a time with <code>INVLPG</code>. Good for small changes. A single invalidation on a huge page mapping drops the whole 2 MiB entry.</li>
  <li>Broader flushes. Drop many or all entries for example by reloading the page table root register. Fewer instructions now and more misses later while refilling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is better depends on how big a change you made, whether you are changing small or huge pages, and the microarchitecture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: PCID</strong><br>
Process Context Identifiers tag TLB entries so switching page tables does not flush everything.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: INVPCID</strong><br>
Allows targeted invalidation of TLB entries for a given tag without switching to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also a debug knob on some x86 builds named <code>tlb_single_page_flush_ceiling</code> that nudges when the kernel switches from per page invalidations to a broad flush.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>INVLPG</code></strong><br>
A privileged instruction that invalidates TLB entries for the page containing a given address in the current address space tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="meltdown-and-why-the-kernel-sometimes-switches-maps-on-entry">Meltdown, and why the kernel sometimes switches maps on entry</h2>

<p>Early 2018 brought Meltdown. Speculative execution plus a cache side channel could leak data across the user and kernel boundary. Even if a user mode load from a kernel address would fault, the CPU might speculatively execute it and touch data that leaves a measurable cache trace.</p>

<p>Linux’s defense on x86‑64 is Page Table Isolation which is PTI. Keep two views and switch between them on entry and exit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: CR3</strong><br>
CR3 holds the current page table root and on x86 switching it changes the active address space.<br>
<strong>Tiny explainer: PTI</strong><br>
PTI keeps a reduced userspace view without normal kernel data mapped and a full kernel view used while in the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cost. More page table switches, different TLB sharing behavior, and a small memory bump for extra top level tables and the per CPU entry area. With PCID Linux keeps separate TLB tags for the two views to reduce flushes. Some systems allow opting out with <code>nopti</code> when acceptable. Default is on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: what Meltdown reads</strong><br>
Permissions never turn off. The architectural access still faults. The leak is in transient speculation which leaves a timing trace.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-the-kernel-changes-mappings-safely">How the kernel changes mappings safely</h2>

<p>When Linux edits page tables the order is deliberate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Handle cache rules first on architectures that need it.</li>
  <li>Modify page tables by adding, removing, or changing PTEs.</li>
  <li>Invalidate the TLB so the CPU forgets stale translations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Under the hood are functions that match the granularity of the change like flush an address space, flush a range, or flush a single page.</p>

<p>There is a parallel story for kernel only mappings made with <code>vmap</code> and <code>vmalloc</code>. Before I/O the kernel flushes the vmap range so the physical page sees the latest bytes. After I/O it invalidates the vmap range so speculative reads do not go stale.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: <code>vmap</code> and <code>vmalloc</code></strong><br>
APIs that create kernel virtual mappings to non contiguous physical pages for use inside the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On x86 you rarely think about the instruction cache because it is coherent with data stores. On others, copying code into executable memory requires an explicit instruction cache flush before running it. The VM has hooks like <code>copy_to_user_page</code> and <code>flush_icache_range</code> where architectures do this housekeeping.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: icache flush</strong><br>
Some CPUs need an instruction cache sync after writing new code so execution sees the new bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="a-tiny-x86-aside-stacks-and-calls-without-the-haze">A tiny x86 aside: stacks and calls, without the haze</h2>

<p>In 64 bit mode registers wear an R. <code>RIP</code> is the instruction pointer, <code>RSP</code> is the stack, <code>RBP</code> is the frame. The stack grows down. <code>push</code> decrements <code>RSP</code> and stores. <code>pop</code> loads then increments. <code>CALL</code> pushes the return address and jumps. <code>RET</code> pops it into <code>RIP</code>.</p>

<p>On Linux the System V AMD64 ABI passes the first arguments in registers which are <code>RDI</code>, <code>RSI</code>, <code>RDX</code>, <code>RCX</code>, <code>R8</code>, <code>R9</code> and returns values in <code>RAX</code>. Large objects go by pointer. Your stack must be readable and writable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: System V AMD64 ABI</strong><br>
The calling convention for 64 bit Unix like systems on x86‑64 that defines where arguments and return values go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>User code runs in ring 3. The kernel runs in ring 0. Crossings like syscalls, interrupts, and exceptions go through CPU defined gates. In 64 bit mode Linux uses a flat segmentation model and relies on paging for isolation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny explainer: rings</strong><br>
Rings are CPU privilege levels. Ring 3 is user mode. Ring 0 is kernel mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tiny note for ARM64 readers</strong><br>
The ideas like stack growth and user vs kernel separation are similar. Register names, calling conventions, and syscall entry differ.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="when-things-go-sideways-and-what-that-usually-means">When things go sideways (and what that usually means)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>mmap</code> → <code>EINVAL</code> often a misaligned file <code>offset</code> which must be page aligned or an impossible flag combo</li>
  <li><code>mmap</code> → <code>ENOMEM</code> you may be out of virtual space or VMA count or you hit strict overcommit</li>
  <li>Store to a file mapping → <code>SIGBUS</code> you walked past EOF. The VMA existed, the data did not</li>
  <li><code>mprotect(PROT_EXEC)</code> → <code>EACCES</code> could be a <code>noexec</code> mount or a W^X policy</li>
  <li>Big <code>malloc</code> creates a new line in <code>maps</code> your allocator used <code>mmap</code> for that size</li>
  <li>RSS balloons after <code>fork()</code> copy on write did its job and you wrote to lots of shared pages</li>
  <li>Accidentally clobbered a mapping you probably used <code>MAP_FIXED</code>. Prefer <code>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</code> to fail instead of overwrite</li>
</ul>

<p>When it is mysterious, look. Start friendly with <code>smaps_rollup</code> for the big picture and <code>maps</code> for shapes. Drop to <code>pagemap</code> and the <code>kpage*</code> files only when you truly need per page truth and expect to need privileges.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="a-small-checklist-to-keep-nearby">A small checklist to keep nearby</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Need memory now. <code>mmap</code> anonymous with <code>PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE</code> and <code>MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS</code></li>
  <li>Generating code. Keep W^X. Write bytes then <code>mprotect(PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC)</code></li>
  <li>Mapping a file. <code>offset</code> must be page aligned. Touching beyond real EOF is <code>SIGBUS</code></li>
  <li>Lots of major faults. Nudge the kernel with <code>MADV_WILLNEED</code> or touch earlier. Watch page cache and storage</li>
  <li>Where did memory go. Start with <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/smaps_rollup</code> then <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code></li>
  <li>Forking big processes. Expect CoW. RSS grows as you write. Consider <code>exec</code> in the child for heavy work</li>
  <li>Latency sensitive. Consider THP or mTHP where it helps. <code>mlock</code> hot sets. Watch your TLB behavior</li>
</ul>

Most critical she points is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox" rel="">Jevons Paradox</a><span>, which is </span><em><strong>the economic principle that a technological improvement in resource efficiency leads to an increase in the total consumption of that resource, rather than a decrease.</strong></em><span> Her argument is that as AI makes radiologists more productive, better diagnostics and faster turnaround at lower costs mean more people get scans. So employment doesn’t decrease. It increases.</span></p><p><span>This is also the Tech world’s consensus. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella </span><a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301" rel="">agrees</a><span>, as does Box CEO Aaron Levie, who </span><a href="https://x.com/levie/status/1843861347198742883" rel="">suggests</a><span>: </span></p><blockquote><p>“The least understood yet most important concept in the world is Jevons Paradox. When we make a technology more efficient, demand goes well beyond the original level. AI is the perfect example of this—almost anything that AI is applied to will see more demand, not less.”</p></blockquote><p>They’re only half right.</p><p><span>First, as Andrej Karpathy, the computer scientist who coined the term </span><em>vibe coding</em><span>, </span><a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1971220449515516391" rel="">points out</a><span>, radiology is not the right job to look for initial job displacements.</span></p><blockquote><p>“Radiology is too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I’d look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability.

graphs are logarithmic, meaning productivity and demand grew exponentially</em><span>). Early on, a service or product is expensive because many workers are needed to produce it. Most people can’t afford it or use them sparingly. For example, in the early 1800s, most people could only afford a pair of pants or shirt. Then automation makes workers dramatically more productive. A textile worker in 1900 could produce fifty times more than one in 1800. This productivity explosion crashes prices, which creates massive new demand. Suddenly everyone can afford multiple outfits instead of just one or two. Employment and productivity both surge (</span><em>note:</em><span> </span><em>employment growth masks internal segment displacement and wage changes. See footnote</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-3-175156576" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>)</span></p><p>Once demand saturates, employment doesn’t further increase but holds steady at peak demand. But as automation continues and workers keep getting more productive, employment starts to decline. In textiles, mechanization enabled massive output growth but ultimately displaced workers once consumption plateaued while automation and productivity continued climbing. We probably don’t need infinite clothing. Similarly, patients will likely never need a million radiology reports, no matter how cheap they become and so radiologists will eventually hit a ceiling. We don’t need infinite food, clothing, tax returns, and so on.</p><p><span>Motor vehicles, in Bessen’s graphs, tell a different story because demand remains far from saturated. Most people globally still don’t own cars. Automation hasn’t completely conquered manufacturing either (Tesla’s </span><a href="https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/strategy/articles/teslas-problem-overestimating-automation-underestimating-humans/" rel="">retreat</a><span> from full manufacturing automation proves the current technical limits). When both demand and automation potential remain high, employment can sustain or even grow despite productivity gains.</span></p><p><span>Software presents an even more interesting question. How many apps do you need? What about software that generates applications on demand, that creates entire software ecosystems autonomously? Until now, </span><em>handcrafted software</em><span> was the constraint. Expensive software engineers and their labor costs limited what companies could afford to build. Automation changes this equation by making those engineers far more productive. Both consumer and enterprise software markets suggest significant unmet demand because businesses have consistently left projects unbuilt</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-4-175156576" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. They couldn’t justify the development costs or had to allocate limited resources to their top priority projects. I saw this firsthand at Amazon. Thousands of ideas went unfunded not because they lacked business value, but because of the lack of engineering resources to build them.

Azeem Azhar, a tech analyst and investor, </span><a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble?" rel="">provides</a><span> an excellent practical framework to answer the AI bubble question. He benchmarks today’s AI boom using five gauges: economic strain (investment as a share of GDP), industry strain (capex to revenue ratios), revenue growth trajectories (doubling time), valuation heat (price-to-earnings multiples), and funding quality (the resilience of capital sources). His analysis shows that AI remains in a demand-led boom rather than a bubble, but if two of the five gauges head into red, we will be in bubble territory.</span></p><p><span>The demand is real. After all OpenAI is one of the fastest-growing companies in history</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-10-175156576" target="_self" rel="">10</a></span><span>. But that alone doesn’t prevent bubbles. OpenAI will likely be fine given its product-market fit, but many other AI companies face the same unit economics questions that plagued dotcom companies in the 1990s. Pets.com had millions of users too (a then large portion of internet users), but as the tech axiom goes, you can acquire infinite customers and generate infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-11-175156576" target="_self" rel="">11</a></span><span>. So despite the demand, the pattern may rhyme with the 1990s. Expect overbuilding. Expect some spectacular failures. But also expect the infrastructure to outlast the hype cycle and enable things we can’t yet imagine.</span></p><p>So where does this leave us?</p><p><strong>We’re early in the AI revolution.</strong><span> We’re at that metaphorical screeching modem phase of the internet era. Just as infrastructure companies poured billions into fiber optics, hyperscalers now pour billions into compute. Startups add “.ai” to their names like companies once added “.com” as they seek higher valuations. The hype will cycle through both euphoria and despair. Some predictions will look laughably wrong. Some that seem crazy will prove conservative. </span></p><p><strong>Different industries will experience different outcomes.</strong><span> Unlike what the Jevons optimists suggest, demand for many things plateaus once human needs are met. Employment outcomes in any industry depend on the magnitude and growth of unmet market demand and whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.</span></p><p><strong>Cost reduction will unlock market segments.</strong><span> Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, (in)famously </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-isnt-worth-17-billion/" rel="">undervalued</a><span> Uber assuming it would only capture a portion of the existing taxi market</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-12-175156576" target="_self" rel="">12</a></span><span>. He missed that making rides dramatically cheaper would expand the market itself as people took Ubers to destinations they’d never have paid taxi prices to reach. AI will similarly enable products and services currently too expensive to build with human intelligence. A restaurant owner might use AI to create custom supply chain software that say at $100,000 with human developers would never have been built. A non-profit might deploy AI to contest a legal battle that was previously unaffordable.</span></p><p><strong>We can predict change, but we can’t predict the details.</strong><span> No one in 1995 predicted we’d date strangers from the internet, ride in their </span><em>ubers</em><span>, or sleep in their </span><em>airbnbs</em><span>. Or that a job called </span><em>influencers</em><span> would become </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/10/29/too-many-people-want-to-be-social-media-influencers" rel="">the most sought-after</a><span> career among young people. Human creativity generates outcomes we can’t forecast with our current mental models. Expect new domains and industries to emerge. AI has already helped us </span><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/dolphingemma/" rel="">decode</a><span> more animal communication in the last five years than in the last fifty. Can we predict what jobs a technology that allows us to have full-blown conversations with them will unlock? A job that doesn’t exist today will likely be the most sought-after job in 2050. We can’t name it because it hasn’t been invented yet.</span></p><p><strong>Job categories will transform.</strong><span> Even as the internet made some jobs obsolete, it also transformed them and created new categories. Expect the same with AI. Karpathy </span><a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1971220449515516391" rel="">ends</a><span> with a question:</span></p><blockquote><p>About 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.</p></blockquote><p><span>To answer this question, go back to 1995 and ask the same question but with journalists. You might have predicted more journalists because the internet would create more demand by enabling you to reach the whole world. You’d be right for 10 or so years as employment in journalism grew until the early 2000s. But 30 years later, the </span><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertising" rel="">number of newspapers</a><span> and the </span><a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/journalism_jobs_digital_decline.php" rel="">number of journalists</a><span> both have declined, even though more “journalism” happens than ever. Just not by people we call journalists. Bloggers, influencers, YouTubers, and newsletter writers do the work that traditional journalists used to do</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13-175156576" href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era#footnote-13-175156576" target="_self" rel="">13</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>The same pattern will play out with software engineers. We’ll see more people doing software engineering work and in a decade or so, what “software engineer” means will have transformed. Consider the restaurant owner from earlier who uses AI to create custom inventory software that is useful only for them. They won’t call themselves a software engineer.</p><p>So just like in 1995, if the AI optimists today say that within 25 years, we’d prefer news from AI over social media influencers, watch AI-generated characters in place of human actors, find romantic partners through AI matchmakers more than through dating apps (or perhaps use AI romantic partners itself), and flip “don’t trust AI” so completely that we’d rely on AI for life-or-death decisions and trust it to raise our children, most people would find that hard to believe. Even with all the intelligence, both natural and artificial, no one can predict with certainty what our AI future will look like. Not the tech CEOs, not the AI researchers, and certainly not some random guy pontificating on the internet. But whether we get the details right or not, our AI future is loading.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.wreflection.com/p/ai-dial-up-era?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><strong>(Lead image: Philip Goldstein) –&nbsp;</strong></em>In the early 1960s the New York City Fire Department was facing a host of problems. The world around them was growing ever taller, ever more compact, and ever more dangerous with respect to fire. There were times when the very infrastructure that was supposed to be supplying them the water to extinguish a blaze simply stopped flowing, there were other times that the equipment they had proved to be woefully insufficient to stop a fire that should have been controlled, resulting in massive blazes that ate up homes, businesses, lives, and millions upon millions of dollars. In April of 1963, a massive fire on Staten Island taxed the city’s fire service to the absolute breaking point while destroying millions and millions in property.</p>

It was this catastrophe that led to the city’s approval to spend the money on the Super Pumper sytem.</p></div>
<p>The day is still referred to as Black Saturday by the people who lived through it. Due to the lack of suitable water supplies, the fire was far larger than it should have been. There was a drought that year and many of the sources that the firemen were used to pulling water from had literally run dry. This began a series of events that led to the construction of the most powerful land based fire fighting truck ever created, the Mack Super Pumper System. It was actually five trucks that worked as a brigade to battle the worst flaming disasters that the city could throw at it.</p>
<p>From 1965 through the early 1980s, the Mack Super Pumper System responded to more than 2,200 calls with more than 900 firefighters serving to operate it in some capacity. The five trucks that made up the super pumper system were a massive, locomotive-engined central pumping truck, a tender truck full of hoses, manifolds, and other gear, and three satellite trucks that looked like standard fire engines but were not equipped with their own pumps. It cost the city of New York $875,000 when it was new and we’ll wager to say that it was probably the best money ever spent to keep Gotham safe. There’s never been anything else like it.</p>
<p><strong>The pumping unit –</strong></p>
<p>The keystone of the whole operation was the massive central pumping unit that could draw water from eight hydrants at once, drop lines into bodies of water, supply a mind-boggling number of lines with water simultaneously, and flow over 10,000 gallons per minute at low pressures if the situation called for it. When the pressure was ramped up to to 350psi, it could move 8,800 GPM. This was enough to supply the other satellite trucks as well as feed a massive water cannon on the tender truck that could heave water over 600ft. That’s right, nearly and eight of a mile in whatever direction you wanted it to go. How was this possible? It was possible because of innovations in diesel engine technology during WWII. The grunt for the Super Pumper system came from a Napier-Deltic diesel engine. This was an engine designed by the British during WWII as a lightweight, high speed means to propel their ships. Making 2,400 horsepower and even more prodigious torque numbers, the engine was “light” enough to be mounted in a trailer behind a tractor and carted around. The Napier-Deltic was used to power locomotives and other massive land craft as well for a while. The engine’s design is interesting in the fact that it had three crankshafts and was an opposed piston style engine meaning that the pistons travel at each other. With turbochargers and a two stroke design, it was as mighty a compact piston powered engine the world had ever known to that point. It was thirsty and noisy as well. When working at full song, the engine would consume 137 gallons of diesel fuel per hour and the noise was so deafening that firemen near the truck had to wear strong ear protection to prevent hearing damage.</p>

<p>Mack was awarded the contract to build the truck in 1964 and by the end of the year, the unit was nearly ready to hit the streets of NYC. The tractor employed to drag the pumping unit around was a&nbsp;F715FSTP cab over that used a 255hp Mack END864 engine. The top speed of the whole rig was 42mph but since it was intended for responding to calls in the city, high mph was not as much a concern as&nbsp;maneuverability, and the ability to zip around at lower speeds happily. There were custom built PTOs to power the priming pump for the water pump and to to run an air compressor that needed 450psi to light off the pump engine.</p>
<p>The custom built trailer housed the engine and all of the stuff needed to keep it alive like the cooling system, fuel tanks, etc. At the rear of the trailer was the enormous six stage pump which was built by a company called DeLaval and that’s where the real magic happened. When the big Deltic was put to work turning that bad boy, fire, at least any on the first 60 stories of a building, didn’t stand a chance. The whole rig weighed in at 68,000lbs and for as much reading and research as we have done, there are no accounts of it ever faltering, failing, or leaving firefighters without the resources they needed to battle a fire. Often times we read about awesome machines like this and discover that they were unreliable or prone to fail but not this big guy.</p>
<p><strong>Some pretty stunning facts about the truck and the pumper:</strong></p>
<p>At 8,800 GPM it was throwing nearly 70,000lbs of water on a fire per minute.</p>
<p>During a fire in the Bronx, firemen laid 7,000ft of hose to get to a suitable water supply and the truck pumped as though it was dipping its feet into the ocean.</p>
<p>In 1967 the Super Pumper responded to a fire at a postal annex in NYC and managed to supply water to the massive gun on the tender truck, its three satellite units, two tower ladder trucks, and a portable manifold with multiple hand lines all by itself.</p>
<p>The hoses on the truck were pressure tested to 1,000psi of pressure but typically operated anywhere in the 350-800psi &nbsp;range depending on the situation. This is way higher (by several times!) what modern trucks use by our understanding. The hoses were a&nbsp;derivative of hoses developed by the Navy in WWII for high pressure applications and while incredibly heavy when compared to modern hoses, they were cutting edge at the time.</p>
<p>The truck still exists, living at a museum in Michigan and standing as a great reminder that human beings are amazingly inventive and creative beings when forced to find solutions to problems that endanger lots of lives or lots of valuable property!</p>

    <p><time>November 01, 2025</time></p><p><img src="https://htmx.org/img/fetch.png" alt="Stop trying to make fetch() happen"></p>
<p>OK, I said there would never be a version three of htmx.</p>
<p>But, <em>technically</em>, I never said anything about a version <em>four</em>…</p>
<h2 id="htmx-4-the-fetch-ening"><a href="#htmx-4-the-fetch-ening" aria-label="Anchor link for: htmx-4-the-fetch-ening">htmx 4: The fetch()ening</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/">The Future of htmx</a> I said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp; implementation. This means accepting and
documenting the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks</a> of the current implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, on a whim, I created <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/fixi">fixi.js</a>, a hyperminimalist implementation
of the ideas in htmx.  That work gave me a chance to get a lot more familiar  with the <code>fetch()</code> and, especially, the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async</a> infrastructure
available in JavaScript.</p>
<p>In doing that work I began to wonder if that, while the htmx <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes">API</a>
is (at least reasonably) correct, maybe there was room for a more dramatic change of the implementation that took
advantage of these features in order to simplify the library.</p>
<p>Further, changing from ye olde <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>
(a legacy of htmx 1.0 IE support) to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> would
be a pretty violent change, guaranteed to break at least <em>some</em> stuff.</p>
<p>So I began thinking: if we are going to consider moving to fetch, then maybe we should <em>also</em> use this update as a
chance address at least <em>some</em> of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks &amp; cruft</a> that htmx has acquired over its lifetime.</p>
<p>So, eventually &amp; reluctantly, I have changed my mind: there <em>will</em> be another major version of htmx.</p>
<p>However, in order to keep my word that there will not be a htmx 3.0, the next release will instead be htmx 4.0.</p>
<h2 id="project-goals"><a href="#project-goals" aria-label="Anchor link for: project-goals">Project Goals</a></h2>
<p>With htmx 4.0 we are rebuilding the internals of htmx, based on the lessons learned from
fixi.js and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmx.org/v/0.0.1">five+ years</a> of supporting htmx.</p>
<p>There are three major simplifying changes:</p>
<h3 id="the-fetch-ening"><a href="#the-fetch-ening" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-fetch-ening">The fetch()ening</a></h3>
<p>The biggest internal change is that <code>fetch()</code> will replace <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> as the core ajax infrastructure.  This
won’t actually have a huge effect on most usages of htmx <em>except</em> that the events model will necessarily change due
to the differences between <code>fetch()</code> and <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends"><a href="#the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends">The Long National Nightmare of Implicit Attribute Inheritance Ends</a></h3>
<p>I feel that my biggest mistake in htmx 1.0 &amp; 2.0 was making attribute inheritance <em>implicit</em>.  I was inspired by CSS in
doing this, and the results have been roughly the same as CSS: powerful &amp; maddening.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0, attribute inheritance will be <em>explicit</em> rather than <em>implicit</em>, via the <code>:inherited</code> modifier:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>  &lt;</span><span>div </span><span>hx-target:inherited</span><span>=</span><span>"#output"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    &lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/up"</span><span>&gt;Like&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    &lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/down"</span><span>&gt;Dislike&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;</span><span>output </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"output"</span><span>&gt;Pick a button...&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>hx-target</code> attribute is explicitly declared as <code>inherited</code> on the enclosing <code>div</code> and, if it wasn’t, the
<code>button</code> elements would not inherit the target from it.</p>
<p>This will be the most significant upgrade change to deal with for most htmx users.</p>
<h3 id="the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends"><a href="#the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends">The Tyranny Of Locally Cached History Ends</a></h3>
<p>Another constant source of pain for both us and for htmx users is history support.  htmx 2.0 stores history in local
cache to make navigation faster.  Unfortunately, snapshotting the DOM is often brittle because of third-party
modifications, hidden state, etc.  There is a terrible simplicity to the web 1.0 model of blowing everything away and
starting over.  There are also security concerns storing history information in session storage.</p>
<p>In htmx 2.0, we often end up recommending that people facing history-related issues simply disable the cache entirely,
and that usually fixes the problems.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0, history support will no longer snapshot the DOM and keep it locally.  It will, rather, issue a network
request for the restored content.  This is the behavior of 2.0 on a history cache-miss, and it works reliably with
little effort on behalf of htmx users.</p>
<p>We will offer an extension that enables history caching like in htmx 2.0, but it will be opt-in, rather than the default.</p>
<p>This tremendously simplifies the htmx codebase and should make the out-of-the-box behavior much more plug-and-play.</p>
<h2 id="what-stays-the-same"><a href="#what-stays-the-same" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-stays-the-same">What Stays The Same?</a></h2>
<p>Most things.</p>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648188.3675127">core</a> functionality of htmx will remain the same, <code>hx-get</code>, <code>hx-post</code>,
<code>hx-target</code>, <code>hx-boost</code>, <code>hx-swap</code>, <code>hx-trigger</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Except for adding an <code>:inherited</code> modifier on a few attributes, many htmx projects will “just work” with htmx 4.</p>
<p>These changes will make the long term maintenance &amp; sustainability of the project much stronger.  It will also take
pressure off the 2.0 releases, which can now focus on stability rather than contemplating new features.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading"><a href="#upgrading" aria-label="Anchor link for: upgrading">Upgrading</a></h2>
<p>That said, htmx 2.0 users <em>will</em> face an upgrade project when moving to 4.0 in a way that they did not have to in moving
from 1.0 to 2.0.</p>
<p>I am sorry about that, and want to offer three things to address it:</p>
<ul>
<li>htmx 2.0 (like htmx 1.0 &amp; intercooler.js 1.0) will be supported <em>in perpetuity</em>, so there is absolutely <em>no</em> pressure to
upgrade your application: if htmx 2.0 is satisfying your hypermedia needs, you can stick with it.</li>
<li>We will create extensions that revert htmx 4 to htmx 2 behaviors as much as is feasible (e.g. Supporting the old implicit
attribute inheritance model, at least)</li>
<li>We will roll htmx 4.0 out slowly, over a multi-year period.  As with the htmx 1.0 -&gt; 2.0 upgrade, there will be a long
period where htmx 2.x is <code>latest</code> and htmx 4.x is <code>next</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-features"><a href="#new-features" aria-label="Anchor link for: new-features">New Features</a></h2>
<p>Of course, it isn’t all bad.  Beyond simplifying the implementation of htmx significantly, switching to fetch also gives
us the opportunity to add some nice new features to htmx</p>
<h3 id="streaming-responses-sse-in-core"><a href="#streaming-responses-sse-in-core" aria-label="Anchor link for: streaming-responses-sse-in-core">Streaming Responses &amp; SSE in Core</a></h3>
<p>By switching to <code>fetch()</code>, we can take advantage of its support for
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams">readable streams</a>, which
allow for a stream of content to be swapped into the DOM, rather than a single response.</p>
<p>htmx 1.0 had Server Sent Event support integrated into the library.  In htmx 2.0 we pulled this functionality out as an
extension.  It turns out that SSE is just a specialized version of a streaming response, so in adding streaming
support, it’s an almost-free free two-fer to add that back into core as well.</p>
<p>This will make incremental response swapping much cleaner and well-supported in htmx.</p>
<h3 id="morphing-swap-in-core"><a href="#morphing-swap-in-core" aria-label="Anchor link for: morphing-swap-in-core">Morphing Swap in Core</a></h3>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph/commit/7760e89d9f198b43aa7d39cc4f940f606771f47b">Three years ago</a> I had
an idea for a DOM morphing algorithm that improved on the initial algorithm pioneered by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom">morphdom</a>.</p>
<p>The idea was to use “id sets” to make smarter decisions regarding which nodes to preserve and which nodes to delete when
merging changes into the DOM, and I called this idea “idiomorph”.  Idiomorph has gone on to be adopted by many other
web project such as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly considered including it in htmx 2.0, but I decided not too because it worked well as an extension and
htmx 2.0 had already grown larger than I wanted.</p>
<p>In 4.0, with the complexity savings we achieved by moving to <code>fetch()</code>, we can now comfortably fit a <code>morphInner</code> and
<code>morphOuter</code> swap into core, thanks to the excellent work of Michael West.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-partial-tag-support"><a href="#explicit-partial-tag-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: explicit-partial-tag-support">Explicit &lt;partial&gt; Tag Support</a></h3>
<p>htmx has, since very early on, supported a concept of “Out-of-band” swaps: content that is removed from the main HTML
response and swapped into the DOM elsewhere.  I have always been a bit ambivalent about them, because they move away
from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">Locality of Behavior</a>, but there is no doubt that they are useful
and often crucial for achieving certain UI patterns.</p>
<p>Out-of-band swaps started off very simply: if you marked an element as <code>hx-swap-oob='true'</code>, htmx would swap the element
as the outer HTML of any existing element already in the DOM with that id.  Easy-peasy.</p>
<p>However, over time, people started asking for different functionality around Out-of-band swaps: prepending, appending,
etc. and the feature began acquiring some fairly baroque syntax to handle all these needs.</p>
<p>We have come to the conclusion that the problem is that there are really <em>two</em> use cases, both currently trying to be
filled by Out-of-band swaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple, id-based replacement</li>
<li>A more elaborate swap of partial content</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we are introducing the notion of <code>&lt;partial&gt;</code>s in htmx 4.0</p>
<p>A partial element is, under the covers, a template element and, thus, can contain any sort of content you like.  It
specifies on itself all the standard htmx options regarding swapping, <code>hx-target</code> and <code>hx-swap</code> in particular, allowing
you full access to all the standard swapping behavior of htmx without using a specialized syntax.  This tremendously
simplifies the mental model for these sorts of needs, and dovetails well with the streaming support we intend to offer.</p>
<p>Out-of-band swaps will be retained in htmx 4.0, but will go back to their initial, simple focus of simply replacing
an existing element by id.</p>
<h3 id="improved-view-transitions-support"><a href="#improved-view-transitions-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-view-transitions-support">Improved View Transitions Support</a></h3>
<p>htmx 2.0 has had <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">View Transition</a> support since
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#190---2023-04-11">April of 2023</a>.  In the interceding
two years, support for the feature has grown across browsers (c’mon, safari, you can do it) and we’ve gained experience
with the feature.</p>
<p>One thing that has become apparent to us while using them is that, to use them in a stable manner, it is important
to establish a <em>queue</em> of transitions, so each can complete before the other begins.  If you don’t do this, you can get
visually ugly transition cancellations.</p>
<p>So, in htmx 4.0 we have added this queue which will ensure that all view transitions complete smoothly.</p>
<p>CSS transitions will continue to work as before as well, although the swapping model is again made much simpler by the
async runtime.</p>
<p>We may enable View Transitions by default, the jury is still out on that.</p>
<h3 id="stabilized-event-ordering"><a href="#stabilized-event-ordering" aria-label="Anchor link for: stabilized-event-ordering">Stabilized Event Ordering</a></h3>
<p>A wonderful thing about <code>fetch()</code> and the async support in general is that it is <em>much</em> easier to guarantee a stable
order of events.  By linearizing asynchronous code and allowing us to use standard language features like try/catch,
the event model of htmx should be much more predictable and comprehensible.</p>
<p>We are going to adopt a new standard for event naming to make things even clearer:</p>
<p><code>htmx:&lt;phase&gt;:&lt;system&gt;[:&lt;optional-sub-action&gt;]</code></p>
<p>So, for example, <code>htmx:before:request</code> will be triggered before a request is made.</p>
<h3 id="improved-extension-support"><a href="#improved-extension-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-extension-support">Improved Extension Support</a></h3>
<p>Another opportunity we have is to take advantage of the <code>async</code> behavior of <code>fetch()</code> for much better performance in our
preload extension (where we issue a speculative (<code>GET</code> only!) request in anticipation of an actual trigger).  We have
also added an optimistic update extension to the core extensions, again made easy by the new async features.</p>
<p>In general, we have opened up the internals of the htmx request/response/swap cycle much more fully to extension developers,
up to and including allowing them to replace the <code>fetch()</code> implementation used by htmx for a particular request.  There
should not be a need for any hacks to get the behavior you want out of htmx now: the events and the open “context” object
should provide the ability to do almost anything.</p>
<h3 id="improved-hx-on-support"><a href="#improved-hx-on-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-hx-on-support">Improved <code>hx-on</code> Support</a></h3>
<p>In htmx 2.0, I somewhat reluctantly added the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-on/"><code>hx-on</code></a> attributes to support light
scripting inline on elements.  I added this because HTML does not allow you to listen for arbitrary events via <code>on</code>
attributes: only standard DOM events like <code>onclick</code> can be responded to.</p>
<p>We hemmed and hawed about the syntax and so, unfortunately, there are a few different ways to do it.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0 we will adopt a single standard for the <code>hx-on</code> attributes: <code>hx-on:&lt;event name&gt;</code>.  Additionally, we are
working to improve the htmx JavaScript API (especially around async operation support) and will make those features
available in <code>hx-on</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/like"
</span><span>        </span><span>hx-on:htmx:after:swap</span><span>=</span><span>"await timeout('3s'); ctx.newContent[0].remove()"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    Get A Response Then Remove It 3 Seconds Later
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>htmx will never support a fully featured scripting mechanism in core, we recommend something like
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a> for that, but our hope is that we can provide a relatively minimalist API that
allows for easy, light async scripting of the DOM.</p>
<p>I should note that htmx 4.0 will continue to work with <code>eval()</code> disabled, but you will need to forego a few features like
<code>hx-on</code> if you choose to do so.</p>
<h3 id="a-better-but-familiar-htmx"><a href="#a-better-but-familiar-htmx" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-better-but-familiar-htmx">A Better But Familiar htmx</a></h3>
<p>All in all, our hope is that htmx 4.0 will feel an awful lot like 2.0, but with better features and, we hope, with fewer bugs.</p>
<h2 id="timeline"><a href="#timeline" aria-label="Anchor link for: timeline">Timeline</a></h2>
<p>As always, software takes as long as it takes.</p>
<p>However, our current planned timeline is:</p>
<ul>
<li>An alpha release is available <em>today</em>:  <code>htmx@4.0.0-alpha1</code></li>
<li>A 4.0.0 release should be available in early-to-mid 2026</li>
<li>4.0 will be marked <code>latest</code> in early-2027ish</li>
</ul>
<p>You can track our progress (and see quite a bit of dust flying around) in the <code>four</code> branch on
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/tree/four">github</a> and at:</p>

He envisions millions of copies of a model whirring away, each conducting its own research: a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.” In June, Sam Altman, of OpenAI, wrote that the industry was on the cusp of building “digital superintelligence.” “The 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the A.I. tools that most people currently interact with on a day-to-day basis are reminiscent of Clippy, the onetime Microsoft Office “assistant” that was actually more of a gadfly. A Zoom A.I. tool suggests that you ask it “What are some meeting icebreakers?” or instruct it to “Write a short message to share gratitude.” Siri is good at setting reminders but not much else. A friend of mine saw a button in Gmail that said “Thank and tell anecdote.” When he clicked it, Google’s A.I. invented a funny story about a trip to Turkey that he never took.</p><p>The rushed and uneven rollout of A.I. has created a fog in which it is tempting to conclude that there is nothing to see here—that it’s all hype. There is, to be sure, plenty of hype: Amodei’s timeline is science-fictional. (A.I. models aren’t improving that fast.) But it is another kind of wishful thinking to suppose that large language models are just shuffling words around. I used to be sympathetic to that view. I sought comfort in the idea that A.I. had little to do with real intelligence or understanding. I even celebrated its shortcomings—rooting for the home team. Then I began using A.I. in my work as a programmer, fearing that if I didn’t I would fall behind. (My employer, a trading firm, has several investments in and partnerships with A.I. companies, including Anthropic.) Writing code is, by many accounts, the thing that A.I. is best at; code has more structure than prose does, and it’s often possible to automatically validate that a given program works. My conversion was swift. At first, I consulted A.I. models in lieu of looking something up. Then I gave them small, self-contained problems. Eventually, I gave them real work—the kind I’d trained my whole career to do. I saw these models digest, in seconds, the intricate details of thousands of lines of code. They could spot subtle bugs and orchestrate complex new features. Finally, I was transferred to a fast-growing team that aims to make better use of A.I. tools, and to create our own.</p><p>The science-fiction author William Gibson is said to have observed that the future is already here, just not evenly distributed—which might explain why A.I. seems to have minted two cultures, one dismissive and the other enthralled. In our daily lives, A.I. “agents” that can book vacations or file taxes are a flop, but I have colleagues who compose much of their code using A.I. and sometimes run multiple coding agents at a time. Models sometimes make amateur mistakes or get caught in inane loops, but, as I’ve learned to use them effectively, they have allowed me to accomplish in an evening what used to take a month. Not too long ago, I made two iOS apps without knowing how to make an iOS app.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61461&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61461" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Duck talking to man sitting on park bench.

Large language models have many weaknesses: they famously hallucinate reasonable-sounding falsehoods; they can be servile even when you’re wrong; they are fooled by simple puzzles. But I remember a time when the obvious strengths of today’s A.I. models—fluency, fluidity, an ability to “get” what someone is talking about—were considered holy grails. When you experience these strengths firsthand, you wonder: How convincing does the illusion of understanding have to be before you stop calling it an illusion?</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On a brutally hot day this summer, my friend Max met up with his family at a playground. For some reason, a sprinkler for kids was switched off, and Max’s wife had promised everyone that her husband would fix it. Confronted by red-faced six- and seven-year-olds, Max entered a utility shed hoping to find a big, fat “On” switch. Instead, he found a maze of ancient pipes and valves. He was about to give up when, on a whim, he pulled out his phone and fed a photo into ChatGPT-4o, along with a description of his problem. The A.I. thought for a second, or maybe didn’t think, but all the same it said that he was looking at a backflow-preventer system typical of irrigation setups. Did he see that yellow ball valve toward the bottom? That probably controlled the flow. Max went for it, and cheers rang out across the playground as the water turned on.</p><p>Was ChatGPT mindlessly stringing words together, or did it understand the problem? The answer could teach us something important about understanding itself. “Neuroscientists have to confront this humbling truth,” Doris Tsao, a neuroscience professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. “The advances in machine learning have taught us more about the essence of intelligence than anything that neuroscience has discovered in the past hundred years.” Tsao is best known for decoding how macaque monkeys perceive faces. Her team learned to predict which neurons would fire when a monkey saw a specific face; even more strikingly, given a pattern of neurons firing, Tsao’s team could render the face. Their work built on research into how faces are represented inside A.I. models. These days, her favorite question to ask people is “What is the deepest insight you have gained from ChatGPT?” “My own answer,” she said, “is that I think it radically demystifies thinking.”</p><p>The most basic account of how we got here goes something like this. In the nineteen-eighties, a small team of cognitive psychologists and computer scientists tried to simulate thinking in a machine. Among the more famous of them were David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and James McClelland, who went on to form a research group at U.C. San Diego. They saw the brain as a vast network in which neurons fire in patterns, causing other sets of neurons to fire, and so on; this dance of patterns is thinking. The brain learns by changing the strength of the connections between neurons. Crucially, the scientists mimicked this process by creating an artificial neural network, and by applying a simple algorithm called gradient descent to increase the accuracy of its predictions. (The algorithm could be compared to a hiker navigating from a mountaintop to a valley; a simple strategy for eventually finding one’s way is to insure that every step moves downhill.) The use of such algorithms in large networks is known as deep learning.</p><p>Other people in A.I. were skeptical that neural networks were sophisticated enough for real-world tasks, but, as the networks got bigger, they began to solve previously unsolvable problems. People would devote entire dissertations to developing techniques for distinguishing handwritten digits or for recognizing faces in images; then a deep-learning algorithm would digest the underlying data, discover the subtleties of the problem, and make those projects seem obsolete. Deep learning soon conquered speech recognition, translation, image captioning, board games, and even the problem of predicting how proteins will fold.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Today’s leading A.I. models are trained on a large portion of the internet, using a technique called next-token prediction. A model learns by making guesses about what it will read next, then comparing those guesses to whatever actually appears. Wrong guesses inspire changes in the connection strength between the neurons; this is gradient descent. Eventually, the model becomes so good at predicting text that it appears to know things and make sense. So that is something to think about. A group of people sought the secret of how the brain works. As their model grew toward a brain-like size, it started doing things that were thought to require brain-like intelligence. Is it possible that they found what they were looking for?</p><p>There is understandable resistance to such a simplistic and triumphant account of A.I. The case against it was well argued by Ted Chiang, who wrote an article for this magazine in early 2023 titled “ChatGPT Is a Blurry <em>JPEG</em> of the Web.” He meant it in a more or less deflationary way: that’s <em>all</em> ChatGPT is. You feed the whole internet to a program and it regurgitates it back to you imperfectly, like a copy of a copy of a photograph—but with just enough facility to fool you into believing that the program is intelligent. This spring, a similar argument was made in a book, “The AI Con,” by Emily M. Bender, a linguist, and Alex Hanna, a sociologist. Bender is perhaps best known for describing L.L.M.s as “stochastic parrots.” “Large language models do not, cannot, and will not ‘understand’ anything at all,” the writer Tyler Austin Harper declared in a book review in <em>The Atlantic</em>. Models “produce writing not by thinking but by making statistically informed guesses about which lexical item is likely to follow another.” Harper buttressed these technical arguments with moral ones. A.I. enriches the powerful, consumes enough energy to accelerate climate change, and marginalizes workers. He concluded that “the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.”</p><figure><p><span>A leading neuroscientist argues that ChatGPT “radically demystifies thinking.”</span></p></figure><p>But the moral case against A.I. may ultimately be stronger than the technical one. “The ‘stochastic parrot’ thing has to be dead at some point,” Samuel J. Gershman, a Harvard cognitive scientist who is no A.I. hype man, told me. “Only the most hardcore skeptics can deny these systems are doing things many of us didn’t think were going to be achieved.” Jonathan Cohen, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton, emphasized the limitations of A.I., but argued that, in some cases, L.L.M.s seem to mirror one of the largest and most important parts of the human brain. “To a first approximation, your neocortex is your deep-learning mechanism,” Cohen said. Humans have a much larger neocortex than other animals, relative to body size, and the species with the largest neocortices—elephants, dolphins, gorillas, chimpanzees, dogs—are among the most intelligent.</p><p>In 2003, the machine-learning researcher Eric B. Baum published a book called “What Is Thought?” (I stumbled upon it in my college’s library stacks, drawn by the title.) The gist of Baum’s argument is that understanding is compression, and compression is understanding. In statistics, when you want to make sense of points on a graph, you can use a technique called linear regression to draw a “line of best fit” through them. If there’s an underlying regularity in the data—maybe you’re plotting shoe size against height—the line of best fit will efficiently express it, predicting where new points could fall. The neocortex can be understood as distilling a sea of raw experience—sounds, sights, and other sensations—into “lines of best fit,” which it can use to make predictions. A baby exploring the world tries to guess how a toy will taste or where food will go when it hits the floor. When a prediction is wrong, the connections between neurons are adjusted. Over time, those connections begin to capture regularities in the data. They form a compressed model of the world.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Artificial neural networks compress experience just like real neural networks do. One of the best open-source A.I. models, DeepSeek, is capable of writing novels, suggesting medical diagnoses, and sounding like a native speaker in dozens of languages. It was trained using next-token prediction on many terabytes of data. But when you download the model it is one six-hundredth of that. A distillation of the internet, compressed to fit on your laptop. Ted Chiang was right to call an early version of ChatGPT a blurry <em>JPEG</em> of the web—but, in my view, this is the very reason these models have become increasingly intelligent. Chiang noted in his piece that, to compress a text file filled with millions of examples of arithmetic, you wouldn’t create a zip file. You’d write a calculator program. “The greatest degree of compression can be achieved by understanding the text,” he wrote. Perhaps L.L.M.s are starting to do that.</p><p>It can seem unnatural, even repulsive, to imagine that a computer program actually understands, actually <em>thinks</em>. We usually conceptualize thinking as something conscious, like a Joycean inner monologue or the flow of sense memories in a Proustian daydream. Or we might mean reasoning: working through a problem step by step. In our conversations about A.I., we often conflate these different kinds of thinking, and it makes our judgments pat. ChatGPT is obviously not thinking, goes one argument, because it is obviously not having a Proustian reverie; ChatGPT clearly is thinking, goes another, because it can work through logic puzzles better than you can.</p><p>Something more subtle is going on. I do not believe that ChatGPT has an inner life, and yet it seems to know what it’s talking about. Understanding—having a grasp of what’s going on—is an underappreciated kind of thinking, because it’s mostly unconscious. Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, likes to say that cognition is recognition. Hofstadter became famous for a book about the mind and consciousness called “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. Hofstadter’s theory, developed through decades of research, is that “seeing as” is the essence of thinking. You see one patch of color as a car and another as a key chain; you recognize the letter “A” no matter what font it is written in or how bad the handwriting might be. Hofstadter argued that the same process underlies more abstract kinds of perception. When a grand master examines a chess board, years of practice are channelled into a way of seeing: white’s bishop is weak; that endgame is probably a draw. You see an eddy in a river as a sign that it’s dangerous to cross. You see a meeting you’re in as an emperor-has-no-clothes situation. My nearly two-year-old son recognizes that late-morning stroller walks might be an opportunity for a croissant and makes demands accordingly. For Hofstadter, that’s intelligence in a nutshell.</p><p>Hofstadter was one of the original A.I. deflationists, and my own skepticism was rooted in his. He wrote that most A.I. research had little to do with real thinking, and when I was in college, in the two-thousands, I agreed with him. There were exceptions. He found the U.C.S.D. group interesting. And he admired the work of a lesser-known Finnish American cognitive scientist, Pentti Kanerva, who noticed some unusual properties in the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces. In a high-dimensional space, any two random points may be extremely far apart. But, counterintuitively, each point also has a large cloud of neighbors around it, so you can easily find your way to it if you get “close enough.” That reminded Kanerva of the way that memory works. In a 1988 book called “Sparse Distributed Memory,” Kanerva argued that thoughts, sensations, and recollections could be represented as coördinates in high-dimensional space. The brain seemed like the perfect piece of hardware for storing such things. Every memory has a sort of address, defined by the neurons that are active when you recall it. New experiences cause new sets of neurons to fire, representing new addresses. Two addresses can be different in many ways but similar in others; one perception or memory triggers other memories nearby. The scent of hay recalls a memory of summer camp. The first three notes of Beethoven’s Fifth beget the fourth. A chess position that you’ve never seen reminds you of old games—not all of them, just the ones in the right neighborhood.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60789&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60789" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Mother waving to daughter from front door." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_120,c_limit/a60789.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_240,c_limit/a60789.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_320,c_limit/a60789.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_640,c_limit/a60789.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_960,c_limit/a60789.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_1280,c_limit/a60789.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_1600,c_limit/a60789.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/69010a5573f0169671cec045/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a60789.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>“Bye, sweetie—have a day filled with social drama, drastically shifting friendships, and academic milestones, which you’ll describe to me later as ‘fine.’&nbsp;”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Ali Solomon</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Hofstadter realized that Kanerva was describing something like a “seeing as” machine. “Pentti Kanerva’s memory model was a revelation for me,” he wrote in a foreword to Kanerva’s book. “It was the very first piece of research I had ever run across that made me feel I could glimpse the distant goal of understanding how the brain works as a whole.” Every kind of thinking—whether Joycean, Proustian, or logical—depends on the relevant thing coming to mind at the right time. It’s how we figure out what situation we’re in.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Kanerva’s book receded from view, and Hofstadter’s own star faded—except when he occasionally poked up his head to criticize a new A.I. system. In 2018, he wrote of Google Translate and similar technologies: “There is still something deeply lacking in the approach, which is conveyed by a single word: <em>understanding</em>.” But GPT-4, which was released in 2023, produced Hofstadter’s conversion moment. “I’m mind-boggled by some of the things that the systems do,” he told me recently. “It would have been inconceivable even only ten years ago.” The staunchest deflationist could deflate no longer. Here was a program that could translate as well as an expert, make analogies, extemporize, generalize. Who were we to say that it didn’t understand? “They do things that are very much like thinking,” he said. “You could say they <em>are</em> thinking, just in a somewhat alien way.”</p><p>L.L.M.s appear to have a “seeing as” machine at their core. They represent each word with a series of numbers denoting its coördinates—its vector—in a high-dimensional space. In GPT-4, a word vector has thousands of dimensions, which describe its shades of similarity to and difference from every other word. During training, a large language model tweaks a word’s coördinates whenever it makes a prediction error; words that appear in texts together are nudged closer in space. This produces an incredibly dense representation of usages and meanings, in which analogy becomes a matter of geometry. In a classic example, if you take the word vector for “Paris,” subtract “France,” and then add “Italy,” the nearest other vector will be “Rome.” L.L.M.s can “vectorize” an image by encoding what’s in it, its mood, even the expressions on people’s faces, with enough detail to redraw it in a particular style or to write a paragraph about it. When Max asked ChatGPT to help him out with the sprinkler at the park, the model wasn’t just spewing text. The photograph of the plumbing was compressed, along with Max’s prompt, into a vector that captured its most important features. That vector served as an address for calling up nearby words and concepts. Those ideas, in turn, called up others as the model built up a sense of the situation. It composed its response with those ideas “in mind.”</p><p>A few months ago, I was reading an interview with an Anthropic researcher, Trenton Bricken, who has worked with colleagues to probe the insides of Claude, the company’s series of A.I. models. (Their research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.) His team has identified ensembles of artificial neurons, or “features,” that activate when Claude is about to say one thing or another. Features turn out to be like volume knobs for concepts; turn them up and the model will talk about little else. (In a sort of thought-control experiment, the feature representing the Golden Gate Bridge was turned up; when one user asked Claude for a chocolate-cake recipe, its suggested ingredients included “1/4 cup dry fog” and “1 cup warm seawater.”) In the interview, Bricken mentioned Google’s Transformer architecture, a recipe for constructing neural networks that underlies leading A.I. models. (The “T” in ChatGPT stands for “Transformer.”) He argued that the mathematics at the heart of the Transformer architecture closely approximated a model proposed decades earlier—by Pentti Kanerva, in “Sparse Distributed Memory.”</p><p>Should we be surprised by the correspondence between A.I. and our own brains? L.L.M.s are, after all, artificial neural networks that psychologists and neuroscientists helped develop. What’s more surprising is that when models practiced something rote—predicting words—they began to behave in such a brain-like way. These days, the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are becoming entangled; brain experts are using A.I. as a kind of model organism. Evelina Fedorenko, a neuroscientist at M.I.T., has used L.L.M.s to study how brains process language. “I never thought I would be able to think about these kinds of things in my lifetime,” she told me. “I never thought we’d have models that are good enough.”</p><p>It has become commonplace to say that A.I. is a black box, but the opposite is arguably true: a scientist can probe the activity of individual artificial neurons and even alter them. “Having a working system that instantiates a theory of human intelligence—it’s the dream of cognitive neuroscience,” Kenneth Norman, a Princeton neuroscientist, told me. Norman has created computer models of the hippocampus, the brain region where episodic memories are stored, but in the past they were so simple that he could only feed them crude approximations of what might enter a human mind. “Now you can give memory models the exact stimuli you give to a person,” he said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The Wright brothers studied birds during their early efforts to build an airplane. They noted that birds take off into the wind, even though a reasonable person might have assumed they’d want the wind at their backs, and that they warp the tips of their wings for balance. These findings influenced their rudimentary glider designs. Then they built a six-foot-long wind tunnel, which allowed them to test a set of artificial wings under precisely controlled conditions. Their next round of glider flights was far more successful. Strangely, it was only well after they’d made a working flying machine that it became possible to understand exactly how the birds do it.</p><p>A.I. enables scientists to place thinking itself in a wind tunnel. For a paper provocatively titled “On the Biology of a Large Language Model,” Anthropic researchers observed Claude responding to queries and described “circuits”—cascades of features that, together, perform complex computations. (Calling up the right memories is one step toward thinking; combining and manipulating them in circuits is arguably another.) One longstanding criticism of L.L.M.s has been that, because they must generate one token of their response at a time, they can’t plan or reason. But, when you ask Claude to finish a rhyming couplet in a poem, a circuit begins considering the last word of the new line, to insure that it will rhyme. It then works backward to compose the line as a whole. Anthropic researchers counted this as evidence that their models do engage in planning. Squint a little and you might feel, for the first time, that the inner workings of a mind are in view.</p><p>You really do have to squint, though. “The worry I have is that people flipped the bit from ‘I’m really skeptical of this’ to totally dropping their shields,” Norman, the Princeton neuroscientist, told me. “Many things still have to get figured out.” I’m one of the people that Norman is talking about. (Perhaps I am too easily moved by the seeming convergence of “Sparse Distributed Memory” and an Anthropic model.) In the past year or two, I started to believe what Geoffrey Hinton, who recently won a Nobel Prize for his A.I. research, told the journalist Karen Hao in 2020: “Deep learning is going to be able to do everything.” But we have also seen that larger models aren’t always better models. Curves plotting model performance against size have begun flattening out. It’s becoming difficult to find high-quality data that the models haven’t already digested, and computing power is increasingly expensive. When GPT-5 came out, in August, it was a merely incremental improvement—and so profound a disappointment that it threatened to pop the A.I. investment bubble. The moment demands a middle kind of skepticism: one that takes today’s A.I. models seriously without believing that there are no hard problems left.</p><p>Perhaps the most consequential of these problems is how to design a model that learns as efficiently as humans do. It is estimated that GPT-4 was exposed to trillions of words in training; children need only a few million to become fluent. Cognitive scientists tell us that a newborn’s brain has certain “inductive biases” that accelerate learning. (Of course, the brain is the result of millions of years of evolution—itself a sort of training data.) For instance, human babies have the expectation that the world is made of objects, and that other beings have beliefs and intentions. When Mama says “banana,” an infant connects that word to the entire yellow object she’s looking at—not just its tip or its peel. Infants perform little experiments: Can I eat this? How far can I throw that? They are motivated by emotions such as desire, curiosity, and frustration. Children are always trying to do something just beyond their ability. Their learning is efficient because it’s embodied, adaptive, deliberate, and continuous. Maybe truly understanding the world requires participating in it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>An A.I.’s experience, in comparison, is so impoverished that it can’t really be called “experience.” Large language models are trained on data that is already extraordinarily refined. “I think the reason they work is that they’re piggybacking on language,” Tsao, the U.C. Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot. Ida Momennejad, a cognitive neuroscientist who now works for Microsoft Research, has done experiments in which an L.L.M. is given a virtual walk-through of a building and then asked questions about routes and shortcuts—spatial inferences that come easily to humans. With all but the most basic setups, the A.I.s tend to fail or hallucinate nonexistent paths. “Do they really do planning?” she said. “Not really.”</p><p>In my conversations with neuroscientists, I sensed a concern that the A.I. industry is racing ahead somewhat thoughtlessly. If the goal is to make artificial minds as capable as human minds are, then “we’re not training the systems in the right way,” Brenden M. Lake, a cognitive scientist at Princeton, told me. When an A.I. is done training, the neural network’s “brain” is frozen. If you tell the model some facts about yourself, it doesn’t rewire its neurons. Instead, it uses a crude substitute: it writes down a bit of text—“The user has a toddler and is studying French”—and considers that before other instructions you give. The human brain updates itself continuously, and there’s a beautiful theory about one of its ways of doing so: when you sleep, selected snapshots from your episodic memory are replayed for your neocortex in order to train it. Your high-dimensional thought space gets dimpled by the replayed memories; you wake up with a slightly new way of seeing.</p><p>The A.I. community has become so addicted to—and so financially invested in—breakneck progress that it sometimes pretends that advancement is inevitable and there’s no science left to do. Science has the inconvenient property of sometimes stalling out. Silicon Valley may call A.I. companies “labs,” and some employees there “researchers,” but fundamentally it has an engineering culture that does whatever works. “It’s just so remarkable how little the machine-learning community bothers looking at, let alone respects, the history and cognitive science that precedes it,” Cohen said.</p><p>Today’s A.I. models owe their success to decades-old discoveries about the brain, but they are still deeply unlike brains. Which differences are incidental and which are fundamental? Every group of neuroscientists has its pet theory. These theories can be put to the test in a way that wasn’t possible before. Still, no one expects easy answers. The problems that continue to plague A.I. models “are solved by carefully identifying ways in which the models don’t behave as intelligently as we want them to and then addressing them,” Norman said. “That is still a human-scientist-in-the-loop process.”</p><p>In the nineties, billions of dollars poured into the Human Genome Project on the assumption that sequencing DNA might solve medicine’s most vexing problems: cancer, hereditary conditions, even aging. It was a time of bluster and confidence—the era of Dolly the cloned sheep and “Jurassic Park”—when biotech was ascendant and the commentariat reckoned with whether humans should be playing God. Biologists soon found that the reality was more complicated. We didn’t cure cancer or discover the causes of Alzheimer’s or autism. We learned that DNA tells just one part of the story of life. In fact, one could argue that biology got swept up in a kind of gene fever, fixating on DNA because we had the means to study and understand it.</p><p>Still, nobody would claim that Francis Crick was wrong when, on the day in 1953 that he helped confirm the structure of DNA, he walked into a Cambridge pub talking about having discovered the secret of life. He and his colleagues did more to demystify life than almost anyone, ever. The decades following their discovery were among the most productive and exciting in the history of science. DNA became a household term; every high schooler learns about the double helix.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>With A.I., we once again find ourselves in a moment of bluster and confidence. Sam Altman talks about raising half a trillion dollars to build Stargate, a new cluster of A.I. data centers, in the U.S. People discuss the race for superintelligence with a gravitas and an urgency that can seem ungrounded, even silly. But I suspect the reason that the Amodeis and Altmans of the world are making messianic pronouncements is that they believe that the basic picture of intelligence has been worked out; the rest is just details.</p><p>Even some neuroscientists believe that a crucial threshold has been crossed. “I really think it could be the right model for cognition,” Uri Hasson, a colleague of Cohen’s, Norman’s, and Lake’s at Princeton, said of neural networks. This upsets him as much as it excites him. “I have the opposite worry of most people,” he said. “My worry is not that these models are similar to us. It’s that we are similar to these models.” If simple training techniques can enable a program to behave like a human, maybe humans aren’t as special as we thought. Could it also mean that A.I. will surpass us not only in knowledge but also in judgment, ingenuity, cunning—and, as a result, power? To my surprise, Hasson told me that he is “worried these days that we might succeed in understanding how the brain works. Pursuing this question may have been a colossal mistake for humanity.” He likened A.I. researchers to nuclear scientists in the nineteen-thirties: “This is the most interesting time in the life of these people. And, at the same time, they know that what they are working on has grave implications for humanity. But they cannot stop because of the curiosity to learn.”</p><p>One of my favorite books by Hofstadter is a nerdy volume called “Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.” When I was in college, it electrified me. The premise was that a question such as “What is thinking?” was not merely philosophical but, rather, had a real answer. In 1995, when the book was published, Hofstadter and his research group could only gesture at what the answer might be. Thinking back on the book, I wondered whether Hofstadter would feel excited that A.I. researchers may have attained what he had yearned for: a mechanical account of the rudiments of thinking. When we spoke, however, he sounded profoundly disappointed—and frightened. Current A.I. research “confirms a lot of my ideas, but it also takes away from the beauty of what humanity is,” he told me. “When I was younger, much younger, I wanted to know what underlay creativity, the mechanisms of creativity. That was a holy grail for me. But now I want it to remain a mystery.” Perhaps the secrets of thinking are simpler than anyone expected—the kind of thing that a high schooler, or even a machine, could understand.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></article><div><div data-testid="RowWrapper" data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper"><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/james-somers">James Somers</a>, a writer and a computer programmer, first contributed to <em>The New Yorker</em> in 2018.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="ContentFooterBottom" data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><p data-testid="SectionTitle"><header>Read More</header></p><div data-testid="SummaryCollectionGridItems"><div data-item="{&quot;dangerousHed&quot;:&quot;Inside the Data Centers That Train A.I. and Drain the Electrical Grid&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:0,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;venue&quot;,&quot;hotelLink&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/11/03/inside-the-data-centers-that-train-ai-and-drain-the-electrical-grid#intcid=_the-new-yorker-article-bottom-recirc_ef471904-7277-4ed9-87c1-db6eb32a7e55_roberta-similarity1&quot;,&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;GridFourColumns&quot;}" role="button" tabindex="0"><a data-component-type="recirc-river" data-recirc-id="item-hed-1" data-recirc-pattern="summary-item" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/11/03/inside-the-data-centers-that-train-ai-and-drain-the-electrical-grid#intcid=_the-new-yorker-article-bottom-recirc_ef471904-7277-4ed9-87c1-db6eb32a7e55_roberta-similarity1" target="_self"><p>Inside the Data Centers That Train A.I. and Drain the Electrical Grid</p></a><p>A data center, which can use as much electricity as Philadelphia, is the new American factory, creating the future and propping up the economy.

The victim was hospitalised with injuries including broken ribs, a punctured lung and rectal damage, according to the indictment, and Tomer-Yerushalmi launched an investigation.</p><p>The government and far-right politicians and pundits have accused her of damaging Israel’s global standing by pursing the case and releasing the video, in effect casting her efforts to prosecute extreme violence as a project to undermine the state.</p><p>“The incident in Sde Teiman caused immense damage to the image of the state of Israel and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement on Sunday. “This is perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the state of Israel has experienced since its establishment.”</p><p>After the first detentions of soldiers in the case in summer 2024, a far-right mob gathered outside Sde Teiman calling for the investigation to be dropped.

Tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza have been killed in attacks and airstrikes over two years.</p><p>Attacks on Tomer-Yerushalemi over the Sde Teiman affair intensified in recent days amid reports that she was responsible for leaking the video. There were official demands for her to step down and personal threats online, even after she announced her resignation.</p><p>The campaign briefly halted on Sunday afternoon amid fears for her life, after her partner reported her missing to the police and her car was found empty at a beach in the Tel Aviv area with a note inside, Israeli media reported.</p><p>Then she was found, and within minutes the attacks resumed. The far-right commentator Yinon Magal posted on X, “we can proceed with the lynching”, adding a winking emoji.</p><p>Soon after, protesters had gathered outside her house, Israeli media reported, shouting slogans including “we will give you no peace”. The defence minister, Israel Katz, later accused her of “spreading blood libels”.</p><p>Traditionally Israel’s government and military have considered the existence of an independent judiciary a crucial barrier to international legal tribunals investigating Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians.</p><p>Where there is a robust national legal system willing and able to investigate and prosecute crimes, international courts are less likely to have jurisdiction to intervene.</p><p>“Don’t they understand we had no choice? That the only way to address the wave of international legal proceedings is by proving we can investigate ourselves?” the investigative reporter Ronen Bergman quoted the advocate general telling colleagues six weeks ago, in a report for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.</p><p>In recent decades many Israelis have seen the role of the military advocate general “as protecting soldiers from prosecution abroad”, said Prof Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Israel’s Open University.</p><p>“In other words, the law is not upheld as a value in itself, but as a defence against international tribunals.”</p><p>Now even such legal pragmatism is under attack by the political right, whose influence can be seen in the lack of legal accountability for soldiers’ conduct in Gaza over the past two years, Levy added.</p><p>“During the war, the advocate general gave the army a free hand in Gaza, for example, regarding the unprecedented collateral damage from airstrikes,” he said.</p><p>“This reflects a far weaker commitment to international law, with some on the right claiming that Israel is exempt from respecting it, and even providing religious justifications for this view.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Series Overview</p><p>This is the first in a series of posts on the true cost of a programming language.</p></div><section><h2 id="the-leadership-blindspot-how-identity-drives-multi-million-dollar-technical-debt">The Leadership Blindspot: How Identity Drives Multi-Million Dollar Technical Debt</h2><p>A programming language is the single most expensive choice a company makes, yet we treat it like a technical debate. After watching this mistake bankrupt dozens of companies and hurt hundreds more, I’ve learned the uncomfortable truth: these decisions are rarely about technology. They’re about identity, emotion, and ego, and they’re destroying your velocity and budget in ways you can’t see until it’s too late.</p></section><p>Early in my career, I worked at Takkle, a promising social network. A sudden departure vaulted me from lead engineer to VP of Engineering, leading a team of 12. While we were delivering on all our goals, I was in my early 20s and lacked experience, a risk our board wanted to fix. They pressured our CEO to recruit a CTO with more experience. I looked forward to learning from him; he was a well known figure in the Perl community and arrived with a stack of O’Reilly “camel” books.</p><p>One of his first acts was to pronounce our language, PHP, the wrong choice. He decreed a switch to Perl. This decree happened after what felt to me like a sham analysis comparing PHP and Perl.</p><p>Our velocity collapsed. Our team had to not only learn a new language but rebuild from scratch, delaying our product by nine months. Our monthly burn rate jumped from $200K to $500K as we more than doubled our size to make up for the lost velocity while building the new Perl based system, which halved our runway.</p><p>Our CTO did deliver, at least on some of his promises. We built a beautiful system, one I was truly proud of. But it was too late. By the time we finally launched, the market opportunity had vanished. Facebook had now expanded beyond colleges, and we were at the end of our monitary runway. The increased spend had shortened our runway by half, and we didn’t have enough momentum with the new site to reach the milestones required to raise more money.</p><p>I’ve often wondered: What if we had just stuck with PHP? We had a fine system and real momentum. We would have launched much earlier at a fraction of the cost. PHP was good enough for Facebook; why not us?</p><p>But the question that haunted me was: <em>Why did such an experienced leader make such an terrible mistake</em>?</p><div><p><strong>Promises Made</strong></p><ul><li>Switching to Perl would unlock the architecture we needed</li><li>Rebuilding from scratch would accelerate hiring and quality</li></ul><p><strong>Reality Delivered</strong></p><ul><li>Velocity collapsed as the team relearned and rebuilt everything</li><li>Burn rate jumped from $200K to $500K per month</li></ul></div><hr><h2 id="the-pattern-repeats">The Pattern Repeats</h2><p>As my career progressed I saw this same pattern over and over. As Languages Product Lead at Google, my group included C++, Java, Go, and Python. At MongoDB, I managed teams writing in 13 different languages. In both places I saw brilliant engineers arguing past each other, armed with conflicting data, all of it true, but none of it complete. At Google Cloud, I saw these same challenges across our customers.</p><p>Fast forward two decades from Takkle, and I had déjà vu. I watched as a VP of Engineering presented to leadership why his team needed to build their next system in Rust. The presentation eerily paralleled that Takkle experience. In that old presentation, nearly every reason the CTO gave for Perl was truer of PHP at the time. Now, every single reason given for choosing Rust in this presentation, Go was objectively better at. As an example: they cited “easy build and deploy” as a Rust advantage. It’s true that this is a strength of Rust, but Go’s nearly instant cross compilation and single static binary is even stronger than Rust in this specic critera with Rust’s very long build times.</p><p>It’s not that I think they should have chosen Go, Go would have been the wrong choice for their situation, and I believe Rust was the right choice. But what struck me was how broken their reasoning was. If they were making a logical argument, surely they would have considered Go and in doing so with their presented criteria they would have realized Go was a better option and, at the very least, refined their critera.</p><p>I pulled the VP aside after the meeting. “Walk me through how you evaluated other language candidates,” I said. His face went blank. “We… didn’t really look at any others,” he admitted. “Everyone’s talking about Rust.” There it was: a 50 million dollar decision made on hype, about to be green lit.</p><p>For me this was the moment of epiphany, finally an answer to the question for the beginning of my career. The presentation didn’t share an analysis, they hadn’t done one; it was a justification for a choice already made. This was a decision based purely on hype, emotion, and identity.</p><section><h2 id="every-technical-debate-is-really-two-conversations">Every Technical Debate Is Really Two Conversations</h2><p>In every language discussion, two conversations are happening simultaneously.</p><p><strong>The Visible Conversation</strong>: “Rust has memory safety without garbage collection.” “Go has faster compile times and easier deployment.” “Python has the richest ML ecosystem.”</p><p><strong>The Invisible Conversation</strong>: “I am a Rust programmer.” “I want to become a Rust programmer.” “I cannot imagine being someone who doesn’t choose Rust.”</p><p>If you just read that and thought “well, my last language choice was different, I was being rational,” your invisible conversation is running right now, defending itself while you read this sentence.</p><hr><p>My CTO at Takkle was having the invisible conversation. Every point in his visible Perl analysis was technically true, but it felt like a sham because it was only there to cover the much deeper invisible conversation. He wasn’t evaluating languages. He was protecting an identity he’d spent a decade building. What our company paid $300K per month extra for wasn’t better architecture or faster hiring. We paid for the opportunity for him to be a Perl CTO instead of a PHP CTO. That was the real transaction. The rebuild was just the payment plan.</p><p>That VP’s Rust presentation listed “easy build and deploy” as an advantage, technically true, but Go is objectively better on that specific criterion. If they were truly having the visible conversation, they would have caught that. They would have at least considered Go in their analysis.</p><p>They hadn’t. Because they weren’t having that conversation at all. And they were about to spend $50 million on the invisible one.</p></section><section><h2 id="the-neuroscience-of-why-you-cant-see-your-own-bias">The Neuroscience of Why You Can’t See Your Own Bias</h2><p>In one of the most <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/which-brain-networks-respond-when-someone-sticks-to-a-belief/">fascinating studies</a> done in the past 20 years, researchers set out to understand why people cling to beliefs even when confronted with overwhelming contradictory evidence. What <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39589">they discovered</a> fundamentally changed our understanding of human decision making.</p><p>The researchers recruited participants and first identified which beliefs were central to each person’s identity—their core political views, their fundamental values, the beliefs that defined who they were. Then, while participants lay in an fMRI scanner, the researchers presented them with carefully constructed challenges to these identity based beliefs, alongside challenges to beliefs the participants held but weren’t central to their sense of self.</p><p>The brain scans revealed something remarkable: these two types of challenges activated completely different neural pathways.</p><p>When a <em>peripheral belief</em> was challenged, something the person believed but wasn’t core to their identity, the brain’s reasoning centers activated normally. Participants could consider the evidence, weigh the arguments, and sometimes even change their minds.</p><p>But when an <em>identity based belief</em> was challenged, the brain responded as if under physical attack. The amygdala, your threat detection system, the same system that fires when you encounter a predator or a physical danger, activates immediately. The insular cortex, which processes emotional pain and disgust, lit up with activity. Most tellingly, the brain’s Default Mode Network, the system that maintains your sense of self and personal narrative, went into defensive mode, working to protect the existing identity rather than evaluate the new information.</p><p>In other words, your brain wasn’t weighing evidence. It was defending itself from an existential threat.</p><p>The researchers’ conclusion was stark: <strong>“To consider an alternative view, you have to imagine an alternative version of yourself.”</strong></p><p>Your brain can’t objectively evaluate challenges to identity based beliefs because doing so requires temporarily dismantling the neural architecture that defines who you are. It’s not a matter of being more rational or trying harder. The mechanism that would allow you to see the bias clearly is the same mechanism the bias has compromised.</p><p>Think about what this means in practice. Every time an engineer evaluates a language that isn’t “theirs,” their brain is literally working against them. They’re not just analyzing technical trade offs, they’re contemplating a version of themselves that doesn’t exist yet, that feels threatening to the version that does. The Python developer reads case studies about Go’s performance and their amygdala quietly marks each one as a threat to be neutralized. The Rust advocate looks at identical problems and their Default Mode Network constructs narratives about why “only” Rust can solve them.</p><p>We’re not lying. We genuinely believe our reasoning is sound. That’s what makes identity based thinking so expensive, and so invisible.</p></section><h2 id="weve-built-our-industry-around-the-wrong-conversation">We’ve Built Our Industry Around the Wrong Conversation</h2><p>We call ourselves Pythonistas, Gophers, Rustaceans, we wear these labels like badges, sometimes we even wear literal badges (t-shirts, stickers, etc). There’s a reason so many of our surnames come from people’s crafts: Potter, Smith, Brewer. What we do becomes who we are. What looks like decorative labels are really decision making frameworks that operate beneath conscious thought.</p><p>We’ve built our entire industry around the <em>visible conversation</em>. We train engineers to debate technical merits. We create decision frameworks based on feature matrices. We think if we just gather enough benchmarks and case studies, we’ll make the right choice.</p><p>But the <em>invisible conversation</em> is much stronger. It’s why my CTO chose Perl. It’s why that VP chose Rust. And it’s operating in your next language decision right now, invisible and unexamined.</p><p>The moment you hire a Rust developer to evaluate languages, you’ve already chosen Rust. You’ve just added a $2 million feasibility study to make the predetermined decision feel rational.</p><hr><h2 id="the-real-cost">The Real Cost</h2><p>The question isn’t whether this bias exists, the science is conclusive. The real question is: can you afford to let it make your decisions?</p><p>Because the invisible conversation has a price tag. Industry research suggests that technology stack decisions account for 40-60% of total development costs over a product’s lifecycle. <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">Research by Stripe</a> found that developers spend 42% of their time on technical debt. When you let identity drive that decision you’re mortgaging your velocity, your budget, and your runway to pay for someone’s sense of self.</p><p>The visible conversation is about technology. The invisible conversation is about identity. And the invisible conversation always wins.</p><hr><h2 id="a-new-framework-language-as-economic-decision">A New Framework: Language as Economic Decision</h2><p>So how do we win, when the invisible conversation is constantly working against us?&nbsp; Change the conversation entirely.</p><p>Instead of asking “which language is best?” we need to ask “what is this language going to cost us?” Not just in salaries, but in velocity, in technical debt, in hiring difficulty, in operational complexity, in every dimension that actually determines whether you survive.</p><p>Reframe it from a technical debate to an economic one. And unlike identity, economics can be measured, compared, and decided without anyone’s ego being threatened.</p><p>Choosing a programming language is the single most expensive economic decision your company will make. It will define your culture, constrain your budget, determine your hiring pipeline, set your operational costs, and ultimately dictate whether you can move fast enough to win your market.</p><p>We need a framework that makes the invisible costs visible. One that lets us have the economic conversation instead of the identity conversation. One that works whether you’re choosing your first language or evaluating a migration.</p><p>Our industry has never really had that framework… Until now.</p><div><p>Up Next</p><p>In my next post, I’ll introduce the 9 Factors of a Language’s True Cost: a comprehensive framework for evaluating language decisions based on economics, not identity. You’ll learn how to quantify the hidden costs, predict long term impact, and make defensible decisions that your team can align behind, regardless of their language preferences.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>November seems to be a ripe month for challenges. Some people grow facial hair. Some people write many words daily hoping to come out with a novel on the other side. I’m sure there are five other such efforts that I’m not aware of.</p>
<p>For me, I’m going to <a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/unplugging-two-weeks-later">continue</a> my push away from social networks. I’ve logged out of all personal accounts, set my YouTube to stop suggesting to me via algorithm, and even found myself logged out of Reddit yesterday. I’m set to have a no socials November!</p>
<p>Maybe some of you reading my blog are also finding yourself overly pulled by the lure of social networking and tempted to take a break? Perhaps join me and see how it feels? Log out, delete the apps from your phone, and start the challenging process of breaking that muscle memory today. I believe in a week you’ll feel pretty good about the decision.</p>
<p>No pressure to stay off socials after November is over. You may decide you want to go back to your same relationship with social networking in December. You may decide you want to go back, but differently. You may decide you want to stay away.</p>
<p>I might try to blog more. I might not. We’ll see! If you’d like to try blogging as an alternative, I recommend&nbsp; my good friend,&nbsp;<a href="https://pika.page/">Pika</a>. In solidarity with #nosocialsnovember, there’s even a NOSOCIALSNOVEMBER coupon code for 15% off your first year of the service.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts to share about stepping away from socials, email me via the link below. And if you’re blogging, let me know! I’d love to follow what you’re writing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-810-explicit-lazy-imports/104131?page=23">https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-810-explicit-lazy-imports/104131?page=23</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45800967">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>Dear PEP 810 authors.  The Steering Council is happy to unanimously<sup><a href="#footnote-276293-1" id="footnote-ref-276293-1">[1]</a></sup> accept “PEP 810, Explicit lazy imports”.  Congratulations!  We appreciate the way you were able to build on and improve the previously discussed (and rejected) attempt at lazy imports as proposed in PEP 690.</p>
<p>We have recommendations about some of the PEP’s details, a few suggestions for filling a couple of small gaps, and we have made decisions on the alternatives that you’ve left to the SC, all of which I’ll outline below.  If you have any questions, please do reach out to the SC for clarification, either here, on the SC tracker, or in office hours.</p>
<p>Use <code>lazy</code> as the keyword.  We debated many of the given alternatives (and some we came up with ourselves), and ultimately agreed with the PEP’s choice of the <code>lazy</code> keyword.  The closest challenger was <code>defer</code>, but once we tried to use that in all the places where the term is visible, we ultimately didn’t think it was as good an overall fit.  The same was true with all the other alternative keywords we could come up with, so… <strong><code>lazy</code> it is</strong>!</p>
<p>What about <code>from foo lazy import bar</code>?  <strong>Nope!</strong>  We like that in both module imports and <code>from</code>-imports that the <code>lazy</code> keyword is the first thing on the line.  It helps to visually recognize lazy imports of both varieties.</p>
<p>Leveraging a subclass of dict.  We don’t see a need for this complicated alternative; please add this to the rejected ideas.</p>
<p>Allowing <code>’*’</code> in <code>__lazy_modules__</code>.  We agree with the rationale for rejecting this idea; it can always be added later if needed.</p>
<p>One thing that the PEP does not mention is <code>.pth</code> files, which the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html">site.py</a> module processes, and which has some special handling for lines that begin with the string <code>'import'</code> followed by a space or tab.  It doesn’t make much sense for <code>.pth</code> files to support lazy imports, so we suggest that the PEP explicitly says that this special handling in <code>.pth</code> files will not be adapted to handle lazy imports.</p>
<p>There currently is no way to get the active filter mode, so please add a <code>sys.get_lazy_imports()</code> function.  Also, do you think appending <code>_mode</code> to their names makes the purpose of these functions clearer?  We leave that up to the PEP authors.</p>
<p>The PEP should be explicit about the precedence order between the different ways to set the mode, i.e. <code>$PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS=&lt;mode&gt;</code>, <code>-X lazy_imports=&lt;mode&gt;</code>, and <code>sys.set_lazy_imports()</code>.  In all expectation, it will follow the same precedence order as other similar settings, but the PEP should be explicit.</p>
<p>We agree that the PEP should take no position on any style recommendations for sorting lazy imports.  While we generally like the idea of grouping lazy imports together, let’s leave that up to the linters and auto-formatters to decide the details.</p>
<p>That should just about cover it.  Again, thank you for your work on this, as it’s been a feature so many in the Python community have wanted for so long.  Given the earlier attempts and existing workarounds, we think this strikes exactly the right balance.</p>
<p>-Barry, on behalf of the Python Steering Council</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>November 3, 2025</p><article><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald"><img src="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/images/python-to-node-pr.png" alt="Python to Node migration"></a></p>
<p>We just did something crazy: we completely rewrote our backend from Python to Node just one week after our launch.</p>
<p>We did this so we can scale. Yes, scale. A week in.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's a good time right? The codebase is still small and we don't have too many users.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it goes completely against the advice given to early-stage startups which is to just ship and sell, and worry about scale once you've hit product-market-fit. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html">"Do things that don't scale"</a>, as PG put it.</p>
<p>You see, we didn't have a magical launch week that flooded us with users and force us to scale. And generally you can expect that any stack you pick should be able to scale reasonably well for a long time until you actually get to the point where you should consider changing frameworks or rewriting your backend in a different language (read: Rust).</p>
<p>So why do it?</p>
<h2 id="python-async-sucks"><a href="#python-async-sucks"></a>Python async sucks</h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of Django. I was introduced to it at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a> and it's become my go-to backend for most projects since. It gets you off the ground really fast, has great tooling and abstractions, and is still flexible enough to tweak to your needs.</p>
<p>So naturally, when I started writing our backend at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald">Skald</a>, I started us off with Django too.</p>
<p>Now, we make a lot of calls to LLM and embedding APIs at Skald, so we're generally doing a lot of network I/O that we'd like to be async. Not only that, we often want to fire a lot of requests concurrently, such as when need to generate vector embeddings for the various chunks of a document.</p>
<p>And things quickly got really messy in Django.</p>
<p>I'll preface this by saying that neither of us has a lot of experience writing Python async code (I've mostly <a href="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/thread-pool">worked on</a> async-heavy services in Node) but I think this is partly the point here: <strong>it's really hard and unintuitive to write solid and performant Python async code</strong>. You need to go deep into the foundations of everything in order to be able to do so.</p>
<p>I'm actually really interested in spending proper time in becoming more knowledgeable with Python async, but in our context you a) lose precious time that you need to use to ship as an early-stage startup and b) can shoot yourself in the foot very easily in the process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I thought I was to blame. "Bad programmer! Bad programmer!" was what I was hearing in my head as I tried to grasp everything. But while more knowledgeable folks would certainly have a better time, we discovered that the foundations of Python async are actually a bit shaky too.</p>
<p>Unlike JavaScript, which had the event loop from the beginning, and Go, that created the concept of goroutines (both concurrency models that I quite like and have used in production), Python async support was patched on later, and that's where the difficulty lies.</p>
<p>Two blog posts that cover this really well are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/why-isnt-python-async-more-popular.html">"Python has had async for 10 years -- why isn't it more popular?"</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://harshal.sheth.io/2025/09/12/python-async.html">"Python concurrency: gevent had it right"</a>, both conveniently published not long before I started digging into all this.</p>
<p>As for us, we learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python doesn't have native async file I/O.</li>
<li>Django still doesn't have full async support. Async in the ORM is not done yet and the colored functions problem really shines here. You can technically use Django with async, but their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/async/">docs on this</a> have so many caveats that it should scare anyone.</li>
<li>You gotta write <code><span><span>sync_to_async</span></span></code> and <code><span><span>async_to_sync</span></span></code> <strong>everywhere</strong>.</li>
<li>All sorts of models have emerged to bring better async support to different parts of the Python ecosystem, but as they're not native they have their own caveats. For instance, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pypi.org/project/aiofiles/">aiofiles</a> brings async API-compatible file operations but uses a thread pool under the hood, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gevent.org/">Gevent</a> with its greenlets is pretty cool but it literally patches the stdlib in order to work.</li>
<li>Due to a lot of async support in Python relying on layers that sit on top of the language rather than being native, you need to be careful about the async code you write as it will have different implications depending on e.g. the Gunicorn worker type you run (good luck learning much about those from the Gunicorn docs, btw).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, just getting an equivalent of <code><span><span>Promise</span><span>.</span><span>all</span></span></code> to work, while understanding all of its gotchas was not simple at all.</p>
<p>Faced with this, I went into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/posthog/posthog">PostHog codebase</a>.</p>
<p>I worked at PostHog for three years and we had no async in the Django codebase back then but they're a massive company and they have AI features now so they must have figured this out!</p>
<p>And what I realized was that they're still running WSGI (not ASGI) with Gunicorn Gthread workers (where the max concurrent requests you're able to handle is usually max 4x CPU cores), thus not getting much benefit from running things async. The codebase also has a lot of utils to make async work properly, like their own implementation of <code><span><span>async_to_sync</span></span></code>. So I guess way they're handling a lot of load is probably just horizontal scaling.</p>
<p>There's simply no great way to run async in Django.</p>
<h2 id="ok-now-what"><a href="#ok-now-what"></a>Ok, now what?</h2>
<p>We essentially concluded that Django was going to hurt us really soon, not just when we started to have a lot of load.</p>
<p>Without too many users we'd already need to start running multiple machines in order to not have terrible latency, plus we'd be writing clunky code that would be hard to maintain.</p>
<p>We could of course just "do things that don't scale" for now and just solve the problem with money (or AWS credits), but it didn't feel right. And being so early would make the migration to another framework much easier.</p>
<p>At this point, some people are probably screaming at their screens going: "just use FastAPI!" -- and we did indeed consider it.</p>
<p>FastAPI does have proper async support and is quite a loved framework said to be performant. And if you want an ORM with it you could use SQLAlchemy which also supports async.</p>
<p>Migrating to FastAPI would have probably saved us a day or two (our migration took 3 days) due to being able to reuse a lot of code without translating it, but at this point we weren't feeling great about the Python async ecosystem overall, and we had actually already written our background worker service in Node, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to go all-in on one ecosystem.</p>
<p>And so migrate to Node we did. We took a little time picking the framework + ORM combo but settled on Express + MikroORM.</p>
<p>Yeah sure Express is old but it's battle-tested and feels familiar. Coming over to the JS event loop was the main point of all this anyway.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-gained-what-we-lost"><a href="#what-we-gained-what-we-lost"></a>What we gained, what we lost</h2>
<h3 id="gained-efficiency"><a href="#gained-efficiency"></a>Gained: Efficiency</h3>
<p>Our initial benchmarks show we've gained ~3x throughput out of the box and that's just with us running what is mostly sequential code in an async context. Being over on Node now, we're planning on doing a lot concurrent processing when chunking, embedding, reranking, and so on. This means this change should have an even greater payoff over time.</p>
<h3 id="lost-django"><a href="#lost-django"></a>Lost: Django</h3>
<p>Losing Django hurts, and we've already found ourselves building a lot more middleware and utilities ourselves on the Express side. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adonisjs.com/">Adonis</a> exists, which is a more fully-featured Node framework, but moving to a whole new ecosystem felt like more work to us than just using something minimal.</p>
<p>What I'm missing the most is the ORM, which in my opinion is really ergonomic. And while you always have to be careful with ORMs when looking to extract the best possible performance, the Django ORM does do some nice things under the hood in order to make it performant enough to write queries in Python, and I learned a bit more about this when migrating our Django models over to MikroORM entities.</p>
<h3 id="gained-mikroorm"><a href="#gained-mikroorm"></a>Gained: MikroORM</h3>
<p>MikroORM was a consolation prize in this whole migration. I still much prefer the Django ORM but at the same time different ecosystems call for different tooling.</p>
<p>I'd never used it before and was positively surprised to find Django-like lazy loading, a migrations setup that felt much better than Prisma's, as well as a reasonably ergonomic API (once you manually set up the foundations right).</p>
<p>Overall, we're early into this change, but currently happy to have picked MikroORM over the incumbent Prisma.</p>
<h3 id="lost-the-python-ecosystem"><a href="#lost-the-python-ecosystem"></a>Lost: The Python ecosystem</h3>
<p>I think this is pretty self-explanatory. While most tools for building RAGs and agents have Python and TypeScript SDKs, Python still takes priority, and we're just talking about API wrappers here.</p>
<p>Once you want to actually get into ML stuff yourself, there's just no competition. I suspect that as we get more sophisticated we'll end up having a Python service, but for now we're ok.</p>
<h3 id="gained-unified-codebase"><a href="#gained-unified-codebase"></a>Gained: Unified codebase</h3>
<p>We'd always realized that migrating to Node would mean we'd have two Node services instead of a Python one and a Node one, but it didn't occur to us until a day in that we could actually merge the codebases and that that would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>There was a lot of duplicate logic across the Node worker and the Django server, and now we've unified the Express server and background worker into one codebase, which feels so much better. They can both use the ORM now (previously the worker was running raw SQL) and share a bunch of utils.</p>
<h3 id="gained-much-better-testing"><a href="#gained-much-better-testing"></a>Gained: Much better testing</h3>
<p>This is not a <code><span><span>pytest</span></span></code> vs <code><span><span>jest</span></span></code> thing, it's just that in order to make sure everything was working as expected after migrating, we just wrote a ton more tests. This and some refactoring were welcome side benefits.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-did-it"><a href="#how-we-did-it"></a>How we did it</h2>
<p>I think it's about time to wrap this post up, but here are some quick notes about the actual migration process.</p>
<ul>
<li>It took us three days.</li>
<li>We barely used AI code generation at all until the final bits -- it felt important to us to understand the foundations of our new setup really well, particularly the inner workings of the new ORM. Once we had the foundations of everything down Claude Code was quite helpful in generating code for some less important endpoints, and also helped us in scanning the codebase for issues.</li>
<li>We almost quit multiple times. We were getting customer requests for new features and had some bugs in the Django code and it felt like we were wasting time migrating instead of serving customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="would-we-do-it-again"><a href="#would-we-do-it-again"></a>Would we do it again?</h2>
<p>Honestly, we're quite happy with our decision and would 100% do it again. Not only will this pay off in the long term but it's already paying off today.</p>
<p>We learned a lot of stuff in the process too, and if the whole point of this whole post is that someone comes to tell me that we're dumb and we should just have done X or Y, or comes to teach me about how Python async works, then that will honestly be great. For my part, I gladly recognize my inexperience with Python async and if I can learn more about it, that's a win.</p>

<div><p>MixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time</p><p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.</p><p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. 
For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>--</p><p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.</p><p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.</p><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-junior-software-engineer-global-remote">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j...</a>

My experience has been indie SaaS development following professional experience as a developer early in my career and a Masters in Computer &amp; Electronic Engineering.</p><p>I also come with a whole career specifying, planning and deploying tech into mission/safety critical applications e.g. aviation and rail. I have led large multidisciplinary teams, undertaken advanced user-engagement and have great working knowledge of commercial and financial management.</p><p>Looking to pivot out of business development and "traditional" engineering, but have the domain knowledge, discipline, and attention to detail to get things done.

I'm a backend/platform engineer and developer advocate with over 10 years of experience building systems at scale across startups and growth-stage companies like Uber and DoorDash.</p><p>Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support.</p><p>At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling.</p><p>I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016.</p><p>After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense.</p><p>Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia.

I'm a developer who believes code isn't valuable unless it's used. That's why I start with conversations, not commits. I work to understand real problems before reaching for shiny new packages. I build tools that are simple, effective, and easy to adopt. My goal is always to solve the problem and make sure people know there’s a solution.
In my next role, I'm looking to work with a team that values clarity and impact. I'm especially interested in data heavy environments where thoughtful tooling can make workflows better.
Most recently, I built [Buckaroo](<a href="https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo</a>) an open source data table for Jupyter using Pandas/Polars. It combines fast rendering, summary stats, and a low-code UI.

Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps.

Hi, I'm Vincent, an engineer with 10+ years of experience working in all parts of the engineering stack. Most recently I've worked on the front end side of things and am specialized in using React professionally, but I'm quick to pick up new technologies as necessary. (personally I prefer Svelte when working on my own projects) Go and Typescript are my two favorite languages. I've consistently been told by my managers that I work fast or was one of the best engineers they had on their team.</p><p>Personally I'm looking for a job that I feel like actually has some kind of positive benefit on the world, or something that seems particularly challenging or interesting. This can range anywhere from a note-taking application to managing retirement funds to writing a Typescript to Go compiler to writing a new database. I'm not interested in one of the 5 million AI hype cycle jobs (partly because I dislike LLMs), and I actively hate the blockchain, ads, and tracking users. I do not, and will never, compromise on privacy issues.</p><p>A list of things you should know about me and how I'm going to do my best work for you:</p><p>* I want to be able to work on something a bit more interesting than another simple REST application.</p><p>* I want my hours to be flexible, meaning when I start/end or being able to take some time in the middle of the day for groceries or a doctors appointment.</p><p>* I want to be able to come up with ideas I think would be useful/interesting and be given some time to work on them. I know that there are things I'm going to have to do for the business that aren't going to be these things, but I need some amount of time to do this or I'm going to struggle as a worker.</p><p>* I'm going to have strong opinions about all sorts of things, and I expect to be able to have a conversation about them and not just be dismissed.</p><p>* I'm going to want to improve things, and if I continuously get told "no", it's going to kill my morale.</p><p>I've previously lived in Japan a couple decades ago and studied the language intensively for 2 years at that time in one of the schools dedicated to helping foreigners go to university or get jobs there. (specifically at: 東京平田日本語学院. I almost passed JLPT N2 then, but I'm nowhere close to that level currently) I've recently been picking back up on studying Japanese again to maybe fulfill a long-held dream of going back to Japan longer than a vacation. So on the off chance you're someone in Japan hiring for a position you think I'd be a fit for (and you're not a black company), please reach out.</p><p>NOTE: I am going on an extended trip to Japan in November and December 2025, so while I'm open to doing interviews (time zones notwithstanding), I will not be able to start working until 2026</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45805424"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45805424" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45805424&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45800464"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Location: Remote, Canada</p><p>Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS</p><p>Interests : systems programming, 2D &amp; 3D graphics, performance</p><p>--------</p><p>Hello, my name is Jesse.</p><p>I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before. My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler and a (really sweet) cycle simulator &amp; debugger.</p><p>In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack. I'm comfortable working in soft-realtime environments which are heavily multithreaded/async, and performance is a key acceptance criteria. I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines. I have working knowledge of interpreters and dynamic language runtimes, including GCs. I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to.</p><p>In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly. I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external. I have a long track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better.</p><p>I'm a natural leader; informal teams coalesce around me when I'm not in a labelled position of leadership. I aspire to someday, maybe in the far future, become a strong technical leader. One of my best qualities is my (nearly) unwavering personal vendetta against mediocrity. I'm generally friendly and easy to get along with, but do not hesitate to volunteer constructive criticism where I see room for improvement. This has caused friction for me in the past, but I'm now generally good at gently steering my teammates in the direction of technical excellence.</p><p>In my personal life, I enjoy travelling, surfing, climbing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, pirates, and attending raves. I like the phrase "have strong opinions, weakly held".</p><p>If I was born to do one thing in this world, it's program computers.</p><p>Jesse</p><p>--------</p><p><a href="https://scallywag.software/" rel="nofollow">https://scallywag.software</a></p><p><a href="https://scallywag.software/resume.html" rel="nofollow">https://scallywag.software/resume.html</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/scallyw4g" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/scallyw4g</a></p><p>jesse@scallywag.software</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45804280"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45804280" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45804280&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45800464"></a></center></td><td><br>
