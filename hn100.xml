<h2>Breaking Changes and Compatibility Notes</h2>
<h3>Classic Queues is Now a Non-Replicated Queue Type</h3>
<p>After three years of deprecated, classic queue mirroring was completely removed in this version.<br>
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues" rel="nofollow">Quorum queues</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams" rel="nofollow">streams</a> are two mature<br>
replicated data types offered by RabbitMQ 4.x. Classic queues continue being supported without any breaking changes<br>
for client libraries and applications but they are now a non-replicated queue type.</p>
<p>After an upgrade to 4.0, all classic queue mirroring-related parts of policies will have no effect.<br>
Classic queues will continue to work like before but with only one replica.</p>
<p>Clients will be able to connect to any node to publish to and consume from any non-replicated classic queues.<br>
Therefore applications will be able to use the same classic queues as before.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/migrate-mcq-to-qq" rel="nofollow">Mirrored Classic Queues Migration to Quorum Queues</a> for guidance<br>
on how to migrate to quorum queues for the parts of the system that really need to use replication.</p>
<h3>Quorum Queues Now Have a Default Redelivery Limit</h3>
<p>Quorum queues now have a default <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">redelivery limit</a> set to <code>20</code>.<br>
Messages that are redelivered 20 times or more will be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx" rel="nofollow">dead-lettered</a> or dropped (removed).</p>
<p>This limit is necessary to protect nodes from consumers that run into infinite fail-requeue-fail-requeue loops. Such<br>
consumers can drive a node out of disk space by making a quorum queue Raft log grow forever without allowing compaction<br>
of older entries to happen.</p>
<p>If 20 deliveries per message is a common scenario for a queue, a dead-lettering target or a higher limit must be configured<br>
for such queues. The recommended way of doing that is via a <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies" rel="nofollow">policy</a>.<br>
See the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">Position Messaging Handling</a> section<br>
in the quorum queue documentation guide.</p>
<p>Note that increasing the limit is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests<br>
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit<br>
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.</p>
<p>For specific cases where the RabbitMQ configuration cannot be updated to include a dead letter policy<br>
the delivery limit can be disabled by setting a delivery limit configuration of <code>-1</code>. However, the RabbitMQ team<br>
strongly recommends keeping the delivery limit in place to ensure cluster availability isn't<br>
accidentally sacrificed.</p>
<h3>CQv1 Storage Implementation was Removed</h3>
<p>CQv1, <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10656" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10656/hovercard">the original classic queue storage layer, was removed</a><br>
except for the part that's necessary for upgrades to CQv2 (the 2nd generation).</p>
<p>In case <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> explicitly sets <code>classic_queue.default_version</code> to <code>1</code> like so</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# this configuration value is no longer supported,
# remove this line or set the version to 2
classic_queue.default_version = 1"><pre><span><span>#</span> this configuration value is no longer supported,</span>
<span><span>#</span> remove this line or set the version to 2</span>
<span>classic_queue.default_version</span> = 1</pre></div>
<p>nodes will now fail to start. Removing the line will make the node start and perform<br>
the migration from CQv1 to CQv2.</p>
<h3>Settings <code>cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.*</code> were Removed</h3>
<p>The following two deprecated <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> settings were <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12050" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12050/hovercard">removed</a>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max"><pre><code>cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max
</code></pre></div>
<p>RabbitMQ 4.0 will fail to boot if these settings are configured in <code>rabbitmq.conf</code>.</p>
<h3>Several Disk I/O-Related Metrics were Removed</h3>
<p>Several I/O-related metrics are dropped, they should be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#system-metrics" rel="nofollow">monitored at the infrastructure and kernel layers</a></p>
<h3>Default Maximum Message Size Reduced to 16 MiB</h3>
<p>Default maximum message size is reduced to 16 MiB (from 128 MiB).</p>
<p>The limit can be increased via a <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> setting:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# 32 MiB
max_message_size = 33554432"><pre><span><span>#</span> 32 MiB</span>
<span>max_message_size</span> = 33554432</pre></div>
<p>However, it is recommended that such large multi-MiB messages are put into a blob store, and their<br>
IDs are passed around in messages instead of the entire payload.</p>
<h3>AMQP 1.0</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 3.13 <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> setting <code>rabbitmq_amqp1_0.default_vhost</code> is unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.</p>
<p>Instead <code>default_vhost</code> will be used to determine the default vhost an AMQP 1.0 client connects to(i.e. when the AMQP 1.0 client<br>
does not define the vhost in the <code>hostname</code> field of the <code>open</code> frame).</p>
<p>Starting with RabbitMQ 4.0, RabbitMQ strictly validates that<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-delivery-annotations" rel="nofollow">delivery annotations</a>,<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-message-annotations" rel="nofollow">message annotations</a>, and<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-footer" rel="nofollow">footer</a> contain only<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-annotations" rel="nofollow">non-reserved annotation keys</a>.<br>
As a result, clients can only send symbolic keys that begin with <code>x-</code>.</p>
<h3>MQTT</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 3.13 <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file" rel="nofollow">rabbitmq.conf</a> settings <code>mqtt.default_user</code>, <code>mqtt.default_password</code>,<br>
and <code>amqp1_0.default_user</code> are unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.</p>
<p>Instead, set the new RabbitMQ 4.0 settings <code>anonymous_login_user</code> and <code>anonymous_login_pass</code> (both values default to <code>guest</code>).<br>
For production scenarios, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/production-checklist#anonymous-login" rel="nofollow">disallow anonymous logins</a>.</p>
<h3>TLS Client (LDAP, Shovels, Federation) Defaults</h3>
<p>Starting with Erlang 26, client side <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl#peer-verification" rel="nofollow">TLS peer certificate chain verification</a> settings are enabled by default in most contexts:<br>
from federation links to shovels to TLS-enabled LDAP client connections.</p>
<p>If using TLS peer certificate chain verification is not practical or necessary, it can be disabled.<br>
Please refer to the docs of the feature in question, for example,<br>
this one <a href="http://rabbitmq.com/docs/ldap/#tls" rel="nofollow">on TLS-enabled LDAP client</a> connections,<br>
two others on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/shovel#tls" rel="nofollow">TLS-enabled dynamic shovels</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/uri-query-parameters" rel="nofollow">dynamic shovel URI query parameters</a>.</p>
<h3>Shovels</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ Shovels will be able connect to a RabbitMQ 4.0 node via AMQP 1.0 only when the Shovel runs on a RabbitMQ node &gt;= <code>3.13.7</code>.</p>
<p>TLS-enabled Shovels will be affected by the TLS client default changes in Erlang 26 (see above).</p>
<h2>Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes</h2>
<p>This release <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang" rel="nofollow">requires Erlang 26.2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang#erlang-repositories" rel="nofollow">Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases</a> explains<br>
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x.</p>
<h2>Release Artifacts</h2>
<p>RabbitMQ releases are distributed via <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases">GitHub</a>.<br>
<a href="https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian/" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> and <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-rpm/" rel="nofollow">RPM packages</a> are available via<br>
repositories maintained by the RabbitMQ Core Team.</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/" rel="nofollow">Community Docker image</a>, <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rabbitmq" rel="nofollow">Chocolatey package</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-homebrew" rel="nofollow">Homebrew formula</a><br>
are other installation options. They are updated with a delay.</p>
<h2>Upgrading to 4.0</h2>
<h3>Documentation guides on upgrades</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade" rel="nofollow">Upgrading guide</a> for documentation on upgrades and <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases">GitHub releases</a><br>
for release notes of individual releases.</p>
<p>This release series only supports upgrades from <code>3.13.x</code>.</p>
<p>This release requires <strong>all feature flags</strong> in the 3.x series (specifically <code>3.13.x</code>) to be enabled before upgrading,<br>
there is no upgrade path from 3.12.14 (or a later patch release) straight to <code>4.0.0</code>.</p>
<h3>Required Feature Flags</h3>
<p>This release <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/feature-flags#graduation" rel="nofollow">graduates</a> all feature flags introduced up to <code>3.13.0</code>.</p>
<p>All users must enable all stable [feature flags] before upgrading to 4.0 from<br>
the latest available 3.13.x patch release.</p>
<h3>Mixed version cluster compatibility</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 4.0.0 nodes can run alongside <code>3.13.x</code> nodes. <code>4.0.x</code>-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster<br>
upgrade to 4.0.0 or a later patch release in the new series.</p>
<p>While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes will be covered in future updates.<br>
Once all nodes are upgraded to 4.0.0, these irregularities will go away.</p>
<p>Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended<br>
periods of time (no more than a few hours).</p>
<h3>Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures</h3>
<h4>Configure Dead Lettering or Increase the Limit for Frequently Redelivered Messages</h4>
<p>In environments where messages can experience 20 redeliveries, the affected queues should have <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx" rel="nofollow">dead lettering</a><br>
configured (usually via a <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies" rel="nofollow">policy</a>) to make sure<br>
that messages that are redelivered 20 times are moved to a separate queue (or stream) instead of<br>
being dropped (removed) by the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">crash-requeue-redelivery loop protection mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the limit can be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">increased</a> using a policy.<br>
This option is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests<br>
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit<br>
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.</p>

- Nothing will be live-streamed or recorded without your permission.</code></pre></blockquote><h4>Frequently asked Questions</h4><blockquote><pre><code><span data-text-attribute-id="ee601f96-5148-4251-b275-aa13197193f7">1) Is an EOL software or product in scope, even if there are components within it that are not EOL?
</span>
A: Yes, but there are caveats: the spirit of this event is to help identify and notify vendors of vulnerabilities in EOL software or products, and all submissions should be in this spirit.
If an EOL item has components that are not EOL within it, that’s fine. However, non-EOL components should not be the focus of the vulnerability or chain - we are not looking for exploits in current systems. If you have questions, please reach out via the submission process and we will work with you to ensure the submission is appropriate for the event.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="a64773bc-7087-4f7b-8765-1464461c1fb0">2) What should my Junkyard pitch at DistrictCon look like? </span>

For the maximum audience enjoyment and clarity of your awesome work, we prefer you presenting a live demo against the EOL system. We know this won't always be practical, so we will work with you during submission review to find the right way. As part of your demonstrated chain, the judges are (among other things) looking for proof of control and execution. 

Given the broad swath of valid targets, we know this may differ in what that means, but two "traditional" examples are to pop a shell and confirm root privileges, or demonstrate arbitrary code execution.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="4f60b934-ec85-40cd-99e1-da056f2b6634">3) What is EOL for Open Source, specifically with an archived repository? </span>

If the software you’re attempting to exploit is an archived repository, first ask if (a) the software moved to a new home and (b) is the archived repo a fork and the substantially similar project is still active? 

If the maintainer confirms they are not maintaining the given version or product, you should be good to go. Otherwise feel free to reach out to the DistrictCon Junkyard Team via the submission process, or via outreach@districtcon.org with additional questions.</code></pre></blockquote><h4>I have More questions.</h4><blockquote><pre><code>Additional details such as the responsible disclosure timelines and any assistance from the conference will be published when available. Please contact outreach@districtcon.org for more details.</code></pre><pre><code>In the case of similar bugs, our team will work privately with the submitters to deduplicate appropriately. </code></pre></blockquote>

That warning showed&nbsp;the patient's white blood cell count was "really, really high,"&nbsp;recalled Bell, the clinical nurse educator for the hospital's general medicine program.</p><p dir="ltr">The cause turned out to be cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to extensive tissue damage, amputations&nbsp;and even death. Bell said the patient was given antibiotics quickly to avoid those worst-case scenarios, in large part thanks to the team's in-house AI technology, dubbed Chartwatch.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's lots and lots of other scenarios where patients' conditions are flagged earlier, and the nurse is alerted earlier, and interventions are put in earlier," she said.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md">https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41578483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why wordfreq will not be updated</h2><a id="user-content-why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated" aria-label="Permalink: Why wordfreq will not be updated" href="#why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The wordfreq data is a snapshot of language that could be found in various
online sources up through 2021. There are several reasons why it will not be
updated anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generative AI has polluted the data</h2><a id="user-content-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data" aria-label="Permalink: Generative AI has polluted the data" href="#generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by
humans.</p>
<p dir="auto">The open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq's data sources. Now the Web at
large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to
communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word
frequencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and
often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as
real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their
output crops up everywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">As one example, <a href="https://pshapira.net/2024/03/31/delving-into-delve/" rel="nofollow">Philip Shapira
reports</a> that ChatGPT
(OpenAI's popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed
with the word "delve" in a way that people never have been, and caused its
overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Information that used to be free became expensive</h2><a id="user-content-information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive" aria-label="Permalink: Information that used to be free became expensive" href="#information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more
conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and
Reddit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free
access to a portion of their "firehose", the terms of use did not allow me to
distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso).
wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the
collected data didn't belong to me and I don't have it anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has
been replaced with an oligarch's plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool
called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn't), there
would be no valuable information to be found there.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their
archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay.</p>
<p dir="auto">And given what's happening to the field, I don't blame them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I don't want to be part of this scene anymore</h2><a id="user-content-i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore" aria-label="Permalink: I don't want to be part of this scene anymore" href="#i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus
linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field I know as "natural language processing" is hard to find these days.
It's all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but
generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It's
rare to see NLP research that doesn't have a dependency on closed data
controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise.</p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages.
That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing
someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly
used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive.
If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or
public posts, it's very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine
that will claim your words as its own.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI,
or that could benefit generative AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a
very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that
they made themselves.</p>

</p>


    <p>There was a time when software (and games! Games are just software for fun!) were distributed on DVD. A physical disk that you would insert into your system to load up software and install. This was the 2000's, when computers prided themselves on being personal computation devices. A <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> was a curiosity at the time, promising to run most of your software in "someone else's computer"; all you needed was the internet and the interface. The Chromebook was a reckoning. Through the 2010's we slowly moved into the clouds of various giants; it was the easy way to compute. The giants were renting out services - subscriptions started gaining foothold as the second best way to make money online after advertisements - and we were happy to give away the control in exchange for convenience. A minor consequence of this is that an entire generation of computer scientists hasn't had the opportunity to start off as computer enthusiasts - the primordial hacker mindset is slowly waning in prominence.</p>
<p>It is 2024, and I say it is time we revisited some of the fundamental joys of setting up our own systems.</p>
<p>Why? Good question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophically, it is a form of rebellion, carving out a niche in a world dominated by monopolies, resisting the forces that be from having complete control over our digital selves. Showing the world a <em>different</em> way of living. One of the last bastions of online freedom, self-hosters stand alongside open-source-ers, data-hoard-ers, privacy-ers, matrix/activity-pub/decentralized-tech-ers, piracy-ers, de-google-ers and hack-ers.</li>
<li>Practically, it is foolishness, for what you save in money you lose in time and sanity. Seriously, else-hosting is the practical option, let someone else worry about the reliability, concurrency, redundancy and availability of your systems.</li>
<li>Intellectually, it is the digital garage of constant tweaking of systems, a source of zen and arcane knowledge. Where you retire after a day's work to work on your favourite toys.</li>
</ul>
<p>So most importantly, it is supposed to be fun. A hobby.</p>
<p>And like every hobby there are a lot of gatekeepers. People who believe having a personal server that you can <em>touch</em> is a necessity to call yourself a self-hoster. Eh. Don't listen to them. Self-hosting is as much about the software as it is about the hardware. I say we get the enthusiasts by any means necessary; they will eventually grow into full-fledged self-hosting. Or not. It doesn't matter! This is supposed to be fun, why are you stopping people from having fun?</p>
<p>And so, here is a gentle introduction to self-hosting that is not "true self-hosting", but whatever. Sue me. We will operate at the software level only, and laugh at the feeble protestations of the rigidly-defined self-hoster loyalists. We will dispense with the heavy prose after this point.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/uberspace.png" alt="uberspace"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shared web hosting service is a web hosting service where many services reside on one web server connected to the Internet. The overall cost of server maintenance is spread over many customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need a space to host. I recommend <a href="https://uberspace.de/en/">Uberspace</a>. They are the most heart-warmingly nice people about hosting; they operate on the idea of "here's a screwdriver, try not to burn down the building, but have fun". Excellent.</p>
<p>So, make an account on Uberspace - did I also mention that you pay after the month ends, so technically everyone gets a free month of trial? I mean, can they get more awesome? (pst, they do).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the cool part: you now have SSH access to a computer in the cloud with 10GB of storage and 1.5GB of RAM. Go ahead, do it now. Run <code>ls</code> to be greeted by your brand spanking new empty user directory.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3><p>What to do, what to install…. I will give you two resources to peruse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/">Uberspace Labs</a> - An Uberspace specific installation guide to various software that you can play around with on Uberspace. Highly recommend searching for anything you want here first.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome-Selfhosted</a> - A broader listing of self-hostable software. If it is on here, it means there is a decent amount of community behind that software; it should cover 90% of the broadly self-hostable programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot use Docker in Uberspace. The memory constraints are too low to run a full virtualization suite. Which is a bummer for the larger software and docker-only installations <strong>but</strong> there are workarounds for it. You can install software from source or pull the final run-time from the dockerisation process and use it as a build image (I leave this as an exercise for the intrepid reader :)).</p>
<p><em>But what exactly do I install first??</em>  Alright, alright. Author suggests the following two trackers - one for finance, and one for videos and website updates.</p>
<h3 id="actual-budget">Actual Budget</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/actual.png" alt="actual"></p>
<p>Have you always wanted a way to track your finances - expenditures, net worth, spend patterns, etc.? Have also been wary of putting all this sensitive information in the hands of others? What if there was a way to be in control of your data, yet have it accessible across the world via a browser?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://actualbudget.com/"><em>Actual Budget</em></a> is a super fast and privacy-focused app for managing your finances. At its heart is the well proven and much loved Envelope Budgeting methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use this and I have written a guide on how to install this <a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_actual/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to peek into the reports section - you should be able to slice and dice your finances and gain tons of insight out of it. For instance, turns out what I considered to be minor purchases actually add up over the month, and I spend an inordinate amount of money on commute!</p>
<h3 id="miniflux">Miniflux</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/miniflux.png" alt="miniflux"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/"><em>Miniflux</em></a> is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a way to keep track of your favourite news outlets and magazines, be posted on the latest blog posts of your favourite writers. You could also build a dedicated ad-free feed timeline of your YouTube subscriptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RSS</em> (<em>Really Simple Syndication</em>) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bonus</em>: YouTube has an RSS feed and the embedded YouTube player is ad-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install <em>Miniflux</em> on Uberspace. Add feeds of your favourite YouTube channels. Hop into settings and enable Fever API.</p>
<p>Now any RSS client which is capable of reading from the Fever API should be able to access your RSS aggregator in the cloud. If you are in the Apple ecosystem I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a> by Golden Hill Software.</p>
<p>With this I have a dedicated recent first timeline of all the videos as they are released.</p>
<p>I also have separate categories of feed for news and comics - there is a ton of webcomics out there beyond <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/">smbc</a> and <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/">oatmeal</a> - a great way to catch up is via RSS.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bonus-your-domain">Bonus: Your Domain</h3><p>The coolest part about self-hosting is showing off your stuff. What better way to show off your things than to have a personal domain - a place you can call your own. Head over to a domain name registrar and grab a site on the net-estate. I suggest <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have a bunch of extraordinary things you can do. With something like <code>awesauce.com</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can point the various services you host on Uberspace to subdomains of your main site. Show off your <code>actual.awesauce.com</code> and <code>miniflux.awesauce.com</code>!</li>
<li>Check with your email provider if they allow you to set up custom domain. You may have to pay for the privilege. Once done you have achieved another freedom - now you can shift the underlying email service provider while keeping the address the same. All mails, for forever, can come to <code>contact@awesauce.com</code>. Woohoo!</li>
<li>Point a subdomain or a URL path to your GitHub repository and host publicly accessible files like your resume: <code>awesauce.com/files/resume.pdf</code></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This has not been a detailed step by step walkthrough on how to do things, by design. You are meant to go and explore; this is simply a way pointer to invigorate your curiosities.</p>
<p>Here is a final reader's exercise: Figure out a way to send yourself a mobile notification when a particular item comes back in stock or website changes :D</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/changedetection.png" alt="changedetection"></p>
<hr>
<p>This made it to the HackerNews front page, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41577156">head over there</a> for some good discussion around the topic.</p>

<p>Bear with me till the end.</p>

<p>I work in the same office as Anna, EY Pune and in the same cluster. </p>

<p>The death of Anna was informed via a centralised mail in which they attached her linkedin picture with some standard short message like RIP. News was put in the grapevine that she was already suffering from a health condition which got worse. </p>

<p>Though I haven't worked directly with her, I've worked with her manager, who is worse than how it's portrayed in the letter. He actually prioritises his convenience (like cricket) and he doesn't really care for anyone's time or effort. He proudly bought IPL final tickets in deadline at exorbitant prices and showed off on insta. He takes all the credit himself, and blames the team for any shortfalls (classic manager behaviour). Boasts all day everyday. When he reviews your work, his focus is not on the correctness of work, he points out as many mistakes as he could, depicting how smart he is, and in other words how dumb you are.</p>

<p>Her assistant manager, she's atrocious. Basically what the asst manager does is distribute work to the team and follow up from each one. Ensure no one is stress free, no one is taking time off. Basically they highlight their potential by getting work done from lesser people (like work of 5/6 resources from 2 resources) in order to get promoted. It is said in common language that you can trust and deal with a drunken man out of his mind, but not an AM. Every AM is the embodiment of this statement.</p>

<p>I have been working in EY for quite some time now, and I have seen people come and go. People who come here (generally) are very hardworking people who have thirst for learning and they are ready to work day and night. Australian timings, European timings, US timings, you name it. Seasoned people exploit these newcomers like anything. And these senior people have power. Good deal of power. They can make your life a living hell if you don't co-operate with them. Try reporting to HR, then you'll get to know he's part of this structure too. They have the audacity to use profane language in reviews. Newly qualified CAs and articles come all the way from their states like Kashmir, Punjab, TN, sacrificing everything just to learn and get good exposure. But it's a bloodbath.  All these people are school toppers of their time. It seems apparent that years of mind numbing toil wasn't enough.They're humiliated to an extent where they lose their respect in their own eyes. Humiliation in the team calls is quite normal here. And these newcomers are from small families who teach them to respect elders and not react to any unreasonable behaviour, not to say NO to any work, give your heart and soul to the work you do. Everyone of us went through this thinking maybe something is wrong with me, if everyone is able to handle this pressure I should handle it too. Female employees may get some leniency but for our male colleagues it's absolutely brutal. Everyone is tortured to hell. No social life, no personal time, no time to attend even phone calls. Most of the newcomers including articles quit, some endure the trouble for some years and then quit, remaining become managers and become trouble for others.</p>

<p>We average 16 hours a day in the busy season, and 12 hours a day in non busy seasons. No weekends or public holidays are off. Annually EY voluntarily announces a day off to rejuvenate their employees. And yes you guessed it right! Even that is not off. We work on that day as well - from Office! Overwork is the only way to get promoted, do and make others do it. </p>

<p>Top level people (Partners) don't care about sh<em>t. You don't even get to interact with partners until you're at least an asst manager. They don't give a f</em>*k about any employee, they just care about getting work done. Even if you go through boiling hell and get the work done, you won't get any acknowledgement from anyone forget about appreciation. One of my colleagues was hospitalized suffering from Dengue, and these people made him make workpapers from his hospital bed. Good for him he quit then and there. When I say these people are inhuman, they literally are.</p>

<p>People leaving EY are usually very happy, and their colleagues congratulate them like they are being released from prison. </p>

<p>It's my request to all my colleagues reading this message - please reevaluate your priorities, see what you're really doing to yourself. And to CAs and articles who dream to work in such an organisation - be very careful of what you wish for.</p>

<p>Anna's death has impacted us all. And such letter from Augustine is a conclusive evidence that "already suffering from health issues" was an deliberately created rumour. Hope the effort behind this letter doesn't go in vain. </p>

<p>Support from all suffering employees of EY.</p>

<p>More power to you Augustine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				
<p>Almost every major website you visit today pops up a banner to warn you that it uses “cookies.”   This is not legally required in the U.S. or in most places, and where it is, the vast majority of sites do not comply with legal requirements.  From a policy perspective: cookie pops are just dumb – (virtually) no one reads them.  There are vastly better ways to deal with the issue they present – legally and from a site usability perspective. </p>



<p>First, no current U.S. law requires cookie pop-ups.   <em>Some</em> sites that are available in the European Union are required to post cookie pop ups – sites that use so called “tracking cookies.”  I discuss below a recent EU case that makes this issue even worse than one would have originally thought. </p>



<p>Second, an anecdotal review of websites shows the vast, <em>vast</em> majority of them – all of them in my experience that are “U.S.” sites – utterly fail to comply with the so called EU “cookie law.”  Why?  Because they store the cookie before consent (which is not permitted under the cookie law) and they simply state, “This site uses cookies” and present an “OK” button (and/or an X to close the pop up) with a link to the privacy policy.  See for example <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/">www.abajournal.com</a> which, as of the date of this post, simply provides an OK button – no option to do anything like reject or manage the cookies, and a link to the privacy policy.   Just a useless and legally insufficient user interface distraction.  </p>



<p>Finally, except in very, very limited cases, these cookie pops do not in any way increase user privacy protection.   Why?  If a site does comply with the notice and consent requirements, <em>it is not legally required to provide the service if a user declines tracking cookies.</em>  The site can simply not provide functionality.  So in many cases, its not really a choice – the choice is either not to use the site, or consent to tracking.  This is made worse because many governments and third parties use these sites for information dissemination.  A truly privacy focused law would at least require that the site function if a person elected no tracking.  </p>



<p>The whole cookie problem was started by our friends in Europe when they promulgated the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC</a>.  However, no U.S. company really started focusing on compliance with the “cookie issue” presented in the ePrivacy Directive until the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 came into effect.  The GDPR applies in Europe, not the US, however so many U.S. companies either do business in, or ostensibly could be regulated by, EU members – so they attempt to comply with both U.S.and EU law.  </p>



<p>Many “cookies” –  the ones necessary to actually operate a website, are “exempt” and need not be identified nor are they subject to consent.   However, sites that use tracking cookies and other tracking technology – even anonymized data – are required under EU law to obtain prior consent before even storing the cookie or other technology that allows such tracking.  </p>



<p>In my opinion, this system has been an utter failure in policy and actual impact.   It has not stopped companies from incessant user tracking.  The companies that rely on user tracking have the power to force the choice of “allow tracking” or do not use the service.   The privacy policies remain mostly unintelligible, or at the very least, its is all but impossible to tell what exact tracking a company does, primarily because they either disclose only the types of tracking, or disclose so excessively that the cookie disclosure is indecipherable.  </p>



<p>But the EU is doubling down on the concept . . . </p>



<p>In a recent decision (File number: DOS-2019-0137) of the Dispute Chamber of the Data Protection Authority of Belgium issued 2/2/2022, that regulator held that the European arm of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s “pop up” framework used by most of its members – intentionally designed to comply with the GDPR, <strong>in fact did not</strong>.   The decision is lengthy (my machine translated version into English is 139 pages long), and undoubtedly will be appealed.   As an overview, IAB created a real time bidding system (RTB) – an automated system of bidding for advertising.  This is their framework in the U.S. and many other countries, but in Europe, they created the “Transparency and Consent Framework” (TCF).   At issue in this case was a subset of the TCF, which the Board described as follows: “Specifically for the TCF, there are also the companies that use so-called “Consent Management Platforms” (CMPs) to offer. Specifically, a CMP takes the form of a pop-up that appears on the first connection to a website appears to request permission from the internet user to collect cookies and other identification data” Para. 40 (Note, all English translations here are machine created by Google’s translation service).  The original decision in Dutch is here (and I can post the English translated version if someone requests it): <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf</a>.  </p>



<p>The basic idea is that IAB manages a “consensu” cookie – that indicates if the web user has already consented (or rejected) cookies.  So, a participating site would somehow take information from a user’s initial browser session, send it off to IAB, and IAB would send back a text string indicating if that user had already consented to accept cookies or not.  If not, a “cookie pop up” would be presented to the user.   The Board found that the IAB maintains a database of users and preferences, which can be used “in order to create an advertising profile of data subjects and to show them personalized advertising”  Para. 50.  It therefore concluded the IAB was a data controller (a point the IAB disputed).  From this point forward the Board essentially found nearly every conceivable violation of the GDPR that could be found.  Among them, that “IAB Europe [] failed to observe the principles of due regard for transparency and fairness with regard to data subjects” in part because some of the information that can be sucked up into the preference model includes “special categories of personal data … For example, participating organizations could become acquainted with the websites previously visited by a data subject, including the political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, health data or also trade union memberships of the data subjects be inferred or disclosed.”  Para 51.  It also found the IAB’s privacy policy insufficient because among other reasons it was only available in English, and used unclear vague terms like “services” and “other means.”  Para. 54.  It also did not like that the terms “partners” and “third parties” were not explained sufficiently. </p>



<p>To me this is just evidence that no one really understands the law – or that the regulators think it says one thing and the industry thinks it says another.  Not good either way.  But after that decision, it seems like it would be all but impossible to have a centralized “cookie consent” service – or to comply, the service would be so intrusive as to make the web experience intolerable.</p>



<p>The solution?  In my view, just stop with the cookie pop ups.  They are stupid and ineffective.  Enact a law that requires a service to respect the do not track signal from a browser (currently entirely voluntary), and not store any tracking cookies, clear gifs or other trackers – and require that a site not “discriminate” against users who elect no tracking – basically – provide all functions to users whether they consent or do not consent.  I would also prevent any government organization to use a site that tracks users as a service for information dissemination. </p>

<p>We don’t typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease—in part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry—but it is. And it doesn’t just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process.</p>

<p>I write the word “cavity,” but the phrase “dental caries” is actually more encompassing. First documented in&nbsp;<u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fcaries&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885498770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fV6hWm531mY5HNCQA%2BOggVL5LPnX%2Bz3lcHYc0E7KwWY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries.

<p>Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially—through interviews and social media endorsements—promises to do just that. It’s a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself.</p>

It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it&nbsp;<i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, or&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>for short.</p>

<p>A few decades later,&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game.

This opened the door to&nbsp;<i>replacement therapy</i>. A destructive approach to the problem of dental carries would be to use an antibiotic to kill the culprit; with replacement therapy, the idea is to&nbsp;<i>replace&nbsp;</i>the culprit with a version of it that is harmless.

Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>and thus bid goodbye to cavities?</p>

<p>A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov’s fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn’t grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path.</p>

<p>Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth’s bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and&nbsp;<i>S. mutans</i>grows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then.

<p>We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system? Will it upset the oral microbiome in ways that have not been tested for? I wish I had answers.</p>

But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it’s fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That’s why fluoride is so good for our teeth.</p>

<p>Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Take-home message:</strong><br>
	- Lumina is a genetically engineered version of the Streptococcus mutans bacterium that lives in the mouth, and it is supposed to prevent you from developing dental caries because it does not produce acid<br>
	- It has been poorly studied for safety and effectiveness<br>
	- Streptococcus mutans is actually neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of dental caries; the disease actually comes about because of a shift in the equilibrium of bacteria in the mouth which encourages the demineralization of our teeth</p>

                <p>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The independent directors of the Board of 23andMe Holding Co. (Nasdaq: ME), today sent the following letter to Anne Wojcicki, Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder, and Chair of the Board of Directors of 23andMe, in which the independent directors have provided their resignation from the Board, effective immediately:<br></p>  <p>Dear Anne,</p>  <p>We, the independent directors of the 23andMe Board, hereby tender our resignations, effective immediately.</p>  <p>After months of work, we have yet to receive from you a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders. We believe the Special Committee and the Board have provided ample time for you to submit such a proposal. That we have not seen any notable progress over the last 5 months leads us to believe no such proposal is forthcoming. The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee’s determination.</p>  <p>While we continue to wholeheartedly support the Company’s mission and believe deeply in the value of the personalized health and wellness offering that you have articulated, it is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward. Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company.</p>  <p>We are proud of what 23andMe has achieved in pioneering direct access to genetic information, and we have been honored to have had the opportunity to be part of those efforts.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>/s/</p>  <p>Roelof Botha, Patrick Chung, Sandra Hernández, M.D., Neal Mohan, Valerie Montgomery Rice M.D., Richard Scheller, Ph.D., Peter J.

<p>None of the bread and butter of programming as we know it is here: conditionals and loops are nowhere to be seen, there is no way to create functions… heck, variables don’t even have names!</p>

<p>Where does one even start?</p>

<p>This little introduction is meant to introduce you, somebody with programming experience, to the world of assembly. We’ll discuss the basics of the language and map them to high-level programming constructs.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to navigate assembly code, know where to look for information, and even write some simple programs all by yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello world</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, our first program will be a “Hello World”.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the code though, we need to briefly introduce the language we’ll be using. At the end of this section, we will be able to write and run our first assembly program.</p>

<h3 id="x86-64-assembly">x86-64 assembly</h3>

<p>First things first, assembly is not a language.</p>

<p>Assembly refers to a <em>family of programming languages</em> featuring instructions that closely map to the machine code that the CPU will execute. In fact, one of the raisons d’etre of assembly languages is to provide a human-readable version of machine code in situations like reverse engineering, hardware programming, or developing games for consoles.</p>

<p>In this guide, we will use <em>x86-64 assembly</em> which can be assembled and executed on most personal computers. This choice should ease running and tinkering with the snippets along the way.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, there are two “flavors” of the x64-64 assembly syntax: one called <em>Intel</em> and the other is called <em>AT&amp;T</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In this guide we will stick to the <em>Intel</em> dialect because it’s used by the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a>, the source of truth on what the CPU <em>really</em> does when fed an instruction.</p>

<p>Assembly is all about working close to the hardware. Optimizimg for portability of the code examples across operative systems and architactures would obfuscate the content of this introduction.</p>

<p>The snippets we will be written for Linux, and they should run fine on Window’s WSL as well. The general concepts and practices are nonetheless valid regardless of your OS of choice.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-instruction">Anatomy of an instruction</h3>

<p>Instructions are the way we tell the CPU what to do. They look something like this:</p>



<p>They represent the smallest unit of assembly language and are mostly composed of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mnemonic</strong>: a shortened word or sentence that specifies the operation to be performed</li>
  <li><strong>operands</strong>: a list of 0-3 items representing what’s affected by the operation</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, the mnemonic is <code>mov</code>, which stands for <em>move</em>, and the operands are <code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code>. This instruction in plain English would read: move the content of <code>rbx</code> in <code>rax</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p><code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code> are registers and we will introduce them in the next paragraph. In the meantime, you can imagine them as variables holding a value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some instructions will have more then mnemonic and operands. Additional parts such as <em>prefixes</em> and <em>size directives</em> will only be needed later, and we’ll talk through them at the right moment.</p>

<p>Fear not, there is no need to memorize all the possible instructions now. Whenever we’ll come across new operations, we will discuss them, and with repetition you will remember in no time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a> will be our instruction reference in the next chapters. Keep it handy!</p>

<h3 id="storing-data-registers">Storing data: Registers</h3>

<p>You can think of registers as storage space baked right into the CPU itself. They are small and incredibly fast to access.</p>

<p>The most common registers are the so-called <em>general purpose</em> registers. In x86-64 they are sixteen in total, and they are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p>One can access the whole register or a subset by using different names. For example, using <code>rax</code> (as in the code above) would address all the 64 bits in the <code>rax</code> register. With <code>al</code>, you can access the lower byte of the same register.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Register</th>
      <th>Higher byte</th>
      <th>Lower byte</th>
      <th>Lower 2 bytes¹</th>
      <th>Lower 4 bytes²</th>

<p>General purpose means that they can store anything in principle. In practice, we’ll see that some registers have special meanings, some instructions only use certain registers, and some conventions dictate who is expected to write where.</p>

<p>The only non-general-purpose register we will be concerned with is <code>rip</code> the <em>instruction pointer</em> register. It holds the address of the next instruction to execute, and therefore, modifying <code>rip</code> allows programs to jump to arbitrary instructions in the code.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-assembly-file">Our first assembly file</h3>

<p>Assembly files typically have an <code>.s</code> or <code>.asm</code> extension and they are split in three sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>data</strong>: where we define constants and initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>bss</strong>: where we define non-initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>text</strong>: where we will type our code, this is the only mandatory section of the file.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>; code here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The semicolon <code>;</code> is the comment character: whatever comes after it will not be executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assembly programs run as you would expect. They start with the first instruction and sequentially execute one instruction after the other, from top to bottom. To create control flow, such as conditionals and loops, we make our programs ‘jump’ to specific instructions. We will look at jumps in detail in the next sections.</p>

<p>Just as you’d use a <code>main</code> function in many high-level languages, assembly requires us to specify an entry point for our program. We do this using the <code>global</code> declaration, which points to a <em>label</em>.</p>

<p>Labels are the assembly’s way of giving human-readable names to specific instructions. They serve two purposes: making our code more understandable and allowing us to reference these instructions elsewhere in our program. You can declare a label by writing it followed by a colon, like this: <code>label:</code>. When you want to reference a label (for example, in a jump instruction), use it without the colon: <code>label</code>.</p>

<p>Typically, <code>global</code> references a <code>_start</code> label declared immediately after it. That is where our program will start executing.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>global</span> <span>_start</span>
<span>_start:</span>
  <span>; instructions here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="at-last-hello-world">At last, “Hello World”</h3>

<p>Finally, we have all the tools to build software in assembly. Very Nice!</p>

<p>Our program will use two system calls: <code>sys_write</code> to print characters in a terminal and <code>exit</code> to terminate the process with a given status code.</p>

<p>Using syscalls goes like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select the syscall to invoke by moving its identifier in <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>pass arguments to the syscall by populating appropriate registers</li>
  <li>use the <code>syscall</code> instruction to fire the call</li>
</ul>

<p>The only other instruction we will use is <code>mov</code> which we have seen in the instruction paragraph. It works pretty much like an assignment (the <code>=</code> operator) in many high-level languages: it moves the content of the second operand into the first operand.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the code to see how this plays together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coding along</strong></p>

  <p>Throughout this series, we’ll use an embedded editor to tinker with the code and run the examples as we go. The same content can be found in the sibling repository <a href="https://github.com/shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro">shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro</a> if you want to run locally.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-19065">

<p>I wrote a decade ago about the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2014/07/16/double-irish-dutch-sandwich/" title="">Double Irish Dutch Sandwich</a>, a strategy for corporations to evade taxes that was widespread and large-scale enough to come to the attention of the International Monetary Fund. But due to various changes in national and international tax agreements, the strategy seems to have faded substantially. Ana Maria Santacreu and&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Samuel Moore  of the St. Louis Fed provide some background in “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/aug/unpacking-discrepancies-american-irish-royalty-reporting" title="">Unpacking Discrepancies in American and Irish Royalty Reporting</a>” (August 08, 2024). </p>



<p>For those who don’t keep up to speed on the details of international tax evasion schemes, Santacreu and Moore describe the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich works like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich tax scheme, as illustrated in the third figure, involved a complex arrangement between a U.S. parent company (USP) and three foreign subsidiaries. The first Irish subsidiary (I1) was incorporated in Ireland but managed from Bermuda, allowing it to avoid both Irish and U.S. taxes. The second Irish subsidiary (I2) was incorporated and managed in Ireland. The purpose of I2 is to control foreign distribution and collect income. A Dutch subsidiary (N) acted as an intermediary between I2 and I1 to avoid Irish taxes.</p>



<p>The scheme worked by exploiting specific provisions in Irish and U.S. tax laws. A USP would transfer intellectual property ownership to I1. Then, I2 would sublicense the intellectual property from I1 and pay royalties. These royalties would flow from I2 to N, and then from N to I1, taking advantage of European Union tax regulations. This structure allowed profits to be shifted to tax havens like Bermuda, effectively minimizing tax liabilities for the entire corporate structure.</p>

<p>However, a combination of Irish tax reforms in 2015 and changes in the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2024/08/12/us-tax-policy-the-coming-storm-in-2025/" title="">US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 </a>made this strategy ineffective: “Consequently, Irish companies began paying royalties directly to American parent companies instead of routing them through tax havens.”</p>



<p>The shifts in royalty payments tell the story. This figure shows royalty payments by Irish companies to the US, which doubled from since 2019 to 2021. </p>

<p>Conversely, tax payments from Ireland and from Netherlands to Bermuda, well-known for it’s near-zero corporate taxes, went way down–showing a decilne in corporate profits being routed through Bermuda. </p>

<p>I’m sure the international tax lawyers around the world are strategizing new tax evasion strategies even as I write these words. But it’s worth remembering that there are two large costs at play here. The obvious loss is to government revenue, but the more subtle and still very real loss is the diversion of high-powered talent from what could have been gains in efficiency and productivity to focus instead on corporate reorganizations and tax evasion games. </p>

<p>When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends <strong>all</strong> DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that <strong>all</strong> requests must be routed through the proxy.</p>
<h2>But…</h2>
<p>While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests—particularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs—were not being received by our proxy!</p>
<p>There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing <strong>some</strong> requests to bypass the installed DNS proxy and be sent unencrypted to the system’s default name server instead.</p>
<p>Note that this bug likely affects any kind of DNS proxy, not just Little Snitch.</p>
<p>So, if you rely on the new DNS encryption feature of Little Snitch 6, or if you are using another third-party DNS proxy, be aware that some DNS lookups may bypass the proxy until Apple provides a fix in a future macOS update.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DNS lookups performed via higher-level APIs do not appear to be affected by this bug. For example, your web-browsing in Safari or Chrome still fully benefits from encrypted lookups. Firefox, on the other hand, does seem to be affected.</p>
<h2>How to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enable DNS encryption in Little Snitch &gt; Settings.</li>
<li>Start <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> with a capture filter for <code>port 53</code>.</li>
<li>Run the following code in an Xcode playground:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>import Foundation

let domain = "dnsproxytest.com"
var result: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;addrinfo&gt;?
let status = getaddrinfo(domain, nil, nil, &amp; result)</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the lookup for <code>dnsproxytest.com</code> can be seen in Wireshark in unencrypted form on UDP port 53 (the default for unencrypted lookups).</p>
<p>Additionally, you will see that Little Snitch Network Monitor does not display any traffic for the lookup because the lookup completely bypasses the network filter!</p>
<p>We have reported this bug to Apple and hope for a fix soon. Please stay tuned, we will keep you updated here.</p>
<h2>Update 2024-09-17, 7:10 p.m.</h2>
<p>After further investigation, we found that this bug has already existed at least since macOS 14.5 Sonoma (maybe even earlier, but we currently don’t have access to an older 14.x system for testing).</p></section>
