Old TV is just so quaint: it’s much slower paced than today’s media, there’s less jump cuts, and the screen transitions and animations are often quirky. There’s not as much industry-wide “best practices”, so there’s a much greater variance in quality, and thus variety of unique little gems.</p><p><span>But I think the main reason I love it so much is because, compared to today: </span><strong>they have a MUCH higher bar of what they think the layperson is capable of understanding </strong></p><p>I’d like to show you some of my favorite snippets here, starting with the intro:</p><p><em>bits and bytes of information, tuuuuurning darkness, to liiiiiiiiiiiiiiight</em></p><p><span>Luba Goy then tells us that we’re going to learn how to USE a computer. </span><strong>This is important, this is NOT a TV show about how computers work</strong><span>.

Imagine teaching your grandma how to use her smart TV. This is kind of how Luba talks to Billy. </p><p><span>And yet, they do NOT talk down to their audience. They do not dumb things down. They explain things in a surprising amount of detail. </span><strong>The explanations are concise &amp; straightforward, but NOT dumbed down. </strong></p><p>For example, in this episode they load a video game from a cassette tape. Billy asks this wonderful question:</p><blockquote><p><span>[how is it possible that] all this [non-sound] information, words, letters, and pictures, can be contained in an </span><em>audio </em><span>cassette tape?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>A bad answer to this question would say: “the cassette tape contains the data for the video game, the computer knows how to decode it. You press this button here, load it like this, then you press that button, etc”. This isn’t wrong, and it may in fact contain a lot of detail, but </span><strong>it doesn’t tell me anything about how this system works.</strong></p><p>More importantly: it doesn’t help me interact with it better. It doesn’t allow me to make predictions or develop a model of it in my mind (which is very important for when things go wrong, or when I want to do something outside the scope of instructions). </p><p>Let’s see how Luba answers this question:</p><p>She has him play the tape (which contains machine code for a video game) on an  audio cassette player. To Billy’s surprise, it works just fine, it just produces an awful noise!</p><p>They then proceed to explain what “binary code” is: that we use a series of “on” and “off” switches, and we can choose to make these sequences represent anything: numbers, letters, or commands.</p><p><span>I think this demonstration of playing “text” over an audio player is amazing. I’m drawn to it because this is how I personally developed my own fundamental understanding of what data on a computer </span><em>is</em><span>, and I think it’s beautiful that this is also how we explain it to the layperson. </span></p><p>There is nothing inherently special about text vs images vs audio. ALL of them are stored using the same primitives (0’s and 1’s). They have no inherent meaning. They get their meaning from how you choose to decode them. </p><p>You store the number 65 in binary. That might mean the letter “A” if this is an ASCII text document. It might be a musical note in MIDI. Or something else entirely. </p><p><strong>What does the layperson get out of this?</strong><span> They have a basic, but useful model of how the machine works. I bet you could use this to deduce something like: how would you come up with a basic encryption system? (you could just encode data in a custom way, and not tell anyone!)</span></p><p>I really do believe this matters day to day. It matters when the computer behaves in unexpected ways, or when you think about what is possible in the future. Or even simply, to give yourself a fighting chance to tell what is “easy” and what is “hard” when working with the people who program these things. </p><p>Here’s an example where Billy asks “why is the computer so slow?” and Luba clarifies exactly why it’s slow:</p><p><em>“[these computers] ARE fast, it’s the cassette that’s slow!”</em></p><p>Does the modern layperson know why their computer is slow? Is this web page sluggish because the internet is bad, or because the CPU is old, or because it’s just a janky website? </p><p><strong>I don’t think this is too much for the average person to understand</strong><span>. I think the average person is perfectly capable of dealing with complexity, when it matters to their day to day lives.</span></p><p>Recently, Chrome added “memory usage” info on each tab. I think this is great.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png" width="346" height="174" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:174,&quot;width&quot;:346,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:14959,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9fd19ad-d3b3-4eff-b4fe-2293126f4f1c_346x174.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>Chrome showing memory utilization for each tab on hover is an excellent feature — awareness of resource consumption is necessary to care about it.</p></blockquote><p><em><span>John Carmack, from: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1727048755881611268" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1727048755881611268</a></em></p><p>In “The Meaning of it All” Feynman talks about how this belief that the average person is dumb is a “dangerous idea”.

They don’t have time to explain everything, but they will try to explain it honestly, OR they will say “that’s out of scope, future episode”</p></li><li><p><span>They encourage you to “peek behind the curtain”. They reward curiosity, even for questions that seem irrelevant </span><em>(like: “why is the power button on the back of the computer” or “why does it say I have 31k of memory, when you said this computer has 32k?)</em></p></li></ol><p>A message to my future self:</p><ul><li><p>resist the urge to dumb things down when explaining complex technical matters</p></li><li><p>if you’re struggling to distill down the essential details, just start with what YOUR mental model is.

How much should we abstract away, to use without understanding? Do I need to know the inner workings of my car, for example? </p><p>My rule of thumb is: if it’s something I use a lot / rely on, I want to at least have (1) a model of how it works (2) some basic ways to verify it, so I can check my own understanding from time to time.

    <time datetime="2024-06-07 19:29:00 -0400">2024-06-07</time>
  </p>

  

  <p>This is the second entry of my series of detecting PS2 emulators. If you haven’t
read it, you can find it <a href="https://fobes.dev/ps2/detecting-emu-vu0-pipeline">here</a>
.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a pretty straightforward method. This one can be done on VU1,
VU0 micro mode or VU0 macro mode.
For simplicity, I will do it with VU0 macro mode, where VU0 is used as a coprocessor.
That way it can be done directly on the EE CPU without dealing with VU programs.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-hell-ps2-floating-point">Welcome to <del>hell</del> PS2 Floating Point</h3>

<p>If you look at any multiplication instruction (MUL,MULi, etc) in the VU developer
manuals, you will see this remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an operation error of 1 bit in multiplication, so the value multiplied by 1 may not be the same as the
original value. By using VF[fs] as a multiplicand, the results of multiplication with 1 are guaranteed to be
accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little bit loaded but the gist of it is, with multiplication operations
<em>1 * X</em> is not guaranteed to result in <em>X</em>, unlike <em>X * 1</em> which is.</p>

<p>The exact reason why a bit is lost is not known to me, whoever decides to
implement software floating point for the PS2 will have to figure that out and
report back :^)</p>

<h3 id="abusing-it">Abusing it</h3>

<p>First things first, we need to figure out a number that triggers this issue. The
easiest way to do that is to brute force it. Thankfully I’ve already done that
in the past. The list of the first 250 numbers (with 0.5 increments) that have
the issue can be found in a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/F0bes/5f209d8a0890879ad0e25ceb6973977a">gist here</a>.</p>

<p>129.5 will be our target number for this detection.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Like I said, it’s pretty straightforward. Load 1 and a special number into a
register, multiply them, check the result.</p>

<p>Currently no emulators (PCSX2, Play!, DobieStation, hps2x64) emulate this behaviour.</p>

<p>The difficulty of this one is definitely a 1/5.<br>
I’ll choose a difficult one next time.</p>

<p>Like many bits of Internet Culture, this simple image of an empty series of rooms represents a deep-repressed or recently-remembered memory of a common Internet Legend, or it’s just a shot of nothing.</p>



<p>If the answer is that it’s a shot of nothing, let’s get you up to speed.</p>



<p>This image floated around message boards in the 2010s, posted with commentary or as a general use for a slightly off-putting photograph of a less-than-well-maintained location, and was, by most standards, rather indistinct. The internet, after all, is filled with odd images and weird drawings that cause a reaction, often after many different attempts to achieve the effect. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank">Survivorship Bias</a> for memes, one might say. So if one more image of an indistinct indoor landscape was out there, not much was going to happen of it.</p>



<p>That changed in 2019, when the image was given a legend and history, made up out of the air, that it was a rare photograph of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">The Backrooms</a>. The phrasing of the original declaration speaks for itself:</p>



<p><strong>“If you’re not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you’ll end up in the Backrooms, where it’s nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in<br>God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you”</strong></p>



<p>If this writing strikes you as some sort of odd, rather dramatic addition to the image of a room, then you’re being introduced to <em>creepypasta</em>, or as some might call them, <em>urban legends</em> and <em>campfire stories</em>. It’s part of the overwhelming need for humans to tell tales that excite and frighten, to compose meaning or horror out of the darkness, and even the mundane.</p>



<p>The concept of the “Backrooms” also touches on a very frequent theme of many different horror and science-fiction movies – that there are service tunnels and hard to access areas woven throughout life, known only to a special few. Movies such as <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>, <em>Us</em>, <em>Beyond the Walls</em>, <em>Dark City</em>, <em>The Cube, </em>and many more have explored this theme – or used it as a jumping off point to tell another story. </p>



<p>The difference, here, is nobody really knew where that very first image came from. <em>For a very long time</em>.</p>



<p>This extended period of not finding the original source of the image left an unfinished tune, a half-written poem, about where it came from and what it meant. And the lack of information in the image as it showed up on these image boards seemed to ensure the mystery would never be found.</p>



<p>So people filled in the blanks.</p>

<p>A Subreddit called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/" target="_blank">/r/backrooms</a>, an extended <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backrooms_(web_series)" target="_blank">web video series called Backrooms</a>, and endless CGI models and creations meant to extend the legend and the origin story became years of effort by thousands to draw the missing pieces of a puzzle that was never a puzzle.</p>



<p>A constantly shifting set of games with titles based off <em>The Backrooms</em> were created and presented for a willing and happy audience; it’d be unfair to choose one or even a few to highlight – there are dozens.</p>

<p>All of them represent the efforts to bring you into a state of heightened fear or paranoia as you lurked through a series of dark hallways, overlit carpeted spaces, and a growing dread. There’s no question there was a huge audience for this, and it is sometimes thought that this entire legend brought mainstream attention to <strong>liminal spaces</strong>, a perception of the in-between geographies of less unsettling locations. It is now enjoying life as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)">aesthetic movement</a>.</p>



<p>Supporting this explosion of creativity and storytelling was the continued fact that <em>nobody knew where the photograph came from</em>. This situation, of a core image having a completely shadowy and unexplained origin, is arguably the foundation of its power.</p>



<p>That changed, recently.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030503094137/http://www.hobbytownoshkosh.com:80/revolution%20raceway,%20020903.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This appears to be the origin of the Backrooms Photograph.</a> </strong></p>

<div><p>In March 2003, there was a former furniture store called Rohner’s Home Furnishings in Oshkosh, Wisconsin whose second floor was being renovated by the (somewhat) new tenants, HobbyTown. </p><p>Renovating the space from the sale of furniture to a new remote-controlled racing car track (among other aspects) meant pulling down partitions and ripping out carpet. This inspired taking photographs of the process, one of which, DSC001561.JPG, was the legendary “Back Rooms” image.</p></div>

<p>18 times in the last 20 years, crawlers affiliated with the Internet Archive moved through this page and grabbed portions of it, speculatively, to store for future research and reference. As the whole image was grabbed, reading the metadata of the original image reveals the date it was taken (June 12, 2002), and the camera used (a Sony Cyber-Shot model). The great unknown image, the unsettling photo of a mysterious place and time, was revealed.</p>



<p>However the original, anonymous user stumbled onto this photograph, it appears it was taken from either the Wayback directly, or the Wayback Machine crawled the same site the user had found, and kept that webpage’s preservation for over 20 years.</p>



<p><strong>Emerging, Blinking, Into the Light</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, as news of the Backrooms being “found” travels throughout the world, responses have wildly ranged.</p>



<p>For some, this is a proof that “with enough eyeballs, all problems are shallow”. While we might argue about the relative worth of a given effort, the fact that it is possible for word to travel about a mystery to the point of being solved means that the world is a hair less intimidating and scary. Our shared efforts and cooperation can find the answer to a seemingly impossible-to-answer question. The fact that an image with basically no information and a blurry set of components could be tracked down and revealed is a miracle.</p>



<p>For others, the mystery being solved removes a little bit of magic and wonder from the world. It says that there’s no kayfabe, no holding of mystery in our hands without peeking further to tear out the secret. In this perspective, something special has been lost.</p>



<p>But there’s another lesson as well.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive’s crawlers moved through the pages of a hobby store multiple times over the years, capturing HTML, photographs, and time-stamping the process, with the equivalent care of an at-risk website, a politician on the national stage, or a legendary and obvious moment in history provided via a PDF file.</p>



<p>This agnostic, wide-ranging crawl likely represented both the original source of the image, and a persistent, dependable URL to reference back to it, as thousands are doing at this very moment.</p>



<p><strong>This is the mission of the Wayback Machine – be the dependable, accessible connection to web history, and therefore all history. Give the Internet its Memory, which would otherwise be lost.</strong></p>



<p>If you mourn the loss of legend and mystery in our quest to keep the truth transparent, available and persistent, don’t worry – the process of internalizing and analyzing the image to give the Backrooms history its full and complete story has already begun:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr LSP-AI abstracts complex implementation details from editor specific plugin authors, centralizing open-source development work into one shareable backend.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Editor integrated AI-powered assistants are here to stay. They are not perfect, but are only improving and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15331" rel="nofollow">early research is already showing the benefits</a>. While several companies have released advanced AI-powered editors like <a href="https://cursor.sh/" rel="nofollow">Cursor</a>, the open-source community lacks a direct competitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">LSP-AI aims to fill this gap by providing a language server that integrates AI-powered functionality into the editors we know and love. Here’s why we believe LSP-AI is necessary and beneficial:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Unified AI Features</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>By centralizing AI features into a single backend, LSP-AI allows supported editors to benefit from these advancements without redundant development efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Simplified Plugin Development</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI abstracts away the complexities of setting up LLM backends, building complex prompts and soon much more. Plugin developers can focus on enhancing the specific editor they are working on, rather than dealing with backend intricacies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Enhanced Collaboration</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Offering a shared backend creates a collaborative platform where open-source developers can come together to add new functionalities. This unified effort fosters innovation and reduces duplicated work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Broad Compatibility</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI supports any editor that adheres to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), ensuring that a wide range of editors can leverage the AI capabilities provided by LSP-AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flexible LLM Backend Support</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Currently, LSP-AI supports llama.cpp, OpenAI-compatible APIs, Anthropic-compatible APIs and Mistral AI FIM-compatible APIs, giving developers the flexibility to choose their preferred backend. This list will soon grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Future-Ready</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI is committed to staying updated with the latest advancements in LLM-driven software development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

    </div><p>In a new study published in the journal <i>iScience</i>, researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Institut Botànic de Barcelona (IBB-CSIC) in Spain present a new record-holder for the largest amount of DNA stored in the nucleus of any living organism on the planet.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Coming in at more than 100 meters of unraveled DNA, the New Caledonian fork fern species Tmesipteris oblanceolata was found to contain more than 50 times more DNA than humans and has dethroned the Japanese flowering plant species Paris japonica, which has held this record since 2010.</p>
<p>In addition, the plant has achieved three Guinness World Records titles for Largest plant genome, Largest Genome, and Largest fern genome for the amount of DNA in the nucleus.</p>
<p>T. oblanceolata is a rare species of fern found on the island nation of New Caledonia, an overseas French territory situated in the Southwest Pacific, about 750 miles east of Australia, and some of the neighboring islands such as Vanuatu. The genus Tmesipteris is an understudied group of plants consisting of about 15 species, most of which occur across a range of Pacific Islands and Oceania.</p>
<p>Until now, scientists have only estimated the size of the genomes for two species of Tmesipteris—T. tannensis and T. obliqua—both of which were found to contain gigantic genomes, at 73.19 and 147.29 gigabase pairs (Gbp) respectively.</p>
<p>In 2023, lead authors Dr. Jaume Pellicer and Dr. Oriane Hidalgo, from the IBB and formerly of RBG Kew, traveled to New Caledonia to collect samples of Tmesipteris, which were then analyzed to estimate the size of their genomes. This involved isolating the nuclei of thousands of cells, staining them with a dye and then measuring how much dye had bound to the DNA within each nucleus—the more dye, the bigger the genome.</p>

</figure><p>The analysis revealed the species T. oblanceolata to have a record-breaking genome size of 160.45 Gbp, which is about 7% larger than that of P. japonica (148.89 Gbp).</p>
<p>When unraveled, the DNA from each cell of this fern would stand taller than the Elizabeth Tower in Westminster, London, which is 96m tall and home to the world-famous Big Ben bell. For comparison, the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+genome/" rel="tag">human genome</a> contains about 3.1 Gbp distributed across 23 chromosomes and when stretched out like a ball of yarn, the length of DNA in each cell only measures about 2m.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Dr. Pellicer, a researcher in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+biology/" rel="tag">evolutionary biology</a>, says, "Tmesipteris is a unique and fascinating small genus of ferns, whose ancestors evolved about 350 million years ago—well before dinosaurs set foot on Earth—and it is distinguished by its mainly epiphytic habit [it grows mainly on the trunks and branches of trees] and restricted distribution in Oceania and several Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>"For a long time, we thought that breaking the previous size record of Paris japonica was going to be an impossible mission, but once again, the limits of biology have surpassed our most optimistic predictions.</p>
<p>"Based on our previous research, we anticipated the existence of giant genomes in Tmesipteris. That said, discovering the largest genome of them all is not just a feat of scientific exploration, but the result of an almost fourteen-year journey into the boundless complexity and diversity of plant genomes."</p>
<p>To date, scientists across the globe have estimated the genome sizes of more than 20,000 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/eukaryotic+organisms/" rel="tag">eukaryotic organisms</a>, revealing in the process a wide range of genome sizes across the tree of life. These, in turn, have been found to have a profound impact not only on their anatomy, as bigger genomes need bigger cells to house them and take longer to replicate, but also how they function, evolve, and where and how they live.</p>

<p>In animals, some of the largest genomes include the marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) at 129.90 Gbp and the Neuse River waterdog (Necturus lewisi) at 117.47 Gbp. In stark contrast, six of the largest-known eukaryotic genomes are held by plants, including the European mistletoe (Viscum album) at 100.84 Gbp.</p>

																																			<p>Surprisingly, having a larger genome is usually not an advantage. In the case of plants, species possessing large amounts of DNA are restricted to being slow growing perennials, are less efficient at photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert the sun's energy into sugars) and require more nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphates) to grow and compete successfully with their smaller-genomed neighbors. In turn, such effects may influence the ability of a plant to adapt to climate change and their risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Dr. Ilia Leitch, Senior Research Leader—Character Evolution, at RBG Kew, says, "Who would have thought this tiny, unassuming plant that most people would likely walk past without notice, could bear a world-beating record in genome size.</p>
<p>"Compared to other organisms, plants are incredibly diverse when viewed at the DNA level, and that should make us pause to think about their intrinsic value in the wider picture of global biodiversity. This discovery also raises many new and exciting questions about the upper limits of what is biologically possible, and we hope to solve these mysteries one day."</p>
<p>Adam Millward, Managing Editor of Guinness World Records, says, "To think this innocuous-looking fern boasts 50 times more DNA than humans is a humbling reminder that there's still so much about the plant kingdom we don't know, and that record holders aren't always the showiest on the outside."</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Radon. I graduated college last year and now work as a
software engineer in DevOps/Infrastructure. In my free time, I also
maintain <a href="https://github.com/raxod502">a number of open-source
projects</a>.</p>
<p>While I was in college, I interned at the startup Replit. This blog
post is the story of how Replit is using legal threats and their
venture-capital funding to bully me into shutting down an open-source
project they don’t like.</p>

<h2 id="whats-replit" tabindex="-1">What’s Replit?</h2>
<p>Replit makes a webapp you can use to run code online in different
programming languages. This is nothing new (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=run+python+online">just Google “run python
online”</a> for
proof), so Replit’s value proposition is extra features like sharing
your work, installing third-party packages, and hosting webapps.</p>
<p>I worked for Replit in Summer 2019, where I was asked to rebuild
Replit’s package management stack and make it open-source. If you like
reading about tech stuff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504051428/https://blog.replit.com/upm">here’s the post I wrote for Replit’s
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/upm">here’s the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I took a job elsewhere in Summer 2020, but still chatted with them
occasionally by email when they reached out to tell me about something
cool Replit had developed.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-open-source-project" tabindex="-1">What was my open-source project?</h2>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/riju-languages.png" alt="Screenshot of
language select page in Riju" width="100%"></center>
<p>The aspect of Replit that I really enjoyed was how it supported lots
of different programming languages. (I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504023410/https://blog.replit.com/elisp">another blog post for
Replit</a>
about how they do that.) That got me thinking: how many programming
languages could you possibly cram into a single website?</p>
<p>To explore that question, I put together my own little webapp that
could run code online. After about a day, I had something that worked.
(If you’re wondering why it was so fast—it turns out you only need
<a href="https://github.com/raxod502/python-in-a-box">30 lines of code</a> to let
people run Python code in a webapp! This may be why there are so many
websites for running Python online…)</p>
<p>After it was working, I started adding as many different programming
languages as I could. As you can see from this excerpt of my project’s
version history, I got a little overexcited:</p>

                                                                   ---------

2020-06-09 846caf2 At this point the number of languages is absurd        79
</code></pre>
<p>I eventually ended up with 216 languages, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512193221/https://replit.com/languages">all 38 languages
from
Replit</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">all 100 languages from Yusuke Endoh’s “Quine
Relay”</a>, and a good deal more
besides. You might ask: Why did I spend so much time adding obscure
programming languages to a webapp nobody was going to use? Well, let
me put it this way: Is it the weirdest 2020 hobby you’ve seen?</p>

<p>One day, I got an email from Replit letting me know about a new
feature they released. I figured this was a good time to share my
open-source project with them, in case they wanted to take inspiration
from any of my work:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-1.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit sharing a post from their blog, and my response
sharing my open-source project with them" width="100%"></center>
<p>At first, I got a positive response. But then, 30 minutes later, out
of nowhere, Replit accused me of unethical behavior and stealing their
design:</p>

<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-2.png" alt="Screenshot of
one email from Replit praising my open-source project, and an
immediately subsequent one accusing me of unethical behavior and
stealing 'internal design decisions'" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now, none of the ideas I used in my open-source project were “internal
design decisions”: they’ve all been published publicly on Replit’s
blog (I knew this because I’d been asked to <em>write</em> some of those blog
posts during my internship). And my project also wasn’t any more of a
Replit clone than any of the other websites on the first few pages of
Google results for “run python online”, most of which look exactly the
same:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-ui-montage.png" alt="Screenshot of
nine different webapps that let you run Python online, all of which
look more or less identical" width="100%"></center>
<p>But I figured I might have missed something, so I asked for details:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-3.png" alt="Screenshot
excerpt of my email asking Replit for details about what ideas they
were claiming I stole" width="100%"></center>
<p>(The rest of this email is basically me repeating the previous
paragraph of this article, but with a lot more technical details. You
can read the whole email <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on Imgur</a>,
mirrored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530184721/https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on the Internet
Archive</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Replit refused to provide any specifics on what they
were saying I had done wrong, reiterated their previous statements,
and threatened me with a lawsuit:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-4.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit threatening me with a lawsuit" width="100%"></center>
<p>And then just to put a cherry on top, Replit sent me another email
reminding me that they <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">just raised $20 million from their investors
last
month</a>,
and they weren’t afraid to use it against me. The “me” in question
being one of their previous interns who just graduated from college a
year ago, and who isn’t running any kind of commercial operation
whatsoever.</p>

<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-5.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit threatening me with their money" width="100%"></center>
<p>I’d like to point out two things about this email:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remark about “commits like this”—this is actually misleading.
There’s only one commit in my project that mentions Replit, and it’s
the one I already showed you earlier, from my third day of coding,
when I’d just added all 38 languages that Replit supported, before
moving onto the 178 other languages I wanted to add.</li>
<li>The remark about me being a “demanding” intern—I’m not actually
sure what this is meant to imply, especially since Replit had just
tried to recruit me earlier that day (see the screenshot of their
first email). But I’ll leave it alone because it’s not really
relevant to the issue at hand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happened-after-replit-threatened-to-sue-me" tabindex="-1">What happened after Replit threatened to sue me?</h2>
<p>Naturally, I took down my project right away, gave it some time for
feelings to cool, and sent Replit an apology. I figured something
might have been lost over email, so I asked to get on a call:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-6.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email in which I apologize to Replit and ask to have a call" width="100%"></center>
<p>Unfortunately, Replit ignored this email, so I sent them another one
following up. This one got a response, but not the one I was hoping
for:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-7.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit making it clear that they have no intention of
talking to me further" width="100%"></center>
<p>Just in case Replit didn’t understand that I wasn’t OK with this
situation, I sent three follow-up emails explaining as such over the
next few weeks, all of which were ignored.</p>
<p>In other words, Replit stands by its threat: if I re-publish my
open-source project, then they will sue me with “top lawyers”.</p>
<h2 id="is-replit-right" tabindex="-1">Is Replit right?</h2>
<p>Replit claimed that my open-source project was:</p>
<ol>
<li>a clone of Replit</li>
<li>based on their trade secrets (“internal design decisions”)</li>
<li>unethical to build</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s examine this claim, part by part:</p>
<ol>
<li>In developing my project, was I making a clone of Replit?</li>
<li>In developing my project, did I make use of any trade secrets of
Replit?</li>
<li>Was it unethical for me to develop an open-source project that’s
similar to Replit, after working for them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 2 have a fair number of technical details, so I’ve put
them <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/evidence">in a separate post</a>. The TL;DR is:</p>
<ol>
<li>My project isn’t any more similar to Replit than the 15 other
(commercial!) ones you can find on Google by searching “run python
online” or “online programming environment”.</li>
<li>Every similarity between my project and Replit can be explained by
looking only at GitHub repositories and blog posts that were
<em>published online by Replit itself</em>, making them obviously not any
kind of secret.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s address question 3 here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Was it unethical for me to develop an open-source project that’s
similar to Replit, after working for them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the answer to this question is no, for a number of
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riju is entirely non-commercial. Unlike Replit, I didn’t seek
funding from any source—advertising, donations, fundraising,
subscriptions, whatever. I have no interest in running a business,
and never really <em>wanted</em> Riju to become too popular, since I was
the one paying the server bill.</li>
<li>Riju wasn’t stealing customers from Replit. Based on my analytics
data, there were 38 visits to Riju during the month of February.
(Half of those were probably me.) Meanwhile, Replit had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505162911/https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1389976994423525378">over 7
million
users</a>.
There’s obviously no sense in which Riju was competing with Replit.</li>
<li>Riju wasn’t <em>built</em> as a competitor to Replit, either. Since the
architecture was limited to running on a single server, anyone could
bring the entire system down just by typing in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork
bomb</a>—and one of my
friends did, just to see what would happen. (The system crashed.) If
I were designing a product to compete with Replit, I certainly
wouldn’t have picked an architecture that could only scale to
toy-project size.</li>
<li>Replit’s core value proposition isn’t letting you run code online
(you can do this in dozens of places for free), it’s the features
they offer on top of running code. Riju categorically lacked all of
these features, including: having a user account, saving your work,
sharing your work, publishing webapps, persistent workspaces,
discussion forums, integration with GitHub, etc. etc.</li>
<li>I had no bad intentions towards Replit when developing Riju, and
wasn’t trying to hide anything. As proof of these claims, I offer
the fact that I had the project public on my GitHub from the
beginning, and the fact that Replit found out about the project
because I openly shared it with them of my own volition, extending
an offer for them to take inspiration from my work.</li>
<li>Riju was never intended to be a product, it was intended to be a
personal playground / art piece. As proof of this claim, I offer the
fact that I spent dozens of hours adding languages like
<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hexagony">Hexagony</a> and
<a href="https://www.snobol4.org/">SNOBOL</a> rather making it so you could
save your work(!).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not a business person. I’m just an open-source dev who likes to
build weird things for fun. (If you doubt my track record of building
things that don’t make money, just check out <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/about/projects">the list on my
website</a>, and note the conspicuous absence of
anything that’s ever made a cent of revenue.)</p>
<p>I would never try to steal someone’s business after I worked with
them. Hurting Replit was not my intent in working on Riju, and to
accuse me otherwise—especially without asking a single clarifying
question, and refusing all offers to have a discussion—shows a great
deal of bad faith on the part of Replit, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you’d like to decide for yourself who is in the right, I’m happy to
put all of the evidence out in the open (except the code, because
Replit’s standing by its promise to sue me if I do). Again, I have <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/evidence">a
separate post</a> with all the technical details. And you can
also read all communications between me and Replit, in full and
unabridged form, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on Imgur</a>, mirrored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530184721/https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on
the Internet
Archive</a>).
(Technical details about Replit internals redacted, as well as any
statement that could reveal such details indirectly.)</p>
<h2 id="why-would-replit-do-this" tabindex="-1">Why would Replit do this?</h2>
<p>Replit’s stated ideals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouraging open-source development (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/replit">open-sourcing parts of
their technology</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522215545/https://blog.replit.com/github">adding GitHub support

Replit</a>;
Replit’s CEO: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108083314/https://amasad.me/github">“I owe my entire career to
open-source”</a>)</li>
<li>giving back to the community (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504051428/https://blog.replit.com/upm">the blog post Replit asked me to
write</a>:
“we are migrating […] to do our part in improving the ecosystem
for developers everywhere”; “Giving back to the community. The core

<li>making it easy to share and remix your creations (e.g. Replit’s CEO
on learning to program: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522215545/https://blog.replit.com/github">“I’d download projects related to what I
wanted to build […] change &amp; tinker with them, and get
inspired”</a>;
he advises others to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522212135/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1395074521804148738">fork</a>
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211025614/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1359697571011125253">remix</a>
too, and sells this philosophy as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522212034/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1392517080017108992">a differentiating feature of
Replit</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Replit’s actions in this case reveal hypocrisy:</p>
<ul>
<li>they say they encourage open-source development, but when my
open-source project offended them, they shut it down with extreme
prejudice</li>
<li>they claim to be giving back to the community through their
open-source and blog posts, but when I tried to use those ideas in a
community project, they threatened to sue me</li>
<li>they say they make it easy to share and remix your creations—but
when I tried to remix Replit itself, I became a <em>persona non grata</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Replit’s emails to me, their threats were based on the fact that I
had worked for them in the past. However, I believe this reasoning is
a smokescreen. To see why, let’s take a look at some tweets that
Replit’s CEO, Amjad, posted just after threatening me by email:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-1.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's deleted tweet calling for 'copycats' to be banned from venture
capital" width="75%"></center>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-2.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's deleted tweet denigrating 'copycats'" width="60%"></center>
<p>Amjad later deleted these tweets because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505050939/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1377604981549752320">they proved
controversial</a>:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-3.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's tweet explaining that they deleted their previous,
controversial tweets" width="60%"></center>
<p>In these tweets, Amjad points out that Athens Research was clearly
inspired by another company, and argues that they should therefore be
“ridiculed” and banned from receiving funding. Furthermore, he says:
“I stand by what I said about copycats in general”, i.e. he disdains
all people that he thinks are “copying” existing ones, not just the
specific company in his tweet.</p>
<p>There is a clear resemblance between Amjad’s comments on Athens
Research and his legal threats towards my own project. He even used
exactly the same word, “copycat”, in both. In the case of Athens
Research, there was nothing Amjad could do to express his disdain
besides denigrate them on Twitter. But in my case, since I had worked
for Replit before, Amjad had an excuse to throw accusations my
way—accusations that, if you aren’t familiar with the facts, sound
like they could be legitimate.</p>
<p>I’d also like to reiterate that the person Replit is threatening with
“top lawyers” and “a lot of money” is a <em>new grad</em> with <em>no company</em>,
<em>no funding</em>, and <em>no commercial ambitions</em>. If someone with an actual
commercial enterprise were to offend Replit, I shudder to think what
treatment <em>they</em> might receive.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-replit-respond-to-this-blog-post" tabindex="-1">How did Replit respond to this blog post?</h2>
<p>After I posted the article in the morning, it was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195">discussed
extensively on Hacker
News</a>. Around 5pm,
Amjad posted an apology on Hacker News, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27429234">which has also been
discussed</a>.</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/amjad-hn-1.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Amjad apologizing for making legal threats, and my reply
indicating I would like to have a call" width="70%"></center>
<p>He also reached out to schedule a call, which I naturally agreed to:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-8.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Amjad promising that he will not sue me, and my response
thanking him and clarifying a point about how he quoted me" width="100%"></center>
<p>During the call, Amjad apologized for making legal threats, but
reiterated that he felt I had made a clone of Replit and that I had
acted unethically. Eventually we agreed to disagree, and he promised
in writing that he was fine with my putting my project back up:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-9.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's comment on HackerNews saying that he apologizes for making
legal threats, but still feels I acted unethically" width="100%"></center>
<p>In retrospect, I’m a little disappointed that Amjad:</p>
<ul>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210608153700/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1401957368510906369">publicly doubling
down</a>
on his decision to threaten me, and didn’t post an update to that
thread after the phone call</li>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210607231029/https://twitter.com/amasad">publicly
retweeting</a>
an accusation that I “literally stole and published IP”, although he
did at least delete the retweet</li>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) making a <a href="#replit-email-5">nebulous personal
attack</a> in writing that I was a “demanding intern”
right after <a href="#replit-email-2">trying to hire me</a></li>
<li>said in the phone call, right after “apologizing”, that he felt as
if he had invited me into his house and I had betrayed his trust</li>
<li>still refused to list any specific part of Replit he thought I had
copied, even when I asked him for such details multiple times during
the phone call, despite his continuing to claim both privately and
publicly that I copied Replit unethically</li>
<li>misquoted me in writing to make me look like I agreed with his
accusations, right after reaching out to apologize for his behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I think this could have gone better.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I’m happy that we were able to get the situation worked
out amicably, and I look forward to moving on with my life—including
putting Riju back up, after I can get things compiling again :)</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

            <p><em>Hello infrastructure enthusiasts! I had a lot of fun back in August 2023 talking about
                <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-electrical-infrastructure">South Pole Electrical Infrastructure</a>. Since then,
                several people have asked me to detail other infrastructure systems.</em></p>
            <p><em>I started this post while I was
                still at Pole, but I only finally got around to finishing it. Better late than never – enjoy!</em></p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>This post will focus on how we produce fresh water and how we dispose
              of wastewater at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>The majority of the world’s population lives in coastal regions, and researchers in Antarctica are no exception.</p>
            <p>Most Antarctic research stations sit on or near the coast.
              Coastal stations are easier to operate, because
              the ocean provides a moderating effect on the climate, access to ship-based transportation,
              a water source, and a mechanism to dispose of (hopefully treated!) wastewater.</p>
            <p>In addition, many of the interesting scientific sites are located near the coast. The majority of human
              activity in Antarctica is for scientific research purposes, so it makes sense to situate these stations nearby
              the sites that they are designed to help study.</p>
            <p>In fact, there are only three year-round stations that are <strong><em>not</em></strong> located on the coast. Here’s a
              decent map of major Antarctic research facilities, from
              <a href="https://www.comnap.aq/antarctic-facilities-information">COMNAP</a>
              (The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs). Yellow dots are year-round facilities, red dots
              are summer-only facilities.</p>

            <p>This is not an exhaustive map. I’m aware of stations that are not shown here.
              This is a decent estimation showing the general pattern of human activity in Antarctica. If your station
              isn’t shown here, please do not get mad at me. Take it up with CONMAP.</p>
            <p>The South Pole is one of those three inland yellow dots, far from the coast.
              We’re located high up on an inland plateau, about 975 miles South of McMurdo Station. (Of course, we are,
              by definition, South of <em>literally everywhere</em>.)</p>
            <p>Remember, McMurdo is the United States’ main coastal logistics hub for Antarctic research, and it’s where I
              spent the first 4 months after my <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/mcmurdo-arrival">arrival on-continent</a>.</p>
            <p>In this post, I’ll quickly review McMurdo’s water infrastructure, before moving on to discuss water infrastructure
              at the South Pole.</p>

            <p>In order to appreciate the unique challenges of water management infrastructure at the inland South Pole
              Station, it’s worth taking some time first to understand water infrastructure at McMurdo, right on the coast.</p>
            <p>As a coastal station, McMurdo has year-round access to liquid seawater, right at the bottom of the hill,
              at the edge of town.
              Sometimes it’s buried under ice, but there’s always liquid water available below that, even in the middle
              of winter when the air temperature is a brisk -30°F.</p>
            <p>McMurdo brings in raw seawater using a series of pumps. The raw seawater intake infrastructure is located
              in building 179, the Seawater Intake Facility:</p>
            <p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>The seawater is pumped up a series of insulated pipes:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>To safely transport water without it freezing in the pipes, we use thick, insulated pipes, with integrated
              heat trace cabling. Heat trace cabling is just controlled, high-resistance wiring that runs the length
              of the pipe. When electricity is passed through the wire, it heats up.
              The heat is trapped by the thick insulation, and it keeps the water in the pipe from freezing.
              This allows us to safely use above-ground pipes in -30°F weather:</p>

            <p>Seawater is used for two purposes in McMurdo. The first use of seawater is for the salt water aquarium in

            <p>The second use for seawater, is, of course, to produce potable (“domestic”) water for station operations.</p>
            <p>At McMurdo, seawater passes through several major steps. I’ll be brief here, because the real focus of this
              post is the South Pole. All of this processing takes place at the McMurdo water treatment plant:</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/south-pole-water-infrastructure/mcmurdo-water-plant-01.jpg">
                <picture>

                  <source srcset="https://brr.fyi/media/south-pole-water-infrastructure/mcmurdo-water-plant-01-small.jpg" type="image/jpg">
                  <img src="https://brr.fyi/media/south-pole-water-infrastructure/mcmurdo-water-plant-01-small.jpg" alt="McMurdo Water Plant 01">
                </picture>
                <em>McMurdo water plant.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>The first step is heating. Liquid seawater enters the plant at about 28°F. Since the water is salty, it remains
              liquid at a lower temperature than fresh water. Before we can remove the salt, we have to heat it. We use
              waste heat from the power plant to heat the water to about 37°F.</p>
            <p>The second step is filtering. Raw seawater can contain sediment, which must be removed prior to further
              treatment.</p>
            <p>The third step is desalination. McMurdo uses a reverse osmosis system for this. In short – the seawater
              is pressurized, then forced through a fine membrane. This process allows only pure water through. Salt,
              along with several other naturally-occurring minerals, are left behind. These are returned to the sea.</p>
            <p>The fourth step is “polishing”. Pure water, straight out of the reverse osmosis system, isn’t actually
              desirable. It can cause issues with distribution piping, and it is less than ideal for human consumption
              due to both aesthetic (taste) and nutritional reasons. Polishing involves the use of chemicals to adjust
              the hardness and pH levels, for optimal distribution. A small amount of chlorine is also added, which helps
              mitigate the negative effects of any contamination in the storage and distribution system.</p>
            <p>Finally, the water is sent to storage and distribution! McMurdo stores hundreds of thousands of gallons of
              treated water, ready
              for distribution. Remember, peak summer population can exceed 1,000 people. Water is also used for
              firefighting, so a significant amount of storage is required.</p>

            <p>That’s McMurdo! It’s not that weird. Cold, but not too cold. Take raw seawater, keep it from freezing,
              purify it, distribute it, use it. Take the wastewater, treat it, release it. Again, not that weird.</p>
            <p>Now – let’s talk about water at the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="south-pole-freshwater-infrastructure">South Pole Freshwater Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>At the South Pole, there is no liquid water source available. Pole is hundreds of miles from
              the coast, high up on an inland plateau, and it’s absurdly cold.</p>
            <p>

                <em>Vast, cold, barren nothingness, and no liquid water in sight.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Luckily – that plateau is made up of several thousand feet
              of snow! It’s a lot of work, but we can melt this snow and produce potable water.</p>
            <p>This is no small feat of engineering, and the
              underlying physics means it’s an energy-intensive process. The deep-down snow at the South Pole is around -60°F.
              It takes 2.44 watt-hours (8.33 BTUs) of heat input to raise the temperature of 1 gallon of water by 1°F.
              Heating the equivalent of 1 gallon of water from -60°F to a reasonable liquid distribution temperature (50°F)
              means heating it up by a whopping <strong>110°F</strong>. That’s 268 watt-hours of raw energy
              required just to bring a single gallon of water up to distribution temperature!</p>
            <p>This is one of the reasons we’re restricted to <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/showering-at-the-south-pole">two-minute showers</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="supply">Supply</h2>
            <p>Water at the South Pole begins with a “Rodwell”, short for “Rodriguez Well”. The original design for
              the Rodwell comes from an engineer named Raul Rodriguez, who designed it for a camp in Greenland.</p>
            <p>The Rodwell is located below the Rodwell support building, which is located several hundred feet
              away from station. By “The Rodwell”, I should clarify that
              I’m referring to the <strong>current</strong> Rodwell. As I’ll discuss later, these don’t last forever. We’re on
              what is now officially called “Rodwell 3”. We’ve had more Rodwells than that in the history of the
              South Pole, but the naming convention began when Rodwell location planning was standardized. We have
              locations already planned out for several more Rodwells.</p>

            <p>The basic operation of a Rodwell is straightforward. You drill a hole in the snow.
              You start pumping hot water into the hole. The hot water melts the snow, which pushes outward and forms
              an underground lake. You can pump liquid water out of the lake! As long as you keep adding heat, by
              recirculating hot water down into the hole, you can keep expanding the lake and keep pumping water
              out of it.</p>

            <p>Inside the support building is all the equipment we need to manage the Rodwell. The building is heated,

            <p>The well itself goes down several hundred feet. There’s two water lines, one for the water we pump out,
              and another for the hot water we recirculate down. There is also electrical wiring for the submerged pump,
              and signal wiring for sensors and control circuitry.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Normally, water is pumped out of the Rodwell, and then pumped hundreds of feet toward station, to the main water
              treatment plant. Some of the water
              is taken for station use. The rest of the water passes through a series of heat exchangers in the water plant,
              before it is then pumped
              back to the Rodwell. This heated, recirculated water is used to keep the underground lake serviceable.</p>

            <p>Since the Rodwell is located several hundred feet from the water plant, we need backup systems
              to ensure that there is <em>always</em> a hot water supply to the Rodwell, even if something happened to the return
              piping between the water plant and Rodwell.</p>
            <p>For resiliency, the Rodwell support building itself has backup boilers and heat exchangers.
              It’s essential that we <em>never</em> lose
              the recirculated hot water loop down into the Rodwell, else we risk damaging it.
              Constant heat input to the system is a critical requirement for its continued operation.</p>

            <p>We use each Rodwell for several years. Once it gets too big (we’re talking <em>millions</em> of gallons),
              we stop pumping fresh water out of it, and
              we start over with a new one in a new location.
              The old one gets converted to be used for wastewater disposal – more on
              that part later.</p>
            <p>Much more fascinating historical documentation about Rodwells can be found
              on Bill Spindler’s <a href="https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/rodwell/rodwell.html">South Pole Station</a>
              website.</p>
            <p>As discussed above, once water is pumped out of the Rodwell,
              it exits the Rodwell support building, and it enters into the ice tunnels below.</p>

            <p>The water pipes exit the ice tunnels and enter the main water plant.</p>
            <p>The water plant is located adjacent to the power plant, in the arches, at the bottom of the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/beer-can">beer can</a>.
              This means we can
              easily use a glycol loop carrying generator waste heat, from the power plant next door, to power these
              heat exchangers.</p>

            <p>When the water enters the treatment plant, it first passes through a series of limestone contactors. Limestone
              contactors are used to increase the pH of the water by adding minerals. This improves corrosion resistance
              and makes the water suitable for human consumption. Contactors can be brought online or taken offline as needed,
              depending on the amount of treatment needed to achieve desired target outcomes.</p>
            <p>Note that <strong>all</strong> water passes through the contactors, even water that will be recirculated back to the Rodwell.</p>

            </p>
            <p>After the limestone contactors, the majority of the water is sent toward heat exchangers, which are used to heat up
              the water that will be sent back to the Rodwell. The Rodwell circulation loop uses the majority of the water that
              is pumped out of the Rodwell. Only a small portion is diverted for domestic use.</p>
            <p>The water is about 36°F when it is pumped out of
              the Rodwell, and it reaches about 42°F after it makes it all the way to the water plant and through the
              limestone contactors.</p>
            <p>Domestic water does not receive any direct supplemental heating further along in the process. Additional heat gains
              are due to ambient heat absorption from the water treatment plant, or due to heating along the insulated, heat-traced
              piping.</p>
            <p>Rodwell recirculation water, on the other hand, needs
              to be heated quite a bit, up to about 84°F. Remember, this water is pumped back
              down into the Rodwell, to maintain and expand the underground lake.</p>
            <p>Here you can see the heat exchanger infrastructure. Hot glycol is pumped in from the power plant next door.
              The heat exchangers place the hot glycol loop and water loop in close proximity, separated only by
              small layers of thermally-conductive metal. This allows for the efficient transfer of heat without the
              contents actually touching.</p>

            <p>The heat exchangers heat up the water to about 84°F. This heated water is sent back to the Rodwell building,
              where it is pumped back down into the Rodwell.</p>
            <p>The remaining portion of the water is destined for domestic use. It receives additional treatment.</p>
            <p>First, the water passes through a series of sediment and carbon filters:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Next, sodium carbonate (soda ash) is used for additional fine-grained pH control:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Finally, chlorine (calcium hypochlorite) is used as a disinfectant:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Once the domestic water has passed through all of these treatment steps, it is stored in bulk,
              unpressurized tanks. There are two tanks, so one can be taken offline for maintenance. The tanks
              are several thousand gallons, and they provide a storage buffer to guard against scheduled or unscheduled
              interruptions in the Rodwell supply or treatment process.</p>

            <p>Most of the washers are only connected to cold water, as an energy saving strategy. A few lucky (and coveted)
              machines have both a hot and cold water connection:</p>

              We participate in weekly “house mouse” cleaning tasks – this week, it was my team’s turn to clean. Other cleaning
              tasks include mopping the halls, vacuuming carpeted spaces, and shoveling snow from outside station entrances.</p>

            <p>And that pretty much covers the freshwater infrastructure at Pole!</p>
            <h2 id="south-pole-wastewater-infrastructure">South Pole Wastewater Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Wastewater at Pole is handled <strong><em>much</em></strong> differently from wastewater at McMurdo!</p>
            <p>As a reminder, from my
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/wastewater-plant">McMurdo Wastewater Plant</a> post, wastewater at McMurdo goes through
              a full wastewater treatment process. Treated wastewater is discharged into the ocean, and solids are processed
              and sent back to the United States for disposal.</p>
            <p>At Pole, we use the old, spent Rodwells for storing wastewater. When a Rodwell has reached its
              maximum size, we stop drawing fresh water from it, and we convert it into wastewater storage. From then on,
              it is known as the “sewage outfall”.</p>
            <p>Raw sewage and other wastewater flows into the current sewage outfall via a network of sewage pipes. The
              wastewater is stored underground indefinitely. No treatment is performed on this wastewater before it is
              sent underground. There are millions of gallons of raw, untreated wastewater stored in outfalls beneath
              South Pole Station.</p>
            <p>As of this writing (June 2024), a wastewater treatment plant is not currently planned or budgeted
              for South Pole Station, although one has been discussed at various points throughout
              the history of South Pole Station. A wastewater treatment plant does appear as a recommendation in the
              <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/documents/SPSMP_Fed%20Reg%20Draft_NSF.pdf">South Pole Station Master Plan Draft 2024</a>
              (<strong>32 MB PDF</strong>) document on the NSF website.</p>
            <p>Disposing of raw sewage by injecting it beneath the ice is permitted under the
              <a href="https://www.ats.aq/e/waste.html">Antarctic Treaty System</a>,
              which is codified in US law under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-671#p-671.12(f)">45 CFR § 671.12(f)</a>.</p>
            <p>As I stated in my post about <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-electrical-infrastructure">South Pole Electrical Infrastructure</a>,
              it is my sincere hope that we continue working, with urgency, to reduce the environmental footprint of US Antarctic
              research.</p>
            <p>Wastewater from the elevated station flows from domestic drains and collects in holding pits. There are two main
              holding pits in the elevated station.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these is twofold: First, these pits provide a temporary storage buffer, allowing
              use of plumbing fixtures within the station during periods of maintenance on the discharge piping or
              sewer outfall.</p>
            <p>Second, wastewater can be collected in these pits until they are full, and then the wastewater can be
              force discharged at a high flow rate.
              Discharging at a high flow rate allows for efficient and more complete carrying of suspended solids. If waste
              were discharged all the way to the sewer outfall at the rate it was produced, the system would suffer from
              blockages caused by solids that settled out in transit.</p>
            <p>The first pit, for the “B” pod, is also co-located with our emergency water purification
              infrastructure, inside the Emergency Power Plant (EPP).
              This is part of the “lifeboat”, a wing of the station with redundant infrastructure that could
              function on its own in case the rest of the station were compromised.</p>
            <p>Here you can see the wastewater holding pit, as well as some of the emergency water purification equipment.</p>
            <p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>This wastewater pit collects all wastewater via gravity from the “B” pod.
              It normally discharges to the main sewage/wastewater outfall. However, in the event that this
              was compromised, it can also discharge to a much smaller emergency outfall. This ensures continuity of
              wastewater disposal in the event of an issue with the primary wastewater outfall.</p>
            <p>The emergency water purification infrastructure here can produce potable, domestic water by melting snow. A
              portable snowmelter can be set up just outside, with heat provided by a glycol loop.</p>
            <p>Up next is the “A” pod wastewater pit. This one is located inside a large mechanical room on the 1st floor
              of the “A” pod. Wastewater collects here via gravity from all fixtures in the “A” pod. It also discharges
              to the main outfall.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Once the pits are full, they automatically discharge to the sewer outfall. This follows roughly the same
              path as the domestic water supply piping. The pipes exit the station, go down the beer can,
              and travel through the ice tunnels, until they reach the current sewer outfall.</p>

            <p>Of course, not every building is connected to the plumbing system. In fact, at South Pole, only the elevated
              station and the power plant arch have running water and wastewater connections. The outbuildings (IceCube,
              MAPO, DSL, ARO, etc) are too far away, and so far it hasn’t been cost-effective to connect them.</p>
            <p>For folks working outside away from station, there are a variety of options.</p>
            <p>During the summer, when the population is high, we have porta-potties strategically located
              around campus:</p>

            <p>Permanent outbuildings also often have an established solution for handling human waste from workers.
              These solutions range from simple buckets, to permanently-installed dry toilets with
              removable storage bins.</p>
            <p>For work that takes you away from station, without access to toilet facilities, many personnel also carry
              portable bottles. These are a formal item, provided by USAP, and marked for their intended use.
              They are 32oz “HDPE” Nalgene bottles.</p>
            <p>You can obtain one at the beginning of your season,
              and it’s your responsibility to return it, thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, before you depart. These are often used
              by personnel who travel to deep field locations, but they are also helpful for any situation where you
              may find yourself away from permanent facilities.</p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>And there you have it – a brief tour of South Pole water and wastewater infrastructure!</p>
            <p>Much like <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-electrical-infrastructure">South Pole Electrical Infrastructure</a>, the
              infrastructure that makes all this possible is generally hidden from view. From an average user’s perspective,
              living and working in the elevated station, everything functions pretty much the way you’d expect it to.</p>
            <p>When you’re washing dishes in a windowless, heated room,
              and you turn on the faucet to fill the sink, it’s easy to forget
              all the work going on behind the scenes to make all this happen.</p>
            <p>But venture out to the Rodwell in the middle of winter, when it’s negative 100°F, and you’ll quickly
              be reminded of the forces we’re up against.</p>
            <p>From cold, to wind, to relentlessly accumulating snow, to the
              long, long supply chains for engineering expertise and spare parts, it’s a challenge to make things
              work at Pole. Our water and wastewater systems are critical infrastructure that enable
              humans to live at the bottom of the world.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.EmbeddedRelated.com/showarticle/152.php">https://www.EmbeddedRelated.com/showarticle/152.php</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40614338">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogarticle"><p>Well... maybe that's a stretch. I don't think I can recommend anything to help you win friends. Not my forte.
</p>
<p>But I am going to try to convince you why you should know about Chebyshev approximation, which is a technique for figuring out how you can come as close as possible to computing the result of a mathematical function, with a minimal amount of design effort and CPU power. Let's explore two use cases:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Amy has a low-power 8-bit microcontroller and needs to compute \( \sqrt{x} \) (square root) to get an accurate estimate of RMS power dissipated in a current sense resistor. She's finding that the math library implementation for <code>sqrt()</code> takes a lot of CPU time, and she's short on free program memory space, and is wondering if there is another way to compute square roots that takes less time and program memory.</li>
	<li>Bill is designing a sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) detector, with a sensor that outputs a voltage dependent on SO<sub>2</sub> gas concentration, and a microcontroller that converts that voltage to a reading of SO<sub>2</sub> concentration so it can be displayed. He's not greatly concerned about CPU time limitations, but somehow he has to figure out how to convert gas sensor voltage to a concentration, because the sensor is fairly nonlinear.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Amy's case, she has a known function that seems difficult to compute. In Bill's case, he has an unknown function that he has to figure out how to model. These are both cases of function evaluation with two very different priorities. Both are on embedded systems, which brings me to the Central Hypothesis of Mathematical Computation on Embedded Systems (CHoMCoES? It needs a better name, and I don't feel like calling it the Sachs Hypothesis):
</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>The only embedded systems that require precision floating-point computations are desktop calculators.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Let that sink in for a minute. Your computer is a wonderful thing. It can calculate pi to hundreds of decimal places in milliseconds, or model the airflow patterns around jet engine blades. The origins of the computer have been consistently centered around mathematical computation, with a huge surge of development around the end of the Second World War and through the early days of solid-state transistors. If you needed a computer in the 1940's and 1950's, it was for some precise mathematical calculation. Computers were very expensive to own and operate; if you needed a quick estimate of some math, there were slide rules. This was also the era where whole books were published containing tables of engineering functions, so that if you needed to calculate Bessel functions to 5 decimal places, you could do it by looking it up in a table.
</p>
<p>The desktop computer uses a calculation strategy of "full machine precision": for a given bit representation, there is only one correct answer to sin(x), and it is the bit pattern that is the one yields the smallest error from the exact mathematical calculation. Someone has written and tested mathematical software libraries that do this, and from there on out, it's just a function call.
</p>
<p>Embedded systems, on the other hand, tend to contain inexpensive processors that are doing things with analog-to-digital-converter measurements. You can do math to the full 53 bits of IEEE-754 double-precision, but if your ADC readings, or the signal conditioning that precedes them, are only accurate to 0.1% (10 bits), then mathematical errors will be dwarfed by the errors of signal conditioning.
</p>
<p>When you have a system that can tolerate mathematical errors, and has computing resource limitations driven by cost, all of a sudden the priority of mathematical computing changes. Now we have to decide what we really need when we want to compute something.
</p>
<p>Let's take Amy's problem first: <u>we need to compute a square root</u>.
</p>
<p>That statement is only an overview of what is needed. There are two major decisions that need to be made up front:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>over what <em>range</em> of x does \( \sqrt{x} \) need to be computed?</li>
	<li>what kind of <em>accuracy</em> does \( \sqrt{x} \) need? (and how does it vary with x?)</li>
</ul>
<p>General full-machine precision math libraries have easy answers to these questions: any input needs to be tolerated, and for each input there is one correct output, even if the correct output is an error (e.g. \( \sqrt{x} \) for negative inputs in systems that don't use complex numbers).
</p>
<p>In the embedded system, the accuracy and range requirements are judgement calls.
</p>
<p>Accuracy is an easy thing to understand: there are algorithms that take shortcuts to computing an expression, and the more inaccuracy can be tolerated, the more shortcuts can be taken.
</p>
<p>The range requirement is a bit more subtle. Obviously you have to support the expected range of inputs to an algorithm, and maybe you want to leave some engineering margin. But why would it be more expensive to calculate \( \sqrt{x} \) over a larger range? If I were to tell you that I was much more concerned about the range of a computation than the accuracy, would you believe me?
</p>
<p>Let's use a real example. Amy thinks she needs \( \sqrt{u} \) calculated over the range \( u \in [0.2, 5.0] \). Her first instinct is to go find her calculus textbook and look up Taylor Series:
</p>
<h2>How not to evaluate functions, part 1: Taylor Series</h2>
<p>Here is the Taylor series for \( \sqrt{1+x} \):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equation courtesy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root#Properties">Wikipedia</a>)
</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/3/713b1394e1acaa9a5bf87163060a363a.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>But there's a little footnote saying this only works for x between -1 and 1, meaning it won't work to calculate \( \sqrt{2} \) or the square root of anything 2 or larger. For \( \sqrt{5} \), she has to use a trick, namely that \( \sqrt{5} \) = \( 2\times\sqrt{5/4} \). So she decides to limit the actual input range of the Taylor series to cover the range of \( \sqrt{1+x} \) for \( x \in [-0.8,+0.25] \), and if \( u = 1+x &gt; 1.25 \) then Amy will do the divide-by-4 trick: (we'll use Python here; assume that Amy does something equivalent in C)
</p>
<pre>def sqrt1(x):
# returns sqrt(1+x) for x between -0.8 and +0.25
   return 1 + x/2 - x*x/8 + x*x*x/16
def sqrtapprox(u):
# valid for x between 0.2 to 5.0
   if (u &gt;= 1.25):
      return sqrt1(u/4-1)*2
   else:
      return sqrt1(u-1)
</pre>
<p>Is this good enough? Hmm, let's think about this. We want to know the error between a function and its approximation(s). Let's graph that error. Here's a quick Python function that uses numpy and matplotlib to plot the results:
</p>
<pre>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def showplots(f,approxlist,a,b):
    x = np.linspace(a,b,1000)
    plt.figure(1)
    plt.subplot(211)
    plt.plot(x,f(x))
    vfuncs = [np.vectorize(approx) for approx in approxlist]
    for vf in vfuncs:
        plt.plot(x,vf(x))
    plt.xlim(a,b)
    plt.ylabel('f(x) and approximations fa(x)')
    plt.subplot(212)
    for vf in vfuncs:
        plt.plot(x,f(x)-vf(x))
    plt.xlim(a,b)
    plt.ylabel('error = f(x)-fa(x)')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.show()
</pre>
<p>The results of <code>showplots(np.sqrt,[sqrtapprox],0.2,5.0)</code> will show us the error between the full-machine-precision <code>sqrt()</code> and our approximation:
</p>

</p>
<p>Yuck. A worst-case error of 0.038. Let's try some more terms in the Taylor series. That means we have to figure out how the coefficients work. A little pencil and paper algebra shows the coefficients starting from the quadratic term are
$$\begin{eqnarray}
a_2 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{4\times 2} = -\frac{1}{8}, \cr
a_3 &amp;=&amp; +\frac{3\times 1}{6\times 4\times 2} = \frac{1}{16}, \cr
a_4 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{5\times 3\times 1}{8\times 6\times 4\times 2} = \frac{5}{128}, \cr
a_5 &amp;=&amp; +\frac{7\times 5\times 3\times 1}{10\times 8\times 6\times 4\times 2} = \frac{7}{256}, \cr
a_6 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{9\times 7\times 5\times 3\times 1}{12\times 10\times 8\times 6\times 4\times 2} = -\frac{21}{1024}
\end{eqnarray}$$
and so on, so we try again:
</p>
<pre>def sqrt1a(x):
# returns sqrt(1+x) for x between -0.8 and +0.25
   return 1 + x/2 - x*x/8 + x*x*x/16 - 5.0/128*x*x*x*x
def sqrtapproxa(u):
# valid for x between 0.2 to 5.0
   if (u &gt;= 1.25):
      return sqrt1a(u/4-1)*2
   else:
      return sqrt1a(u-1)
def sqrt1b(x):
# returns sqrt(1+x) for x between -0.8 and +0.25
   return 1 + x/2 - x*x/8 + x*x*x/16 - 5.0/128*x*x*x*x + 7.0/256*x*x*x*x*x
def sqrtapproxb(u):
# valid for x between 0.2 to 5.0
   if (u &gt;= 1.25):
      return sqrt1b(u/4-1)*2
   else:
      return sqrt1b(u-1)
</pre>
<p>Here are the results for sqrtapproxa (a 4th-degree Taylor series):

</p>
<p>And here are the results for sqrtapproxb (a 5th-degree Taylor series):

</p>
<p>Yuck. We added two more terms and we only got the error down to 0.015.
</p>
<p>Here's what you need to learn about Taylor series for function evaluation. (Or rather, read this and whatever you don't understand, just trust me.)
</p>
<p>To get the coefficients of a Taylor series for a function f in a region around a point \( x=x_0 \), you evaluate \( f(x_0) \) and all of the derivatives of \( f(x) \) at \( x=x_0 \). You don't have to look at the function anywhere else; the behavior at \( x=x_0 \) somehow lets you know what  \( f(x) \)  is elsewhere. For some functions (like \( \sqrt{1+x} \) ) the region of convergence is finite; for others like \( \sin x \) or \( e^x \) the region of convergence is everywhere.
</p>
<p>Taylor series work on most everyday functions, because these functions have a property called "analyticity": all of their derivatives exist and are therefore continuous and smooth, and through the magic of mathematics this means that looking at an analytic function only at 1 point will tell you enough information to calculate it in some nearby region.
</p>
<p>Right near \( x=x_0 \), Taylor series are great. The error between the exact function and the first N terms of the corresponding Taylor series will be extremely small around \( x=x_0 \). As you move away from \( x=x_0 \), the error starts to become larger. In general, the more terms you use, the better the approximation will be around \( x=x_0 \), but when the approximation starts to do poorly at the edge of its range, it diverges faster.
</p>
<p>To sum this up:<strong> Taylor series approximations do not distribute the approximation error fairly.</strong> The error is small at \( x=x_0 \), but its error tends to be much larger at the edges of its range.
</p>
<p>Now I'm going to show you two more attempts at approximating \( \sqrt{x} \) for \( x \in [0.2, 5.0] \), but I'm going to wait before explaining how I came up with them.
</p>
<pre>def sqrt1c(x):
# valid for x between 0.2 to 1.25
   coeffs = [0.20569678, -0.94612133, 1.79170646, -1.89014568, 1.66083189, 0.17814197]
   y = 0
   for c in coeffs:
      y = y * x + c
   return y
def sqrtapproxc(u):
# valid for u between 0.2 to 5.0
   if (u &gt;= 1.25):
      return sqrt1c(u/4)*2
   else:
      return sqrt1c(u)
def sqrtapproxd(x):
# valid for x between 0.2 to 5.0
   coeffs = [0.00117581,-0.01915684,0.12329254,-0.41444219,1.04368339, 0.26700714]
   y = 0
   for c in coeffs:
      y = y * x + c
   return y
</pre>
<p>Approximation "c" splits the range between \( [0.2,1.25) \) and \( [1.25,5] \) as before; approximation "d" operates over the entire range \( [0.2,5] \). Both are 5th-degree polynomials. Here is the performance of approximation "c":
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/8037220800_ca6a139588_o.png" alt="" width="646" height="486" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>You'll notice a peak error of about 0.00042. This is about 35 times smaller than the error in approximation "b" (the Taylor series version using 5th order polynomials with the same range split).
</p>
<p>Here is the error for approximation "d":
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8457/8037172712_cc0165778d_o.png" alt="" width="644" height="484" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>That's about 0.011 worst case error, which is about 30% smaller than approximation "b". We got better worst-case error, without having to split up the range, with a polynomial of the same degree!
</p>
<p>A few things to note from this exercise:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Good function approximations have error graphs with a characteristic "wiggle".</strong> Ideally they form a so-called minimax function, where the positive and negative peaks all line up. This spreads the error throughout the range of input argument, and can be orders of magnitude better accuracy than a Taylor series polynomial of the same degree. In practice, it is difficult to achieve the ideal minimax error graph, but there is an easy method that comes close to it, which I'll explain in a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Range reduction can improve the accuracy of function evaluation significantly.</strong> Approximations "c" and "d" both used 5th degree polynomials, but approximation "d" used the whole input range (a 25:1 ratio of maximum to minimum input), whereas approximation "c" only used a part of the input range (with 6.25:1 ratio of maximum to minimum input), and "c" was 25 times more accurate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How not to evaluate functions, part 2: lookup tables</h2>
<p>All right, so let's toss out Taylor series. The next approach is a lookup table. The idea is simple: you have an array of precomputed values for your function, and use those as a table to evaluate the function. Let's look at a solution for \( \sqrt{x} \) over the \( [0.2, 5.0] \) range using a lookup table with 32 entries:
</p>
<pre>import math
def maketable0(func, a, b, n):
    table = func([(x+0.5)/n*(b-a)+a for x in range(0,n)])
    def tablefunc(x):
        if x &lt; a or x &gt; b:
            raise "out of range error"
        i = math.floor((x-a)/(b-a)*n)
        if i == n:
            i = n-1
        return table[i]
    return tablefunc
sqrtapproxe = maketable0(np.sqrt, 0.2, 5.0, 32
</pre>
<p>Using a lookup table involves the following process, which is fairly trivial but worth discussing nonetheless:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>At design time (or initialization time), divide the input range of the function into N intervals and evaluate the function within those intervals. (Usually the intervals are equal width and function evaluation is at the midpoint of each interval.)</li>
	<li>At runtime:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>handle out-of-range situations (either throw an error or return a value corresponding to min/max input)</li>
		<li>compute an index of which interval the function is in</li>
		<li>lookup the value in the table at that index</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Here's what the error of approximation "e" looks like:
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8039239534_bec155cf9c_o.png" alt="" width="644" height="484" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Note the stairsteppy result and the sawtooth error plot. This is typical for a plain table approach. The maximum error is roughly proportional to the slope of the function within an interval (the error is larger for small values of x where \( \sqrt{x} \) is steeper), and proportional to the interval size. If we want to reduce the error by a factor of 10, we need 10x as many lookup table entries.
</p>
<p>If we want to improve the situation, the next improvement we can use is linear interpolation:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>At design time (or initialization time), divide the input range of the function into N intervals and evaluate the function at the N+1 endpoints of those intervals. (Usually the intervals are equal width)</li>
	<li>At runtime:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>handle out-of-range situations (either throw an error or return a value corresponding to min/max input)</li>
		<li>compute an index k of which interval the function is in</li>
		<li>lookup the value in the table at that index and the next index</li>
		<li>perform a linear interpolation: <code>y = table[k]*(1-u) + table[k+1]*u</code>, where u is the number between 0 and 1 representing the position of the input within the interval (0 = beginning of interval, 1 = end)</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<pre>import math
def maketable1(func, a, b, n):
    table = func([float(x)/n*(b-a)+a for x in range(0,n+1)])
    def tablefunc(x):
        if x &lt; a or x &gt; b:
            raise "out of range error"
        ii = (x-a)/(b-a)*n
        i = math.floor(ii)
        if i == n:
            i = n-1
        u = ii-i
        return table[i]*(1-u) + table[i+1]*u
    return tablefunc
sqrtapproxf = maketable1(np.sqrt, 0.2, 5.0, 32)
</pre>
<p>Here's the error plot for approximation "f":
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/8039308346_b417950bee_o.png" alt="" width="646" height="486" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Much better — note the error plot containing parabolic sections. This is typical for interpolated table lookup. The maximum error is roughly proportional to the curvature (2nd derivative) of the function within an interval, and proportional to the square of the interval size. If we want to reduce the error by a factor of 10, we only need about 3x as many lookup table entries.
</p>
<p>This is one of the rare cases where table interpolation may be more appropriate than polynomial evaluation: the maximum error here is about 1/2 as much as the 5th-order polynomial we used in approximation "d".
</p>
<p>For a comparison in execution time: table lookup with no interpolation is roughly equivalent to a quadratic (2nd order) function, and table interpolation is roughly equivalent to a quartic (4th order) polynomial. That's only an estimate; it really depends on things like whether you're doing floating-point or fixed-point computation, whether the table has a length that is a power of 2 (it should be, so you can use bitwise operations to speed up the math), and how long it takes to perform table lookups on your processor.
</p>
<p>There are only a few situations, in my opinion, where table lookup is appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If accuracy requirements are very low, a non-interpolated table lookup may be sufficient.</li>
	<li>If a function is very "nonpolynomial" then an interpolated table lookup may produce superior accuracy compared to a polynomial evaluation of comparable execution time. (This appears to be the case for \( \sqrt{x} \) over the \( [0.2, 5.0] \) range. We'll define "nonpolynomial" shortly; for now just think of it as a function with a lot of wiggles or twists and turns.)</li>
	<li>If a function is very difficult to approximate with a polynomial over the whole range but needs very high accuracy, one option is to split the range into 4 or 8 subintervals and use table lookup to obtain polynomial coefficients for each subinterval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table lookup is <em>not</em> appropriate when it requires such a large table size that you have to worry about memory requirements.
</p>
<p>Also note that the error in approximation "f" is not fairly distributed: the maximum error happens at the low end of the input range and is much smaller over the rest of the input range. You can use tricks to make the error distribution more fair, namely by using variable-width intervals, but there's no general process for doing this while still using an efficient computation at runtime.
</p>
<h2>Chebyshev Polynomials</h2>
<p>The key to using polynomials to evaluate functions, is not to think of polynomials of being composed of linear combinations of \( 1, x, x^2, x^3 \), etc., but as linear combinations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> \( T_n(x) \). As discussed in more detail in the Wikipedia page, these have the following special properties:
</p>

</p>
<p>Let's say we have a given function \(f(x)\) over the range \( x \in [a,b] \). We can express \( f(x) = \sum c_k T_k(u) \) where \( u = \frac{2x-a-b}{b-a} \) and \( x = \frac{b-a}{2}u + \frac{a+b}{2} \), which is a transformation which maps the interval \( x \in [a,b] \) to \( u \in [-1,1] \). The problem then becomes a matter of figuring out the coefficients \( c_k \), which can be done using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_nodes">Chebyshev nodes</a>:
</p>

</p>
<p>These are easier to understand graphically; they are merely the projections onto the x-axis of the midpoints of equal interval circular arcs of a semicircle:

</p>
<p>You will note that the nodes are spaced equally near 0 and more compressed towards ± 1.
</p>
<p>To approximate a function by a linear combination of the first N Chebyshev polynomials (k=0 to N-1), the coefficient \( c_k \) is simply equal to \( A(k) \) times the average of the products \( T_k(u)f(x) \) evaluated at the N Chebyshev nodes, where \( A = 1 \) for \( k = 0 \) and \( A = 2 \) for all other k.
</p>
<p>Let's illustrate the process more clearly with an example.
</p>
<p>Suppose \( f(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 10 \) over the range \( [-1, 3] \), with \( u = \frac{x-1}{2}, x = 2u+1 \):
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8317/8039798545_804ba9a536_o.png" alt="" width="604" height="463" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Let's use \( N=5 \). The Chebyshev nodes for N=5 are \( u=-0.951057, -0.587785, 0, +0.587785, +0.951057 \). This corresponds to \( x=-0.902113, -0.175571, 1, 2.175771, 2.902113 \), and the function \( f(x) \) evaluated at those nodes are \( y=-9.51921, -10.11572, -6.66667, 5.07419, 17.89408 \).
</p>
<p>For \( c_0 \) we compute the average value of y = \( (-9.51921-10.11572-6.66667+5.07419+17.89408)/5 = -0.66667 \).
</p>
<p>For \( c_1 \) we compute 2 × the average value of u × y = \( 2\times(-9.51921\times-0.951057+-10.11572\times-0.587785\) \(+-6.66667\times 0+5.07419\times 0.587785+17.89408\times 0.951057) = 14 \)
</p>
<p>For \( c_2 \) we compute 2 × the average value of \( T_2(u)\times y  = (2u^2-1) \times y \: \longrightarrow \: c_2 = 6 \)
</p>
<p>For \( c_3 \) we compute 2 × the average value of \( T_3(u)\times y = (4u^3-3u) \times y \: \longrightarrow \: c_3 = 0.66667\)
</p>
<p>For \( c_4 \) we compute 2 × the average value of \( T_4(u)\times y = (8u^4-8u^2+1) \times y \: \longrightarrow \: c_4 = 0 \)
</p>
<p>The conclusion here is that \( f(x) = -\frac{2}{3}T_0(u) + 14T_1(u) + 6T_2(u) + \frac{2}{3}T_3(u) \) ; if you go and crunch through the algebra you will see that the result is the same as \( f(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 10 \).
</p>
<p>So what was the point here....? Well, if you <em>already</em> have the coefficients of a polynomial, there's no point in using Chebyshev polynomials. (If the input range is significantly different from \( [1,1] \), a linear transformation from x to u where \( u \in [-1,1] \) will give you a polynomial in u that has better numerical stability, and Chebyshev polynomials are one way to do this transformation. More on this later) If you want to approximate the polynomial with a polynomial of lesser degree, Chebyshev polynomials will give you the best approximation.
</p>
<p>For example let's use a quadratic function to approximate \( f(x) \) over the input range in question. All we need to do is truncate the Chebyshev coefficients: let's compute $$\begin{eqnarray} f_2(x) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{2}{3}T_0(u) + 14T_1(u) + 6T_2(u) \cr
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{2}{3} + 14u + 6\times(2u^2-1) \cr
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{20}{3} + 14u +12u^2 \cr
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{20}{3} + 7(x-1) + 3(x-1)^2 \cr
&amp;=&amp; 3x^2 + x - \frac{32}{3}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$
</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/8039804078_f816df25e6_o.png" alt="" width="592" height="464" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Voila! We have a quadratic function that is close to the original cubic function, and the magnitude of the error is just the coefficient of the Chebyshev polynomial we removed = \( \frac{2}{3} \).
</p>
<p>You will note that these two polynomials (\( \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 10 \) and \( 3x^2 + x - \frac{32}{3} \)), expressed in their normal power series form, have no obvious relation to each other, whereas the Chebyshev coefficients are the same except in coefficient \( c_3 \) which we set to zero to get a quadratic function.
</p>
<p>In my view, this is the primary utility of expressing a function in terms of its Chebyshev coefficients: The coefficient \( c_0 \) tells you the function's average value over the input range; \( c_1 \) tells you the function's "linearness", \( c_2 \) tells you the function's "quadraticness", \( c_3 \) tells you the function's "cubicness", etc.
</p>
<p>Here's a more typical and less trivial example. Suppose we wish to approximate \( \log_2 x \) over the range \( [1,2] \).
</p>
<p>A decomposition into Chebyshev coefficients up to degree 6 yields the following:
</p><p>
$$\begin{eqnarray}
c_0 &amp;=&amp; +0.54311 \cr
c_1 &amp;=&amp; +0.49505\cr
c_2 &amp;=&amp; -0.042469\cr
c_3 &amp;=&amp; +0.0048577\cr
c_4 &amp;=&amp; -6.2508\times 10^{-4}\cr
c_5 &amp;=&amp; +8.5757\times 10^{-5}\cr
c_6 &amp;=&amp; -1.1996\times 10^{-5}\cr
\end{eqnarray}
$$
</p><div><p>You will note that each coefficient is only a fraction of the magnitude of the previous coefficient. This is an indicator that the function in question (over the specified input range) lends itself well to polynomial approximation. If the Chebyshev coefficients don't decrease significantly by the 5th coefficient, I would classify that function as "nonpolynomial" over the range of interest.</p></div>

</p>
<p>The maximum error for the 6th-degree Chebyshev approximation for \( \log_2 x \) over \( x \in [1,2] \) is only about 2.2×10<sup>-6</sup>, which is approximately the value of the next Chebyshev coefficient.
</p>
<p>If we truncate the series to a 4th-degree Chebyshev approximation, we get a maximum error that is about equal to \( c_5 = 8.6×10^{-5} \):

<h2>Other comments</h2>
<p>A great reference for Chebyshev functions is <a href="http://www.nr.com/">Numerical Recipes</a> by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery, which covers Chebyshev approximation in detail.
</p>
<p>There are a few things to note when evaluating Chebyshev functions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It's better to compute the functions directly rather than trying to convert Chebyshev approximations to a standard polynomial form. (that is, if you want to calculate \( 3T_0(x) + 5T_1(x) - 0.1T_2(x) \) , don't convert to a polynomial, but instead calculate the T values directly.) Numerical Recipes recommends Clenshaw's recurrence formula, but I just use the following simple algorithm:</li>
</ul>
<pre>u = (2*x-a-b)/(b-a)
Tprev = 1
T = u
y = c[0]
for i = 1:n
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y=y+T*c[i]
   Tnext = 2*u*T - Tprev
   Tprev = T
   T = Tnext
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Remember to convert from x to u — this keeps the numerical stability of the algorithm, because polynomials tend to be well-conditioned for evaluating arguments between -1 and 1, and ill-conditioned for arguments with very large or very small magnitudes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a Python class for computing and applying Chebyshev coefficients:

<h2>Function approximation for empirical data</h2>
<p>Let's go back to the beginning of our discussion to Bill's problem. He has a nonlinear sensor relating a physical quantity (gas concentration) to a voltage measurement; the problem he faces is how to invert that relation so that he can estimate the original physical quantity: \( y = f(x) \) where x is the measurement and y is the physical quantity.
</p>
<p>Chebyshev approximation works well here too, but we have a problem. We can't just evaluate \( f(x) \) at Chebyshev nodes to get the Chebyshev coefficients, because we don't know for certain what \( f(x) \) actually is. Instead, we have to make some reference measurements to determine those coefficients, with known physical quantities (e.g. known gas concentrations in Bill's case), and tabulate these x and y values, then use them to estimate the coefficients. We have two choices in selecting the measurements:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Try to plan the measurements so that the values x lie near the Chebyshev nodes over the expected range. This will allow us to use fewer measurements.</li>
	<li>Make a lot of measurements so the whole input range is well-covered</li>
</ul>
<p>In some situations, it's quick and easy to make measurements with arbitrary references. (For example, if you're trying to calibrate a microphone, you can change the amplitude and frequency of reference sound signals automatically with electronic equipment), and the second option is a viable one. In other situations, like the gas concentration problem, it may be inconvenient or expensive to make lots of measurements, and you have to select the reference values carefully.
</p>
<p>The best way I've found to estimate Chebyshev coefficients from empirical data, is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_%28mathematics%29#Weighted_linear_least_squares">weighted least-squares</a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collect the measurements x and physical input quantity y into vectors X and Y</li>
	<li>For the vector of measurements x, compute u from x, and compute the values of the Chebyshev polynomials \( T_0(u), T_1(u), T_2(u), \ldots T_n(u) \) and save each these as vectors in a matrix T. Each polynomial will be used as a basis function.</li>
	<li>Compute a weighting value \( w(x) \) to compensate for the density of values x. (e.g. if lots of x values are near \( x=0 \) but very few of them are near \( x=1 \), you may have to choose \( w(x) \) low near \( x=0 \) and higher near \( x=1 \) .) Express these values as a diagonal matrix W.</li>
	<li>Compute a vector C of coefficients \( c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n \) using weighted least-squares to solve for C: <br>
	$$(T^TWT)C = T^TWY.$$
To do this you will need some kind of matrix library. In MATLAB this would be computed as
	<code>C = (T'*diag(W)*T)\(T'*diag(W)*Y)</code>. In Python with Numpy, you can skip calculating the T matrix, and just use the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebfit.html"><code>numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebfit</code></a> function on the x and y measurements; the weighting vector is an optional input.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would not use a degree greater than 5. If you find you're still not getting a good approximation with a 5th degree polynomial, you're probably using the wrong approach; the function is too sharp or wiggly or cusped. Higher degree polynomials can have problems with numerical accuracy.
</p>
<p>In any case, function approximation of empirical data is a little trickier than approximation of known functions. <strong>Always</strong> make sure you double-check your approximation by graphing the original data and the function you come up with.
</p>
<h2>Wrapup</h2>
<p>The next time you need to turn to function approximation, give Chebyshev approximation a shot! Not only is it probably the best and easiest way to approximate a function with a polynomial, but it will also let you know how well polynomials approximate the function in question, by the behavior of the Chebyshev coefficients.
</p>
<p>Make sure you choose the required accuracy and input range of your function wisely. Too high of an accuracy and too wide an input range will require higher degrees of polynomials and longer execution times, and high degree polynomials are often numerically ill-conditioned.
</p>
<p>More efficient evaluation of functions will mean you can use less CPU resources for a desired accuracy. So this <em>can</em> save you money and influence your coworkers.
</p>
<p>Happy approximating!
