Transmitting radio signals can become legally problematic <em>very quickly</em>, and the band I specifically transmit on here (<code>868Mhz</code>) is <strong>illegal</strong> in the United States without a license. I'd rather you didn't have men in suits knocking on your door on my account. You've been warned!</p></div><p>A little while ago I moved into an apartment to live on my own for the first time. This has given me a decent amount of newfound freedom to sculpt my living environment to my liking, but not enough where I could start knocking down walls. I have a landlord (and a deposit!) to think about, after all. 🙂</p><p>While it isn't near the level of knocking down walls, I was finding heating my apartment rather frustrating. The boiler's thermostat installed by my landlord is a single radio-controlled unit that uses a built-in temperature sensor to modulate the heating on and off to meet a target temperature. This presents a few first-world problems:</p><ul><li>The temperature sensor can only sample a single room in the apartment, which heats unevenly.</li><li>That room is dependent on the physical proximity of the thermostat's controls, which can be annoying to use if I might be in bed and the controls are in the living room or vice versa.</li><li>If I forget to turn the heating off before I leave the apartment, I'm wasting a lot of costly energy.</li></ul><p>I automate things around my apartment with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, and I wanted to be able to do the same here. There are a lot of off-the-shelf solutions for this, obviously, but to get back to the knocking-down-walls comparison, they would require my landlord's cooperation and likely a visit from an electrician. I don't want that!</p><p>Instead, here's how I figured out how to control my apartment's heating in a way that leaves no trace using the existing thermostat already fitted by my landlord, and maybe learn a bit about radios along the way.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where Do We Start?</h2><p>I knew that the thermostat communicated with the boiler through some kind of radio protocol. We could try to reverse-engineer the protocol from scratch, but as I'll get into later, that turns out to be <em>very involved</em> and way beyond my minimal radio skills.</p><p>I eventually decided it was a lot easier to attempt something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack#Remote_keyless-entry_system_for_vehicles">Replay Attack</a>. This involves cloning the signals sent between the boiler and the thermostat, and then pretending <em>we</em> are the thermostat by re-broadcasting the signals. This way we don't need to understand the protocol, just replay it.</p><div><p>This approach requires some degree of luck and crossing your fingers. Replay attacks can be pretty easily thwarted by using an incrementing counter in the communications to nullify previous signals, ignoring signals with a counter value you've already seen. I was lucky the thermostat does not do this—your mileage may vary!</p></div><h2 id="initial-reconnaissance">Initial Reconnaissance</h2><p>The first thing I did was check to see if there was any information online about my specific thermostat. I came across <a href="https://www.wolseley.co.uk/product/center-rf-wireless-programmable-boiler-thermostat">a listing for the exact model I had</a>, along with a datasheet in the attachments section. The section on <em>RF Communication</em> is exactly what I was looking for:</p><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/boiler_datasheet_rf.png"></picture></figure><p>From this, we know the thermostat communicates around the <code>868Mhz</code> range. The <code>Protocol: Encrypted</code> part was initially a bit concerning, but it turned out to not be a problem.</p><p>The first issue I'm running into here is that there are shockingly few resources on cloning a <code>868Mhz</code> signal online. Most beefy resources were about using LoRa/Meshtastic. I would come across a lot of Reddit posts of people trying to do the same thing as me for things like ceiling fans and garage doors, but nobody seemed to have any answers... 😭</p><div><p>I <em>suspect</em> this is because unlicensed <code>868Mhz</code> transmission is illegal in the US and nobody cares about Europe, but who really knows. My life would be <em>so much</em> easier if it were <code>433Mhz</code> instead, as there is a plethora of consumer-facing tools for communicating on that band.</p></div><h2 id="seeing-signals">Seeing Signals</h2><p>So without much to go on, I thought the first thing to do would be to actually <em>see</em> the radio packets and inspect them. I'd read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio">Software-Defined Radios</a> in the past and guessed it'd be my best bet. Most SDRs are <em>really</em> expensive, so I went with the budget <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005952566458.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.165.295b1802ErX1lM">RTL-SDR V4</a> off of AliExpress. (This actually ended up being somewhat unnecessary for reasons we'll eventually get to!)</p><div><p>You might have heard of the infamous <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> and its ability to clone and replay signals. Maybe you're like me and consider using it in this situation, but be warned that the Flipper is <strong>NOT</strong> an SDR. The Flipper is very stingy about what frequencies it can operate on. I found this out the hard way when I borrowed one and assumed all was hopeless when it wouldn't work.</p></div><p>After it arrived, I hooked it up to my laptop with the <a href="https://www.sdrpp.org/">SDR++</a> software just to see if it worked and get an initial glimpse of my thermostat yapping. After pressing the thermostat's buttons a few times, I managed to see the waterfall light up!</p><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/sdr_plus_plus.png"></picture><figcaption>The "waterfall" at 868Mhz showing long horizontal blips.</figcaption></figure><div><p>Ignore the solid vertical line on the waterfall—this is just a common byproduct of using a really cheap SDR, and for me it appears nearby to any frequency I'm inspecting.</p></div><p>This step isn't super important, but we can then try to use the <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> tool (it works on other frequencies despite the name) to see if the thermostat is speaking a known protocol. More obscure devices might not work here!</p><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/rtl_443_results.png"></picture></figure><p>It seems like this thermostat speaks the same protocol as another Honeywell one. The demand attribute sets whether the boiler is on (1) or off (0), and then the boiler responds with an acknowledgement (presumably so the thermostat can determine if it's out of range).</p><h2 id="trying-to-yell-back">Trying To Yell Back</h2><p>Now that we've actually seen the back-and-forth communication, we want to be able to send some packets ourselves and puppeteer the boiler as if we were the thermostat.</p><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/challenger.png"></picture><figcaption>Using a 868Mhz Challenger Dev Board, first failed attempt...</figcaption></figure><p>This was the step I got stuck on for <em>months</em>. I was trying the "smart" route of attempting to reverse-engineer and reconstruct the packets <em>by hand</em> using <a href="https://github.com/jopohl/urh">URH</a> and then broadcasting them with very cheap <code>868Mhz</code> microcontroller boards. I can safely say this was all wayyy outside of my skill set. None of the boards were really designed to talk to anything other than <em>the exact same board</em>, and going any further than that required poking at radio registers in ways I wasn't comfortable doing.</p><h2 id="the-hackrf">The HackRF</h2><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/hackrf-board.png"></picture><figcaption>The official HackRF One board, going on to spawn many AliExpress clones.</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to then go for the <strong>sledgehammer</strong> approach: use a full-blown SDR to just replay the exact same signal without a care for what the signal actually contains. But the cheap RTL-SDR I got earlier only supports receiving, not broadcasting. SDRs that can broadcast are usually <em>hundreds of dollars</em>.</p><p>I say <em>usuallyyy</em> because one of the most common broadcast-capable SDRs, the <code>HackRF One</code> (usually upwards of $400), had numerous clones available on AliExpress for a fraction of the price—just $40.</p><div><p>And then I say <em>haddd</em> because, writing this months later, AliExpress has removed pretty much every listing you could find just searching "HackRF". From my understanding, they were getting nabbed at customs in a lot of countries that were getting pissy about importing a scawy hacking tool, so they just decided to nuke all the listings rather than deal with it. Newer clones can be bought from <a href="https://opensourcesdrlab.com/products/r10c-hrf-sdr-software-defined-1mhz-to-6ghz-mainboard-development-board-kit?VariantsId=10158">here</a>, but they aren't nearly as cheap as they used to be... 😭</p></div><p>There are some obvious ethical (and probably a few technical) problems with cheap clones of what is meant to be open-source hardware, but I figured it'd be fine for my small use case. Please <a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one">support the original hardware project</a> if it's within your means to!</p><div><p>As I kinda alluded to earlier, this makes the need for the RTL-SDR sort of redundant? But I guess it's always good to have another SDR just to confirm that we're not polluting other frequencies.</p></div><h2 id="actually-yelling-back">Actually Yelling Back</h2><p>With the HackRF in hand, we can use the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/hackrf/hackrf_transfer.1.en.html">hackrf_transfer tool</a> to record signals and, most importantly, <em>replay</em> signals. I perform these commands and then press the appropriate controls on the thermostat to write the signals to individual files:</p><pre data-lang="shell"><code data-lang="shell"><span># We set the frequency to 868.3Mhz and the sample rate to 2000000.
</span><span>hackrf_transfer -r turn_off.raw -f 868300000 -s 2000000
</span><span>hackrf_transfer -r turn_on.raw -f 868300000 -s 2000000
</span></code></pre><p>And then we can try and turn the boiler off and on from CLI like this:</p><pre data-lang="shell"><code data-lang="shell"><span># We use -a to turn on the amplifier and -x to increase the gain a tad.
</span><span>hackrf_transfer -t turn_off.raw -f 868300000 -s 2000000 -a 1 -x 23
</span><span>hackrf_transfer -t turn_on.raw -f 868300000 -s 2000000 -a 1 -x 23
</span></code></pre><p>After doing this, I could hear the physical relay inside of my boiler turning on and off!</p><h2 id="automating-the-whole-thing">Automating The Whole Thing</h2><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/hackrf_horizontal.png"></picture><figcaption>My HackRF clone in a 3D printed case, plugged into the server.</figcaption></figure><p>I have the HackRF plugged into a powered USB hub connected to my Home Assistant server. I wrote a very basic web server that simply shells out to the transmit commands above in a Docker container.</p><p>Then with an <a href="https://github.com/Limych/ha-average">Average Sensor Plugin</a> and the config YAML below:</p><pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>command_line</span><span>:
</span><span>  - </span><span>switch</span><span>:

</span><span>  </span><span>target_sensor</span><span>: </span><span>sensor.average_temperature
</span></code></pre><p>We have a working controllable thermostat! 🤯</p><p>At this point I was just happy to have the thing <em>working</em> after so many months, so I'll be the first to admit this setup with Home Assistant is a bit slapdash and could use some cleanup. It'd be better to write a proper plugin and control the radio directly instead of shelling out to the CLI. Relying on <code>curl</code> to heat my apartment is maybe a bit cursed?</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was It Worth It?</h2><figure><picture><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/images/boiler_grafana.png"></picture><figcaption>Grafana graph showing the temperatures following the target one.</figcaption></figure><p>I've been using this setup to control the heating of my apartment since the beginning of December and haven't had any issues since! It's super convenient to dial in the temperature from my phone, and the automations I have make me feel like this project was really worth the work.</p><p>I have some basic automations like having the temperature go down when I'm sleeping and then up in the morning in time for me waking up, but I also have it so the heating turns off when I go into town and turns back on when I'm just a few train stops away so my place is nice and toasty for me getting home!</p><p>The only thing I'm not happy with is needing to use a very powerful and versatile radio like the HackRF for something as simple as a boiler on/off switch. But I'd rather use something overkill and have it work than spend ages trying to force smaller radios to do my bidding.</p><p>The important thing is I'm not as cold as I used to be! 🐺</p><hr><div><h3>There was a comment section here. It's gone now.</h3><p>As of March 16th, 2025 the United Kingdom's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023">Online Safety Act</a> has gone into full effect. The law presents a lot of challenges for hobbyist websites like this one to present any user-to-user content (like y'know, <i>blog comments</i>) and comes with some pretty serious repercussions for non-compliance.</p><p>The odds of Ofcom (the regulator who's job is to enforce this) kicking my door down over this blog are low if we are being honest with ourselves. But the odds are at least somewhere above zero and the punishment is a life ruining <strong>£18 million fine(!!)</strong> so it's just not worth the risk. taking the risk.</p><p>A kind lawyer has written up the <a href="https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/ra_blog_with_comments/">implications of this law for self-run blogs like this one</a> and the only way to guarantee that I am not in-scope would be to manually review all comments made before being available to the public. Not to be a big baby about it all but I don't really want to do this! I liked my current setup!</p><p>So I guess as a little act of protest and to hedge against any risk I've removed the comment section entirely. Sorry about that!</p><p>If you want more information on this and how much this sucks for the hobbyist internet <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ukosa1/uk_users_lobsters_needs_your_help_with#c_xevn8a">please read this writeup</a>.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Evertop is a portable PC that emulates an IBM XT with an 80186 processor and 1MB RAM. It can run DOS, Minix, and some other old 1980s operating systems.  It also runs Windows up to version 3.0.  Because it's based on a powerful yet very low power microcontroller, uses an e-ink display, packs two 10,000mAh batteries, and implements extreme power saving measures, it can run for hundreds or even thousands of hours on a single charge.  Combine that with its built in solar panel, and you should be able to use it indefinitely off grid without ever having to worry about battery life.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loaded with built-in peripherals</h3><a id="user-content-loaded-with-built-in-peripherals" aria-label="Permalink: Loaded with built-in peripherals" href="#loaded-with-built-in-peripherals"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It features a built in keyboard, external PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, full CGA, Hercules, and MCGA graphics support, partial EGA and VGA support, PC speaker, Adlib, Covox, and Disney Sound Source audio output, built in speaker and headphone jack with volume control wheel, one DB9 RS232 serial port, one TTL serial port, dual keyboard and mouse PS/2 ports, USB flash drive port for convenient file transfer, an RJ45 ethernet port, wifi, and LoRA radio (I wrote a LoRA realtime chat client in QBASIC in about 15 minutes).  Bluetooth hardware is present but I have not yet implemented it in any features, though I plan to add support for BT keyboard and mouse, and maybe serial over BT, IP over BT, audio over BT, and BT file transfer.  The keyboard can be easily detached on a short tether to make it convenient to prop up the device at an angle while placing the keyboard on a flat surface.  Or you can just plug in your own to the PS/2 port, as sometimes it's nice to be able to use a full sized keyboard, though the one I built into this device is big enough for normal typing.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Charging options for every scenario</h3><a id="user-content-charging-options-for-every-scenario" aria-label="Permalink: Charging options for every scenario" href="#charging-options-for-every-scenario"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are three ways you can power and charge this compputer: 1.) built in detachable solar panel, 2.) 2.5 - 20V DC input via an internal buck/boost circuit, or 3.) micro USB connector.  It can charge from all three sources simultaneously, and of course charge in every way while in use.  I also added a built in voltmeter to facilitate easy battery level and charge voltage monitoring.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hundreds to thousands of hours on a single charge</h3><a id="user-content-hundreds-to-thousands-of-hours-on-a-single-charge" aria-label="Permalink: Hundreds to thousands of hours on a single charge" href="#hundreds-to-thousands-of-hours-on-a-single-charge"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In power saving mode it can run between 200 hours on the low side and 500 hours or in some cases even much longer of constant interactive use, <b><i>not</i></b> standby.  That should afford ample opportunity to find some sunny weather and recharge the batteries long before they start getting low.  I'm also going to port over a simple native (non-emulated) text editor / word processor and e-reader that I made several years ago for a similar pocket device.  I'm hoping I can get over 1000 hours of constant use on a single charge with those, maybe even 5000-10000 hours on the e-reader app.  Evertop also features optional user initiated or automatic hibernate to disk and automatic total power shutoff via an IO controlled dual MOSFET circuit, so you can set it to hibernate and it will completely shut off power when idle, then when you power back on you can resume right where yo left off.  Internal peripherals can be shut off when not in use via physical switches on the front panel to ensure no power is being wasted.  The solar panel is rated at 6V and 6W, so theoretically it should be able to produce 1 amp with full sunlight.  The most I've ever seen it do is 700mA, but even that's enough to provide ten to fifty hours of constant use from each hour of sunlight.  And even on the dimmest cloudy days it still gets around 70-100mA, which at least gives can give one to five hours of use per hour of charge.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Storage</h3><a id="user-content-storage" aria-label="Permalink: Storage" href="#storage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I've been using a 256G SD card to store floppy and hard disk images, larger cards might work but I haven't tested one yet.  Hard drive images can be up to 4G each.  Emulated systems can mount two floppies and two hard drives for a total of 8G per emulated system.  You can set up multiple emulated systems and choose which one to boot at startup, or just default to the previous choice.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technology</h3><a id="user-content-technology" aria-label="Permalink: Technology" href="#technology"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the hood it's powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller.  The display is a 5.83 inch 648x480 (yes, 648 with the 8) "fast refresh" model from good-display.com which uses no power when not refreshing.  I started out using Fabrizio Di Vittorio's amazing and excellent PCEmulator demo for his FabGL library and have been adding, cutting, changing, fixing, and generally tampering for two years to turn this into what it is today.  Enclosure is 3d printed matte PETG plastic.
<br></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h3><a id="user-content-compatibility" aria-label="Permalink: Compatibility" href="#compatibility"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Runs almost all IBM PC/XT compatible DOS software from the 1980s and early 90s.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">New minimal version: "Evertop Min"</h2><a id="user-content-new-minimal-version-evertop-min" aria-label="Permalink: New minimal version: &quot;Evertop Min&quot;" href="#new-minimal-version-evertop-min"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this version, I removed the built-in keyboard, variable voltage charging, solar panel, RJ45 ethernet, DB9 serial port, LoRA radio, volt meter and half the battery capacity to reduce weight, material, and costs of parts and assembly.  It still has the same e-ink display, dual keyboard/mouse PS/2 ports, built in speaker, headphone jack, volume control wheel, USB flash drive port, wifi networking, bluetooth, TTL serial port, sd card slot, and micro USB charging port.  And it runs the same firmware as its larger sibling.  Add your own PS/2 keyboard and an external solar panel and you're still good to go for basic long lasting off grid computing without the weight, bulk, and expense of all those wonderful bells and whistles.</p>

One of the most pressing issues is </span><a href="https://www.mescomputing.com/news/4188979/nvidia-outlines-ai-strategies-gpus-kubernetes" rel="">fault tolerance</a><span> – key for ensuring reliability and high utilization when dealing with many points of failure in a training run. For subscale customers this isn’t a problem, but with really large cluster sizes NVIDIAs </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-report-details-hundreds-of-gpu-and-hbm3-related-interruptions-to-llama-3-training-run/" rel="">network design and hardware choices provide no built in protection</a><span>. Despite this, NVIDIA still doesn't have a compelling proprietary library to handle fault tolerant training; subscale clients rely on </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/rapidly-deploy-pytorch-applications-on-batch-using-torchx/" rel="">open source frameworks</a><span>. The major hyperscalers now rely on more robust internal solutions. For instance, Google uses proprietary software called </span><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/" rel="">Pathways</a><span>; it does a fantastic job of covering more edge cases and types of faults than other solutions (While being able to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533" rel="">operate flexibly</a><span> with synchronous and asynchronous data flows). Pathways is also </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533" rel="">very good at detecting and fixing</a><span> nearly invisible GPU memory issues that slip past ECC; NVIDIAs diagnostic tool (DCGM) </span><a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/multi-datacenter-training-openais" rel="">is considerably less reliable</a><span>. NVIDIA also struggles to provide competitive partitioning and cluster management software. Their </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/base-command/" rel="">BaseCommand</a><span> system (built on Kubernetes) is designed to be cross platform and work with heterogeneous systems. However, once again, hyperscalers have better proprietary, integrated solutions like </span><a href="https://research.google/pubs/large-scale-cluster-management-at-google-with-borg/" rel="">Borg</a><span> (Google, also the basis of Kubernetes) and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07848" rel="">Singularity</a><span> (Microsoft) which better handle scaled VM/container management, transparent migration, and GPU workload scheduling/management. Google even has a </span><a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/multi-datacenter-training-openais" rel="">custom sharder called MegaScaler</a><span> for synchronously partitioning workloads across TPU pods within and beyond a single campus.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Hyperscalers' core advantage is their vertical integration across the semiconductor, infrastructure, and model layers–which enables improved system level understanding, observability, co-optimization and failure analysis.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Even though I am a C++ programmer at heart, Go fascinates me for none of the reasons you think. Go has made several interesting design decisions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It has virtually no Undefined Behavior<sup id="fnref:goub" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:goub" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It has very simple GC semantics that they’re mostly stuck with due to design decisions in the surface language.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These things mean that despite Go having a GC, it’s possible to do manual memory management in pure Go and in cooperation with the GC (although without any help from the <code>runtime</code> package). To demonstrate this, we will be building an untyped, garbage-collected arena abstraction in Go which relies on several GC implementation details.</p> <p>I would never play this kind of game in Rust or C++, because LLVM is extremely intelligent and able to find all kinds of ways to break you over the course of frequent compiler upgrades. On the other hand, although Go does not promise any compatibility across versions for code that imports <code>unsafe</code>, in practice, two forces work against Go doing this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Go does not attempt to define what is and isn’t allowed: <code>unsafe</code> lacks any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics">operational semantics</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Go prioritizes not breaking the ecosystem; this allows to assume that <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a> will protect certain observable behaviors of the runtime, from which we may infer what can or cannot break easily.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This is in contrast to a high-performance native compiler like LLVM, which has a carefully defined boundary around all UB, allowing them to arbitrarily break programs that cross it (mostly) without fear of breaking the ecosystem.</p> <p>So, let’s dive in and cheat death.</p> <h2 id="what-are-we-building"><a href="#what-are-we-building">What Are We Building?</a></h2> <p>Our goal is to build an <em>arena</em>, which is a data structure for efficient allocation of memory that has the same lifetime. This reduces pressure on the general-purpose allocator by only requesting memory in large chunks and then freeing it all at once.</p> <p>For a comparison in Go, consider the following program:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

For example, on 64-bit systems, <code>int</code> and <code>*int</code> have the same layout: 8 bytes of size, and 8 bytes of alignment.</p> <p>However, the Go GC (and all garbage collectors, generally) require one additional piece of information, which is somewhere between the layout of a value (how it is placed in memory) and the type of a value (rich information on its structure). To understand this, we need a brief overview on what a GC does.</p> <h2 id="mark-and-sweep"><a href="#mark-and-sweep">Mark and Sweep</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>For a complete overview on how to build a simple GC, take a look at a toy GC I designed some time ago: <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz/2022/06/07/alkyne-gc/">The Alkyne GC</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>A garbage collector’s responsibility is to maintain a memory allocator and an accounting of:</p> <ol> <li>What memory has been allocated.</li> <li>Whether that memory is still in use.</li> </ol> <p>Memory that is not in use can be reclaimed and marked as unallocated, for re-use.</p> <p>The most popular way to accomplish this is via a “mark and sweep” architecture. The GC will periodically walk the entire object graph of the program from certain pre-determined <em>roots</em>; anything it finds is “marked” as alive. After a mark is complete, all other memory is “swept”, which means to mark it is unallocated for future re-use, or to return it to the OS, in the case of significant surplus.</p> <p>The roots are typically entities that are actively being manipulated by the program. In the case of Go, this is anything currently on the stack of some G<sup id="fnref:g" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:g" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or anything in a global (of which there is a compile-time-known set).</p> <p>The marking phase begins with <em>stack scanning</em>, which looks at the stack of each G and locates any pointers contained therein. The Go compiler generates metadata for each function that specifies which stack slots in a function’s frame contain pointers. All of these pointers are live by definition.</p> <p>These pointers are placed into a queue, and each pointer is traced to its allocation on the heap. If the GC does not know anything about a particular address, it is discarded as foreign memory that does not need to be marked. If it does, each pointer in that allocation is pushed onto the queue if it has not already been marked as alive. The process continues until the queue is empty.</p> <p>The critical step here is to take the address of some allocation, and convert it into all of the pointer values within. Go has precise garbage collection, which means that it only treats things declared as pointers in the surface language as pointers: an integer that happens to look like an address will not result in sweeping. This results in more efficient memory usage, but trades off some more complexity in the GC.</p> <p>For example, the types <code>*int</code>, <code>map[int]byte</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>struct {A int; B *int}</code> all contain at least one pointer, while <code>int</code>, <code>[1000]byte</code>, <code>struct {X bool; F uintptr}</code> do not. The latter are called <em>pointer-free</em> types.</p> <p>Go enhances the layout of a type into a <em>shape</em> by adding a bitset that specifies which pointer-aligned, pointer-sized words of the type’s memory region contain a pointer. These are called the <em>pointer bits</em>. For example, here are the shapes of a few Go types on a 64-bit system.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Size/Align</th> <th>Pointer Bits<sup id="fnref:ptr-bits-endian" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ptr-bits-endian" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>byte</code></td> <td>1/1</td> <td><code>0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>int</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>rune</code></td> <td>4/4</td> <td><code>0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>*int</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>1</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>unsafe.Pointer</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>1</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>string</code></td> <td>16/8</td> <td><code>10</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>[]int</code></td> <td>24/8</td> <td><code>100</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>[3]string</code></td> <td>48/8</td> <td><code>101010</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>map[int]byte</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>1</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>map[int]string</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>1</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>any</code></td> <td>16/8</td> <td><code>01</code><sup id="fnref:itab" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:itab" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>error</code></td> <td>16/8</td> <td><code>01</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>func(int) int</code></td> <td>8/8</td> <td><code>1</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>runtime.hchan</code><sup id="fnref:hchan" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hchan" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></td> <td>104/8</td> <td><code>0010110011110</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In the Go GC, each allocation is tagged with its shape (this is done in a variety of ways in the GC, either through an explicit header on the allocation, itself (a “malloc header”), a runtime type stored in the allocation’s <code>runtime.mspan</code>, or another mechanism). When scanning a value, it uses this information to determine where the pointers to scan through are.</p> <p>The most obvious problem with our <code>Allocator.Alloc</code> type is that it does not discriminate shapes, so it cannot allocate memory that contains pointers: the GC will not be able to find the pointers, and will free them prematurely!</p> <p>In our example where we allocated an <code>*int</code> in our custom allocator, we wind up with a <code>**int</code> on the stack. You would think that Go would simply trace through the first <code>*</code> to find an <code>*int</code> and mark it as being alive, but that is not what happens! Go instead finds a pointer into some chunk that the custom allocator grabbed from the heap, which is missing the pointer bits of its shape!</p> <p>Why does go not look at the type of the pointer it steps through? Two reasons.</p> <ol> <li> <p>All pointers in Go are untyped from the runtime’s perspective; every <code>*T</code> gets erased into an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>. This allows much of the Go runtime to be “generic” without using actual generics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pointee metadata can be aggregated, so that each pointer to an object does not have to remember its type at runtime.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The end result for us is that we can’t put pointers on the arena. This makes our <code>New</code> API unsafe, especially since Go does not provide a standard constraint for marking generic parameters as pointer-free: unsurprisingly, the don’t expect most users to care about such a detail.</p> <p>It <em>is</em> possible to deduce the pointer bits of a type using reflection, but that’s very slow, and the whole point of using arenas is to go fast. As we design our arena, though, it will become clear that there is a safe way to have pointers on it.</p> <h2 id="designing-the-arena"><a href="#designing-the-arena">Designing The Arena</a></h2> <p>Now that we have a pretty good understanding about what the Go GC is doing, we can go about designing a fast arena structure.</p> <p>The ideal case is that a call to <code>Alloc</code> is very fast: just offsetting a pointer in the common case. One assumption we can make off the bat is that all memory can be forced to have maximum alignment: most objects are a pointer or larger, and Go does have a maximum alignment for ordinary user types, so we can just ignore the <code>align</code> parameter and always align to say, 8 bytes. This means that the pointer to the next unallocated chunk will always be well-aligned. Thus, we might come up with a structure like this one:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Arena</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

The performance increase seems to scale up with the amount of memory allocated, for a 2x-4x improvement across different cases.</p> <p>Now we need to contend with the fact that our implementation is completely broken if we want to have pointers in it.</p> <h3 id="not-dropping-memory-on-the-ground"><a href="#not-dropping-memory-on-the-ground">Not Dropping Memory on the Ground</a></h3> <p>In <code>(*Arena).Alloc</code>, when we assign a freshly-allocated chunk, we overwrite <code>a.next</code>, which means the GC can reclaim it. But this is fine: as long as pointers into that arena chunk are alive, the GC will not free it, independent of the arena. So it seems like we don’t need to worry about it?</p> <p>However, the whole point of an arena is to allocate lots of memory that has the same lifetime. This is common for graph data structures, such as an AST or a compiler IR, which performs a lot of work that allocates a lot and then throws the result away.</p> <p>We are not allowed to put pointers in the arena, because they would disappear from the view of the GC and become freed too soon. But, if a pointer wants to go on an arena, it necessarily outlive the whole arena, since it outlives part of the arena, and the arena is meant to have the same lifetime.</p> <p>In particular, if we could make it so that holding any pointer returned by <code>Alloc</code> prevents the <em>entire arena</em> from being swept by the GC, the arena can safely contain pointers into itself! Consider this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We have a pointer <code>p **int</code>. It is allocated on some arena <code>a</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The GC sees our pointer (as a type-erased <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>) and marks its allocation as live.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow, the GC also marks <code>a</code> as alive as a consequence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow, the GC then marks every chunk <code>a</code> has allocated as alive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore he chunk that <code>*p</code> points to is also alive, so <code>*p</code> does not need to be marked directly, and will not be freed early.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The step (3) is crucial. By forcing the whole arena to be marked, any pointers stored in the arena into itself will be kept alive automatically, without the GC needing to know how to scan for them.</p> <p>So, even though <code>*New[*int](a) = new(int)</code> is still going to result in a use-after-free, <code>*New[*int](a) = New[int](a)</code> would not! This small improvement does not make arenas themselves safe, but a data structure with an internal arena can be completely safe, so long as the only pointers that go into the arena are from the arena itself.</p> <p>How can we make this work? The easy part is (4), which we can implement by adding a <code>[]unsafe.Pointer</code> to the arena, and sticking every pointer we allocate into it.</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Arena</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

But the chunks we’re allocating are <code>[]uintptr</code>s, which will not be scanned. If there could <em>somehow</em> be a single pointer in this slice that was scanned, we would be able to stick the pointer <code>a *Arena</code> there, and so when anything that <code>Alloc</code> returns is scanned, it would cause <code>a</code> to be marked as alive.</p> <p>So far, we have been allocating <code>[N]uintptr</code> using <code>make([]T)</code>, but we would actually like to allocate <code>struct { A [N]uintptr; P unsafe.Pointer }</code>, where <code>N</code> is some dynamic value.</p> <p>In its infintie wisdom, the Go standard library actually gives us a dedicated mechanism to do this: <code>reflect.StructOf</code>. This can be used to construct arbitrary anonymous <code>struct</code> types at runtime, which we can then allocate on the heap.</p> <p>So, instead of calling <code>make</code>, we might call this function:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span><span>Arena</span><span>)</span> <span>allocChunk</span><span>(</span><span>words</span> <span>uintptr</span><span>)</span> <span>unsafe</span><span>.</span><span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>

The GC can’t tell the difference between a one-past-the-end pointer for allocation A, and for the start of allocation B immediately after it. At best this causes memory to stay alive for longer, and at worst it triggers safety interlocks in the GC. The GC will panic if it happens to scan a pointer for an address that it knows has been freed.</p> <p>But in our code above, every chunk now has an extra element at the very end that is not used for allocation, so we <em>can</em> have a pointer that <em>is</em> one-past-the-end of the <code>[N]uintptr</code> that we are vending memory from.</p> <p>The updated allocation function would look like this:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span><span>Arena</span><span>)</span> <span>Alloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>align</span> <span>uintptr</span><span>)</span> <span>unsafe</span><span>.</span><span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>

Go generates code for one any time a non-pointer-free type is stored. For example, writing to a <code>**int</code>, <code>*string</code>, or <code>*[]int</code> requires a write barrier.</p> <p>Write barriers are implemented as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>runtime.writeBarrier</code> is checked, which determines whether the write barrier is necessary, which is only when the GC is in the mark phase. Otherwise the branch is taken to skip the write barrier.</p> </li> <li> <p>A call to one of the <code>runtime.gcWriteBarrierN</code> functions happens. <code>N</code> is the number of pointers that the GC needs to be informed of.</p> </li> <li> <p>This function calls <code>runtime.gcWriteBarrier</code>, which returns a buffer onto which pointers the GC needs to now trace through should be written to.</p> </li> <li> <p>The actual store happens.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A write barrier is required for a case like the following.

For example, arenas could be re-used; once an arena is done, it could be “reset” and placed into a <code>sync.Pool</code>. This arena would not need to go into the GC to request new chunks, re-using the ones previously allocated (and potentially saving on the cost of zeroing memory over and over again).</p> <p>I did say that this relies very heavily on Go’s internal implementation details. Whats the odds that they get broken in the future? Well, the requirement that allocations know their shape is forced by the existence of <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>, and the requirement that a pointer into any part of an allocation keeps the whole thing alive essentially comes from slices being both sliceable and mutable; once a slice escapes to the heap (and thus multiple goroutines) coordinating copies for shrinking a slice would require much more complexity than the current write barrier implementation.</p> <p>And in my opinion, it’s pretty safe to say that Hyrum’s Law has us covered here. ;)</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>A team of astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute, working with one colleague from the University of St Andrews' Center for Exoplanet Science and another from the European Southern Observatory, has confirmed the existence of a lone black hole. In their <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adbe6e" target="_blank">paper</a> published in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>, the group describes how they studied newer data regarding an object they had spotted several years ago to confirm its identity.</p>


										      
																					<p>In 2022, members of essentially the same team <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac739e/meta" target="_blank">reported the discovery</a> of what they described as a "dark object" moving through the constellation Sagittarius. They suggested it might be a lone black hole. Shortly thereafter, a second research team challenged that result, suggesting it was more likely a neutron star. After continuing to study the object, the original research team has found more evidence backing up their original claim that it is likely a lone black hole.</p>
<p>Prior to this new finding, all the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/black+holes/" rel="tag">black holes</a> that have been identified have also had a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/companion+star/" rel="tag">companion star</a>—they are discovered due to their impact on light emitted by their companion star. Without such a companion star, it would be very difficult to see a black hole. The one identified by the team was only noticed because it passed in front of a distant non-companion star, magnifying its light and shifting its position in the sky for a short while.</p>
<p>The research team made their initial observations using data from Hubble over the years 2011 to 2017. This time around, they looked at data from Hubble for the years 2021 and 2022, as well as from the Gaia space probe. They found that the object under review was approximately seven times as massive as the sun, showing that it could not be a neutron star, leaving only a black hole as the sole option.</p>
<p>Additionally, the second research team <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aced4a" target="_blank">revised their neutron star assessment</a> in 2023, agreeing that the object was indeed a black hole. They found that the object was around six solar masses, but the higher uncertainty in their measurement still keeps it consistent with the more recent results.</p>
<p>Now, the latest study by the original research team marks the first time the existence of a lone black hole has ever been confirmed. They hope to find more examples with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2027.</p>

    <p>If you are reading this message, the experiment below is still ongoing. This page was served to you by a real Nintendo Wii.</p>
<p>You can check the Wii’s <a href="https://blog.infected.systems/status">live status page</a> for system load info.</p>

<p>For a long time, I’ve enjoyed the idea of running general-purpose operating systems on decidedly not-general-purpose hardware.</p>
<p>There’s been a few good examples of this over the years, including a few which were officially sanctioned by the OEM. Back in the day, my PS3 ran <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yellow-dog-linux-on-ps3-actually-works/">Yellow Dog Linux</a>, and I’ve been searching for a (decently priced) copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2">PS2 Linux</a> for 10+ years at this point.</p>
<p>There are some other good unofficial examples, such as <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/02/dusting-off-dreamcast-linux.html">Dreamcast Linux</a>, or <a href="https://psplinux.info/files/">PSPLinux</a>.</p>
<p>But what a lot of these systems have in common is that they’re now very outdated. Or they’re hobbyist ports that someone got running once and where longer-term support never made it upstream. The PSP Linux kernel image was last built in 2008, and Dreamcast Linux is even more retro, using a 2.4.5 kernel built in 2001.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen many of these projects where I’d be comfortable running one as part of an actual production workload. Until now.</p>
<p>While browsing <a href="https://netbsd.org/">the NetBSD website</a> recently, I noticed the fact that there was a ‘Wii’ option listed right there on the front page in the ‘Install Media’ section, nestled right next to the other first-class targets like the Raspberry Pi, and generic x86 machines.</p>
<p>Unlike the other outdated and unmaintained examples above, clicking through to the NetBSD Wii port takes you to the latest stable NetBSD 10.1 release from Dec 2024. Even the <a href="https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/evbppc/binary/gzimg/">daily HEAD builds</a> are composed for the Wii.</p>
<p>As soon as I discovered this was fully supported and maintained, I knew I had to try deploying an actual production workload on it. That workload is the blog you’re reading now.</p>

<p>I picked this up expecting to use it for homebrew games and emulation mostly, but I don’t think it expected this fate.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-fast-enough">Is it fast enough?</h3>
<p>So we have a spare Wii. And an OS with mainline support. But is a Wii actually fast enough to handle this as a production workload?</p>
<p>The single-core ‘Broadway’ CPU in the Wii is part of IBM’s continued evolution of the PowerPC 750 lineup, dating all the way back to Apple’s iconic 1998 Bondi Blue fishtank iMac. Although Broadway is one of the later 750 revisions, the commercially-available equivalent chip - the PowerPC 750CL - has a maximum TDP of only 9.8 W, and clocks about 33% higher than the version in the Wii.</p>
<p>So with a single-core chip based on a late-90s architecture and a TDP well under 10 W, it’s clear that we’re probably fairly contstrained here in terms of compute performance.</p>
<p>With that said, one of the other PowerPC 750 deployments you might be familiar with is currently floating 1,500,000 km from Earth mapping the deepest reaches of the universe in more detail than humanity has ever seen before. So if I can’t get this thing serving a static website, then I think it’s probably time to execute on my long-term plan of retiring from tech and opening a cat cafe.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you can read about the James Wii Space Telescope’s use of the PowerPC 750 <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150019915/downloads/20150019915.pdf">in this NASA presentation</a>. The 750 actually gets a lot of use in spaceflight and satellite applications because there is a radiation-hardened version available, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750">RAD750</a>. Some other recent uses of the chip include both the Mars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)">Curiosity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance_(rover)">Perseverance</a> rovers.</p>
<h3 id="installing-netbsd-on-the-wii">Installing NetBSD on the Wii</h3>
<p>Okay, Nintendo lawyers avert your eyes.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I softmodded a Wii. I remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BlpONgj74A">Twilight Hack</a>, which involved exploiting a buffer overflow in the <em>Twilight Princess</em> save game handler to run unsigned code.</p>
<p>Things are much easier these days. The <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wilbrand">Wilbrand exploit</a> seems to be what people generally recommend now. Like some other exploits, it takes advantage of the fact that an SD card can be used to store and retrieve messages from the Wii Message Board. Exploting this allows unsigned code execution, which allows us to boot the <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/HackMii_Installer_Wii">HackMii</a> tool that installs the Homebrew Channel.</p>
<p>It’s an easy mod which just requires knowing the MAC address of the console and generating a few files to load from an SD card. There’s a handy browser-based tool <a href="https://wilbrand.donut.eu.org/">here</a> which does all of the hard work for you.</p>
<p>I did have some issues using a larger SDHC card to run the Wilbrand exploit, but had the best luck with a 1GB non-SDHC card. SD card compatibility <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SD/SDHC_card_compatibility_tests">seems to be a known issue</a> for Wii homebrew, but overall I’d still call the process fairly painless.</p>
<p>Once we’ve hacked the console, we should have the Homebrew Channel available in our Wii Menu:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/wiimenu.jpg" alt="The Homebrew Channel now available on the Wii Menu">
</figure>



<p>Now we can prepare our NetBSD SD card. We do this by downloading the <code>wii.img.gz</code> image from the <a href="https://netbsd.org/">front page of the NetBSD site</a>.</p>
<p>For this card, I opted to use a fairly speedy 32GB SDHC card. The Wii doesn’t support SDXC or newer cards, which means we’re limited to 32GB. Larger flash devices also <em>generally</em> tend to be faster and more resilient than smaller ones. And NetBSD seems a lot less bothered by living on a larger card than the Wilbrand exploit was. So overall I’d recommend getting a decent quality fast 32GB card if you want to try this.</p>
<p>We can unpack and write this image however we please, but I’m a fan of using the Raspberry Pi Imager because it’ll do the work of extracting the image and verifying it post-write for us:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/pi-imager.png" alt="Using the Raspberry Pi Imager to write and verify the image">
</figure>



<p>At this point, things are very easy. The NetBSD Wii image has all the necessary metadata &amp; structure needed to boot directly from the Homebrew Channel as if it were any other kind of homebrew app. I think there’s a lot of credit due here to <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jmcwhatever">NetBSD developer Jared McNeill</a>, who seems to be the main author of the Wii port.</p>
<p>Placing our SD card in the console and launching the Homebrew Channel is all we need to do to prepare ourselves to launch NetBSD:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/homebrew.jpg" alt="NetBSD, ready to launch">
</figure>



<p>Once booted into NetBSD, we can use a USB keyboard just fine, but it will be easiest to get SSH working so we can manage the system remotely. The SSH daemon is already running out-of-the-box, so the only changes we need to make are to set a password for the <code>root</code> user and then enable logging in as root by adding <code>PermitRootLogin yes</code> to the <code>sshd_config</code>.</p>
<p>You could set up an unprivileged user or do anything else you fancy here but I was keen to get SSH going ASAP, as due to <del>the absence of HDMI-enabled screens in my server-area</del> laziness I was doing this bit using a capture card and Photo Booth on macOS which doesn’t actually support disabling the image-flip on the video feed:</p>

<p>If you thought it was hard to exit Vim, try doing it back to front.</p>
<p>After installation, I set a static network config by editing <code>/etc/ifconfig.axe0</code> and restarted the host.</p>
<p>On that note, I’m using the official RVL-015 Wii LAN Adapter. I went to great lengths to track down one of these for a decent price for the best chance of compatibility. On reflection, this probably wasn’t needed as by the time we’re booted into NetBSD we should have all of NetBSD’s drivers available to us, so I expect most generic USB adapters would probably work (in theory!).</p>
<p>If anyone is wondering though, here are the specifics of the adapter and chipset, taken from <code>dmesg</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>[     2.089988] axe0 at uhub2 port 1

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="package-management">Package management</h3>
<p>After restarting, I installed NetBSD’s <code>pkgin</code> package manager by setting some env vars and then using <code>pkg_add pkgin</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>export</span> <span>PKG_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/evbppc/10.1/All/"</span>
</span></span><span><span>pkg_add pkgin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After this, I was able to use pkgin to install a bunch of useful packages - most importantly including our <code>lighttpd</code> web server, which I’ve picked due to it being slim and well-suited for resource constrained environments:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pkgin install bsdfetch iperf3 lighttpd nano rsync
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that, I copied the basic <code>lighttpd</code> sample config, and enabled and started it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cp -fv /usr/pkg/share/examples/rc.d/lighttpd /etc/rc.d
</span></span><span><span><span>echo</span> <span>'lighttpd=YES'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>/etc/rc.d/lighttpd start
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By default, <code>lighttpd</code> is set up to serve static content from <code>/srv/www/htdocs</code>. Since my blog is a collection of static pages built with Hugo, I was able to simply <code>rsync</code> these files over and within seconds I had the system serving my site over standard HTTP.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-fast-enough-addendum">Is it fast enough? (addendum)</h3>
<p>Alright, you got me. It turns out that while a PPC 750 might be enough to map the futhest reaches of the universe, a bit of soak testing suggests it does struggle a bit when trying to concurrently serve a lot of pages encrypted with modern TLS.</p>
<p>I tried freeing up resources by disabling a bunch of services I don’t need that are running out of the box on NetBSD:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^dhcpcd=.*/dhcpcd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'dhcpcd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^inetd=.*/inetd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'inetd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^mdnsd=.*/mdnsd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'mdnsd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^postfix=.*/postfix=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'postfix=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I also disabled <code>ntpd</code>, which was using a staggering 15% of the whole system’s RAM:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>USER PID  %CPU %MEM COMMAND
</span></span><span><span>root 9161  0.0 15.6 /usr/sbin/ntpd -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately it seems <code>ntpd</code> is definitely necessary to keep the system clock in-check. I’m not sure whether the Wii just drifts a lot, whether it’s specific to NetBSD on the Wii, or whether the clock battery in what may be a nearly 20 year old console has given up but I got some interesting and quite indignant sounding error messages after disabling this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/preposterous.jpg" alt="The world needs more indignant sounding error messages like this">
</figure>



<p>To compensate, I cheated by adding <code>ntpd -q -g</code> to the main <code>crontab</code>, so the system would run it hourly at <code>:42</code> min past the hour. We still get timesync, but we don’t need to sacrifice a sixth of our RAM keeping it resident:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>42    *       *       *       *       /usr/sbin/ntpd -q -g
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even after freeing up the resources above, it seems like serving multiple encrypted requests in parallel was a struggle for the 750, so I opted to move the TLS termination for the blog to a Caddy instance sitting in front of the Wii.</p>
<p>I have Caddy acting as a reverse proxy to the Wii, handling encryption and cert management with ACME. <strong>Importantly, there are no caching options enabled in Caddy. Every request the site serves is being serviced directly by the Wii</strong> - including the large number of images on this post which I’ll almost certainly regret adding. I optimised as much as I could, but this page is still almost exactly 1 MB when all of the content is loaded.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/caddy.jpg" alt="Shitpost diagram of Caddy reverse proxy">
</figure>



<p>Through this method, I’ve also been able to sinkhole LLM slop-scrapers at Caddy’s level, by dropping requests from <a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt">known scraper User Agents</a> before they’re forwarded to the Wii. Hopefully that might help to keep our single core chugging along without too much distress.</p>
<h3 id="status-monitoring">Status monitoring</h3>
<p>Moving the SSL termination to Caddy also gives me the advantage of enabling Caddy’s Prometheus exporter, so I can load it into my InfluxDB + Grafana stack and monitor site load without putting a bunch of additional stress on the Wii.</p>
<p>But I’m still interested (and I’m sure you are too) in monitoring the general state of the Wii resources as this post goes live.</p>
<p>Considering I had to disable the NTP client for using too much RAM, I think running something like a Prometheus exporter directly on the Wii is right out of the window to begin with. So I put together a simple shell script that runs from the <code>crontab</code> every 15 min, outputting some system stats to a basic HTML file in the webroot.</p>

<p>Honestly, this worked way better and was far easier than I was expecting. Naturally, there are some downsides to the setup here though.</p>
<p>Rebooting NetBSD reboots the whole console, and not just the NetBSD ‘app’, so you’ll find yourself back at the Wii Menu after any kernel patch or system upgrade. Yes, this does mean that the Wiimote and sensor bar in your server cupboard are now a vital component of the production infrastructure.</p>
<p>I was reasonably pleased with the power consumption too. Some testing based on stats from my UPS monitoring suggest that when idling, the Wii is adding a fairly consistent ~18 W to my overall homelab usage.</p>
<p>By my calculations, that means I can expect the Wii to use ~13.2 kWh/month, which on my fairly expensive UK power tariff comes out to around £3.47/month - which does actually make this cheaper than most of the VPSes I can find around the obvious cloud providers. So when you’re looking for your next VPS… you know what to consider.</p>
<p>This was a fun experiment for a rainy day over a long weekend. I’ll probably keep it going for a while if it actually continues to work as well as it started. I’m often interested in applying artificial constraints to the things I deploy, as I find that’s when I learn best.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe I’ll have been forced to become an expert in NetBSD TCP kernel tunables by this time next week…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit today against Uber, alleging the rideshare and delivery company charged consumers for its Uber One subscription service without their consent, failed to deliver promised savings, and made it difficult for users to cancel the service despite its “cancel anytime” promises.</p><p>“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson. “The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people. Today, we’re alleging that Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.”</p><p>In its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/uber-ftc-v-timeline-item-2025-04-21" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="507f8cc6-ae69-4735-a845-328330233ba4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">complaint</a>, the FTC alleges that Uber used deceptive billing and cancellation practices. For example, the complaint alleges:</p><ul><li>When signing up for Uber One, customers are wrongly promised savings of $25 a month. Even if that were true, Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings. The company also obscures material information about the subscription (for example, by using small, greyed out text which consumers can easily miss). Many consumers say they were enrolled without consent; the complaint quotes one consumer saying they were charged despite not even having an Uber account.</li><li>After sign-up, Uber charges consumers before their billing date. For example, some consumers who signed up for a free trial say they were automatically charged for the service before the free trial ended even though Uber promises customers the ability to cancel at no charge during the trial period.</li><li>When customers try to cancel, Uber makes it extremely difficult. Users can be forced to navigate as many as 23 screens and take as many as 32 actions to cancel. If a customer tries to proceed with cancellation, Uber can require them to say why they want to cancel, urge them to pause their membership or, if that failed, present them with offers to stay. Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support.</li></ul><p>The FTC alleges that the company’s deceptive billing and cancellation practices violate the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA), which requires online retailers to clearly disclose the terms of the service they are selling, obtain consumers’ consent before charging them for a service, and provide a simple way to cancel a recurring subscription.</p><p>The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint was 2-0-1 with Commissioner Mark R. Meador recused. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.</p><p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.</p><p>The lead attorneys on this matter are Stephanie Liebner, James Doty, and Paul Mezan in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon.
The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded.</p>
<p dir="auto">On enterprise GPUs, Dia can generate audio in real-time. On older GPUs, inference time will be slower.
For reference, on a A4000 GPU, Dia rougly generates 40 tokens/s (86 tokens equals 1 second of audio).
<code>torch.compile</code> will increase speeds for supported GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full version of Dia requires around 10GB of VRAM to run. We will be adding a quantized version in the future.</p>

</center>
<p>Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">set their domain as their username</a>. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check</strong>. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, <strong>through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly</strong>. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/jay-verification-illustration.png" alt="A verified Bluesky account with a blue check" width="700">
  <figcaption>A verified Bluesky account with a blue check.</figcaption>
</center>
<h2>Trusted Verifiers</h2>
<p>Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.</p>
<p>So, we’re also enabling <strong>trusted verifiers</strong>: organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/nyt-verification-illustration.png" alt="The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check" width="700">
  <figcaption>The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check.</figcaption>
</center>
<p>For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>When you tap on a verified account's blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/paul-verification.png" alt="Paul Frazee's account is verified by Bluesky" width="700">
  <figcaption>Tap on the blue check to see which organization verified the user.</figcaption>
</center>
<p>You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings &gt; Moderation &gt; Verification Settings to toggle it off.</p>
<h2>How to Get Verified on Bluesky</h2>
<p>You can self-verify by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">setting your domain as your username</a>. We highly encourage official organizations and individuals to do this.</p>
<p>During this initial phase, Bluesky is not accepting direct applications for verification. As this feature stabilizes, we’ll launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Decades later, a generation of adoptees wrestles with the aftermath.</p></div></div><p>In 1975, to hear the Americans tell it, the mass adoption of Vietnamese children was a story of rescue and redemption. These children were war babies, bụi đời, children of dust. A decade of death coupled with a thriving sex trade near US military bases had put nearly 20,000 children in more than a hundred orphanages throughout South Vietnam. By April, as the Viet Cong swept down the coast, mixed race children were said to be in danger. The Northern army would find foreign offspring and carve their livers from their bodies to eat, or so the rumors went. Out of fear and desperation, mothers relinquished their babies — many underweight, sick, or maimed by war — to the Americans. And the Americans took them away.</p><p>The popular narrative of Vietnamese adoption began like this:</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog1-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>In a Saigon school, orphans are cared for and rounded up before their departure for the United States in April 1975 during Operation Babylift.</p><p>Photo by Jean-Claude Francolon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog2-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>In a Saigon school, orphans are cared for and rounded up before their departure for the United States in April 1975 during Operation Babylift.`</p><p>Photo by Jean-Claude Francolon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</p></div></div></div><p>And ended like this:</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="860" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog5.jpeg"></p><div><p>Edna Deichl (left), wife of a Free Flight pilot, naps while Linda Reid (center), wife of the copilot, and Lillian Bradshaw (right), an orphanage worker, feed their charges on a flight from Seattle to Chicago, bringing Vietnamese children to their new homes.</p><p>Photo by Barry Sweet/Associated Press</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="645" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog3-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>1975, April 5 – Inside Aircraft - San Francisco International Airport – San Francisco, CA – Gerald R. Ford, Medical Staff, Nurses, Refugee Children, Others talking, holding children- Arrival of Operation Babylift Plane from South Vietnam</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library</p></div></div></div><p>Aid workers called it a “salvage operation.” Cherie Clark, a nurse, <a href="https://www.comeunity.com/apv/babylift-clark.htm">recalled</a>, “We were literally picking up babies and trying to keep them alive long enough to place them for adoption.” Clark ultimately sent around 1,200 children out of Vietnam through her adoption organization Friends of Children of Vietnam (FCVN).</p><p>President Gerald Ford announced Operation Babylift in early April, as it became clear that the US would withdraw its presence from Vietnam entirely. Ford described the babylift as a humanitarian “mission of mercy.” It was, just as importantly, a deflection from military defeat and abandonment. A month later, 2,894 Vietnamese and Cambodian children were on their way to American homes; approximately 1,300 others were adopted to Australia, Canada, and across Europe.</p><p>Some of the first children were flown away on a C-5A Galaxy transport aircraft, a plane whose interior could rival a gymnasium. Orphanage workers loaded the cargo hold with 200-plus children, an endeavor “like trying to carry loose eggs in the bed of a pickup truck,” as journalist Dana Sachs described in her book, <em>The Life We Were Given</em>. Twelve minutes after takeoff, a door in the rear of the plane blew out, ripping a hole in the side of the plane. The plane crashed into a rice paddy, crushing the cargo hold where the children were kept — 138 died, including 78 babies.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1290" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog6-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Cover of The New York Daily News on April 5, 1975.

The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Saigon’s Tan Son Nhut Airport during Operation Babylift’s initial flight. Seventy-eight children and around 50 adults died; around 170 survived. Subsequent flights evacuated more than 2,5000 children to the US and other countries for adoption.</p><p>Photo by Sal Veder / AP Photo</p></div></div></div><p>Operation Babylift continued without a breath. The next day, 324 children, including survivors from the previous day’s crash, were loaded onto a commercial Pan Am flight. This time, babies in white pajamas were packaged neatly in cardboard boxes. Boxes with babies were wedged under seats like carry-on luggage. Some babies were buckled into the red-and-yellow plane seats, slumped over like little dolls. In the ensuing weeks, the seven US and international adoption organizations in Vietnam competed to ensure space on planes for the children in their care.</p><p>A South Vietnamese lieutenant gave this bitter statement to the <em>New York Times</em>: “It is nice to see you Americans bringing home souvenirs of our country as you leave — china elephants and orphans. Too bad some of them broke … but we have plenty more.”</p><p>Americans had adopted children from abroad in previous decades, most notably from South Korea, but Operation Babylift created a story around adoption that transformed the displacement of a foreign baby to an American home into an act of charity. Out of the horrors of war came an opportunity for benevolence and absolution. “Everyone suffers in a war, but no one suffers more than the children, and the airlift was the least that we could do,” Ford wrote in his autobiography. This narrative has never been without its critics — Grace Paley, writing for <em>Ms. Magazine</em> at the time of the babylift, called it “a cynical political game” — but even those who acknowledged the alarming messiness of the campaign’s logistics thought of the adoptions themselves as a win-win. A Massachusetts senator put it this way: “Very simplistically, it is better to live in elitism in the United States than to be dead in Vietnam.”</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="790" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/GettyImages-2206801760-min.jpg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by Jean-Claude FRANCOLON/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="622" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog8-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Fifty-two Vietnamese children arrive in a World Airways plane at Oakland Airport in California.</p><p>Photo by Jerry Telfer/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="688" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog9-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Inside Ambulance at San Francisco International Airport, Medical Staff Arrival of Operation Babylift Plane from South Vietnam.

Nhu Miller, a Vietnamese woman who was living nearby, came to the Presidio to interpret for the older children and found that some didn’t know where they were. They wanted to see their parents, siblings, grandparents. “When can I go home?” they asked. In the chaos, many lacked identifying documents; their papers had been lost, mixed up, or fabricated. “I went to help and saw people were just picking them out like puppies,” Miller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/booming/from-lucky-encounter-in-vietnam-to-40-years-married.html">said later</a>.</p><p>How one viewed the babylift — as a mission to save children or to abduct them — depended in part on how one defined the purpose of adoption. Was it to provide <em>for</em> a child or to <em>provide a child</em> to eager Western parents? FCVN and other adoption agencies, as well as prospective parents, persisted with their adoptions in defiance of evidence that some children had other alternatives. They offered their belief in the restorative power of a loving family as reasoning. “Let’s forget the politics and think of the kids,” said one adoptive parent of an Operation Babylift child. This attitude prevails today. </p><p>The children’s birth mothers were rarely given consideration. Yet some refused to be forgotten. One mother, Anh Thi Hoang Doan, arrived as a refugee at Camp Pendleton in Southern California, four months after entrusting her seven children to FCVN in the belief that the agency would transport her children safely to the United States. She’d planned to join them. She explained these conditions to the agency, and — not intending to give her children up — she did not sign an adoption release. Once in California, Doan found several of her children quickly. A fifth child, Binh, had been adopted by a couple in Iowa. The couple refused to return the boy. Doan sued for custody, and the couple appealed. Finally, after 18 months, she won Binh back. Her last child, Than, was lost in the shuffle of FCVN. Doan died in 2021, having never found him.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="857" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/american-war/articles/babylift/spot/babylift_spot_1-min.png"></p></div><div><p>“What is my face? Who are my people? Where do I come from?”
</p></div></div><p>The mission of Operation Babylift concluded with the arrival of the Vietnamese babies to their American homes. For the humanitarians and the new parents, this made for a happy ending. But as the children grew up, their stories continued on to other endings.</p><p>“My adoption was not one of those happy, wonderful stories,” Lynelle Long told me. She was taken from Vietnam to Australia at five months old, in 1973. She was not formally adopted until she was in her late teens. “I suffered years of abuse,” she said. Long gave a testimonial last year to the Australian minister of immigration, in which she spoke about suffering sexual abuse by several family members. Two years ago, her adoptive father pleaded guilty to the abuse, and Long legally annulled her adoption. In her passport, “place of birth” had always been listed as Australia. She finally changed it to the truthful location: Vietnam.</p><p>Australia did not have a history of adoption before the Vietnam War, so Long was among the first children to arrive in the country. Back then, no one talked about adoption. “I just grew up feeling strange, weird, isolated, very alone,” she told me. When Long was in her early 20s, she went looking for a meeting like Alcoholics Anonymous for adoptees from abroad. There was none. She joined one group for domestic adoptees, but when she attended she found that they didn’t talk about the experience of looking different from their white families or about facing a daily undercurrent of racism. She asked the group organizers if they ever heard from other adopted people like her. A few came around now and again, they told her. She gave them her name and number and told them to share it when they did. A couple years later, Long, then working at IBM, transformed these chance connections into an online group for anyone around the world who’s been adopted to a foreign country.</p><p>InterCountry Adoptee Voices became a lifeline for adopted people looking for legal advice, help with mental health problems, and information about how to find their birth families — none of which was provided by governments in the years after the babylifts. The United States does not provide welfare checks on internationally adopted children, opening them up to potential harm. In 2022, research on a group of around 800 South Korean adoptees found that a third of them were abused by their adoptive families. The US government also does not collect information about the wellbeing of adopted children later in life. Yet teenagers who were transnationally adopted are far more likely to suffer serious mental health disorders than children who were not adopted. “As a taken child, I was never in any position to defend or protect myself. I had no voice,” Long said in her testimonial.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="705" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog11-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Children on the first Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by AP Photo/File</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="1210" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog12-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R.

In 2000, a sociology student named Indigo Willing started one of the first groups for people adopted from Vietnam, called Adopted Vietnamese International (AVI). Willing was adopted from Vietnam to the suburbs of Sydney in 1972. Her family was loving, she told me, but that didn’t make her forget how she got there. She likened adopted people to lost souls wandering the earth, searching for answers.</p><p>“There’s not a day that I don’t look in the mirror and I wonder, ‘What is my face? Who are my people? Where do I come from?’” she told me. AVI is now a Facebook group of around 2,000 members, where people share baby photos and scans of government flight rosters. They list the names of their birth mothers and 50-year-old addresses, asking, “If you know anything, please let me know.” They fundraise for trips back to Vietnam to hand out DNA kits, in the hopes of expanding the databank of birth families. They organize heritage tours. Willing has traveled back to Vietnam, but she’s never found her birth parents.</p><p>Many of the adopted people I spoke to described themselves as fundamentally incomplete. The parts of their lives that are absent from memory loom as large as the parts that are present. “My narrative is the source of who I am and yet also a reminder of what I am not and do not have. I’m in between a complete story and a story that will never be fully known,” Bert Ballard, who was flown out from Saigon’s An Lac orphanage at three weeks old, wrote in an <a href="https://www.inheritancemag.com/stories/in-between-the-already-but-not-yet">anthology of adoption stories</a>.</p><p>It is for this reason that some adopted people find the closest sense of family among other adoptees. In the Facebook groups, adoptees will sometimes call each other brother and sister. “You guys are my homeland,” said one Korean adoptee to a room of other adoptees at a 2018 conference.</p><p>Jane Joy was adopted from Saigon in 1973 and grew up in a white family in western New York. A few years ago, she founded a Facebook group called Vietnamese Adoptees that she restricted to adopted people only. She told me that so often the good intentions and the injured feelings of adoptive parents end up circumscribing what their adopted children feel permitted to talk about. “I remember being seven or eight years old, and it felt like it physically hurt to not look like my family. I remember saying to my mom, ‘I just wish I had blonde hair, blue eyes.’ She didn’t understand,” Joy told me. “To her, my perspective didn’t make sense. <em>Oh, but you’re different.</em> I didn’t want to be different. That was the last thing I wanted.”</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1297" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog13-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Flight crew members assist Vietnamese children on an Operation Babylift flight to the Philippines.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R.

Ford Presidential Library</p></div></div></div><p>Long, Willing, and Joy are part of what’s often called the first generation of Vietnamese adoptees, people now in their 50s and 60s. For decades after the war, the most widely circulated first-person accounts of the babylifts were memoirs written by humanitarian workers like Cherie Clark, and the events held to commemorate the babylifts were put on by adoption agencies and airline companies. But as the first generation of adoptees came of age, they began to articulate their own perspectives. After groping the dark to find each other, adoptees formed a common language for their experience. They talk about “coming out of the fog” — learning to question the white savior narrative so often handed down by their birth parents. They’ve published memoirs, made documentaries and films. Many have managed to find and reunite with their birth families. They’ve created a counternarrative of adoption that acknowledges the reality of grief, loss, and anger in their stories.</p><p>The recent book <em>Somewhere Sisters</em> by journalist Erika Hayasaki follows the remarkable full story of an adoption, from birth to relocation, to reunion and its aftermath. In Nha Trang in 1998, a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman named Liên bears twin daughters prematurely. Both are ill, weighing less than four pounds. Liên has neither job nor home, and the father is gone. She brings the twins to a nearby orphanage, which accepts one girl, named Loan. Liên’s other daughter, Hà, she entrusts to the care of her sister. Over the next three years, Liên intermittently visits her daughters. One day, she comes by the orphanage and is told that Loan has been adopted by an American family. She is not told their names, but we learn they are the Solimenes, a wealthy family living in a large house in a Chicago suburb. The adoption was motivated by the mother Keely, who, in the wake of 9/11, wanted to do something good and meaningful for the world.</p><p>Hà, meanwhile, lives a poor but happy childhood in her village. At the age of 13, Loan finally reunites with her sister Hà and mother Liên after years of effort on Keely’s part. Her persistence at finding Hà and Liên — procuring interpreters, pursuing leads, and visiting Nha Trang in person several times — is a generous act, but it also makes clear how fully the adoptive family is in control of reunion. Keely makes it happen, though only according to her motivations and on her schedule. Early on, Liên writes Keely a letter to tell her she desires to reconnect with Loan. But Keely will not be ready for six more years. She does not reply.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="857" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/american-war/articles/babylift/spot/babylift_spot_2-min.png"></p></div><div><p>After groping in the dark to find each other, adoptees formed a common language for their experience
</p></div></div><p>The United States has absorbed more adopted children than every other country put together. In 2004, at the peak of international adoption, American families adopted almost 23,000 children. Since then, international adoptions to the US have decreased by more than 90 percent, largely due to Hague Convention regulations intended to eliminate trafficking. In other countries, the narrative around adoption has soured. Ethiopia was sending a couple thousand children to the US a year when the abuse and death of a 10-year-old girl pushed the country to ban all international adoptions. Today, the country’s official policy is that every Ethiopian child should grow up in Ethiopia. China — the country that has cumulatively sent the most children to the US — ceased overseas adoptions last year. When international adoptions do take place, Hague Convention guidelines suggest that the process should be regulated and that contact information for the birth family is preserved and made available if the child desires it.</p><p>There are currently more than a million people in Western countries who were adopted from abroad, including a predominantly Asian American population of adult adoptees in the United States. It’s a group of people unique in history. The first generation has found their voice; the youngest cohort is now coming of age. They are in the unique position, too, of seeing with clear eyes how the cherished American institution of family is offered up or withheld for political aim. </p><p>One of the primary issues facing some American adoptees today is, appallingly, being denied citizenship. Until 2001, foreign adoptions in the US were routed through the same legal pathway as for domestic adoptions. The result was that naturalizing the foreign-born children did not happen as part of that process. Parents had to apply for their children’s citizenship separately, and many of them were either never informed or never did it.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="822" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog15-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>President Gerald Ford holds a Vietnamese baby that arrived in the US on one of the Operation Babylift flights to San Francisco.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library</p></div></div><p>Kris Larsen’s parents did apply for his American citizenship after they adopted him in Guam from an Operation Babylift flight. They assumed he received it, because they didn’t hear otherwise. But his paperwork was never processed. In 2012, Larsen was in his early 40s and serving a prison sentence in Seattle when an ICE check flagged him. The news that he wasn’t a US citizen made no sense to him. “I kind of laughed it off because I was like, ‘That’s impossible. I’ve been here all my life,’” he told me. His family told him it was a mistake and not to worry. On his release, when his family went to the prison to meet him, ICE picked him up instead. He was on their deportation list.</p><p>In 2000, Congress passed legislation to grant citizenship to all adopted children who were under 18. But the law did not apply to adopted adults, including the Operation Babylift cohort and thousands of other adoptees from Korea, China, and other countries.</p><p>Talking to Larsen, I made the mistake of referring to his situation as “undocumented.” He quickly corrected me. He has never been undocumented. In 2022, he petitioned for a pardon, which he received, and was reissued a green card. Now, in his 50s, he is in the process of applying for citizenship.</p><p>About 10 years ago, after the widely publicized deportations of a couple of Korean adoptees, one of whom committed suicide, a movement formed to lobby for legislation that would grant citizenship to adoptees who’d been left out of the 2000 law — a group that potentially numbers in the thousands. The proposed bill, the Adoptee Citizenship Act, has not passed. Conservative opponents categorize it as an undesirable “immigration bill” and demand that adopted people with criminal records and the many dozen adoptees who have already been deported be excluded from the bill.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="604" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog16-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Fifty-two Vietnamese children arrive in a World Airways plane at Oakland Airport in California.</p><p>Photo by Jerry Telfer/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="680" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog17-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by Peter O’Loughlin/AP Photo</p></div></div></div><p>Monte Haines is one such person. He was deported to South Korea in 2009. Five ICE agents escorted him off the plane, put $20 in his pocket, and left. It was November. Haines was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. He had no luggage, no phone, no ID. He did not speak Korean. For three weeks, he slept under a bridge and ate from the trash. “It’s like ping-pong,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf7bj6nuh5s">he said at a panel</a> a few years ago. “First the Korean government sent me to the US, then from the US they sent me back to Korea.”</p><p>The children of Operation Babylift, and all other descendants of American war, are both adoptees and refugees. But they are not voluntary immigrants, and they are not foreigners. The denial of citizenship to adopted Americans like Larsen and Haines reveals that the beneficent embrace of the American family was always conditional, coming at the cost of more vulnerable families and even the children themselves. Adoption in the US has never erased a child’s foreignness. Those who grew up and were charged with crimes are most vulnerable, suddenly marked as not properly deserving to belong. This logic has continued in more insidious form under President Donald Trump, who has dispensed with any notion of saving the children and instead straightforwardly threatens them. His 2018 family separation policy severed approximately 5,500 migrant children from their families in order to broadcast a political warning; more than a thousand are still not reunited. His move earlier this year to undo birthright citizenship is a bald attempt to deny nonwhite children of the US their claim to the American family. </p><p>Long has never found her birth family. Even so, she feels her story is complete. “You can find peace without finding your birth family. That’s not necessary. It’s the process of finding yourself that is necessary,” she said. Haines, meanwhile, managed to move into a studio apartment and get work at a pizza shop, but he has never found home. His new compatriots in Seoul look at him like he’s a foreigner. “I’m Korean, same as you,” he tells them. He has not returned to the United States.</p></main></div></div>]]></description>

<em>[ED: There’s a lot of talk of replacing human programmers. Sure, some will go, but not all. My views on how this plays out have changed considerably over the last 2 months. 3 out of 5 hats.]</em></p>
<h2>
Why LLM-Powered Programming is More Mech Suit Than Artificial Human</h2>
<p>
Last month, I used Claude Code to build two apps: an MVP for a non-trivial backend agent processing platform and the early workings of a reasonably complex frontend for a B2C SaaS product. Together, these projects generated approximately 30k lines of code (and about the same amount again thrown away over the course of the exercise). The experience taught me something important about AI and software development that contradicts much of the current narrative.</p>
<h2>
The Mech Suit Programmer</h2>
<p>
Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTBAvkC3ew" target="_blank">Ripley’s final showdown with the Xenomorph Queen in <em>Aliens</em></a>? She straps into the Power Loader—an industrial exoskeleton that amplifies her strength and capabilities. The suit doesn’t replace Ripley; it transforms her into something far more powerful than either human or machine alone.</p>
<p>
This is exactly how tools like Claude Code work in practice. They’re not replacement programmers; they’re amplifiers of what I can already do. That backend project? It would’ve taken me months the old way. With Claude Code, I knocked out the core in weeks. But let’s be clear - I wasn’t just describing what I wanted and watching magic happen.</p>
<p>
Think of Ripley controlling that Power Loader. Claude Code gave me tremendous lifting power while I maintained control of where we were going. I made all the architectural calls, set the quality bar, and kept us on vision. Most importantly, I had to watch - diligently - for it going off the rails. And when it did (which happened regularly), I had to bring it back into line. The AI cranked out implementation details at incredible speed, but the brain behind the operation? Still mine, and constantly engaged.</p>
<h2>
Vigilance Required</h2>
<p>
With great power comes great responsibility. You must maintain constant awareness when working with AI coding tools—something I learned through several painful lessons.</p>
<p>
Claude Code occasionally made bewildering decisions: changing framework code to make tests pass, commenting out whole sections of code and replacing them with hardcoded values to achieve a passing test rather than fixing the underlying problem, or introducing dependencies that weren’t necessary or appropriate. It has a massive bias for action, so you have to ruthlessly tell it to do less than it wants to do to keep it under control. I even found myself swearing at it from time to time in a weird form of anthropomorphising that I am still not entirely sure I am comfortable with or properly understand.</p>
<p>
Much like piloting an A380, the system handles tremendous complexity but requires a human to grab the yoke at critical moments. Modern aircraft can practically fly themselves, but we still need skilled pilots in the cockpit making key decisions. Taking your eyes off the process, even briefly, can lead to trouble. In my case, the backend required three complete rewrites because I looked away at crucial junctures, allowing the AI to go down problematic implementation paths that weren’t apparent until much later.</p>
<p>
This vigilance requirement creates a fascinating dynamic. While the AI dramatically accelerates certain aspects of development, it demands a different kind of attention from the developer—less focus on writing each line of code, more focus on reviewing, guiding, and maintaining architectural integrity.</p>
<h2>
The Time Cost of Coding</h2>
<p>
Working with Claude Code has fundamentally shifted how I think about the economics of programming time. Traditionally, coding involves three distinct “time buckets”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Why am I doing this?</strong> Understanding the business problem and value  </li>
  <li>
<strong>What do I need to do?</strong> Designing the solution conceptually  </li>
  <li>
<strong>How am I going to do it?</strong> Actually <em>writing</em> the code  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For decades, that last bucket consumed enormous amounts of our time. We’d spend hours, days or weeks writing, debugging, and refining. With Claude, that time cost has plummeted to nearly zero. I can generate thousands of lines of functional code in a sitting—something that is, frankly, mind-blowing.</p>
<p>
But here’s the critical insight: the first two buckets haven’t gone anywhere. In fact, they’ve become <em>more</em> important than ever. Understanding the intent behind what you’re building and clearly defining what needs to be done are now the primary constraints on development speed.</p>
<p>
And there’s a new skill that emerges: wielding the knife. With code generation being essentially free, we need to become much more comfortable with throwing away entire solutions. The sunk cost fallacy hits programmers hard—we hate discarding code we’ve invested in, fearing we might break something important or never get back to a working state.</p>
<p>
But when your assistant can rewrite everything in minutes, that calculus changes completely. Three times during my backend project, I looked at substantial amounts of code—thousands of lines that <em>technically worked</em>—and decided to scrap it entirely because the approach wasn’t right. This wasn’t easy. My instinct was still to try to salvage and refactor. But the right move was to step back, rethink the approach, and direct the AI down a different path.</p>
<p>
This willingness to cut ruthlessly is a muscle most developers haven’t developed yet. It requires confidence in your architectural judgment and a radical shift in how you value implementation time.</p>
<h2>
Experience Still Matters</h2>
<p>
For me, using Claude Code has been a learning exercise in itself. Progress often felt like two steps forward and three back, particularly in the early stages. Generating 20k+ lines of code became relatively straightforward on a daily basis, but knowing when to throw everything away and rebuild from scratch—that took 30 years of experience.</p>
<p>
Wisdom and a bit of grey hair gave me the confidence to recognise when a particular approach wasn’t going to scale or maintain properly, even when the code appeared functional on the surface. Rather than just sit there and watch it generate code, I had to pay very close attention to spot anti-patterns or worse emerging that would either stop working soon after it was written, or lie dormant and bite later on. </p>
<p>
This highlights a critical danger: developers without substantial real-world experience might not recognise when the AI produces nonsense output. They might not realise when AI-generated code solves the immediate problem but creates three more in the process. The mech suit amplifies capability, but it also amplifies mistakes when operated without expertise. These tools are incredibly powerful, but they are also incredibly dangerous when pointed in the wrong direction. </p>
<h2>
The Centaur Effect</h2>
<p>
Chess provides a useful parallel here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess" target="_blank">“Centaur chess”</a> pairs humans with AI chess engines, creating teams that outperform both solo humans and solo AI systems playing on their own. What’s fascinating is that even when AI chess engines can easily defeat grandmasters, the human-AI combination still produces superior results to the AI alone. The human provides strategic direction and creative problem-solving; the machine offers computational power and tactical precision.</p>
<p>
My experience with Claude demonstrated this effect clearly. When I treated the AI as a partner rather than a replacement, development velocity increased dramatically. What I found most effective was when I spent time writing out a stream-of-consciousness “spec” and then iterating with Claude to turn it into an more formal design document. </p>
<p>
But the partnership still required my domain knowledge and architectural judgment to succeed. The AI excelled at pattern recognition and code generation but lacked the contextual understanding to make appropriate trade-offs and design decisions. It can’t tell when it’s done that seems ok, but is actually bonkers. It needed me to watch it constantly and keep it on track.</p>
<h2>
Finding the Balance</h2>
<p>
Building these applications required finding the right balance between delegation and control. Claude went down some insane rabbit holes on the backend when left unsupervised—places where the AI would implement increasingly complex solutions to problems that should have been solved differently or perhaps didn’t need solving at all. In one nightmare example, it ended up completely duplicating a whole section of code in one place rather than reuse an existing component. It worked (for some version of the word “work”) but it was <em>wrong</em>. Way wrong. </p>
<p>
It was a similar story on the front end. I had to constantly stop it from trying to implement functionality in hacky JavaScript rather than use idiomatic Elixir and Phoenix LiveView patterns. </p>
<p>
Over time, I developed a rhythm for collaboration. For straightforward implementations following established patterns, I could delegate broadly. For novel challenges or areas with significant trade-offs, I needed to provide more detailed specifications and review output more carefully.</p>
<p>
What I’ve built could not have been completed so quickly without Claude Code, but it also would have failed completely without human oversight. The true value emerged from understanding when to leverage the AI’s capabilities and when to assert human judgment.</p>
<h2>
The Future is Augmentation</h2>
<p>
There is a view in many circles that LLMs will replace programmers. I am hesitant to say that this will <em>never</em> happen, becuase a lot of things with LLMs have surprised me recently, and I expect more surprises to come. For now, however, I don’t see LLMs <em>effectively</em> replacing programmers; but they are transforming how we work. Like Ripley in her Power Loader, we’re learning to operate powerful new tools that extend our capabilities far beyond what we could achieve alone.</p>
<p>
This transformation will change what we value in developers. Raw coding ability becomes less important; architectural thinking, pattern recognition, and technical judgment become more crucial. The ability to effectively direct and collaborate with AI tools emerges as a vital skill in itself.</p>
<p>
The developers who thrive in this new environment won’t be those who fear or resist AI tools, but those who master them—who understand both their extraordinary potential and their very real limitations. They’ll recognise that the goal isn’t to remove humans from the equation but to enhance what humans can accomplish.</p>
<p>
In my view, that’s something to embrace, not fear. The mech suit awaits, and with it comes the potential to build software at scales and speeds previously unimaginable—but only for those skilled enough to operate the machines in ways that don’t harm themselves or those around them.</p>

Researchers found that writing by hand activates far more extensive and interconnected brain networks compared to typing, particularly in regions linked to memory and sensory processing. These findings provide new evidence that handwriting engages the brain in unique ways, raising concerns about the growing reliance on digital tools for education.</p><p>As digital tools replace traditional handwriting in classrooms, concerns have arisen about how this shift might impact learning. Typing on a keyboard is often preferred because it enables children to express themselves more quickly and with less physical strain. However, prior research has shown that handwriting is linked to better memory retention, letter recognition, and overall learning outcomes. The fine motor movements involved in handwriting seem to stimulate the brain differently than typing, but the exact neurological mechanisms behind this difference remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate, the researchers focused on brain connectivity, which describes how different brain regions work together to accomplish a task. By comparing brain activity during handwriting and typing, the team hoped to uncover whether the physical act of handwriting promotes more extensive brain communication patterns—patterns thought to support learning and memory formation.</p><p>“The brain research on handwriting is really a spin-off of our infant brain research in the <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/psychology/nulab#/view/about">NuLab</a>, our developmental neuroscience laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), where we show that babies are born with a brain that is ready to learn from day one,” said study author Audrey van der Meer, a professor of neuropsychology.</p><p>For their new study, the researchers recruited 40 university students in their early twenties. To ensure consistency, only right-handed participants were included in the analysis, as determined by a standardized handedness assessment. After excluding participants whose data contained artifacts, the final sample consisted of 36 individuals.</p><p>Each participant completed two tasks: handwriting and typing. For the handwriting condition, participants used a digital pen to write visually presented words in cursive directly on a touchscreen. For the typing condition, participants typed the same words on a keyboard using only their right index finger. Participants wrote or typed each word repeatedly within a 25-second window while brain activity was recorded. To avoid visual distractions, the words did not appear on the screen during typing.</p><p>Brain electrical activity was measured using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), a method that captures rapid changes in brain activity using a net of sensors placed on the scalp. The researchers focused on connectivity, analyzing how strongly different brain regions communicated with each other while participants wrote or typed.</p><p>“In our previous studies, critics sometimes mentioned we had tested too few participants,” van der Meer told PsyPost. “This time, we recruited 40 young adults and were able to use the brain data from 36. This is a massive amount of data given that our EEG nets consist of 256 electrodes and can record data at up to 1,000 Hz.”</p><p>The results revealed striking differences in brain activity between handwriting and typing. Handwriting activated far more widespread and interconnected brain networks than typing, particularly in the theta (3.5–7.5 Hz) and alpha (8–12.5 Hz) frequency bands. These brain waves, particularly in the lower frequency range, are associated with memory formation, sensory processing, and attention.</p><p>The most significant connectivity patterns during handwriting emerged in central and parietal brain regions, which are involved in processing motor control, sensory input, and higher-order cognitive tasks. In contrast, typing produced far less synchronized activity across these areas, indicating that pressing keys involves far less integration of visual, motor, and sensory input than forming letters by hand.</p><p>The researchers proposed that handwriting’s benefits arise from the spatiotemporal complexity of the task. Handwriting requires precise coordination of vision, motor commands, and sensory feedback as the brain continuously adjusts finger and hand movements to shape each letter. Typing, on the other hand, relies on repetitive keystrokes that provide minimal motor variation or feedback.</p><p>“In our handwriting research, it becomes clear that the brain works differently when writing by hand as opposed to when typing on a keyboard,” van der Meer explained. “Precisely forming letters by hand requires fine motor skills and involves the body and senses to a much larger degree than typing on a keyboard does. As a result, handwriting involves most of the brain, requiring the brain to communicate fast and efficiently between its active parts.”</p><p>“Our latest results show widespread brain connectivity for handwriting but not for typewriting, suggesting that the spatiotemporal pattern from visual and proprioceptive information obtained through the precisely controlled hand movements when using a pen, contribute extensively to the brain’s connectivity patterns that promote learning.”</p><p>The study’s findings suggest that handwriting should remain an essential part of education, especially for young children whose brains are still developing. The researchers argue that handwriting’s ability to engage the brain more fully provides “optimal conditions for learning,” making it an important tool for fostering cognitive growth.</p><p>Rather than abandoning handwriting in favor of digital tools, the researchers recommend a balanced approach. While keyboards are useful for certain tasks, handwriting offers unique neurological benefits that cannot be replicated by typing alone. Schools, therefore, should prioritize handwriting instruction to ensure children develop the brain connectivity patterns that support lifelong learning.</p><p>“Our brain research shows that handwriting is very good brain stimulation—especially for the developing brain in young children,” van der Meer said. “Therefore, we propose a minimum of handwriting tuition for all children in the lower grades. Also, we see the ability to write by hand and to draw as an important part of our cultural heritage, and we think it is important that the next generation is able to write a poem or love letter by hand. Incidentally, based on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810/full" target="_new" rel="noopener">our 2020 paper</a>, 20 states in the United States decided to reintroduce handwriting instruction in schools.”</p><p>“We are sometimes accused of being against all digital development and wanting to go back to the stone age. All we are saying is that while it is vital to maintain handwriting practice at school, it is also important to keep up with continuously developing technological advances. Therefore, teachers and pupils alike should be aware of which practice has the best learning effect in what context, for example, when taking lecture notes or when writing an essay.”</p><p>While the study provides evidence that handwriting promotes more extensive brain connectivity, it does have limitations. The participants were young adults, so the findings may not generalize to children or older adults. Additionally, the study used digital handwriting, which may differ slightly from traditional pen-and-paper writing in terms of sensory input and motor control.</p><p>The researchers plan to address these limitations in future studies. For example, they are investigating whether students who take notes by hand learn more effectively than those who type. They also hope to explore whether older adults who practice handwriting regularly exhibit slower cognitive decline than those who rely exclusively on digital tools.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Handwriting but not typewriting leads to widespread brain connectivity: a high-density EEG study with implications for the classroom</a>,” was authored by F. R. (Ruud) Van der Weel and Audrey L. H. Van der Meer.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>21st April 2025</p>



<p>For the past two and a half years the feature I’ve most wanted from LLMs is the ability to take on search-based research tasks on my behalf. We saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity (first launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI">December 2022</a>, first prompt leak <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/22/perplexityai/">in January 2023</a>) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which launched/cratered spectacularly <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">in February 2023</a>). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this problem, most notably <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a>.</p>
<p>Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren’t present in the search results, to the point that you couldn’t trust anything they told you.</p>
<p>In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed the line into being genuinely useful.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="deep-research-from-three-different-vendors">Deep Research, from three different vendors</h4>
<p>First came the <strong>Deep Research</strong> implementations—<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">then OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research">then Perplexity</a> launched products with that name and they were all impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of citations. Gemini’s version had a <em>huge</em> upgrade a few weeks ago when they <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/">switched it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, and I’ve had some outstanding results from it since then.</p>
<p>Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn’t my ideal workflow for this kind of tool. I’m impatient, I want answers faster than that!</p>
<h4 id="o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">o3 and o4-mini are really good at search</h4>
<p>Last week, OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/">search-enabled o3 and o4-mini</a> through <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>. On the surface these look like the same idea as we’ve seen already: LLMs that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a prompt.</p>
<p>But there’s one <em>very significant</em> difference: these models can run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use before producing their final answer.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a <em>huge</em> deal. I’ve been throwing all kinds of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven’t spotted a hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself shouting "no, don’t search for <em>that</em>!" at the screen when I see what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Here are four recent example transcripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805758b-acc8-8006-88a3-bdd78866ee15">Get me specs including VRAM for RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000—plus release dates and prices</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68057580-02c8-8006-8ff4-7ae3ce816342">Find me a website tool that lets me paste a URL in and it gives me a word count and an estimated reading time</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805756c-4268-8006-82ab-014f7c304622">Figure out what search engine ChatGPT is using for o3 and o4-mini</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805755b-4aa0-8006-ab0b-42ae569da6a8">Look up Cloudflare r2 pricing and use Python to figure out how much this (screenshot of dashboard) costs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time, without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an overly-verbose report.</p>
<p>My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model. Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of junk.</p>
<p>Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this effectively?</p>
<h4 id="google-and-anthropic-need-to-catch-up">Google and Anthropic need to catch up</h4>
<p>The user-facing <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini app</a> can search too, but it doesn’t show me what it’s searching for. As a result, I just don’t trust it. This is a big missed opportunity since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google’s AI assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates <em>wildly</em> to the point that it’s actively damaging their brand. I just checked and Google is still showing slop <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/">for Encanto 2</a>!</p>
<p>Claude also finally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/">added web search</a> a month ago but it doesn’t feel nearly as good. It’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">using the Brave search index</a> which I don’t think is as comprehensive as Bing or Gemini, and searches don’t happen as part of that powerful reasoning flow.</p>
<h4 id="lazily-porting-code-to-a-new-library-version-via-search">Lazily porting code to a new library version via search</h4>
<p>The truly magic moment for me came <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/#gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking">a few days ago</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Gemini image segmentation tool</a> was using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai">@google/generative-ai</a> library which has been <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js">loudly deprecated</a> in favor of the still in preview <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai">Google Gen AI SDK @google/genai</a> library.</p>
<p>I did <strong>not</strong> feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a whim, I pasted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/aa310a4f9cde07d5e8e87572f70fceca532884dd/gemini-mask.html">my full HTML code</a> (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough documentation to port this code to it.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I couldn’t even be bothered to look up the name of the new library myself!)</p>
<p>... it did <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507">exactly that</a>. It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of searches, figured out the new library (which existed <em>way</em> outside of its training cut-off date), found the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate">upgrade instructions</a> and produced <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/d199de213dc3f866a3b8efbcdd2dde34204dc409">a new version</a> of my code that worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-thinking.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AI assistant response about upgrading Google Gemini API code. Shows &quot;Thought for 21 seconds&quot; followed by web search results for &quot;Google Gemini API JavaScript library recommended new library&quot; with options including Google AI for Developers, GitHub, and Google for Developers. The assistant explains updating from GoogleGenerativeAI library to @google-ai/generative, with code samples showing: import { GoogleGenAI } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@google/genai@latest'; and const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: getApiKey() });"></p>
<p>I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing something else. I was <em>extremely</em> impressed and surprised when it did exactly what I needed.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-economic-model-for-the-web-work-now-">How does the economic model for the Web work now?</h4>
<p>I’m writing about this today because it’s been one of my “can LLMs do this reliably yet?” questions for over two years now. I think they’ve just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check <em>everything</em> they say with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>I still don’t trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I’ll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.</p>
<p>This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we’ve been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?</p>
<p>The lawsuits over this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/#ethics-diabolically-complex">started flying</a> back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they’re actually good at it!</p>
<p>I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I've been exploring the m8 Dirtywave tracker for a few months now, and it's been a fascinating experience. If you're not familiar with it, the m8 is a portable music sequencer built on the Teensy platform that combines a minimal 8-button interface with a powerful tabular workflow. What makes it special isn't just its portability or its sound capabilities, but how the hardware and interface work together to create an experience that's simultaneously constrained and liberating.</p>

<p>When I'm making music on the m8, I don't feel like I'm fighting with the UI or solving puzzles. It's more like intuitive cooking - mixing ingredients, tasting, adapting, and discovering new flavors along the way. I can lay on my couch, pick it up, and within minutes be immersed in the creative process. No re-learning complicated interfaces, no decision paralysis from too many options - just pure creative flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://sam.elborai.me/assets/2abda33123fd7409_tracker-m8-dirtywave-model02.jpg" title=""></p>
<p>This experience got me thinking about programming environments. Most of our programming tools are designed for desktop workstations with keyboards, mice, and large displays. But what about a programming environment designed specifically for a minimal, portable hardware interface? What would programming look like if it was built around a tabular interface navigated with just a handful of buttons?</p>
<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>I've been conceptualizing a programming environment built around a tabular interface inspired by the m8. The key insight is that while traditional programming involves typing long streams of text, we could instead organize code into a structured table with each function defined as rows with fixed columns:</p>
<p><img src="https://sam.elborai.me/assets/b1e89057bd529a81_functions-view.svg" title=""></p>
<ol>
<li>NAME: The function identifier</li>
<li>IN: Input parameter specification</li>
<li>EXP1-EXP5: Five expression cells (the core of execution)</li>
<li>OUT: Output specification</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance, limiting each function to just five expressions seems incredibly restrictive. But this constraint actually encourages breaking down complex operations into atomic, composable functions - which tends to produce more maintainable code.</p>
<p>The hardware component is just as important as the software model. The target hardware would be deliberately minimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teensy 4.1 microcontroller (same as the m8)</li>
<li>320x240 display</li>
<li>D-pad, A/B, START/SELECT buttons (8 buttons total)</li>
<li>microSD slot and headphone jack</li>
</ul>
<p>You would navigate the table with the D-pad, edit cells with the A button (which brings up a contextual menu), and run your program with START. No keyboard needed - all programming happens on the device itself through selection rather than typing.</p>
<p>This isn't just about building yet another programming tool - it's about exploring how hardware constraints can lead to new programming paradigms. When you start from the assumption that your interface has just 8 buttons and a small screen, you're forced to rethink fundamental aspects of how programming works.</p>
<p>The current concept is built on a stack-based model similar to Forth, but that's just an implementation detail. The core innovation is the tabular programming model and how it maps to minimal hardware controls.</p>
<p>Some interesting properties emerge from this design:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Error Reduction</strong>: By selecting from valid options, many classes of syntax errors simply cannot happen</li>
<li><strong>Focused Decomposition</strong>: The five-expression limit forces thoughtful function decomposition</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Data Flow</strong>: Data flow between expressions is visually explicit in the table</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: The entire environment is designed for programming on the go, in casual positions</li>
</ol>
<h2>Real-World Examples: Demoscene Effects</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that this concept isn't just theoretical, let's explore how a classic demoscene effect - a plasma - would be implemented using this tabular programming model:</p>
<pre><code>┌─────────┬─────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬─────┐

└─────────┴─────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴─────┘
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break down how this plasma effect works in detail:</p>
<p>The entry point <code>PLASMA</code> first calls <code>INIT</code> to set up initial state variables, then calls <code>LOOP</code> to start the main execution loop. The <code>INIT</code> function initializes two global variables: <code>TIME</code> set to 0 to track animation time, and <code>BEAT</code> set to 0 to respond to audio input. The arrow symbol (<code>→</code>) represents assignment to a variable, making the data flow explicit.</p>
<p>The main <code>LOOP</code> function orchestrates the entire effect by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calling <code>TIME+</code> to increment the time counter</li>
<li>Calling <code>CLR</code> to clear the screen by writing 0 to video memory</li>
<li>Calling <code>CALC</code> to calculate the plasma values</li>
<li>Calling <code>DISP</code> (implied but not shown) to display the frame</li>
<li>Recursively calling itself to continue the animation loop</li>
</ol>
<p>The actual plasma calculation happens through a nested loop structure. <code>CALC</code> sets up the initial Y coordinate (0) and calls <code>Y-LOOP</code>. The <code>Y-LOOP</code> function then processes each row of pixels by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting the initial X coordinate to 0</li>
<li>Calling <code>X-LOOP</code> to process that row</li>
<li>Incrementing Y by 1</li>
<li>Checking if Y is less than the screen height (<code>Y&lt;H?</code>)</li>
<li>If so, recursively calling itself to process the next row</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, <code>X-LOOP</code> processes each pixel in a row by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calling <code>PXCALC</code> to calculate the plasma value for that pixel</li>
<li>Calling <code>PLOT</code> to set the pixel</li>
<li>Incrementing X by 1</li>
<li>Checking if X is less than the screen width (<code>X&lt;W?</code>)</li>
<li>If so, recursively calling itself to process the next pixel</li>
</ol>
<p>The core math of the plasma effect happens in <code>PXCALC</code>. It:</p>
<ol>
<li>Takes X and Y coordinates as input</li>
<li>Divides X by 16 to scale it down</li>
<li>Calculates the sine of that scaled X value</li>
<li>Divides Y by 16 to scale it down</li>
<li>Calculates the cosine of that scaled Y value</li>
<li>Adds the sine and cosine values together</li>
<li>Returns this sum as the plasma value (<code>VAL</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a simple plasma pattern based on the interference of sine and cosine waves. The division by 16 controls the frequency of the waves.</p>
<p><code>PLOT</code> takes X, Y coordinates and a value V as input, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adds the current <code>TIME</code> to the value to animate the plasma</li>
<li>Multiplies by the current <code>BEAT</code> value to make it respond to audio</li>
<li>Calls <code>!PIXEL</code> to set the pixel at (X,Y) with the resulting color value</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>TIME+</code> function increments the <code>TIME</code> variable by 1 and then calls <code>BEAT+</code> to update the beat value. The audio responsiveness is implemented by <code>BEAT+</code> and <code>BEAT1+</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>BEAT+</code> reads the audio input level (<code>AUDIO</code>) and checks if it's above a threshold (<code>THRSH&gt;?</code>)</li>
<li>If it is, it calls <code>BEAT1+</code> to increase the beat value</li>
<li><code>BEAT1+</code> adds 16 to the current beat value, limits it to a maximum of 127, and stores it back in the <code>BEAT</code> variable</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a visual "pulse" effect when audio input is detected, as the plasma pattern will get brighter or more saturated.</p>
<p>What's particularly fascinating about this implementation is how it manages data flow using the stack. Between each expression cell, data implicitly moves via the stack. For example, in the <code>PXCALC</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>│ PXCALC  │ X Y │ X 16/ │ SIN   │ Y 16/ │ COS   │ +     │ VAL │
</code></pre>
<p>The stack operations would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with X and Y on the stack</li>
<li><code>X 16/</code>: Pop X, divide by 16, push result (let's call it X')</li>
<li><code>SIN</code>: Pop X', calculate sine, push result (sin(X'))</li>
<li><code>Y 16/</code>: Pop Y, divide by 16, push result (Y')</li>
<li><code>COS</code>: Pop Y', calculate cosine, push result (cos(Y'))</li>
<li><code>+</code>: Pop cos(Y'), pop sin(X'), add them, push result (sin(X') + cos(Y'))</li>
</ol>
<p>The final value on the stack is the plasma value that gets returned as <code>VAL</code>.</p>
<p>This illustrates how the stack implicitly connects operations within a row, while the explicit function calls (like <code>X-LOOP</code> calling <code>PXCALC</code> and then <code>PLOT</code>) handle data flow between rows.</p>
<p>To execute this tabular code, a virtual machine would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain a data stack and a return stack</li>
<li>Process each expression cell from left to right within a row</li>
<li>Handle function calls by pushing the current position to the return stack and jumping to the new function</li>
<li>Support basic stack operations, arithmetic, conditionals, and variable storage</li>
<li>Provide hardware abstraction for screen access, audio input, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that the VM can be quite simple while still supporting powerful programs. The tabular structure adds a layer of organization that makes the code more readable and navigable than traditional Forth, while still leveraging the power of stack-based programming.</p>
<p>Here's another example of a classic demoscene effect - a tunnel:</p>
<pre><code>┌─────────┬─────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬─────┐

└─────────┴─────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴─────┘
</code></pre>
<p>The tunnel effect works by precalculating angle and distance lookup tables (<code>GEN-LUT</code>, <code>ANGLE</code>, <code>ANG-X</code>, <code>DIST</code>, <code>DST-X</code>) and then using those tables to map each screen pixel to a position in a texture pattern. The angle (<code>ATAN2</code>) and distance (<code>HYPOT</code>) calculations would normally be expensive operations, but by precalculating them into lookup tables, the effect can run at full speed even on limited hardware.</p>
<p>What's impressive about these examples is how they demonstrate complex mathematics and visualization techniques in a highly constrained programming model. Despite the five-expression limit per function, these programs can create sophisticated visual effects with smooth animation and even audio responsiveness.</p>
<p>While demoscene effects are a great way to demonstrate the capabilities of this system, I'm more excited about its potential for creative applications like pixel art editors, music tools, or interactive storytelling environments.</p>
<p>Imagine a pixel art painting program implemented in this tabular format. The main structure might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>┌─────────┬─────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬─────┐
│ NAME    │ IN  │ EXP1  │ EXP2  │ EXP3  │ EXP4  │ EXP5  │ OUT │
├─────────┼─────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
│ MAIN    │ void│ INIT  │ LOOP  │       │       │       │ void│
│ INIT    │ void│ LOAD-│ CANVAS│ UI-INIT│       │       │ void│
│ LOOP    │ void│ INPUT │ PROCESS│ RENDER│ SAVE? │ LOOP  │ void│

│ PROCESS │ void│ MODE? │ DRAW  │ FILL  │ SELECT│ MENU  │ void│
│ RENDER  │ void│ CANVAS│ CURSOR│ UI    │ FLIP  │       │ void│
└─────────┴─────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴─────┘
</code></pre>
<p>The real power would come from how naturally the hardware maps to the application. The D-pad could move your cursor or navigate UI elements, the A button would draw or select, and B would undo or cancel. The entire interface would be designed around the constraints of the hardware, making it feel natural and intuitive rather than limited.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this approach is scaling beyond simple demos. To address this, I've been thinking about a hierarchical organization model inspired by the m8's structure. The m8's navigation system is quite elegant - it divides the interface into "Views" that can be navigated by holding SHIFT and using the direction keys, with a helpful mini-map in the corner showing your location.</p>
<p><img src="https://sam.elborai.me/assets/4a7324c6d924c575_module-view.svg" title="">
<img src="https://sam.elborai.me/assets/b1e89057bd529a81_functions-view.svg" title=""></p>
<p>The context-sensitive menu system would be a crucial part of making this environment work with so few controls. When you press the A button to edit a cell, you would see a menu of valid options for that context. This eliminates syntax errors and makes discovery of available functions organic.</p>
<p><img src="https://sam.elborai.me/assets/c9fbf7397ac07303_function-edit.svg" title=""></p>
<p>For example, when editing an expression cell, the menu might show available functions, variables, constants, and operators. The options would be filtered based on the current context, so you only see what's relevant. This approach makes programming feel more like navigation than typing.</p>
<p>What excites me most about this concept isn't just the software model, but how the hardware and software could work together when designed as an integrated system. The m8 succeeds because it isn't just tracker software running on portable hardware - it's a complete experience where every aspect of the hardware and software are designed to work together.</p>
<p>Similarly, this tabular programming environment isn't just about cramming programming capabilities into a Game Boy-like
device. It's about rethinking programming from the ground up for a specific hardware context. The result would be
something that doesn't feel constrained when you're using it - it feels natural and intuitive for its purpose, even if
it looks strange and completely foreign at first.</p>
<p>This tabular programming concept opens up many possibilities for exploration. By rethinking how programming can work within tight hardware constraints, we might discover new approaches that actually enhance rather than limit creative expression. I'm sharing this idea because I believe there's something genuinely interesting in the intersection of minimal hardware interfaces and structured programming models.</p>
<p>I currently have a working but pretty bare bone web prototype, to validate the general concept — the Forth-like interpreter works, and can render examples mentioned in this article.</p>

            <p>Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature.</p>
            <p>
              What is pipelining? Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from your
              parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.
            </p>
            <p>When I say pipelining, I’m talking about the ability to write code like this:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_ids</span>(data: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Widget<span>&gt;</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Id<span>&gt;</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>data.iter()<span>              </span><span>// get iterator over elements of the list
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.filter(<span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.alive)<span> </span><span>// use lambda to ignore tombstoned widgets
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.map(<span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.id)<span>       </span><span>// extract ids from widgets
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.collect()<span>           </span><span>// assemble iterator into data structure (Vec)
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}<span>
</span></span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As opposed to code like this. (This is not real Rust code. Quick challenge for the curious Rustacean, can
              you explain why we cannot rewrite the above code like this, even if we import all of the symbols?)
            </p>

            <p>
              I honestly feel like this should be so obvious that it shouldn’t even be up for debate. The first code
              example—with its nice ‘pipelining’ or ‘method chaining’ or whatever you want to call it—it
              <em>just works</em>. It can be read line-by-line. It’s easy to annotate it with comments. It doesn’t
              require introduction of new variables to become more readable since it’s already readable as is.
            </p>
            <p>
              As opposed to, y’know,
              <em>the first word in the line describing the final action our function performs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me make it very clear: This is an <del>article</del> <em>hot take</em> about syntax. In practice,
              <em>semantics beat syntax every day of the week</em>. In other words, don’t take it too seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, this is not about imperative vs. functional programming. This article takes for granted that
              you’re already on board with concepts such as ‘map’ and ‘filter’. It’s possible to overuse that style, but
              I won’t talk about it here.

            <p>
              Here is a feature that’s so bog-standard in modern programming languages that it barely feels like a
              feature at all. Member access for structs or classes with our beloved friend the <code>.</code>-operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a form of pipelining. It puts the data first, the operator in the middle, and concludes with the
              action (restricting to a member field). That’s an instance of what I call pipelining.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>type</span> Bar <span>struct</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	field <span>int</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>get_field</span>(bar Bar) <span>int</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> bar.field
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs. syntax like that of Python's `getattr` function
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>get_field</span>(bar Bar) <span>int</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>getattr</span>(bar, <span>"field"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              You see what I am getting at, right? It’s the same principle. One of the reasons why
              <code>x.y</code>-style member access syntax (and <code>x.y()</code>-style method call syntax!) is popular
              is since it’s easy to read and chains easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s make the comparison slightly more fair, and pretend that we have to write <code>x.get(y)</code>.
              Compare:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span>fizz.<span>get</span>(bar).<span>get</span>(buzz).<span>get</span>(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>get</span>(<span>get</span>(<span>get</span>(fizz, bar), buzz), foo)
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Which one of these is easier to read? The pipelined syntax, obviously. This example is easy to parse
              either way, but imagine you’d like to blend out some information and purely focus on the final operation.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span>&lt;previous stuff&gt;.<span>get</span>(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>get</span>(&lt;previous stuff&gt;, foo)
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              You see the problem, right? In the first example, we have ‘all of the previous stuff’ and then
              <em>apply another operation</em> to it. In the second example, the operation which we want to perform
              (<code>get</code>) and the new operand (<code>foo</code>) are spread out with ‘all of the previous stuff’
              sitting between them.
            </p>
            <p>Looking back at our original example, the problem should be obvious:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_ids</span>(data: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Widget<span>&gt;</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Id<span>&gt;</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>collect(map(filter(iter(data),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.alive),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.id))<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-----------------------------</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>// it's fun to parse the whole line to find the start
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>------------------------</span><span>2</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-----</span><span>7</span><span> </span><span>// okay the final step is the first word in the line that makes sense
</span></span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              I cannot deny the allegations: I just don’t think it makes sense to write code like that as long as a
              clearly better option exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why would I have to parse the whole line just to figure out where my input comes in, and why is the data
              flow ‘from the inside to the outside’? It’s kind of silly, if you ask me.

              This is adding a single line of code. No parentheses counting. It’s easy and obvious. It’s easy to write
              and easy to review. Perhaps most importantly, it shows up <em>incredibly nicely</em> in the
              <code>blame</code> layer of whatever editor or code exploration tool you’re using.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might think that this issue is <em>just</em> about trying to cram everything onto a single line, but
              frankly, trying to move away from that doesn’t help much. It will still mess up your git diffs and the
              blame layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can, of course, just assign the result of every <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> call to a
              helper variable, and I will (begrudgingly) acknowledge that that works, and is
              <em>significantly</em> better than trying to do absurd levels of nesting.

            <h2 id="code-discovery">Code Discovery</h2>
            <p>
              When you press <code>.</code> in your IDE, it will show a neat little pop-up that tells you which methods
              you can call or which fields you can access.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is probably the single IDE feature with the biggest value add, and if not that, then at least the
              single most frequently used one. Some people will tell you that static analysis for namespace or
              module-level code discovery is useless in the age of AI autocompletion and vibe coding, but I very much
              disagree.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>

              Words to live by. What he’s describing here is something that essentially <em>requires</em> pipelining to
              work at all. (And types or type annotation, but having those is the direction the industry is moving in
              anyway.)
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn’t matter if it’s the trusty <code>.</code> operator, C++’s <code>-&gt;</code>, or if it’s
              something more bespoke such as Elm’s or Gleam’s <code>|&gt;</code> or Haskell’s <code>&amp;</code>. In the
              end, it’s a pipeline operator—the same principle applies. If your
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" target="_blank">LSP</a> knows the type of
              what’s on the left, it <em>should</em> in principle be able to offer suggestions for what to do next.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your favorite language’s LSP/IDE does a poor job at offering suggestions during pipelining, then it’s
              probably one of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                You don’t know which type you’re even holding. This happens most often when the language is dynamically
                typed, ’types’ are hard to deduce with static analysis, and you’re touching/writing code without type
                annotations. (e.g. Python)
              </li>
              <li>
                The ecosystem and LSP just didn’t have enough time put into them, or most active users don’t care
                enough. (e.g. any sufficiently obscure language)
              </li>
              <li>
                You are in a situation in which even looking up which methods are available is hard, often due to a
                bespoke build process that confuses the editor. (e.g. basically any build or runtime generation of code,
                or bespoke loading/selection of libraries).
              </li>

              In either case, great editor/LSP support is more or less considered mandatory for modern programming
              languages. And of course, this is where pipelining shines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask any IDE, autocompleting <code>fizz.bu... -&gt; fizz.buzz()</code> is <em>much easier</em> than
              autocompleting <code>bu... -&gt; buzz(...)</code>, for the obvious reason that you
              <em>didn’t even write <code>fizz</code> in the second example yet</em>, so your editor has less
              information to work with.

            <p>
              Pipelining is <em>amazing</em> at data processing, and allows you to transform code that’s commonly
              written with ‘inside-out’ control flow into ’line-by-line’ transformations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where could this possibly be more clear than in SQL, the presumably single most significant language for
              querying and aggregating complex large-scale datasets?
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll be pleased to hear that, yes, people are in fact working on bringing pipelining to SQL. (Whether
              it’s actually going to happen in this specific form
              <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/2d2720461b82f2fd" target="_blank">is a different question</a>,
              let’s not get too carried away here.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless you’re one of those people who spends so much time dealing with SQL that it’s become second nature,
              and the thought that the control flow of nested queries is hard to follow for the average non-database
              engineer is incomprehensible to you, I guess.
            </p>
            <p>Personally, I’m a fan.</p>

              (essentially) its function signature and specifies the return type. With pipe syntax, you lose some of

              Out of the Gang of Four
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern" target="_blank">builder pattern</a> is one that
              isn’t completely irredeemable.
            </p>
            <p>
              And—surprise, surprise—it fits pretty well into pipelining. Any situation where you need to construct a
              complex, stateful object (e.g. a client or runtime), it’s a great way to feed complex, optional arguments
              into an object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people say they prefer optional/named arguments, but honestly, I don’t understand why: An optional
              named <code>foo</code> parameter is harder to track down in code (and harder to mark as deprecated!) than
              all instances of a <code>.setFoo()</code> builder function.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have no clue what I’m talking about, this here is the type of pattern I’m talking about. You have a
              ‘builder’ object, call some methods on it to configure it, and finally <code>build()</code> the object
              you’re actually interested in.

            <h2 id="making-haskell-slightly-more-readable">Making Haskell (slightly more) readable</h2>
            <p>Haskell is hard to read.</p>
            <p>
              It has these weird operators like <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>, <code>$</code>, or
              <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and when you ask Haskell programmers about what they mean, they say something like
              “Oh, this is just a special case of the generalized
              <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:-62--61--62-" target="_blank">Kleisli Monad Operator</a>
              <code>&gt;=&gt;</code> in the category of endo-pro-applicatives over a locally small poset.” and your eyes
              have glazed over before they’ve even finished the sentence.
            </p>
            <p>(It also doesn’t help that Haskell allows you to define custom operators however you please, yes.)</p>
            <p>
              If you’re wondering “How could a language have so many bespoke operators?”, my understanding is that most
              of them are just fancy ways of telling Haskell to compose some functions in a highly advanced way. Here’s
              the second-most basic<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
              example, the <code>$</code> operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine you have functions <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and some value <code>data</code>. In a
              “““normal””” language you might write <code>foo(data)</code>. In Haskell, this is written as
              <code>foo data</code>. This is since <code>foo</code> will automatically ‘grab’ values to the right as its
              arguments, so you don’t need the parentheses.
            </p>
            <p>
              A consequence of this is that <code>bar(foo(data))</code> is written as <code>bar (foo data)</code> in
              Haskell. If you wrote <code>bar foo data</code>, the compiler will interpret it as
              <code>bar(foo)(data)</code>, which would be wrong. This is what people mean when they say that Haskell’s
              function call syntax is
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property" target="_blank">left-associative</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>$</code> operator is <em>nothing but syntactic sugar</em> that allows you to write
              <code>bar $ foo data</code> instead of having to write <code>bar (foo data)</code>. That’s it. People were
              fed-up with having to put parens everywhere, I guess.
            </p>
            <p>If your eyes glazed over at this point, I can’t blame you.</p>
            <p>Let’s get back on track.</p>
            <p>
              Talking about any of the fancier operators would be punching well above my weight-class, so I’ll just
              stick to what I’ve been saying throughout this entire post already. Here’s a stilted Haskell toy example,
              intentionally not written in
              <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree" target="_blank">pointfree</a> style.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>-- Take an input string `content`</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Split into lines, check whether each line is a palindrome and stringify</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Ex. "foo\nradar" -&gt; "False\nTrue"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> content <span>=</span> unlines <span>$</span> map (show <span>.</span> isPalindrome) <span>$</span> lines <span>$</span> map toLower content
</span></span><span><span>  <span>where</span>
</span></span><span><span>    isPalindrome xs <span>=</span> xs <span>==</span> reverse xs
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              If you want to figure out the flow of data, this whole function body has to be read
              <em>right-to-left</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make things even funnier, you need to start with the <code>where</code> clause to figure out which
              local “variables” are being defined. This happens (for whatever reason) at the end of the function instead
              of at the start. (Calling <code>isPalindrome</code> a variable is misleading, but that’s besides the
              point.)
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point you might wonder if Haskell has some sort of pipelining operator, and yes, it turns out that
              one was
              <a href="https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/78#issuecomment-1183568372" target="_blank">added in 2014</a>! That’s pretty late considering that Haskell exists since 1990. This allows us to refactor the above
              code as follows:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

</span></span><span><span>    isPalindrome xs <span>=</span> xs <span>==</span> reverse xs
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Isn’t that way easier to read?</p>
            <p>
              <em>This</em> is code which you can show to an enterprise Java programmer, tell them that they’re looking
              at
              <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Java Streams</a>
              with slightly weird syntax, and they’ll get the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, in reality nothing is as simple. The Haskell ecosystem seems to be split between users of
              <code>$</code>, users of <code>&amp;</code>, and users of the
              <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flow-2.0.0.0/docs/Flow.html#g:1" target="_blank">Flow</a>-provided operators, which allow the same functionality, but allow you to write
              <code>|&gt;</code> instead of <code>&amp;</code>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t know what to say about that, other than that—not entirely unlike C++—Haskell has its own share of
              operator-related and cultural historical baggage, and a split ecosystem, and this makes the language
              significantly less approachable than it has to be.

            <p>
              In the beginning I said that ‘Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from
              your parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.’
            </p>
            <p>
              I still think that this is true, but it doesn’t get across the whole picture. If you’ve paid attention in
              the previous sections, you’ll have noticed that <code>object.member</code> and
              <code>iterator &amp; map</code> share basically <em>nothing</em> in common outside of the order of
              operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first case, we’re accessing a value that’s <em>scoped</em> to the object. In the second, we’re
              ‘just’ passing an expression to a free-standing function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or in other words, pipelining is not the same as pipelining. Even from an IDE-perspective, they’re
              different. In Java, your editor will look for methods associated with an object and walk up the
              inheritance chain. In Haskell, your editor will put a so-called
              <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.3-rc1/users_guide/typed-holes.html" target="_blank">’typed hole’</a>, and try to deduce which functions have a type that ‘fits’ into the hole using
              <a href="https://herecomesthemoon.net/2025/01/type-inference-in-rust-and-cpp/" target="_blank">Hindley-Milner Type Inference</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, I like type inference (and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class" target="_blank">type classes</a>), but I also like if
              types have a namespace attached to them, with methods and associated functions. I am pragmatic like that.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I like about Rust is that it gives me the best out of both worlds here: You get traits and type
              inference without needing to wrap your head around a fully functional, immutable, lazy, monad-driven
              programming paradigm, and you get methods and associated values without the absolute dumpster fire of
              complex inheritance chains or AbstractBeanFactoryConstructors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve not seen any other language that even comes close to the convenience of Rust’s pipelines, and its
              lack of higher-kinded types or inheritance did not stop it. Quite the opposite, if anything.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              I like pipelining. That’s the one thing that definitely should be obvious if you’ve read all the way
              through this article.
            </p>
            <p>I just think they’re neat, y’know?</p>
            <p>I like reading my code top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of from-the-inside-to-the-outside.</p>
            <p>
              I like when I don’t need to count arguments and parentheses to figure out which value is the first
              argument of the second function, and which is the second argument of the first function.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when my editor can show me all fields of a struct, and all methods or functions associated with a
              value, just when I press <code>.</code> on my keyboard. It’s great.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when <code>git diff</code> and the <code>blame</code> layer of the code repository don’t look like
              complete ass.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when adding a function call in the middle of a process doesn’t require me to parse the whole line
              to add the closing parenthesis, and doesn’t require me to adjust the nesting of the whole block.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when my functions distinguish between ‘a main value which we are acting upon’ and ‘secondary
              arguments’, as opposed to treating them all as the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when I don’t have to pollute my namespaces with a ton of helper variables or free-standing
              functions that I had to pull in from somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re writing pipelined code—and not trying overly hard to fit everything into a single, convoluted,
              nested pipeline—then your functions will naturally split up into a few pipeline chunks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each chunk starts with a piece of ‘main data’ that travels on a conveyer belt, where every line performs
              exactly one action to transform it. Finally, a single value comes out at the end and gets its own name, so
              that it may be used later.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that is—in my humble opinion—exactly how it should be. Neat, convenient, separated ‘chunks’, each of
              which can easily be understood in its own right.
            </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog">https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43750765">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nerdlog</h2><a id="user-content-nerdlog" aria-label="Permalink: Nerdlog" href="#nerdlog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Nerdlog is a fast, remote-first, multi-host TUI log viewer with timeline
histogram and no central server. Loosely inspired by Graylog/Kibana, but
without the bloat. Pretty much no setup needed, either.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's laser-focused on being efficient while querying logs from multiple remote
machines simultaneously, filtering them by time range and patterns, while also
drawing a timeline histogram for quick visual insight:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/blob/master/images/nerdlog_intro.png"><img src="https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/raw/master/images/nerdlog_intro.png" alt="Nerdlog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Primary use case: reading system logs (<code>/var/log/messages</code> or
<code>/var/log/syslog</code>) from one or more remote hosts. Very efficient even on large log files (like 1GB or more).</p>
<p dir="auto">It does support some other log formats and can use any log files, but that was the primary use case which was driving the implementation: we were having our web service backend running as systemd services on a bunch of Linux instances, printing a lot of logs, and wanted to be able to read these logs efficiently and having the timeline histogram, much like tools like Graylog have.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design highlights</h2><a id="user-content-design-highlights" aria-label="Permalink: Design highlights" href="#design-highlights"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No centralized server required; nerdlog establishes an ssh connection to
every node that the user wants to collect logs from, and keeps them idle in
the background (although a separate server to store the log files might still
help in some cases; see the <a href="https://dmitryfrank.com/projects/nerdlog/article#requirements" rel="nofollow">Requirements and limitations</a> sections in the article);</li>
<li>Logs are not downloaded to the local machine in full: all the log analysis
is done on the remote nodes, and on each query, only the following data is
downloaded from each node: up to 250 messages from every logstream
(configurable), and data for the timeline histogram. It's obviously possible
to paginate over the logs, to get the next bunch of messages, etc. Nerdlog
then merges the responses from all nodes together, and presents to the user
in a unified form;</li>
<li>Most of the data is gzipped in transit, thus saving the bandwidth as well.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Demo</h2><a id="user-content-demo" aria-label="Permalink: Demo" href="#demo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here’s a quick demo showing how Nerdlog works across four remote nodes:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project history</h2><a id="user-content-project-history" aria-label="Permalink: Project history" href="#project-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It might be useful to know the history to understand the project motivation and
overall direction, you can read it
<a href="https://dmitryfrank.com/projects/nerdlog/article#project_history" rel="nofollow">here in the full article</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project state</h2><a id="user-content-project-state" aria-label="Permalink: Project state" href="#project-state"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Originally hacked together in 2022 to replace painfully slow Splunk setups.
Revisited in 2025 to clean it up to a certain extent, and open source it.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's still kinda in a proof-of-concept stage though. Implemented as fast as
possible, spaghetti code abounds, could be covered with more tests, a lot more
features could be implemented, etc. Was only tested for real on Linux, and with
Linux hosts to get the logs from.</p>
<p dir="auto">But it works. It's pretty usable and surprisingly fast.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To build it, you need <a href="https://go.dev/" rel="nofollow">Go</a>. Having it installed:</p>
<p dir="auto">To install <code>nerdlog</code> binary to your <code>/usr/local/bin</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Or to build and run without installing:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you open the app (<code>nerdlog</code> binary), it'll show a query edit form with a
few fields:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/blob/master/images/nerdlog_query_edit_form.png"><img src="https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/raw/master/images/nerdlog_query_edit_form.png" alt="Nerdlog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Time range is self-explanatory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next one is "Logstreams": shortly, a logstream means one or more <em>consecutive</em>
logfiles like <code>/var/log/syslog</code>, <code>/var/log/syslog.1</code> etc, on a particular
server accessible via ssh. If you have a server like <code>myserver.com</code> accessible
via ssh on port 22, then the logstream to read its <code>/var/log/syslog</code> (or
<code>/var/log/messages</code>) file could be:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you need a different port and/or different log files, then a more explicit
form is:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="myuser@myserver.com:1234:/some/other/logfile"><pre><code>myuser@myserver.com:1234:/some/other/logfile
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Multiple logstreams can be provided separated by commas, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="myuser@myserver.com, myuser@myserver.com:1234:/some/other/logfile"><pre><code>myuser@myserver.com, myuser@myserver.com:1234:/some/other/logfile
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Nerdlog also reads ssh config (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>) and can take the port, username
and hostname from there. It supports globs too, so e.g. in your ssh config you
have two hosts like <code>myhost-01</code> and <code>myhost-02</code>, then instead of specifying
your logstreams as <code>myhost-01,myhost-02</code> it can be simply <code>myhost-*</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Obviously though, we can't specify the log files in the ssh config, so if you
need to configure a logstream for non-default log file on some host(s), you can
use the nerdlog's own logstreams config file <code>~/.config/nerdlog/logstreams.yaml</code>,
which can look like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="log_streams:
  myhost-01:
    hostname: actualhost1.com
    port: 1234
    user: myuser
    log_files:
      - /some/custom/logfile
  myhost-02:
    hostname: actualhost2.com
    port: 7890
    user: myuser
    log_files:
      - /some/custom/logfile"><pre><code>log_streams:
  myhost-01:
    hostname: actualhost1.com
    port: 1234
    user: myuser
    log_files:
      - /some/custom/logfile
  myhost-02:
    hostname: actualhost2.com
    port: 7890
    user: myuser
    log_files:
      - /some/custom/logfile
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The last thing on that query form is the "Select field expression", it looks
like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="time STICKY, lstream, message, *"><pre><code>time STICKY, lstream, message, *
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It only affects the presentation of the logs in the UI. The syntax somewhat
resembles the SQL <code>SELECT</code> syntax, although a lot more limited.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>STICKY</code> here just means that when the table is scrolled to the right,
these sticky columns will remain visible at the left side.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another supported keyword here is <code>AS</code>, so e.g. <code>message AS msg</code> is a valid
syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a more extensive discussion on the logstreams and other core concepts, consider
reading the <a href="https://dmitryfrank.com/projects/nerdlog/article#core_concepts" rel="nofollow">Core concepts</a>
section in the article.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>SSH access to the remote hosts is required. You can read about the related limitations and possible workarounds here: <a href="https://dmitryfrank.com/projects/nerdlog/article#consequences_of_requiring_ssh_access" rel="nofollow">Consequences of requiring SSH access</a>;</li>
<li>SSH agent must be running locally;</li>
<li>Gawk (GNU awk) is a requirement on the hosts, since nerlog relies on the <code>-b</code>
option. So notably, <code>mawk</code> will not work. You need <code>gawk</code>;</li>
<li>If you're going to read system logs (those accessible via <code>journalctl</code>), make
sure that you have <code>rsyslog</code> or similar system installed; otherwise, nobody
is writing to these log files. Notably, on latest Fedora and Debian,
<code>rsyslog</code> is not installed by default.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For more extensive discussion about these requirements, the consequent limitations, and possible ways to address them, see the <a href="https://dmitryfrank.com/projects/nerdlog/article#requirements" rel="nofollow">Requirements and Limitations</a> sections in the article.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UI</h2><a id="user-content-ui" aria-label="Permalink: UI" href="#ui"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">UI consists of a few key elements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Awk pattern input: just a filter for logs. Empty filter obviously means no filter, and some examples of valid filters are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Simple regexp: <code>/foo bar/</code></li>
<li>Regexps with complex conditions: <code>( /foo bar/ || /other stuff/ ) &amp;&amp; !/baz/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Edit button: opens a complete query edit form discussed above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Menu button: just opens a menu with a few extra items:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Back: Go to the previous query, just like in the browser</li>
<li>Forward: Go to the next query, just like in the browser</li>
<li>Copy query command: It's the equivalent of copying an URL in the browser, containing the link to the current logs query. See the <code>:xc[lip]</code> command below for more details on that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Time range histogram: similarly to some web-based log viewers, like Graylog or Kibana, Nerdlog also shows a timeline histogram, so you can quickly glance at the intensiveness of the logs accordingly to the current query. It's also easy to visually select and apply timerange (using arrow / PgUp / PgDown / Home / End / Enter keys or vim-like bindings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Logs table: obviously contains the actual logs. Like in the normal, old-school logs, <strong>the latest message is on the bottom</strong>. I don't know why modern web tools do it the other way around (latest message being on the top), to me it's nonsense. But let me know if you prefer it this modern way; it shouldn't be too hard to make it configurable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every line shows the timestamp and the message, and it can also be scrolled to the right to show the context tags parsed from a log line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Status line. On the left side, there are a few computer icons with numbers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Green: number of lstreams which we're fully connected to and which are idle</li>
<li>Orange: number of lstreams which we're fully connected to and which are executing a query</li>
<li>Red: number of lstreams which we're trying to connect to</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And on the right side, there are 3 numbers like <code>1201 / 1455 / 2948122</code>. The rightmost number (2948122) is the total number of log messages that matched the query and the timerange (and included in the timeline histogram above). The next number (1455) is the number of actual log lines currently loaded in the nerdlog app, and the leftmost (1201) is just the cursor within those available logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Command line: Vim-like command line. Hit <code>:</code> to enter command mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Navigation</h2><a id="user-content-navigation" aria-label="Permalink: Navigation" href="#navigation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are multiple ways to navigate the app, and you can mix them as you wish.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most conventional one is to just use Tab and Shift+Tab to switch between widgets (logs table, query input, Edit and Menu buttons, timeline histogram), arrows and keys like Home / End / PgUp / PgDn to move around within a widget, Enter to apply things, Escape to cancel things.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you know Vim though, you'll feel right at home in nerdlog too since it supports a bunch of Vim-like keybindings:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Keys <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>Ctrl+U</code>, <code>Ctrl+D</code>, etc move cursor whenever you're not in some text-editing field, like query input or others</li>
<li>Hitting Escape eventually brings you to the "Normal mode", which means that the logs table is focused (and all of those <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>l</code>, etc work there)</li>
<li><code>:</code> focuses the command line where you can input some commands (see below)</li>
<li><code>i</code> or <code>a</code> focuses the main query input field</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When in an input field (command line, query input, etc), you can go through input history using <code>Up</code> / <code>Down</code> or <code>Ctrl+P</code> / <code>Ctrl+N</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the query edit form (the Edit button on the UI, or the <code>:e[dit]</code> command), the <code>Ctrl+K</code> / <code>Ctrl+J</code> iterates "full" query history (affecting not only one field like query, but all of them: time range, logstreams filter, query).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Commands</h2><a id="user-content-commands" aria-label="Permalink: Commands" href="#commands"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to the UI which is self-discoverable, there is a vim-like command line
with a few commands supported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:xc[lip]</code> Copies to clipboard a command string which would open nerdlog with
the current logstreams filter, time range and query. This can be done from the Menu too (Menu -&gt; Copy query command)</p>
<p dir="auto">This is the equivalent of URL sharing for web-based logging tools: when you'd
normally copy the graylog URL and paste it in slack somewhere, with nerdlog you
can do the same by sharing this string.</p>
<p dir="auto">The string would look like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="nerdlog --lstreams 'localhost' --time -3h --pattern '/something/'"><pre><code>nerdlog --lstreams 'localhost' --time -3h --pattern '/something/'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And it can be used in either the shell (which would open a new instance of
nerdlog), OR it can also be used in a currently running nerdlog instance: just
type <code>:</code> to go to the command mode, copypaste this command above, and nerdlog
will parse it and apply the query.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:back</code> or <code>:prev</code> Go to the previous query, just like in the browser. This can be done from the Menu too (Menu -&gt; Back)</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:fwd</code> or <code>:next</code> Go to the next query, just like in the browser. This can be done from the Menu too (Menu -&gt; Forward)</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:e[dit]</code> Open query edit form; you can do the same if you just use Tab to navigate
to the Edit button in the UI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:w[rite] [filename]</code> Write all currently loaded log lines to the filename.
If filename is omitted, <code>/tmp/last_nerdlog</code> is used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:reconnect</code> Reconnect to all logstreams</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:disconnect</code> Disconnect from all logstreams</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:set option=value</code> Set option to the new value</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>:set option?</code> Get current value of an option</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently supported options are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>numlines</code>: the number of log messages loaded from every logstream on every
request. Default: 250.</li>
<li><code>timezone</code>: the timezone to format the timestamps on the UI. By default,
<code>Local</code> is used, but you can specify <code>UTC</code> or <code>America/New_York</code> etc.</li>
