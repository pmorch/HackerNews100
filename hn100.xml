<p dir="auto">A decompilation of Duke Nukem Zero Hour for N64.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: To use this repository, you must already own a copy of the game.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h2><a id="user-content-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Dependencies" href="#dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The build instructions assume that you will be using Ubuntu 20.04; either natively or via WSL2.</p>
<p dir="auto">Package requirements can be install via:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt update

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Clone the repository; note the --recursive flag to fetch submodules at the same time:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/Gillou68310/DukeNukemZeroHour.git --recursive"><pre>git clone https://github.com/Gillou68310/DukeNukemZeroHour.git --recursive</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Navigate into the freshly cloned repo</p>

<p dir="auto">Place the Duke Nukem Zero Hour US ROM in the root of this repository, name it baserom.us.z64, and then run the first make command to extract the ROM:</p>

<p dir="auto">Now build the ROM:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you did everything correctly, you'll be greeted with the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Creating z64: build/us/dukenukemzerohour.z64

<p dir="auto">This repository has support for the French versions of the game too.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build this version, place your ROM in the root of the repo and rename it to baserom.fr.z64. Pass VERSION=fr to the above make commands.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building NON_MATCHING Version</h3><a id="user-content-building-non_matching-version" aria-label="Permalink: Building NON_MATCHING Version" href="#building-non_matching-version"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Functions can be decompiled to a state where they are functionally equivalent, but are not a byte-perfect match.
In order to build/test the non-matching, add NON_MATCHING=1 argument to the make commands.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h2><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A Docker image containing all dependencies can be built and ran as follows:</p>

docker run --rm -ti --mount src=<span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span></span>,target=/dukenukemzerohour,type=bind dukenukemzerohour</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then continue with <a href="#Building">the building instructions</a></p>
<p dir="auto">When binding windows or mac folder I strongly recommand installing <a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/docker-desktop-extension" rel="nofollow">Mutagen Extension for Docker Desktop</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Game can be debugged with gdb through mupen64plus (Windows only for now).
In order to have source code information the game should be compiled with modern gcc by adding MODERN=1 to the make command.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_84">
<p>Authorities are now considering whether a falling object, possibly from space, caused damage to the windshield and frame on a United 737 MAX over Colorado on Thursday. Various reports that include watermarked photos of the damage suggest the plane was struck by a falling object not long after taking off from Denver for Los Angeles. One of the photos shows a pilot’s arm peppered with small cuts and scratches. In his remarks after the incident, the captain reportedly described the object that hit the plane as “space debris,” which would suggest it was from a rocket or satellite or some other human-made object. Some reports say it was possibly a meteorite.</p>



<p>Whatever hit the plane, it was an enormously rare event and likely the first time it’s ever happened. The plane diverted without incident to Salt Lake City where the approximately 130 passengers were put on another plane to finish the last half of the 90-minute flight. Apparently only one layer of the windshield was damaged, and there was no depressurization. The crew descended from 36,000 feet to 26,000 feet for the diversion, likely to ease the pressure differential on the remaining layers of windshield. Neither the airline nor FAA have commented.</p>

<div><p>I work for an MSP, mostly with small to medium companies. Licensing costs went up a ton when broadcom acquired vmware. They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that.</p><p>If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off.</p><p>About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included.

<div><p>I'm with a block storage vendor that works with a lot of companies migrating off VMware, and the diversity of KVM-based cloud management platforms we're seeing is fascinating. We have customers moving to OpenNebula, CloudStack, Proxmox, OpenStack, HP VME, Oracle Virtualization, and even some homegrown solutions. The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45638920"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45638920" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45638920&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45635940"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Hard to say much given we weren't given much info on how it'd be used.</p><p>E.g. Parallel's is only useful for people looking to run VMs locally on their Mac, but Hyper-V can be anything from that for a Windows PC to a full-blown headless hypervisor cluster with HA, shared volumes, replication, etc.</p><p>For several of the common categories, these are my takes:</p><p>- Traditional Enterprise: Nutanix [paid] if money is available, otherwise Hyper-V [paid] if a large Microsoft contract is already in place. If neither fit: fall through to acting like an SMB.</p><p>- SMB/Modern Mid-Sized Enterprise: Cloud [paid] only and/or Proxmox [free/paid]</p><p>- Tech Company: Doesn't matter, they'll do whatever sounds cool that year and make it work well enough</p><p>- Home Lab: Proxmox [free/paid]</p><p>- Windows PC: Hyper-V [free w/ Windows] (it's meh, but it's integrated - doubly so if you plan on using WSL on the side).</p><p>- Mac PC: Parallels [paid] if you need a GPU accelerated Windows guest, UTM [free] otherwise.</p><p>- Linux PC: QEMU+KVM [free], the choice of (optional) GUI client is up to preference.</p><p>Some extra notes by solution:</p><p>- Nutanix: Enterprises were staring to use this more and more even prior to the VMware sale. It's definitely the spiritual successor of traditional VMware usage in the data center. A bit less full of themselves, for now at least, than VMware ever managed to keep themselves (IMO).</p><p>- Proxmox: Has a bit of a habit of feeling like it always ends up a little broken by the time you've used an install/cluster for 6 months, but is by far the best option for the homelabber type use case (even ignoring that it's free as a reason). It's basically like someone configured KVM with what you want to be able to just (try to) use it without thinking about what's underneath, while still having access to the underneath to un-stick it in certain situations. Also does host-native containers! I never did have the guts to pitch my company try to run anything production on a cluster, but they do have reasonably priced support plans and advanced feature tiers for that.</p><p>- Parallels: Kind of sucks for the price, but there isn't anything else on macOS with the same GPU acceleration for Windows.</p><p>- Hyper-V: I think this is mostly still around because it helps Microsoft stay sticky at companies when the yearly renewal comes up. That said, it's alright - and it's also integrated into Windows in some pretty nifty ways for local use these days.</p><p>- UTM: Fantastic QEMU client for macOS, worth giving a few bucks for even though it's free.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45636581"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45636581" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45636581&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45635940"></a></center></td><td><br>

<h2>Doing well in your courses</h2>
<p>a guide by Andrej Karpathy</p>
<br>

<div><p>Here is some advice I would give to younger students if they wish to do well in their undergraduate courses.</p><p>
  
  Having been tested for many years of my life (with pretty good results), here are some rules of thumb that I feel helped me:</p></div>

<div>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p>
  <strong>All-nighters are not worth it. <br>
  </strong>Sleep does wonders. Optimal sleep time for me is around 7.5 hours, with an absolute minimum of around 4hrs.<br>
  It has happened to me several times that I was stuck on some problem for an hour in the night, but was able to solve it in 5 minutes in the morning. I feel like the brain "commits" a lot of shaky short-term memories to stable long-term memories during the night. I try to start studying for any big tests well in advance (several days), even if for short periods of time, to maximize the number of nights that my brain gets for the material.
</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Attend tutorials or review sessions</strong>.<br>
  Even if they are bad. The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts. If its too boring, you can always work on something else. Remember that you can also try to attend a different tutorial with a different TA.</p></div>

<div>
<h2>TESTS: PREPARATION</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Considering the big picture and organisation is the key.</strong> <br>
  Create schedule of study, even if you dont stick to it. For me this usually involves getting an idea of everything I need to know and explicitly writing it down in terms of bullet points. Consider all points carefully and think about how long it will take you to get them down. If you don't do this, there is a tendency to spend too much time on beginning of material and then skim through the (most important) later material due to lack of time.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study</strong>.<br>
Especially if the past tests were written by the same professor. This will give you strong hints about how you should study. Every professor has a different evaluation style. Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type of questions.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content.<br>
</strong>Even I often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them at will. Feynman famously <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand">knew this</a> very well.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to collaborate with others, but near the end. <br>
  </strong>Study alone first because in the early stages of studying others can only serve as a distraction. But near the end get together with others: they will often point out important pitfalls, bring up good issues, and sometimes give you an opportunity to teach. Which brings me to:</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Don't only hang out only with stronger students</strong>.<br>
  Weaker students will have you explain things to them and you will find that teaching the material helps A LOT with understanding.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Go to the prof before final exam at least once for office hours.</strong> <br>
  Even if you have no questions (make something up!) Profs will sometimes be willing to say more about a test in 1on1 basis (things they would not disclose in front of the entire class). Don't  expect it, but when this does happen, it helps a lot. Does this give you an unfair advantage over other students? Sometimes. It's a little shady :)<br>
But in general it is a good idea to let the prof get to know you at least a little.</p>
<div><p><strong><br>
  Study well in advance.</strong> <br>
   Did I mention this already? Maybe I should stress it again. The brain really needs time to absorb material. Things that looked hard become easier with time. <br>
   You want to alocate ~3 days for midterms, ~6 days for exams.</p><p>
  
  <strong><br>
  If things are going badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink.</strong><br>
  They work. It's just chemistry.</p></div>
<p><strong><br>
  For things like math: Exercise &gt; Reading.</strong><br>
  It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start the exercises, but then fill in the gaps through doing exercises, especially if you have many available to you. The exercises will also make you go back and read things you don't know.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Make yourself cheat sheet.</strong> <br>
  Even if you're not allowed to bring it to the exam. Writing things down helps. What you want is to cram the entire course on 1 or more pages that you can in the end tile in front of you and say with high degree of confidence "This is exactly everything I must know"</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Study in places where other people study as well, even if not the same thing.</strong> <br>
  This makes you feel bad when you are the one not studying. It works for me :)<br>
  Places with a lot of background noise are bad and have a research-supported negative impact on learning. Libraries and Reading rooms work best.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>TESTS: ON DAY OF</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Optimal eating/drinking habit is: T-2 hours get coffee and food.</strong><br>
  For me, Coffee or Food RIGHT before the test is ALWAYS bad<br>
  Coffee right before any potentially stressful situation is ALWAYS bad.<br>
  No coffee at all is bad.<br>
  I realize the coffee bit may be subjective to me, but its something to think about for yourself.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Study very intensely RIGHT before the test.</strong> <br>
   I see many people give up before the test and claim to "take a break". Short term memory is a wonderful thing, don't waste it! Study as intensely as possible right before the test. If you really feel you must take a break, take it about an hour before the test, but make sure you study really hard 30-45 minutes before the test.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>DURING THE TEST</h2>
<p>
  <strong> Always use pencil for tests</strong>.
  <br>
  You want to be able to erase your garbage "solutions"</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Look over all questions very briefly before start.</strong> <br>
A mere 1-3 second glance per question is good enough. Just absorb all key words, and get idea of the size of the entire test.</p>
<p><strong> <br>
  On test, do easy questions first.</strong> <br>
  Do not allow yourself to get stuck on something too long. Come back to it later. I skip questions all the time... Sometimes I can complete as little as 30% of the test on my first pass. Some questions somehow become much easier once you're "warmed up", I can't explain it.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to be neat on the test.</strong> <br>
  Surprisingly few people actually realize this obvious fact: A human being will mark your test. A sad human being gives low marks. I suspected this as undergrad student and confirmed it strongly when I was TAing and actually marking. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always BOX IN/CIRCLE the answer</strong><br>
  Especially when there is derivation around it. This allows the marker to give you a quick check mark for full marks and move on. Get in the mindset of a marker.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  NEVER. EVER. EVER. Leave test early. </strong><br>
  You made a silly mistake (I guarantee it), find it and fix it. If you can't find it, try harder until time runs out. If you are VERY certain of no mistakes, work on making test more legible and easier to mark. Erase garbage, box in answers, add steps to proofs, etc.<br>
  I have no other way of putting this-- people who leave tests early are stupid. This is a clear example of a situation where potential benefits completely outweigh the cost.
  <br>
  </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Communicate with the marker.</strong> <br>
  Show the marker that you know more than what you put down. Ok you can't do a particular step, but make it clear that you know how to proceed if you did. Don't be afraid to leave notes when necessary. Believe it or not the markers often end up trying to find you more marks-- make it easy for them.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Consider number of points per question.</strong><br>
  Many tests will tell you how many marks every question is worth. This can give you very strong hints when you are doing something wrong. It also gives you strong hints at what questions you should be working on. It is, of course, silly to spend too much time on questions worth little marks that are still relatively hard for you.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  If there are &lt;5 minutes left and you are still stuck on some question, STOP.</strong> <br>
  Your time is better spent re-reading all questions and making absolutely sure you did not miss any secondary<br>
  questions, and that you answered everything. You wouldn't believe how many silly marks people lose this way.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Congratulations if you got all the way here! Now that you are here, here's my last (very important advice). It is something that I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate.</p>

<p>Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that noone will care about your grades, unless they are bad. For example, I always used to say that the smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not under-study.</p>

<p>Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don't screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important endeavors. What are they?
</p>

<p>Getting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base, projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely imporant. Professors/People who know you and can write you a good reference letter saying that you have initiative, passion and drive are extremely important. Are you thinking of applying to jobs? Get a summer internship. Are you thinking of pursuing graduate school? Get research experience! Sign up for whatever programs your school offers. Or reach out to a professor/graduate student asking to get involved on a research project you like. This might work if they think you're driven and motivated enough. Do not underestimate the importance of this: A well-known professor who writes in their recommendation letter that you are driven, motivated and independent thinker completely dwarfs anything else, especially petty things like grades. It also helps a lot if you squeeze in at least one paper before you apply. Also, you should be aware that the biggest pet peeve from their side are over-excited undergrad students who sign up for a project, meet a few times, ask many questions, and then suddenly give up and disappear after all that time investment from the graduate student's or professor's side. Do not be this person (it damages your reputation) and do not give any indication that you might be.</p>

<p>Other than research projects, get involved with some group of people on side projects or better, start your own from scratch. Contribute to Open Source, make/improve a library. Get out there and create (or help create) something cool. Document it well. Blog about it. These are the things people will care about a few years down the road. Your grades? They are an annoyance you have to deal with along the way. Use your time well and good luck.</p>

                                        <p>PARIS (AP) — In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world’s most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift up the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/police-outside-the-louvre-museum-after-theft-8abcc540ef4640789c03ae9e54f7e6a0">Louvre</a></span> ’s facade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said. </p><p>The daylight heist about 30 minutes after opening, with visitors already inside, was among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory and comes as staff complained that crowding and thin staffing are straining security.</p><p>The theft unfolded just 250 meters (270 yards) from <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mona-lisa-paint-recipe-leonardo-louvre-2b82601ad75f8514754966d74e95a211">the Mona Lisa</a></span>, in what Culture Minister Rachida Dati described as a professional “four-minute operation.” </p><p>One object, the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum, French authorities said. It was reportedly recovered broken.</p><p>Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine. No one was hurt. </p><p>Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone, since removed — the thieves’ entry point and, observers said, a striking vulnerability for a palace museum.</p>
    
    
    
<h2>A museum already under strain</h2><p>Around 9:30 a.m., several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the glass display cases, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift via the riverfront facade, where construction is underway, to reach the hall with the 23-item royal collection.</p><p>Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery — where the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia. </p><p>The thieves smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes, Nunez said. Alarms brought Louvre agents to the room, forcing the intruders to bolt, but the theft was already done.</p>
    
<p>Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch — a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.</p><p>“It’s a major robbery,” Nunez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-louvre-museum-renovation-64c83759247406323def9e54bb4890c9">the museum’s upcoming overhaul plan</a></span>. Officials said security upgrades include new-generation cameras, perimeter detection, and a new security control room. But critics say the measures come far too late.</p><p>The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday for the forensic investigation to begin as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine. </p><p>Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre with visitors present ranks among Europe’s most audacious in recent history, and at least since <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/dresden-berlin-0ba8c0a7adf4719aaecd64753c000a51">Dresden’s Green Vault museum in 2019</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/louvre-museum-paris-closed-lines-delay-2bbf9be4f49de739fd14dd4d908e4d72">June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing</a></span>. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.</p><p>Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — but Sunday’s theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum’s more than 33,000 objects.</p><p>The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny.</p><p>“How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It’s just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.”</p><p>The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.</p>
    
<p>Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi’s carved laws; Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. The objects — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe’s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.</p>
    
<h2>Politics at the door</h2><p>The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament. </p><p>“The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?” </p><p>The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.</p><h2>What we know — and don’t</h2><p>Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value. </p><p>Recovery may prove difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.”</p><p>Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter. French authorities did not immediately comment on this.</p><p>Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It seems like Microsoft has encountered a significant issue with the latest <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341976/microsoft-breaks-localhost-with-windows-11-october-update-users-forced-to-revert" target="_blank">Windows 11 25H2 October update, KB5066835</a>. The company confirmed that this update disrupts mouse and keyboard functionality within the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), making them unresponsive and unusable. As a result, the WinRE feature is completely inoperative. WinRE is a built-in troubleshooting toolkit included with Windows. It's intended to assist users when their computer encounters startup problems or system issues. WinRE activates automatically when Windows crashes or fails to boot properly, but users can also access it manually to utilize various repair tools.</p><p>

However, with the current problem affecting keyboard and mouse input, WinRE is essentially ineffective. Microsoft stated that "the USB keyboard and mouse continue to work normally within the Windows operating system," and assured users that they are "working to release a solution to resolve this issue in the coming days. More information will be provided when it is available." This is yet another incident related to the recent Windows 11 updates, which have previously caused localhost issues. The list of Windows 11 problems continues to grow as the latest updates are released. Microsoft maintains a Windows 11 version 25H2 known issues and notifications <a rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-25H2" target="_blank">website</a> that provides status updates on the latest problems, including this one.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/eVE26AT7I8nb5Xs0.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1024" data-height="768" data-fancybox="g342032"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/eVE26AT7I8nb5Xs0_thm.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/JFGDRMELQOYGydHH.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1024" data-height="768" data-fancybox="g342032"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/JFGDRMELQOYGydHH_thm.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt=""></a> </p><p>Early last week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341832/microsoft-breaks-windows-media-creation-tool-ahead-of-windows-10-eol" target="_blank">accidentally broke</a> the Windows Media Creation Tool (MCT) just a day ahead of Windows 10's end-of-life. Additionally, the company began requiring <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341656/microsoft-blocks-online-account-bypass-on-windows-11" target="_blank">Online Accounts for Windows 11 installations</a>, making them increasingly difficult to bypass. Every previously reported issue has been addressed or resolved, except for the broken localhost functionality and now this WinRE problem. Without keyboard and mouse input, users are unable to initiate any recovery processes to resolve OS issues. Until Microsoft releases a patch, we must wait and hope that the OS remains stable without needing any intervention.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>For more than</span> a century, the zipper has stayed more or less the same: two interlocking rows of teeth, a sliding pull, and the fabric tape that holds it together. It’s one of those inventions that conquered the world by blending into it. Billions are used every day, yet few people ever stop to think about how they work.</p><p>Now, after a hundred years of stasis, YKK, the Japanese company that makes roughly half the world’s <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">zippers</a>, has decided it’s time to rethink the mechanism that holds much of modern <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/fashion/">clothing</a> together. Their new <a data-offer-url="https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/&quot;}" href="https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AiryString zipper</a> looks ordinary at first glance. Then you realize what’s missing: there’s no tape.</p><p>That absence transforms everything. Without the woven fabric that normally flanks the teeth, the AiryString is lighter, sleeker, and far more flexible. It’s a small but important redesign that feels almost futuristic in its simplicity, a fastening system that sinks into a garment instead of sitting on top of it.</p><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="YKK probably makes the zippers on the clothes you're wearing right now.

</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of AiryString</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We wanted to address the challenges involved in zipper sewing,” says Makoto Nishizaki, vice president of YKK’s Application Development Division. The idea grew out of a collaboration with JUKI Corporation, a leader in industrial sewing machines. Together, the two companies reconsidered how a zipper could be made and how it could merge more seamlessly with fabric. The partnership began in 2017 and made its public debut at the JIAM 2022 Osaka trade show—a detail that hints at how long YKK plays the long game.</p><p>If <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YKK’s name</a> doesn’t ring a bell, check the pull tab on your jackets or pants, because you probably already wear their work. In 2023, the company had more than $6 billion in revenue. Founded in Japan in 1934, the company makes zippers for everyone from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-wants-you-to-do-space-in-style-with-the-prada-axiom-spacesuit/">Prada</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-puffer-jackets/">Arc’teryx</a> to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/patagonia-sustainable-clothing/">Patagonia</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/the-north-face-base-camp-duffel-bag/">The North Face</a>.</p><p>Its dominance comes from an unusual level of control: YKK manufactures its own machines, designs its own molds, and even spins its own thread. That self-sufficiency lets it experiment in ways competitors can’t, turning a mundane component into a field for continuous innovation.</p><h2>Reinventing an Everyday Mechanism</h2><p>The zipper, as we know it, hasn’t had a real overhaul since the 1910s. Its long reign owes much to reliability—it’s sturdy, inexpensive, and easy to sew. For most of the 20th century, that was enough. But materials have evolved. Designers now work with featherlight nylons, stretch fabrics, and technical blends that behave more like skin than cloth. The old zipper, with its woven borders and stiff seams, has started to feel out of sync with what surrounds it.</p><p>“There has been a growing demand from the market for lighter and more flexible garments,” Nishizaki says. “And similar expectations have extended to zippers.” However, removing the tape introduced a host of engineering problems. Those strips of fabric give a zipper its structure and provide the surface tailors sew through. Without them, YKK had to rethink every step of production.</p><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="The North Face has selected YKK's new AiryString zipper system for its new Summit Series Advanced Mountain Kit." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_120,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_240,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_320,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_640,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_960,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1280,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1600,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span><p>The North Face has selected YKK's new AiryString zipper system for its new Summit Series Advanced Mountain Kit.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of North Face</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The teeth were redesigned, the manufacturing process rewritten, and new machinery developed to attach the closure to garments. “The absence of the tape posed various production challenges,” Nishizaki says. “We had to develop new manufacturing equipment and a dedicated sewing machine for integration.” The result: a lighter, more flexible system that reduces material use and environmental impact compared with a standard Vislon zipper.</p><p>Early adopters are already experimenting. <a data-offer-url="https://www.descente.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.descente.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.descente.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Descente Japan</a>, known for technical sportswear, was among the first to prototype AiryString in 2022. The North Face has selected the system for use in its new <a data-offer-url="https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men&quot;}" href="https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Summit Series</a> Advanced Mountain Kit. Smaller brands like <a data-offer-url="https://earthletica.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://earthletica.com/&quot;}" href="https://earthletica.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Earthletica</a>, an eco-conscious swim and performance label, have also tested it, describing the zipper as “soft, flexible, and almost silent.”</p><p>The effect is apparently tactile. Garments move more naturally, lie flatter against the body, and feel less mechanical. “We repeatedly conduct durability and strength tests by sewing AiryString <em>and</em> conventional zippers into various fabrics,” Nishizaki says. “In terms of usability, AiryString offers much smoother operability.” That translates to a softer, slicker glide—the satisfying pull that separates a well-made jacket from a cheap one.</p><h2>Little Parts, Big Change</h2><p>On the factory floor, the benefits add up, too. Traditional zippers consume extra fabric and dye and require multiple sewing passes. By removing the tape, YKK says it trims both material and labor. “It contributes to reducing work in customers’ sewing processes,” Nishizaki says. “It also reduces fiber use and water consumption in the dyeing process, lowering CO₂ emissions.”</p><p>The math adds up fast. YKK offers a 100 percent recycled-material version of AiryString and claims measurable cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. The impact is magnified by scale: The company operates in 71 countries and regions, and its trademark is registered in 177. When you make <em>billions</em> of zippers a year, these small efficiencies ripple globally.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="Tape takeaway YKK's new zipper design completely removes the fabric strip on either side of the teeth making the..." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_120,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_240,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_320,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_640,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_960,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1280,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1600,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AiryString%25C2%25AE%2520zipper2.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span><p>Tape takeaway: YKK's new zipper design completely removes the fabric strip on either side of the teeth, making the AiryString lighter, sleeker, and far more flexible.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of AiryString</span></p></figure><p>That incremental progress mirrors YKK’s founding philosophy, the “Cycle of Goodness.” The principle—that no one prospers without benefiting others—has supposedly guided the company for decades. It’s visible in its other micro-improvements: corrosion-resistant alloys, sound-dampened sliders, recyclable polyester tapes. AiryString continues that tradition, shrinking the zipper’s physical and environmental footprint at once.</p><p>Adoption, though, will take time. AiryString can fit into existing workflows, but to unlock its full potential, factories will apparently need specialized sewing equipment. That limits early use to design-led and performance-oriented brands, such as The North Face, willing to retool. Once those experiments prove successful, the technology could spread quickly, especially in an industry where efficiency drives everything from pricing to sustainability.</p><p>When asked what zippers might look like in 50 years, Nishizaki doesn’t talk about smart fabrics or AI-assisted closures. He returns to YKK’s mantra: “Little parts. Big difference.” AiryString embodies that principle. It’s not a flashy reinvention, it's a recalibration. A century-old mechanism made lighter, cleaner, and almost invisible. In a world addicted to louder, faster innovation, YKK’s breakthrough succeeds by subtracting rather than adding.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration made nine elite universities <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">an offer they couldn’t refuse</a>: bring in more conservatives while shutting down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” give up control of admissions and hiring decisions, agree to “biological” definitions of sex and gender, don’t raise tuition for five years, clamp down on student protests, and stay institutionally “neutral” on current events. Do this and you won’t be cut off from “federal benefits,” which could include research funding, student loans, federal contracts, and even student and faculty immigration visas. Instead, you may gain “substantial and meaningful federal grants.”</p>
<p>But the universities <em>are</em> refusing. With the initial deadline of October 20 approaching, four of the nine universities—the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/update-penns-response-compact-academic-excellence">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5557914-brown-university-rejects-trump-compact/">Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-16/usc-rejects-trump-education-compact">University of Southern California</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/mit-rejects-white-house-compact.html">MIT</a>—that received the federal “compact” have announced that they will not sign it.</p>
<p>In addition, the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, today <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx">issued a statement</a> calling for the compact to be completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>The compact would “impose unprecedented litmus tests on colleges and universities as a condition for receiving ill-defined ‘federal benefits’ related to funding and grants,” the statement says, and goes on to add that “it offers nothing less than government control of a university’s basic and necessary freedoms—the freedoms to decide who we teach, what we teach, and who teaches… The compact is just the kind of excessive federal overreach and regulation, to the detriment of state and local input and control, that this administration says it is against.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Think about it for a second: could the internet exist without standards and protocols? Of course not! Computers need shared rules and agreements to communicate with one another. Even human languages, like English, work much the same way. They function as a kind of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">communication protocol</a> because we’ve all agreed on words and grammar that carry shared meaning. In both cases, whether among machines or people, communication depends on common understanding.</p><p>This is where <strong>RFCs</strong> come in. They’re the blueprints and proposals that define how the internet operates and how systems interact. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at <strong>RFCs</strong> and uncover some of the fascinating history behind the internet.</p><p>Before we dive in, here’s a quick overview: RFCs, or <em>Requests for Comments</em>, are <strong>official documents that explain how Internet technologies work</strong>. They outline how systems are expected to behave and interact. Think of them as the reference guides for anyone who wants to build, understand, or improve the Internet.</p><h2 id="the-birth-of-the-internet"><span>the Birth of the Internet</span><a href="#the-birth-of-the-internet"><i></i></a></h2><p>The history of the internet is a long and amazing tale — one that deserves its own post (and I’ll probably write about it). But for now, let’s focus on how it all began.</p><p>I’m not going to answer “Who invented the Internet?” because that’s the wrong question. The internet didn’t appear overnight; it took decades to mature. Instead, we can highlight the people who played key roles in shaping today’s internet.</p><p>It all started in the USA in 1958, when the government created the <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</strong> to fund research in new technologies — partly driven by <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Cold War</a> tensions. The US government was worried that a nuclear first strike from the Soviets could wipe out their communication. To prevent that, they established computer research centers at leading universities. The goal was to create a <strong>reliable, distributed communication system</strong> that could continue operating even if parts of it were damaged by a nuclear attack.</p><p>Computers — or better to say, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">mainframes</a> back in those days — were gigantic and could fill an entire room. Here’s what an IBM 7090 mainframe looked like in the early 60s:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/60s-mainframe.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/60s-mainframe.webp" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090" width="550" loading="lazy"></a> <em><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_J._Corbat%C3%B3" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Corbató</a> with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p><p>Back then, transferring data was nothing like the internet file uploads we know today. First, everything was physical: <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">punch cards</a> or paper tapes had to be loaded manually into machines. Then came <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic tapes</a> (big reels of tape containing data) which you’d physically transport to other machines:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/mainframe-data-storage.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/mainframe-data-storage.webp" alt="Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape" width="520" loading="lazy"></a> <em>Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape</em></p><p>Since these computers were geographically separated, they needed a way to <strong>connect and exchange information reliably and fast</strong>. The solution was to develop a <strong>packet-switching network</strong>, which could send data in small blocks called “packets” that could travel independently across the network and be reassembled at their destination. This system eventually became the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">ARPANET</a>, the first network to implement packet switching, laying the foundation for the modern internet.</p><p>In fact, the first use of the term <em>protocol</em> in a modern data communication context appeared in April 1967, in a memorandum titled <strong>“A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network”</strong>. It was written under the direction of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Davies</a>, who pioneered the concept of packet switching.</p><p>In 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford university. They tried to send the word <code>LOGIN</code>, but only <code>LO</code> made it through before the system crashed. About an hour later, after recovering from the crash, the full message was successfully transmitted.</p><p>by 1970, there were around 15 nodes (or computers), and by 1972, 19 nodes were connected. In 1973 they even created a map of ARPANET — the same one you see in the post preview image. ARPANET was considered a major success because it showed that packet-switching technology worked in practice and made it possible for distant computers to share information reliably. However, access was still limited to universities and research organizations that held contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.</p><p>As you can see, the network was growing rapidly and that didn’t happen by chance. It was the result of coordination and collaboration. Every node and computer had to follow the same rules and standards to communicate effectively.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the foundations laid by ARPANET and early networking experiments made it possible for something revolutionary: in 1989, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Berners-Lee</a> proposed the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, which went public in 1991, opening the internet to everyone.</p><p>We’ll pause the story of the internet here, having covered the key parts. If you’re interested to know more, you can check out this infographic:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/history-of-the-internet-infographic.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/history-of-the-internet-infographic.webp" alt="Internet History Timeline Infographic from Behance" width="400" loading="lazy"></a> <em>Internet History Timeline (Infographic from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/6310935/History-of-the-Internet-Infographic">Behance</a>)</em></p><p>Now it’s time to explore the technical documents that shape and standardize Internet operations.</p><h2 id="what-are-rfcs"><span>What Are RFCs?</span><a href="#what-are-rfcs"><i></i></a></h2><p><strong>Request for Comments (RFCs)</strong> are a series of numbered documents that describe how the internet works and how different systems communicate. They address a variety of topics, including core standards, communication protocols, guidelines, design ideas, and concepts that help keep the global network running smoothly. Each RFC is written by engineers and computer scientists as a memorandum presenting new ideas, research findings, proposed methods, or other concepts related to internet technologies.</p><p>The RFC system was created in 1969 by <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Crocker</a> to record and share informal notes on the development of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">ARPANET</a>. The goal was to help researchers share ideas about how the network should operate, how computers (hosts) should communicate, and how software running on these hosts should behave.</p><p>The very first RFC, titled <strong>“Host Software”</strong>, was published by Crocker himself on <strong>April 7, 1969</strong>. In this context, “host software” referred to the programs and protocols that computers needed to communicate over ARPANET, essentially the foundational rules for networked computing at the time:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc0001.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc0001.webp" alt="RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969" width="400" loading="lazy"></a> <em>RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969</em></p><p>Every RFC is assigned a unique number upon publication — starting with RFC 1 — and these numbers are permanent. Once a document receives its number, it never changes or gets reused, even if that RFC later becomes obsolete or is replaced by a newer one. This numbering system helps maintain a consistent historical record of the internet’s evolution and ensures that every RFC can be precisely referenced.</p><p>Today, RFCs are maintained and published by the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>, which continues to develop and expand them. While many RFCs are experimental in nature and never become official standards, others have become the backbone of the Internet’s architecture. These include the core technologies we rely on every day, such as <strong>TCP/IP</strong>, <strong>HTTP</strong>, and <strong>DNS</strong>. RFCs not only define how these protocols operate but also reveal the reasoning behind their design, helping us understand how the global network actually operates.</p><p>RFCs are often described as the blueprints of the internet. Yet, in an age where artificial intelligence and higher-level tools make technology more accessible, fewer people explore the underlying systems and details of how things actually work (at least, that’s my perspective). I believe RFCs are essential reading for anyone involved in technology or IT — that’s why I wrote this post.</p><h2 id="why-they-still-matter-today"><span>Why They Still Matter Today?</span><a href="#why-they-still-matter-today"><i></i></a></h2><p>RFCs remain the <strong>official source of truth</strong> for Internet standards, ensuring consistency across the global network. By studying them, developers learn not just the rules, but also <em>why</em> they exist, gaining the knowledge needed to build software and systems that communicate reliably with other computers.</p><p>You can’t create something truly dependable without understanding its foundations — just as you couldn’t design a beautiful building without knowing architecture, the same principle applies to apps and networked systems.</p><p>For instance, if you ever wanted to <strong>build your own DNS server</strong>, the first step isn’t writing code from scratch or copying an online tutorial. You’d start by reading relevant RFCs, which define the domain name system and how queries and responses should work. By understanding the protocol from the original source, you can ensure your implementation is reliable, interoperable, and standards-compliant. This is the power of RFCs: they let you build on solid foundations rather than reinventing the wheel.</p><h2 id="finding-and-reading-them"><span>Finding and Reading Them</span><a href="#finding-and-reading-them"><i></i></a></h2><p>The official source for RFCs is the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC Editor</a>, which manages the publication, editing, and archiving of all RFC documents. If you want to explore the development process behind RFCs — including drafts, authors, and approval stages — the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">IETF Datatracker</a> provides detailed information on every document’s history and current status. Also, for a more comfortable reading experience, <a href="https://www.rfcreader.com/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC Reader</a> offers an online viewer with features like an automatic table of contents, note-taking, and search capabilities.</p><p>For guidance on how to read RFCs, the IETF provides a helpful article titled <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/how-read-rfc/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">“How to Read an RFC”</a>. I strongly recommend reading it. The article explains how to search for the right documents, understand the structure of RFCs, and identify the most relevant information on the first page.</p><p>Some RFCs are <em>informational</em> or <em>experimental</em>, so you should be careful about which ones you read. For example, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1149.html" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 1149</a> literally describes a method for transmitting IP packets using pigeons! Its humorous follow-up, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549.html" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 2549</a>, improves on the idea. You can think of it like something out of a Harry Potter movie — sending messages via birds — but applied, jokingly, to the Internet:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc-1149.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc-1149.webp" alt="RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers" width="500" loading="lazy"></a> <em>RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers</em></p><p>Also, RFCs are archival documents, which means they cannot be updated once published. As a result, older RFCs may be obsolete or superseded by newer versions, and it’s important to ensure you are reading the correct, up-to-date document. The IETF article linked above explains how to identify the most relevant RFCs and determine which ones are current.</p><p>You can also check the references at the end of a Wikipedia article on a given topic, where several related RFCs are often listed for further reading.</p><p>When reading these documents, you might come across words like <strong>“MUST”</strong>, <strong>“MUST NOT”</strong>, <strong>“REQUIRED”</strong>, <strong>“SHALL”</strong>, <strong>“SHALL NOT”</strong>, <strong>“SHOULD”</strong>, <strong>“SHOULD NOT”</strong>, <strong>“RECOMMENDED”</strong>, <strong>“MAY”</strong>, and <strong>“OPTIONAL”</strong>. These are not just casual suggestions — they have <strong>precise and standardized meanings</strong> in the context of RFCs. These terms are defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 2119</a>, which provides guidance for specifying requirement levels in technical documents. Here’s a quick summary of what they mean:</p><ul><li><strong>MUST / MUST NOT / REQUIRED / SHALL / SHALL NOT</strong> – Indicates an <strong>absolute requirement</strong>; the behavior described is mandatory.</li><li><strong>SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / RECOMMENDED</strong> – Indicates a <strong>strong recommendation</strong>, but there may be valid reasons to deviate.</li><li><strong>MAY / OPTIONAL</strong> – Indicates a <strong>truly optional</strong> behavior; implementers have complete discretion.</li></ul><p>Understanding these words is crucial because RFCs use them to <strong>clearly communicate which rules are mandatory and which are flexible</strong>, ensuring interoperability and consistency across the Internet. If you plan to implement protocols, <strong>don’t skim RFCs or read them selectively</strong>. It’s easy to misinterpret a specification if you only look at part of it. You should read not just the sections that seem directly relevant to what you’re working on, but also any referenced material, to fully understand its requirements.</p><h2 id="final-words"><span>Final Words</span><a href="#final-words"><i></i></a></h2><p>The early developers built much of the technology we rely on today <strong>without the Internet or Stack Overflow</strong>, relying purely on their skill, curiosity, and persistence. It’s easy to copy and paste something that works — but doing so only makes you one of many. The ones who <strong>truly understand</strong> are those who push limits and create what has never existed before.</p><p>Every protocol, every standard, every “MUST” or “SHOULD” is part of a story crafted by engineers over decades. So don’t be intimidated — explore, read carefully, and let these documents guide you. And if you ever discover a better idea or approach, share it with the world — perhaps even as an RFC. Who knows? The next specification you write could help shape the Internet of tomorrow.</p><p>I’ll end this post with a quote from one of my all-time favorite animated films, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Ratatouille</a> — a reminder that mastery comes from courage and curiosity:</p><blockquote><p><em>“You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true — anyone can cook… but only the fearless can be great.”</em></p></blockquote><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9JTgpk1hXs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By the time you read this essay, no matter the hour of the day, you will likely have already made some kind of choice: coffee with skimmed milk, whole milk, cream, or black? Sugar or no sugar? Tea instead? Personalised, preference-based choice is, at present, a deeply familiar aspect of life in much of the world, though perhaps most markedly so in the United States, where I live and work. It is also something people don’t generally spend a lot of time discussing, in part because it feels so ordinary. People around the globe shop for everything from housing to vacations to, yes, caffeinated drinks. They pick what they want to read, what they want to listen to, and what they want to believe. They vote for favourite candidates for office. They select friends and lovers, fields to study, professions and jobs, places to live, even insurance plans to hedge their bets when something they cannot choose occurs.</p>
<p>Perusing a menu of options to decide what best matches individual desires and values – which is what we generally mean today by making a choice – is a key feature of modern democratic and consumer culture alike. It is also an exalted one. People may disagree about what the possibilities should be, but rarely about the principle of maximising arenas for choice-making or the options themselves. For many of the world’s citizens, this is simply what freedom feels like.</p>
<p>Yet, as you may have also felt at various moments, abundant choice isn’t always so straightforward. Behavioural economists point out that most people are actually pretty bad at making decisions of this kind (which explains the appeal of return departments and divorces for when things don’t go as hoped). Philosophers and political theorists say it promotes selfish individualism and discourages collective action around issues that affect us all. And sociologists add that societies that prize choice too much tend to blame those with only poor or limited options for their own misfortunes. So much for choice as consistently synonymous with freedom.</p>
<p>What is strange, though, is that few of these critics ever really question either the centrality or the value of choice-making in contemporary life. On the contrary, they tend to make their case as if people everywhere had always spent their days doing things that feel commonplace in capitalist democracies and, indeed, hankering for more such chances. But for the historian, it is obvious that this entire phenomenon is culturally specific. There are people around the globe even today who actively resist this framing of freedom. What may be more surprising is that granting this special status to choice-making is also a relatively recent development even in Western Europe and the United States, not to mention the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So how did we get to this point? How did choice become a proxy for freedom in so many domains in modern life? As we discover more and more about our troubles navigating it, we might also wonder if there are other, better ways to be free.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hough the explosion of choice has largely been a <span>20th-century</span> phenomenon, the full story is a long one, going all the way back to the 17th and <span>18th centuries.</span> Personal choice, as both experience and term of art, got its start in two quite distinct early modern spaces.</p>
<p>One is the realm of the shop. Fuelled by the building of colonial and interior trade networks, new goods started to enter cities and towns as early as the <span>17th century,</span> first in Western Europe, then in the New World, and gradually in their hinterlands too. Particularly significant among those goods were patterned and brightly coloured textiles called calicoes, originally from South Asia, whose price point made it possible for ordinary people to have the novel experience of selecting from among different designs for clothing or home furnishings. Checks? Flowers? Stripes? Purple or green? The decision could, distinctively, be based on nothing more than personal preference. For at the same time, a leisure-time activity blossomed, first at auctions in temporary locations and then increasingly in fixed destinations called shops, in which consumers were invited to peruse a display of the options for sale before ever opening their purses.</p>
<p>Even people with limited means started to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers</p>
<p>The English-language neologism ‘shopping’, as opposed to provisioning, took off in the second half of the <span>18th century</span> precisely to describe this newfangled business. We now also call it consumer choice. The customer learned from all of this browsing and weighing the possibilities to ‘make a choice’ – which is to say, an aesthetic as well as a practical determination en route to purchasing – from what were often already described as a set of ‘choice’, or pre-selected, goods ripe for picking.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The post-Reformation fracturing of Christianity, combined with the Protestant tradition of ‘freedom of conscience’ or ‘religious choice’, gradually produced a sense of ideas and beliefs as being similarly up for selection in a pluralist world. With the double emergence of Enlightenment notions of tolerance in Europe and of the Great Awakening religious revival in the British colonies, even people with limited means started, on both sides of the Atlantic, to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers and churches where congregations had become voluntary communities, attending varieties of public lectures, and picking books from lending libraries and sales catalogues. These, too, were learned recreations, ones that soon revolved around secular as well as sacred notions. Consider Jane Austen’s fictional heroine in <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814) who, when she gets up the nerve to subscribe to a lending library, is, in Austen’s lightly satirical telling, ‘amazed at her own doings in every way, to be a renter, a chuser [sic] of books!’ From such actions, the stage was set for intellectual choice <span>as well.</span></p>
<p><span>B</span>etween the late 18th century and the First World War, choice continued to expand its domain, encompassing the selection of other people, from marriage partners to employees to political representatives, too. At the same time, it became subject to ever more rules and strictures, formal and not, so as both to tame its potential for undermining the social order and to make it work.</p>
<p>In the course of the 19th century, choice increasingly entered the romantic and sexual lives of urban men and women, though with significant gender distinctions when it came to the rules, creating affective and bodily choice as well. This was a development tied very much to the rise of both the idea of companionate marriage – spouses who consent to marry out of mutual affection or even attraction – <em>and </em>an elaborate etiquette about how to identify and court possible partners in a world in which everyone didn’t already know everyone else. From Santiago and Chicago to Paris and Stockholm, and from working-class ticketed dance halls to private soirées for the elite, balls, in particular, became places for organising and evaluating the options in a world in which both young men and young women had been given the power to contract freely for a spin around the dance floor – and also, potentially, for permanent coupledom in the form of a marriage (aka ‘The Choice’, though a marriage contract would technically mean the end of sexual choice once it was signed and sealed). Employment saw a similar kind of transition insofar as it, too, became increasingly a matter of sorting mechanisms, markets and contracts.</p>

<p>Finally (and surprisingly late), a similar form of choice came to politics in the form of new voting practices as well as an increase in formal laws to go with them. It is well known that the <span>19th century</span> was marked by intense debates, from Central Europe to Latin America, about <em>who</em> should be able to vote as new democratic norms spread to many parts of the world. Much less well remembered is the rise of intense discussions about how all these new voters should go about the business of suffrage, especially when it came to the moment of choice itself. Voices in favour of secret balloting, like the Sons of Liberty in New York City, had made themselves heard by the end of the 1760s. But it wasn’t until another century had passed that this mode of voting, rooted in the idea of the protection of internal personal preferences from outside pressure, became the international gold standard, instituted first in Australia in the 1850s (hence what is sometimes still called the Australian ballot) and then by a host of other nations around the globe in the decades just preceding the First World War.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists, marketing experts and economists devoted themselves, in different ways, to the <em>study</em> of choice-making</p>
<p>Even at the time, commentators were amazed that this transformation took place with so little upheaval. That may well be because the change to secret, individualised voting diminished the rowdiness and violence so often previously associated in many places with popular and considerably more communal elections. But surely it was also because, by the time this shift occurred, it seemed to bring elections into line with so many other kinds of 19th-century leisure-time activities. The secret ballot allowed for the same sorts of choice-making to be enacted when it came to candidates, though with the results eventually aggregated into group choice, as it did for other forms of picking – overcoming the longstanding objections of even liberals like John Stuart Mill, who worried that the last stronghold of public life would in this way be privatised. Only the workplace would remain largely immune. In effect, if the initial age of revolutions in the <span>18th century</span> introduced popular sovereignty based on elections in the first place, we might think of this as the moment of a second age of democratic revolution.</p>

<p>But the 20th century added its own finishing touches to the story of choice. The ranks of choosers continued to expand, albeit highly unevenly, to include women, poor people, sometimes even children, especially in places where mass goods, from newspapers to chewing gum, became widely available. So did the ranks of ‘choice agents’, the people creating the menus of options, inventing the rules, and directing the activity itself. Beyond shop owners, itinerant preachers, dancing masters and political party officials, now new kinds of social scientists came to the fore. Psychiatrists, marketing experts, economists: in different ways, they all devoted themselves to the <em>study</em> of choice-making, exploring who makes what choices under what conditions and with what effects, along with how individuals and groups could be steered to make better ones. Ordinary people participated in this work every time they sat on a couch for a therapy session or filled out a survey card or took a multiple-choice exam. Together, researchers and their everyday subjects, male and female, invented sciences of choice, further entrenching the idea of humans as, fundamentally, choosers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the rise of the internet has only expanded this model. Today, the sheer number of both choice-making opportunities and options has grown exponentially, whether we are talking about music or vacuum cleaners. The nature of our choices has also changed. Before the age of shopping for goods and selecting ideas had really gotten underway, most choices were structured around doing the right thing rather than the wrong. Since then, choice has increasingly become value-neutral, a matter of one’s own interior preferences being externalised in the act of selection. Moreover, choice has become more and more important to conceptions of human flourishing. Once, picking from menus was of relatively little significance, especially since freedom was imagined in the Western tradition well into the <span>18th century</span> more often as a matter of <em>not</em> having to make many choices or strive too much thanks to being born with the status of an independent person. Over time, however, choice became a means of achieving the liberty to shape one’s life as one saw fit. It also became a key signifier of being a full-fledged, autonomous person worthy of respect by others. Since the end of the Second World War, we might say that it has become a value unto itself, widely celebrated from billboards to international human rights decrees as the meeting point of capitalism and democracy. When then French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said, in 2016, ‘I believe deeply in a society governed by choice,’ he was in a certain sense uttering what had become a banality.</p>
<p><span>T</span>his is a story that has not been told before, even as some of the details may feel familiar from lived experience. It is also an essential story to grapple with if we want to try to understand what has been gained and lost from an investment in choice as the defining feature of ‘free time’ as well as a basic understanding of freedom. How have people, individually and collectively, benefitted from this mushrooming of options and opportunities for choice – and how and when has choice led us astray? This is a question that behavioural economists and all others who take our current actions and investments as constants have largely failed to ask.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is easy to read this narrative as a tale of liberation. Take feminism. Women in Europe and its outposts got their first real taste of the modern form of choosing as shoppers for ribbons, fabrics and other sundries, as late-18th-century novels – and especially those written by and for women – make very clear. Certainly, both women and this new kind of value-neutral, preference-based choice-making were quickly tainted by association with each other; the <em>coquette </em>was a much-mocked figure of the 18th and <span>19th</span><span><sup> </sup></span><span>centuries,</span> a stereotype of a woman who relishes her own choices a little too much and isn’t very good at them either. But as new forms of individualised selection became more important to life beyond the textile purveyor’s shop, and as men got in on the game as well, an expanded repertoire of choice, including in ideas, reading matter, marriage, children, career and finally politics, became one of the key aspirations for women looking to break free of their traditional constraints.</p>
<p>Female suffrage, for example, could be advocated at the start of the <span>20th century</span> as simply an extension of women’s already existing capacity to make a selection from a list-like menu. By the start of the 1960s, the American feminist Betty Friedan could argue that women’s full liberation required them to follow their male counterparts in seizing ‘the power to choose’ in their personal lives too, including in forging ‘an identity’ beyond housewife. And a decade later, mainstream abortion rights advocates, not surprisingly, took the same tack, imagining limited resistance to a focus on choice. Who, after all, could object? Behind the 1970s feminist idea of ‘a right to choice’ when it came to motherhood was the argument that no one should be compelled to pick this solution – abortion – for themselves; the law now simply ensured that everybody could, as needed, determine which of the possibilities on offer seemed like the best option by their own criteria. Plus, having choices meant the essential opportunity to reassert one’s standing as author of one’s own destiny – a point sometimes made by stateless people today as well. No wonder the ability to choose has become a key factor in global happiness indexes.</p>
<p>A market model for governance would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we <span>know it</span></p>
<p>But the abortion debate of the 1970s also illustrates some of the limitations of this framing. Soon after the passage of the <em>Roe v Wade </em>US Supreme Court Ruling legalising abortion in the early months of pregnancy, an emerging Right-wing coalition landed on a clever strategy for opposition, arguing that the ‘life’ of the fetus outweighed mere ‘choice’ on the part of the mother. In other words, in feminists’ enthusiasm for having choices, the moral dimension of what was being chosen had been pushed to the side, leaving behind a very thin foundation for a major policy matter. And from the Left, and especially from Black feminists, came the argument that choice itself was meaningless, an empty promise, unless it was to be accompanied by a commitment to meeting women’s basic needs, whether that meant the money necessary to travel and pay for an abortion, or greater financial and institutional support for mothers after their children were born. In this sense, they too warned of the dangers of the shopper and shopping as models for all our activities, even when couched as rights.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing some of the fallout of this debate writ large. Today, a far-Right ‘dark enlightenment’ movement imagines a market model for everything, including governance, which would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it. At the same time, significant pushback around the world against feminism, and now against gay and trans rights as well, has become emblematic of the rejection of a larger vision of freedom rooted in personal choice. As a result of democracy-promotion and global capitalism, almost no one in the world currently stands entirely outside the choice-as-freedom paradigm; it has gradually enveloped even those with very limited ability or opportunity to choose or with only rotten choices before them. Voting, for example, is near universal today even in places like Russia, where it is a sham. But an emphasis on choice as a form of liberation has occasioned serious resentments in different sectors and geographies, where it can seem a direct threat to other, more communal values and needs.</p>
<p>Indeed, even in democracies, choice can sometimes seem to be not only an illusion (is there any real difference between the scores of toothpastes or breakfast cereals in contemporary supermarkets?) or a headache to contend with, but a regressive force. Think, for example, of people who took up the pro-abortion rights phrase ‘My body, my choice’ to protest mask or vaccine mandates during the <span>COVID-19</span> pandemic, even as they were told that the point of both actions was to limit the spread of the disease and advance public health more broadly. Or consider how the US president Donald Trump’s current claims to be restoring the American people’s ‘freedom to choose’ in the market for cars and appliances will require gutting environmental regulations and thus advancing climate change in ways that will negatively impact all of us. It’s not just that we don’t always know our minds. It’s that choice in its current incarnation isn’t, in fact, always freeing.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? The answer is not with one or the other of these visions. But considering the history of choice should make us more self-conscious the next time we are fretting over whether to pick the oat milk rather than the half-and-half, not to mention one train ticket or candidate for office or college course over another. We might instead ask ourselves: when, collectively, should we be invested in individual choice as a good way to solve a shared problem, and when not? And when should I, as an individual, try to maximise the opportunity to make choices about my own life versus not doing so? Most of all, though – as we struggle with both choice overload and the failures of personal choice to help us solve some of our biggest problems, including the rise of forms of authoritarianism directed squarely against choice – thinking about our attachment to choosing off menus should make us wonder what other possibilities for defining freedom might be lurking out there. In the past, for example, freedom has sometimes been imagined as a release from oppression or as an act of pure imagination, alternative visions we might want to bring back into circulation. As it turns out, choice doesn’t always produce freedom, and freedom itself often looks very different.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Now, experts don't actually know how to control superhuman AI (yet),

          not sure what the future holds if we can't work that out in time. It

<p>On a scorching Texas afternoon, some Houston neighborhoods heat up far faster than others. New research from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&amp;M University</a> shows vacant and abandoned land is a big reason why.</p>



<p>A new study led by Dr. Dingding Ren, a lecturer in the <a href="https://www.arch.tamu.edu/laup/">Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning</a>, finds that vacant lots with vegetation can help cool surrounding areas. Abandoned buildings and paved lots do the opposite, raising land surface temperatures by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>



<p>Ren said many low-income residents run their air conditioning less to save money, leaving them even more exposed to the heat.</p>



<p>“Residents living in these vulnerable areas are more likely to suffer heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses,” Ren said. “Because of more vacant land and abandoned structures, [these neighborhoods] retain more heat during the daytime and even experience higher overall temperatures at night, because the concrete absorbs heat and releases it slowly.”</p>



<h2><strong>Drone data reveals hotspots</strong></h2>



<p>Houston ranks among the top 10 hottest cities in the U.S., and Ren set out to understand why.</p>



<p>Using more than 1,400 drone images and NASA satellite LandSat data, he mapped heat at a street-by-street level across seven sites, including residential neighborhoods, commercial strips and industrial zones. Each location had patterns of both above-average land surface temperatures and high social vulnerability, a measure for communities most at risk during disasters.</p>

Hot areas appear in red and orange, cooler areas in blue and purple."><figcaption>A map of a residential site reveals how the abundance of trees and open lots helps keep the neighborhood cool and comfortable, even with some abandoned buildings. </figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>“The type of surface on vacant land matters significantly,” Ren said. “Lots with bare soil or gravel tend to have higher land surface temperatures than those covered with vegetation, though lower than heavily built-up areas.”</p>



<p>Houston alone contains roughly 45,000 acres of vacant land and 10,000 acres of abandoned buildings, according to the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even a small cluster of abandoned structures in industrial areas can raise nearby land temperature dramatically.</p>



<h2><strong>Walking into danger</strong></h2>



<p>Higher surface temperatures can make public spaces, like sidewalks and bus stops, dangerously hot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Houston is famous as an unwalkable city,” Ren said. “Low-income people are sometimes forced to walk or bike in this extreme heat with zero shading, and over time, being exposed like this every summer is not healthy.”</p>



<p>Ren shared his own experience trying to navigate Houston. “Google Maps said it was a five-minute walk from my hotel to a pharmacy, but it took me 30 minutes with no shade, no red lights and no safe place to cross,” Ren said. “That day, I even got heat stroke.”</p>



<p>Ren said heat absorbed by concrete and rooftops lingers into the night, raising risks of heat-related illness while forcing households to spend more on cooling. The city’s power grid feels the strain too, as residents rely heavily on air conditioning to stay safe.</p>



<h2><strong>Green space solutions</strong></h2>



<p>While the findings reveal serious public health risks, Ren said small-scale interventions could make a measurable difference for vulnerable residents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Low-income communities lack trees and green space,” Ren said. “Green infrastructure would really help reduce their risk and also encourage healthier, more active living.”</p>



<p>Vacant lots can also serve as a climate adaptation tool, making the outdoors safer. “If managed effectively, it can be redeveloped as green infrastructure gardens or shade areas to reduce the urban heat.”</p>



<p>Ren plans to expand the research by combining his heat data with CDC health records. He is co-authoring the paper with Jiang Zheng, a doctoral student in <a href="https://www.arch.tamu.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ph-d-in-urban-regional-sciences/">urban and regional sciences</a>, to study how heat exposure contributes to illness.</p>



<p>He hopes the findings will guide city leaders and planners in prioritizing cooling strategies for Houston’s hottest, most vulnerable neighborhoods. Ren said its lessons may extend beyond Houston, too.</p>



<p>“If the problem presents even in <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/vintage-2024-popest.html">one of the fastest-growing cities,</a> then the situation could be worse in shrinking cities,” where there may be even more vacant lots, Ren said.</p>

Inspired by <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">WTF Happened in 1971</a> I wanted to make a website detailing many charts that show something weird is happening.
</p>

<p>
Beginning around the late 2000s and accelerating through the 2010s, a series of troubling trends emerged. Measures of well-being, including happiness and life satisfaction, began to show signs of strain. Youth mental health entered a state of crisis, with rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm rising to unprecedented levels. Concurrently, metrics of cognitive performance and academic achievement, such as international test scores and measures of fluid intelligence, appeared to stagnate or decline after decades of progress. Labour productivity growth, a cornerstone of economic prosperity, slowed to a crawl.
</p>

<p>
We had many major events in that time including the Great Recession and COVID-19 that had an large impact, but my hypothesis is that the introduction of the iPhone, and thus the modern mobile age is causing a huge impact on attention and is limiting life outcomes of millions around the globe.
</p>

<p>
This is not an attempt to say these trends are monocausal - it is worth remembering that Correlation != Causation - but it is at the very minimum interesting that the charts seem to line up around 2007, and increase in magnitude of upward or downward slope as adoption of smartphones increase.
</p>

Survey data consistently identifies young adults as the demographic most acutely affected by loneliness. One comprehensive survey found that 61% of young adults in the U.S. aged 18 to 25 identified as "seriously lonely". Globally, the figures are similarly high, with one study finding that 27% of young adults aged 19 to 29 experience feelings of loneliness. When compared generationally, the contrast is stark. One report found that 80% of Generation Z individuals (born roughly 1997-2012) reported feelings of isolation over the past year, significantly higher than the 72% of Millennials and 45% of Baby Boomers who said the same

Economic productivity, specifically labour productivity (output per hour worked), is the primary driver of long-term improvements in living standards.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2>Déjà Tune</h2>
<p>Most of my reading this week focused on fine-tuning, sparked by Thinking Machines Labs’ <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/announcing-tinker/">announcement of Tinker</a>. The six-month-old, already $12B-valued startup founded by OpenAI’s former CTO Mira Murati wants to bring fine-tuning back into the spotlight with a new fine-tuning-as-a-platform initiative positioned as a foundation for research collaborations with universities.</p>
<p>A few days later, Clément Delangue from Hugging Face <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clementdelangue_am-i-wrong-in-sensing-a-paradigm-shift-in-activity-7383908410167152640-rOEi/">posted</a> that he sensed a paradigm shift toward self-managed, open-source, and specialized LLM deployments, even backed by dedicated hardware like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/">NVIDIA’s DGX Spark</a>, many conversations with founders about growing client demand, or the <a href="https://a16z.com/building-a16zs-personal-ai-workstation-with-four-nvidia-rtx-6000-pro-blackwell-max-q-gpus/">Personal AI Workstation</a>, a very clever marketing stunt from a16z (I’m jealous).</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucfU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220237f8-8aa7-4d59-9024-6a1630e9d5e9_1600x1165.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All of this feels like a déjà vu. For a brief moment after the first wave of large language models, fine-tuning was the hottest topic in machine learning. Then, just as quickly, it disappeared from most production systems, now accounting for <a href="https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/">less than 10% of AI inference workloads</a>.</p>
<p>So, how did fine-tuning get sidelined so fast, and why do we feel it could be time for a come-back? And more importantly, what could be different this time?</p>
<h2>Attention, Please</h2>
<p>Before the Transformer breakthrough, the spark that led to the LLMs we use today, NLP relied on specialized models. Early progress came from recurrent architectures like <a href="https://aditi-mittal.medium.com/understanding-rnn-and-lstm-f7cdf6dfc14e">RNNs and LSTMs</a>, which for the first time learned directly from word sequences instead of relying on hand‑crafted linguistic features. A step forward in representations, but without any learning paradigm that would define later foundation models. Each application required to start from scratch on task-specific data.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mfeN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F446a7a1b-e964-45b7-a60d-f27e18f5adb1_551x380.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2017, Google’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a> introduced the Transformer architecture, replacing recurrence and convolution with self‑attention alone. Seven months later, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFiT</a> demonstrated that a pretrained language model (at the time still based on LSTMs) could be fine‑tuned for different tasks, and helped establish the methodological foundation that made Transformers practically useful. And a year later, models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and GPT‑1 <a href="https://ravjot03.medium.com/bert-vs-gpt-a-guide-to-two-powerful-language-models-b14502438065">applied the design in practice</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bvz0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed45b2db-a685-4654-9058-283092ae75b8_1400x831.png" alt=""></p>
<p>BERT leveraged the encoder side with bidirectional attention for understanding, while GPT used the decoder side with unilateral attention for generation, beautifully illustrated in <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/"><em>The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and Co</em></a> and <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/"><em>The Illustrated GPT-2</em></a>, two readings recommended by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdeltheil/">Cédric Deltheil</a> (<a href="https://finegrain.ai/">Finegrain</a>).</p>
<p>BERT in particular reshaped the culture of NLP: instead of building every model from scratch, researchers could “just fine-tune” a pretrained Transformer and achieve results that once required months of manual feature engineering.</p>
<p>Everything was fine until LLM madness turned into a full-blown parameter explosion, with models jumping from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters (and then some). Fine-tuning was no longer a smart idea. What had once been a few GPU-hours task quickly became a massive industrial operation and raised serious deployment challenges. This practice, called Full Fine-Tuning (FFT), meant retraining every layer and every weight. It offered precision but at a brutal cost.</p>
<p>Then, in 2021, Microsoft Research introduced LoRA (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685%5D"><em>Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</em></a>). Instead of retraining billions of parameters, LoRA freezes the original weights and adds small low-rank matrices to selected layers. Only these are trained, cutting costs by an order of magnitude while maintaining (and sometimes even improving) FFT performance. Unsurprisingly, LoRA became the default. And by 2024, thanks to <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index">Hugging Face’s PEFT library</a>, implementing it was a one-line command.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Yp0-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fea19c5-e989-40d7-84b5-bb349644520b_1456x612.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Finding The Right Tune</h2>
<p>A surface-level simplicity masking an ugly truth: fine-tuning is more than a package to deploy and maintain. The tuning itself is where the real magic happens, and it is never a one-config-fits-all process. Generally speaking, this <a href="https://symbl.ai/developers/blog/a-guide-to-llm-hyperparameters/">hyperparameter tuning</a> alone can make or break a model. The critical process feels more like alchemy than science, balancing ranks, learning rates, and alpha ratios while hoping your adapters don’t overfit or forget what the model already knows (a phenomenon called <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05175v1">catastrophic forgetting</a>). And when you finally get something that works, evaluating it feels less like validation and more like divination.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rtoz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37684f0c-2a81-47d2-aa66-8320af9d527d_430x303.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Meanwhile, LLMs kept getting better at nearly every task, approaching something close to omniscience. Writing a leasing contract? A whole chapter on the Industrial Economy in Rural Britain in the nineteenth century? A movie script? A REST API or a website for your mom? By 2023, most teams realized they could achieve about 90% of fine-tuned performance through prompt engineering, thanks to larger context windows, or RAG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a>, which gives the model access to an external knowledge base). Both approaches required no retraining and came with far less operational burden for quite decent results.</p>
<h2>Tuning Back In</h2>
<p>But why does fine-tuning seem to be gaining fans again? Maybe because the very factors that once made it irrelevant or inefficient are now, piece by piece, being solved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GPU-as-a-service platforms such as <a href="http://together.ai/">Together.ai</a> allow you to spin up a LoRA fine-tuning pipeline with minimal friction and in many cases in minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While new models still come fast, the changes are now more evolutionary than revolutionary. That shift means tuning a model today is less likely to be totally invalidated tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open-weight ecosystems like Mistral, Llama, Falcon, Yi, and Gemma offer a lot of alternatives for organizations to own, inspect, and persist their fine-tuned variants without vendor lock-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, companies may have reached the ceiling of what can be achieved with prompting alone. Some want models that know their vocabulary, their tone, their taxonomy, and their compliance rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those reasons, fine-tuning is slowly dipping its toes back into the spotlight, not as a trendy feature this time, but as a strategic lever for control, differentiation, and embedded intelligence.</p>
<p>Thinking Machines Lab’s Tinker, which focuses on theorem proving, chemistry reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and AI safety, embodies this shift. And they have already made several recommendations shared in their blog post <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/"><em>LoRA Without Regret</em></a>, which explores how to fine-tune more effectively.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vHdd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05bf9ca8-833f-4e2d-a11f-a6b63829a633_900x600.png" alt=""></p>
<p>They recommend applying LoRA to all linear modules, not just attention layers as in the original paper. They also emphasize the importance of LoRA rank, a hyperparameter often overlooked, and advise setting higher learning rates (at least 10x), smaller batch sizes (the opposite of common practice), and defining reward functions explicitly with mathematical or logical verification. All these recommendations are clearly explained and reproducible on <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/lora_without_regret">Hugging Face’s TRL</a>.</p>
<p>This is great for tuning, but maybe Tinker’s major contribution to fine-tuning is elsewhere.</p>
<h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>As expected, the modern fine-tuning pipeline looks nothing like what we used five years ago. It is modular, serverless, and orchestrated. A single deployment can run a base model alongside dozens of LoRA adapters, each representing a specific tone, function, or domain. During inference, the system routes queries to the right combination of adapters instead of relying on a static model file.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l1I-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78b829a9-a666-4228-b058-ddf8ad133ebe_1468x974.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Such modularity introduces its own challenges. All-in-one platforms like <a href="http://together.ai/">Together.ai</a> handle most of the heavy lifting, but they often lack the granularity many teams need for fine-grained configuration and observability, and costs at scale can escalate quickly.</p>
<p>On paper, Tinker seems to offer the best of both worlds: the comfort of a modern, fully managed fine-tuning stack combined with fine-grained control for researchers. It provides direct API <a href="https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/losses">access to low-level training primitives</a>, allowing users to orchestrate training workflows and custom algorithms at the deepest level while taking care of the grunt work. Hopefully this will inspire other platforms, since Tinker is currently reserved for research purposes.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h8Bt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5331bbd8-bf94-4772-83b9-65ef063f1245_1326x1430.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway, as imperfect as they are, infrastructure challenges are becoming problems of the past. Yet one major difficulty remains: evaluation.</p>
<p>Models are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Human evaluation is inconsistent, slow and more importantly expensive, while benchmarks age quickly and lose relevance with data contamination. Even automated approaches such as <a href="https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/g-eval-the-definitive-guide">G-Eval</a> or <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/">Chatbot Arena</a> introduce their own problems, often amplifying bias and producing unstable scores.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Tinker, Benjamin Anderson suggested they might have part of the solution. As he wrote in “<a href="https://benanderson.work/blog/anatomy-of-finetuning-api"><em>Anatomy of a Modern Fine-Tuning API</em></a>” on his blog, “<em>It gives the user the power to do online reinforcement learning: take a completion from the current model weights, score that completion, and update the model based on whether that completion was good or bad. Supervised fine-tuning teaches the model to mimic pre-written responses, while online RL improves it by scoring its own responses.</em>” Therefore, with such architectures, the future of fine-tuning may not look like fine-tuning at all: it starts to resemble continuous learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ilw9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1314b3c5-cc3e-4863-a96a-d60d478199dd_1600x603.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>A Very Different Tune</h2>
<p>“<em>Theoretically, fine-tuning has always made sense. But the speed at which closed-source labs were scaling their model intelligence made it a practically bad bet. Now, with compute, data, and better frameworks, the scales are tipping back toward specialization</em>.” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhommes/">Robert Hommes</a> from <a href="https://www.moyai.ai/">Moyai.ai</a>, a company specialized in adaptive fine-tuning.</p>
<p>And regarding the shift to self-hosting, this could go even closer to you than you might think. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/constant-razel/">Constant Razel</a> from <a href="https://withexxa.com/">Exxa</a> put it, “<em>Personal AI computers are no longer a distant idea. Technology is improving and becoming more accessible. Security and cost will likely drive early adoption, while fine-tuning will enable specialized, high-performance agents to run on them.</em>”</p>
<p>From a brute-force chase for marginal accuracy to a framework for ownership, alignment, and continuous improvement rooted in proximity and control, fine-tuning might have found a new territory to thrive. It is no longer just a technical step but perhaps a strategic layer in how intelligence will be built and owned.</p>
