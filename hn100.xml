									<p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has uncovered several intriguing revelations. The latest revelation raises serious questions as to whether or not Tesla values its drivers’ privacy.</p>
<p>In his book, Isaacson shows how Musk wanted to spy on drivers to defend Tesla from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Musk insisted on using the internal monitoring camera in Tesla vehicles to record drivers’ behaviors behind the wheel. This driver behavior was to be used as evidence to safeguard the company during investigations following accidents. By recording driver behavior, Musk could argue that driver error led to the accidents rather than Tesla technology.</p>
<p>While most car manufacturers employ internal cameras to monitor driver attentiveness and issue warnings, Musk envisioned Tesla taking it a step further. The book highlights Musk’s push to collect data from the car’s cameras, including the one focused on the driver, to establish instances of driver error. Drivers were not to be informed about the monitoring.</p>
<p>However, during a meeting, a Tesla manager raised concerns regarding privacy. The manager pointed out that Musk’s driver monitoring technology would not be able to link the recorded footage to specific vehicles, even in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>Musk ignored the manager’s concerns. However, he did back down somewhat on his idea to spy on drivers without their consent.</p>
<p>Musk proposed a pop-up message, informing customers that data would be collected if they used the Full Self-Driving Beta feature. This placated the manager.</p>
<p>The pop-up exists in current Tesla vehicles and explains how the company plans to use data from the internal camera. Drivers are given the choice to agree or disagree with Tesla collecting cabin camera data.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Tesla has not yet used internal vehicle images in legal disputes or investigations relating to the Autopilot system.</p>
<p>Even with Tesla’s use of pop-up messages, there continues to be numerous privacy complaints against the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/687228/musk-wanted-use-tesla-in-car-video-win-lawsuits-biography/">According to InsideEVs</a>, Tesla is currently facing multiple class action lawsuits regarding video privacy. In one lawsuit, plaintiffs are alleging that groups of Tesla employees privately shared highly invasive videos captured by customers’ car cameras between 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit in Illinois specifically focuses on privacy violations involving the cabin camera.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441">JEP 441</a> Pattern
Matching for switch<a href="#441" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for
<code>switch</code> expressions and statements. Extending pattern
matching to <code>switch</code> allows an expression to be tested
against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that
complex data-oriented queries can be expressed concisely and

Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)<a href="#442" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with
code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking
foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely
accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the
API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process
native data without the brittleness and danger of JNI. This is a

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444">JEP 444</a> Virtual
Threads<a href="#444" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>virtual threads</em> to the Java Platform. Virtual
threads are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort
of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent
applications.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">JEP 445</a> Unnamed
Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)<a href="#445" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Evolve the Java language so that students can write their first
programs without needing to understand language features designed
for large programs. Far from using a separate dialect of Java,
students can write streamlined declarations for single-class
programs and then seamlessly expand their programs to use more
advanced features as their skills grow. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview language feature</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446">JEP 446</a> Scoped
Values (Preview)<a href="#446" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>scoped values</em>, values that may be safely and
efficiently shared to methods without using method parameters. They
are preferred to thread-local variables, especially when using
large numbers of virtual threads. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, a scoped value is an <em>implicit method
parameter</em>. It is "as if" every method in a sequence of calls
has an additional, invisible, parameter. None of the methods
declare this parameter and only the methods that have access to the
scoped value object can access its value (the data). Scoped values
make it possible to pass data securely from a caller to a faraway
callee through a sequence of intermediate methods that do not
declare a parameter for the data and have no access to the
data.</p>

compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU
architectures, thus achieving performance superior to equivalent
scalar computations.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a> Prepare to
Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents<a href="#451" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Issue warnings when agents are loaded dynamically into a running
JVM. These warnings aim to prepare users for a future release which
disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default in order to
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968">improve integrity by
default</a>. Serviceability tools that load agents at startup will
not cause warnings to be issued in any release.</p>

Encapsulation Mechanism API<a href="#452" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), an
encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public key
cryptography.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453">JEP 453</a> Structured
Concurrency (Preview)<a href="#453" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>

<section>core-libs/java.net</section>
<section>
<p>The following methods have been added to the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>void close()</code>: closes the client gracefully,
waiting for submitted requests to complete.</li>
<li><code>void shutdown()</code>: initiates a graceful shutdown,
then returns immediately without waiting for the client to
terminate.</li>
<li><code>void shutdownNow()</code>: initiates an immediate
shutdown, trying to interrupt active operations, and returns
immediately without waiting for the client to terminate.</li>
<li><code>boolean awaitTermination(Duration duration)</code>, waits
for the client to terminate, within the given duration; returns
true if the client is terminated, false otherwise.</li>
<li><code>boolean isTerminated()</code>: returns true if the client
is terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instances returned by
<code>HttpClient.newHttpClient()</code>, and the instances built
from <code>HttpClient.newBuilder()</code>, provide a best effort
implementation for these methods. They allow the reclamation of
resources allocated by the <code>HttpClient</code> early, without
waiting for its garbage collection.</p>
<p>Note that an <code>HttpClient</code> instance typically manages
its own pools of connections, which it may then reuse when
necessary. Connection pools are typically not shared between
<code>HttpClient</code> instances. Creating a new client for each
operation, though possible, will usually prevent reusing such
connections.</p>

<h3>Sequenced Collections <span>( <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8280836" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-libs/java.util:collections</section>
<section>
<p>The Sequenced Collection API introduces several new interfaces
into the collections framework, providing enhancements to many
existing collections classes. The new API facilitates access to
elements at each end of a sequenced collection, and provides the
ability to view and iterate such collections in reverse order. See
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a> for additional
information.</p>
<p>The introduction of new collections interfaces, along with
default methods, introduces some compatibility risk, including the
possibility of both source and binary incompatibilities. The
introduction of default methods in an interface hierarchy may cause
conflicts with methods declared on existing classes or interfaces
that extend collections interfaces - this could result in either
source or binary incompatibilities. The introduction of new
interfaces also introduces new types into the system, which can
change the results of type inference, leading in turn to source
incompatibilities.</p>
<p>For a discussion of potential incompatibilities and possible
ways to mitigate them, please see the document <a href="https://inside.java/2023/05/12/quality-heads-up/">JDK 21:
Sequenced Collections Incompatibilities</a>.</p>

<h3>Warning Printed when an Agent Is Loaded into a Running VM
<span>( <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8307478" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-svc/tools</section>
<section>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) now prints a warning to standard
error when a JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent or Java Agent is
dynamically loaded into a running JVM. The warning is intended to
prepare for a future release that disallows, by default, dynamic
loading of agent code into a running JVM.</p>
<p>Agents are programs that run in the JVM process and make use of
powerful JVM TI or <code>java.lang.instrument</code> APIs. These
APIs are designed to support tooling such as profilers and
debuggers. Agents are started via a command line option, for
example <code>-agentlib</code> or <code>-javaagent</code>, or they
can be started into a running VM using the JDK specific
<code>com.sun.tools.attach</code> API or the <code>jcmd</code>
command. Agents loaded into a running VM will now print a warning.
There is no warning for agents that are loaded at startup via
command line options.</p>
<p>The HotSpot VM option <code>EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
controls dynamic loading of agents. This option has existed since
JDK 9. The default, since JDK 9, is to allow dynamic loading of
agents. Running with <code>-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code> on
the command line serves as an explicit "opt-in" that allows agent
code to be loaded into a running VM and thus suppresses the
warning. Running with <code>-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
disallows agent code from being loaded into a running VM and can be
used to test possible future behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, the system property
<code>jdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> can be used to trace uses of
the <code>java.lang.instrument</code> API. Running with
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> or
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage=true</code> causes usages of the
API to print a trace message and stack trace. This can be used to
identify agents that are dynamically loaded instead of being
started on the command line with <code>-javaagent</code>.</p>

<p>This feature delivers an enhanced syntax for properties related
to certificate, CRL, and OCSP connect and read timeouts. The new
syntax allows the timeout values to be specified either in seconds
or milliseconds. This feature also delivers three new System
properties related to connect and read timeouts.</p>
<p><em>New properties</em>: The existing
<code>com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout</code> property will now be
paired with the new <code>com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout</code>
property. The former property will be used to set timeouts for the
transport-layer connection while the latter will be used to manage
timeouts for reading the data. The new
<code>com.sun.security.cert.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.cert.readtimeout</code> properties will be
used to control connect and read timeouts, respectively, when
following an X.509 certificate's AuthorityInfoAccess extension. For
the certificate fetching properties, the
<code>com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers</code> property must be
set to <code>true</code> in order for fetching to occur and these
property timeouts to be enabled.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced timeout syntax</em>: The new syntax applies to the
aforementioned properties, and also to the
<code>com.sun.security.crl.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.crl.readtimeout</code> properties as well.
The allowed syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decimal integer will be interpreted in seconds and ensures
backward compatibility.</li>
<li>A decimal integer ending in "s" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will also be interpreted in seconds.</li>
<li>A decimal integer value with "ms" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will be interpreted as milliseconds. For
example, a value of "2500ms" will be a 2.5 second timeout.</li>
<li>Negative, non-numeric, or non-decimal (for example, hexadecimal
values prepended by "0x") values will be interpreted as illegal and
will default to the 15 second timeout.</li>
<li>Whether the value is interpreted in seconds or milliseconds, a
value of zero will disable the timeout.</li>

the <code>here()</code> function in new signatures and replacing
existing signatures that use the <code>here()</code> function.
Future versions of the JDK will likely disable, and eventually
remove, support for this function, as it cannot be supported using
the standard Java XPath API. Users can now disable the
<code>here()</code> function by setting the security property
<code>jdk.xml.dsig.hereFunctionSupported</code> to "false".</p>

<p>Some older, user-defined class loaders would workaround a
deadlock issue by releasing the class loader lock during the
loading process. To prevent these loaders from encountering a
<code>java.lang.LinkageError: attempted duplicate class
definition</code> while loading the same class by parallel threads,
the HotSpot Virtual Machine introduced a workaround in JDK 6 that
serialized the load attempts, causing the subsequent attempts to
wait for the first to complete.</p>
<p>The need for class loaders to work this way was removed in JDK 7
when parallel-capable class loaders were introduced, but the
workaround remained in the VM. The workaround was deprecated in JDK
20 and the option <code>-XX:+EnableWaitForParallelLoad</code> was
introduced for users who relied on this legacy behavior. The
default for this option was off.</p>
<p>In JDK 21, the option

<section>core-libs/java.lang</section>
<section>
<p>Since JDK 13, executing commands in a sub-process uses the
so-called <code>POSIX_SPAWN</code> launching mechanism (that is,
<code>-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=POSIX_SPAWN</code>) by
default on Linux. In cases where the parent JVM process terminates
abnormally before the handshake between the JVM and the newly
created <code>jspawnhelper</code> process has completed,
<code>jspawnhelper</code> can hang indefinitely in JDK 13 to JDK
20. This issue is fixed in JDK 21. The issue was especially harmful
if the parent process had open sockets, because in that case, the
forked <code>jspawnhelper</code> process will inherit them and keep
all the corresponding ports open, effectively preventing other
processes from binding to them.</p>
<p>This misbehavior has been observed with applications which
frequently fork child processes in environments with tight memory
constraints. In such cases, the OS can kill the JVM in the middle
of the forking process leading to the described issue. Restarting
the JVM process after such a crash will be impossible if the new
process tries to bind to the same ports as the initial application
because they will be blocked by the hanging
<code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.</p>
<p>The root cause of this issue is <code>jspawnhelper</code>'s
omission to close its writing end of the pipe, which is used for
the handshake with the parent JVM. It was fixed by closing the
writing end of the communication pipe before attempting to read
data from the parent process. This way, <code>jspawnhelper</code>
will reliably read an EOF event from the communication pipe and
terminate once the parent process dies prematurely.</p>
<p>A second variant of this issue could happen because the
handshaking code in the JDK didn't handle interrupts to
<code>write(2)</code> correctly. This could lead to incomplete
messages being sent to the <code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.
The result is a deadlock between the parent thread and the child
process which manifests itself in a <code>jspawnhelper</code>
process being blocked while reading from a pipe and the following
stack trace in the corresponding parent Java process:</p>
<pre><code>java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE

<section>
<p>Maintainers of applications that do network multicasting or use
the <code>java.net.NetworkInterface</code> API should note that the
names that the JDK assigns to network interfaces on Windows have
changed in this release. The JDK historically synthesized names for
network interfaces on Windows. This has changed to use the names
assigned by the Windows operating system. For example, the JDK may
have historically assigned a name such as “eth0” for an ethernet
interface and “lo” for the loopback. The equivalent names that
Windows assigns may be names such as “ethernet_32768” and
“loopback_0".</p>
<p>This change may impact code that does a lookup of network
interfaces with the <code>NetworkInterace.getByName(String
name)</code> method. It also may also be surprising to code that
enumerates all network interfaces with the
<code>NetworkInterfaces.networkInterfaces()</code> or
<code>NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()</code> methods as the
names of the network interfaces will look different to previous
releases. Depending on configuration, it is possible that
enumerating all network interfaces will enumerate network
interfaces that weren’t previously enumerated because they didn’t
have an Internet Protocol address assigned. The display name
returned by <code>NetworkInterface::getDisplayName</code> has not
changed so this should facilitate the identification of network
interfaces when using Windows native tools.</p>

locate the charset, even though it was never supported or
documented to change the value of this system property in these
releases. Since JDK 18, it is possible to set the system property
on the command line to the value <code>UTF-8</code> (the default)
or <code>COMPAT</code>. Setting it to any other value is not

<p>Starting with the July 2023 CPU, on operating systems where ASLR
(Address Space Layout Randomization) is enabled, the CDS archive
will be placed at a random address picked by the operating
system.</p>
<p>This change may have a minor performance impact: (a) Start-up
time may increase because the JVM needs to patch pointers inside
the CDS archive; (b) Memory usage may increase because the memory
used by the CDS archive is no longer shareable across processes. We
expect the impact to be small because such increases should be only
a small fraction of the overall application usage.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you must disable ASLR for CDS, you
can use the JVM flags <code>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:ArchiveRelocationMode=0</code>. The usage of such flags is not
recommended.</p>

<p>Annotation processing by <code>javac</code> is enabled by
default, including when no annotation processing configuration
options are present. Implicit annotation processing by default may
be disabled in a future release, possibly as early as JDK 22. To
alert <code>javac</code> users of this possibility, in JDK 21
<code>javac</code> prints a note if implicit annotation processing
is being used. The text of the note is:</p>
<pre><code>     Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were
    found on the class path. A future release of javac may disable
    annotation processing unless at least one processor is specified by
    name (-processor), or a search path is specified (--processor-path,
    --processor-module-path), or annotation processing is enabled
    explicitly (-proc:only, -proc:full).
    Use -Xlint:-options to suppress this message.
    Use -proc:none to disable annotation processing.
</code></pre>
<p>Good build hygiene includes explicitly configuring annotation
processing. To ease the transition to a different default policy in
the future, the new-in-JDK-21 <code>-proc:full javac</code> option
requests the current default behavior of looking for annotation
processors on the class path.</p>

JLS 9.6.4.1</a> specifies that annotations without an

<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler did not always
mark method parameters as <code>synthetic</code> or
<code>mandated</code> when applicable. Starting with JDK 21, the

attribute in the class file when applicable. This attribute stores
information on whether or not parameters are <code>synthetic</code>
or <code>mandated</code>. This change applies to all release and
target versions supported by <code>javac</code> since all currently
supported releases and targets have the
<code>MethodParameters</code> attribute defined.</p>
<p>This change is justified by JLS § 13.1, in particular:</p>
<pre><code>A binary representation for a class or interface must also contain all of the following: 

[...]

11. A construct emitted by a Java compiler must be marked as synthetic if it does not
    correspond to a construct declared explicitly or implicitly in source code, unless
    the emitted construct is a class initialization method (JVMS §2.9).
12. A construct emitted by a Java compiler must be marked as mandated if it corresponds
    to a formal parameter declared implicitly in source code (§8.8.1, §8.8.9, §8.9.3,
    §15.9.5.1).

<h3>Detection for Output File Clashes <span>(<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8296656">JDK-8296656</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8296656" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>A new compiler lint flag, <code>output-file-clash</code>,
enables detection of output file clashes. An output file clash is
when the compiler intends to write two different output files, but
due to the behavior of the operating system, these files end up
being written to the same underlying file.</p>
<p>This usually happens due to case-insensitive file systems. For
example, a class like this would cause two class files to be
written to the same file, <code>Test$Inner.class</code>:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    class Inner {
    }
    class INNER {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this problem can also happen when the file system
"normalizes" file names. For example, on macOS, compiling this
class will generate such a clash:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    interface Cafeu0301 {
    }
    interface Cafu00e9 {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>u0301</code> is the Unicode character
"Combining Acute Accent" which means "add an accent over the
previous character". MacOS normalizes the letter <code>e</code>
followed by a <code>u0301</code> into a Unicode <code>u00e9</code>,
that is, <code>é</code>. However, the Java language treats these
the two names, <code>Cafeu0301</code> and <code>Cafu00e9</code>, as
distinct.</p>
<p>Compiling the example above on macOS with
<code>-Xlint:output-file-clash</code> will now generate a warning
like this:</p>
<pre><code>    warning: [output-file-clash] output file written more than once: /home/test/Test$Café.class

<section>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler was omitting
some "potentially ambiguous overload" warnings enabled by the
<code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option.</p>
<p>If the <code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option is enabled, the
compiler warns when the methods in a class create a potential
ambiguity for method invocations containing an implicit lambda
expression parameter like <code>x -&gt; { ... }</code>. An
ambiguity can occur if two or more methods could match such a
method call, like when one method takes a
<code>Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;</code> parameter where the other
takes an <code>IntConsumer</code>. For example, the
<code>javac</code> compiler should issue a warning for code such
as:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the warning was only issued for a class if one
of the methods was declared in the class. The <code>javac</code>
compiler now also warns when neither method is declared in the
class. That is, both methods are inherited from supertypes. For
example, for code like:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
    }

    interface J {
        void foo(IntConsumer c);

<pre>JDK 21, the reference implementation of Java 21, is now Generally
Available.  We shipped build 35 as the first and only Release Candidate
of JDK 21 on 11 August, and no P1 bugs have been reported since then.
Build 35 is therefore now the GA build, ready for production use.

GPL-licensed OpenJDK builds from Oracle are available here:

  <a href="https://jdk.java.net/21">https://jdk.java.net/21</a>

Builds from other vendors will no doubt be available soon.

This release includes fifteen JEPs [1], including the final versions of
Record Patterns (440), Pattern Matching for switch (441), and Virtual
Threads (444):

  430: String Templates (Preview)
  431: Sequenced Collections
  439: Generational ZGC
  440: Record Patterns
  441: Pattern Matching for switch
  442: Foreign Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)
  443: Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview)
  444: Virtual Threads
  445: Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)
  446: Scoped Values (Preview)
  448: Vector API (Sixth Incubator)
  449: Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 Port for Removal
  451: Prepare to Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents
  452: Key Encapsulation Mechanism API
  453: Structured Concurrency (Preview)

This release also includes, as usual, hundreds of smaller enhancements
and thousands of bug fixes.

JDK 21 will be a long-term-support (LTS) release from most vendors,
including Oracle.  If you’re upgrading from the previous LTS release,
JDK 17, then you have many more JEPs to look forward to, summarized
here:

  <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17">https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17</a>

Thank you to everyone who contributed this release, whether by designing
and implementing features or enhancements, by fixing bugs, or by
downloading and testing the early-access builds!

            <p>
              Recently at TigerBeetle,
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1157">we’ve decided</a>
              to use 128-bit integers to store all financial amounts and
              balances, retiring our previous use of 64-bit integers. While some
              may argue that a 64-bit integer, which can store integers ranging
              from zero to 2<sup>64</sup>, is enough to count the
              <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky">grains of sand on Earth</a>, we realized we need to go beyond this limit if we want to be
              able to store all kinds of transactions adequately. Let’s
              find out why.
            </p>
            <h2 id="how-do-we-represent-money">How do we represent money?</h2>
            <p>
              To represent numbers (and to be able to do math with them),
              computers need to encode this number in a binary system which,
              depending on the range and the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number#Classification">kind</a>
              of number, requires a certain amount of bits (each bit can be
              either 0 or 1). For example, integers (whole numbers) ranging from
              -128 to 127 can be represented with only 8 bits, but if we
              don’t need negative numbers, we can use the same bits to
              represent any integer from 0 to 255, and that’s a byte!
              Larger numbers require more bits, for example, 16-bit, 32-bit, and
              64-bit numbers are the most common.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that we are talking about money as whole
              numbers and not as decimal numbers or cents. Things get more
              complicated with fractional numbers, which can be encoded using
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating point</a>
              numbers. While binary floating point may be fine for other
              calculations, they
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_error_mitigation">cannot accurately express decimal numbers</a>. This is the same kind of problem that we humans have when we
              try to represent ⅓ in decimal as 0.33333…, computers have to
              represent ¹⁄₁₀ in binary!
            </p>

            <p><small>
              As “fractions of a penny” add up over time to a lot, floating
              point is a

              <br>
            </small></p><p>
              Therefore, in TigerBeetle, we don’t use fractional or
              decimal numbers, every
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/accounts#ledger">ledger</a>
              is expressed as multiples of a minimal
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/recipes/fractional-amounts">integer factor</a>
              defined by the user. For example, you can represent Dollars as a
              multiple of cents, and then a $1.00 transaction can be described
              as 100 cents. Even
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency">non-decimal currency systems</a>
              can be
              <a href="https://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/learning/learning-zone/going-decimal/old-money/">better represented</a>
              as a multiple of a common factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprisingly, we also don’t use negative numbers (you may
              have encountered software ledgers that store only a single
              positive/negative balance). Instead, we keep two separate strictly
              positive integer amounts:
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/design/data-modeling#debits-vs-credits">one for debits and another for credits</a>. This not only avoids the burden of dealing with negative
              numbers (such as the myriad of language-specific wraparound
              consequences of overflow… or underflow), but most of all
              preserves information by showing the volume of transactions with
              respect to ever-increasing balances for both the debit and credit
              sides. When you need to take the net balance, the two balances can
              be subtracted accordingly and the net displayed as a single
              positive or negative number.

              So, why do we need 128-bit integers?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Back to the example of representing $1.00 as 100 cents. In this
              case, 64-bit integers can count to something close to 184.5
              quadrillion dollars. While it may not be an issue for many people,
              the upper limit of a 64-bit integer becomes restrictive when there
              is a need to represent values smaller than a cent. Adding more
              decimal places
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/986">dramatically reduces</a>
              this range.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the same reason,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital currencies</a>
              are another use case for 128-bit balances, where again, the
              smallest quantity of money can be represented on the order of
              micro-cents (10<sup>-6</sup>)… or
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ether">even smaller</a>. Although it’s a compelling use case for TigerBeetle to support,
              we found a variety of other applications that also benefit from
              128-bit balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s think some more about scenarios where $0.01 is too big
              to represent the value of something.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in many countries, the price of a gallon/liter of
              gasoline requires three digits after the decimal point, and stock
              markets
              <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/subpenny612faq.htm">already require</a>
              pricing increments of hundredths of cents like 0.0001.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or, in an economy of high-frequency
              <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.micropaymentsimpactonnpaymentsecosystem202308~bb92cda8ce.en.pdf">micropayments</a>, greater precision and scale are also required. Sticking with
              64-bit values would impose artificial limits on real-world
              demands, or force applications to handle different scales of the
              same currency in separate ledgers, by painstakingly splitting
              amounts across multiple “Dollar” and
              “Micro-Dollar” accounts, only because a single 64-bit
              balance isn’t enough to cover the entire range of precision
              and scale required for many micropayments to represent a
              multi-billion Dollar deal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value of a database that can count well (and at scale) is also
              not limited to money. TigerBeetle is designed to count not only
              money, but anything that can be modeled using double-entry
              accounting. For instance, to count inventory items, the frequency
              of API calls, or even kilowatts of electricity. And none of those
              things need to behave like money or be constrained to the same
              limits.
            </p>
            <h2 id="future-proof-accounting">Future-proof accounting.</h2>
            <p>
              Another thing about the upper limits of amounts and balances, is
              that, while it may seem unlikely for a single transaction amount
              to exceed the order of magnitude of trillions or quadrillions,
              account balances accumulate over time. For long-running systems,
              it’s likely that an account could transact such volume over
              the years, and so then a single transfer must also be able to move
              this entire balance from one account to another. This was a gotcha
              we ran into, as we considered whether to move to 128-bit
              transaction amounts and/or only 128-bit account balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, even the most unexpected events such as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>
              can push a currency toward the upper limits of a 64-bit integer,
              requiring it to abandon the cents and cut the zeros that have no
              practical use.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We may not be able to intuit how big a 128-bit integer is. Not
              merely twice the 64-bit; it’s actually 2<sup>64</sup> times
              bigger! To put this in perspective, a 64-bit integer is not enough
              to handle that One Hundred Trillion Dollar bill if we encode our
              ledger at a micro-cent scale. However, using 128-bit integers we
              should be able to perform 1 million transfers per second of the
              same value for a thousand years and still not hit the account
              balance limit.

            <p>
              Modern processor architectures such as x86-64 and ARM64 can handle
              arithmetic operations involving 64-bit values, but, if we
              understand correctly, they don’t always have a specific
              instruction set for native 128-bit calculations. When dealing with
              128-bit operands, the task may have to be segmented into 64-bit
              portions that the CPU can execute. Consequently, we considered
              whether 128-bit arithmetic may be more demanding compared to the
              single-instruction execution possible with 64-bit integers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The table below compares the x86_64
              <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/oosed6j81">machine code generated</a>
              for 64-bit and 128-bit operands. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be
              an assembly expert to get the point! Just note that the compiler
              can optimize most operations into a sequence of trivial CPU
              instructions, such as
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/adc">carry sum</a> and
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sbb">borrowing subtraction</a>. This means that the cost overhead of using 128-bit amounts is
              not material for TigerBeetle.

              1. For simplicity, this assembly code omits the checked arithmetic
              bounds checks and panics that we
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WYdYyjek4">always enable for TigerBeetle</a>.<br>
              2. 128-bit division cannot be expressed as a sequence of 64-bit
              instructions and needs to be implemented
              <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/lib/builtins/udivmodti4.c">by software</a>.<br>
            </small></p><p>
              Something else we had to consider as part of this change were all
              our clients, since TigerBeetle needs to expose its API to many
              different programming languages that don’t always support
              128-bit integers. The mainstream languages
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle#clients">we provide clients for</a>, currently need to use arbitrary-precision integers (aka
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">BigInteger</a>) to do math with 128-bit integers. The sole exception is .Net
              which recently
              <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67151">added support for Int128 and UInt128 data types</a>
              in .Net 7.0 (kudos to the DotNet team!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing BigIntegers comes with additional overhead because they
              are not handled as fixed-size 128-bit values but are instead
              heap-allocated as variable-length byte arrays. Also, arithmetic
              operations are emulated by software during runtime, which means
              they can’t take much advantage of the optimizations that
              would be possible if the compiler knew the kind of number it’s
              dealing with. Hey,
              <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/">Java</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9455">Go</a>, and
              even
              <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-7-generic-math/#types-without-language-support">C#</a>, I’m looking at you.
            </p>
            <p>
              To mitigate this cost on the client side (and, of course, to stay
              true to our
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md#performance">TigerStyle</a>), we store and expose all 128-bit values (e.g. IDs, amounts,
              etc.) as just a pair of stack-allocated 64-bit integers (except
              for JavaScript, since it does not support 64-bit numbers either).
              Although the programming language has no knowledge of this raw
              type and can’t perform arithmetic operations on them, we
              offer a set of helper functions for converting between idiomatic
              alternatives existing in each ecosystem (e.g., BigInteger, byte
              array, UUID).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our API is designed to be non-intrusive, giving each application
              the freedom to choose between using BigIntegers or handling
              128-bit values through any third-party numerical library that
              makes the most sense. We want to provide excellent
              high-performance low-level primitives, as far as possible, with a
              minimum of “sugar”, without taking away from the
              freedom of the user at a higher layer.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              TigerBeetle is designed for a new era where financial transactions
              are more precise and more frequent. A new era that has already
              begun and is full of everyday-life examples that 64-bit balances
              ‘ought to be enough!’ for not much longer. To
              128-bit… and beyond!

<p>What the group’s members didn’t realize at the time, is that the plans they made would create a ripple effect that still has an impact decades later.</p>
<p>Like many other people mesmerized by the unbridled ability to share files over the Internet, the new BitTorrent protocol caught Piratbyrån’s eye. From one thing came another, and Piratbyrån decided to start their own tracker. </p>
<h2>A Swedish Torrent Tracker</h2>
<p>When this idea was first brought up isn’t clear, not even to the site’s founders, but at the end of 2003 The Pirate Bay was presented to the public. </p>
<p>“We have opened a BitTorrent tracker – The Pirate Bay. From there, you can download and share games, movies, discs, TV shows and more,” the short <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127001634/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=viewcomments&amp;type=news&amp;cid=62">announcement reads</a>, translated from Swedish.</p>
<center><strong>A New Torrent Tracker</strong></center><br><center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg" alt="tpb announcement" width="600" height="321" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20321'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg"></center>
<p>One of the group’s unwritten goals was to offer a counterweight to the propaganda being spread by local anti-piracy outfit Antipiratbyrån. The pro-culture group saw sharing as something positive instead, and a file-sharing website would surely bring this point across.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay first came online in Mexico where Gottfrid Svartholm, aka Anakata, hosted the site on a server owned by the company he was working for at the time.</p>
<p>After a few months, the site moved to Sweden where it was hosted on a Pentium III 1GHz laptop with 256MB RAM. This one machine, which belonged to Fredrik Neij, aka TiAMO, kept the site online and included a fully operational tracker. </p>
<p>This early setup was quite primitive, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/early-tpb.jpg">shown here</a>, and some of the hardware was later <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/first-pirate-bay-server-on-permanent-display-in-computer-museum-130110/">put on display</a> at the Computer Museum in Linköping.</p>
<center><strong>The Pirate Bay server</strong><br></center><center><img width="525" height="418" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg" alt="tpb classic" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20525%20418'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg"></center>
<p>Piratbyrån initially planned to create the first public file-sharing network in Sweden but, in the years that followed, the site grew out to become a global file-sharing icon.</p>
<p>While The Pirate Bay team was proud of this success, it was not without consequences. Initially, various takedown messages from copyright holders were met with mocking responses, but the legal pressure became a heavy burden. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the US Government applied <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-us-pushed-sweden-to-take-down-the-pirate-bay-171212/">pressure on Sweden</a>, urging the country do something about the taunting pirate site. At the same time, the site’s founders noticed that they were being shadowed by private investigators, who smelled blood. </p>
<h2>The Raid</h2>
<p>The pressure eventually reached its first peak when The Pirate Bay’s infrastructure was raided. </p>
<p>May 31, 2006, less than three years after The Pirate Bay was founded, 65 Swedish police officers <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/">entered a datacenter</a> in Stockholm. The policemen had instructions to shut down the Pirate Bay’s servers, and that’s exactly what they did.</p>
<center><strong>Footage from The Pirate Bay raid</strong><br></center><center></center>
<p>For most pirate sites the road would end there, but The Pirate Bay was no ordinary site, and it wasn’t planning to cave in just yet. </p>
<p>Shortly before the raid began, Gottfrid noticed some unusual activity. He warned Fredrik who, as a precaution, decided to make a backup. This turned out to be a pivotal moment in the site’s history. Because of this backup, Fredrik and the rest of the Pirate Bay team managed to resurrect the site within three days.</p>
<p>Instead of hiding in the shadows, Pirate Bay’s spokesperson Peter Sunde, aka Brokep, told the world that The Pirate Bay wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
<p>This swift and defiant comeback turned the site’s founders into heroes for many. The site made headline news around the world and in Stockholm, people were waving pirate flags in the streets, a sentiment that benefited the newly founded Pirate Party as well. </p>
<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
<p>There was also a major downside, however. The raid was the start of a criminal investigation, which led to a spectacular trial, and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founders-prison-sentences-final-supreme-court-appeal-rejected-120201/">prison sentences</a> for several of the site’s founders.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate Bay supporters at the first day in Court</strong><img width="475" height="344" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20475%20344'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg"></p>
<p>This became another turning point. Many of the early Piratbyrån members cut their ties with the site. Gottfrid, Fredrik and Peter also left the ship, which was handed over to a more anonymous group ostensibly located in the Seychelles. </p>
<p>The outspokenness of the early years eventually gave way to the silent treatment. While the site’s moderators are easy to reach nowadays, the people (Winston) who pull the strings at the top remain behind the scenes at all times. </p>
<p>This was made quite obvious when the site disappeared for weeks following another raid at a Stockholm datacenter <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/swedish-police-raid-the-pirate-bay-site-offline-141209/">in 2014</a>. At the time, even the site’s staffers had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay eventually recovered from this second raid too, but by then something had clearly changed. The torrent site now seems content with just being there. </p>
<p>Over the years the site simplified its setup by removing the tracker, introducing <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-dumps-torrents-120228/">magnet links</a>, and further decentralizing its setup. The ability to comment was also sacrificed at some point, and user registrations were closed for years, although there’s some <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-reopens-its-doors-to-new-members-after-four-years-230628/#:~:text=Manually%20Approved%20Registrations&amp;text=New%20Pirate%20Bay%20registrations%20are,accounts%20using%20a%20new%20tool.">progress on that front</a> now.</p>
<h2>The Mods and Admins</h2>
<p>Today’s manual user registrations are processed by a dedicated moderator team, which also ensures that the site remains free of spam and malware. This team of volunteers is separate from the site’s ‘operator’ and many have been in that role for over a decade.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Pirate Bay admin Spud17 posted a <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-The-Pirate-Bay-is-20-years-old-today">message</a> in the Pirate Bay forum to celebrate the 20th anniversary. </p>
<p>“Most of the current TPB Crew have been here for well over 10 years, many for much, much longer, and we’re proud to be associated with the world’s most iconic torrent site,” she notes. </p>
<p>“We volunteer our time freely to help keep the site clean, nuking the fakes and malware to kingdom come, and help edit/move/delete torrents as and when uploaders request help in the forum’s Account Issues subforum.”</p>
<h2>Crypto Miner and Token</h2>
<p>After two decades, TPB still manages to make headlines on occasion. For example, when yet another country orders Internet providers to block the site, or when it suddenly decides to ‘deploy’ its users to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-website-runs-a-cryptocurrency-miner-170916/">mine cryptocurrency</a>. </p>
<p>The last major project was announced in 2021 when The Pirate Bay released its very own <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-promotes-mysterious-piratetoken-tpb-210513/">‘crypto’ token</a> out of the blue. There was no official whitepaper for these PirateTokens, but the torrent site envisioned the ‘coin’ being used to access VIP content or donate to uploaders.</p>
<p>These plans never came to fruition and the token price soon entered a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-crypto-token-is-barely-alive-after-just-one-year-220515/">freefall</a>. After a few months, the official token announcement disappeared from the site as well, leaving token holders with worthless digital memorabilia.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay itself isn’t going anywhere it seems. The events listed above are really just a fraction of events spanning 20 extraordinary years. The question now is whether the site will survive until its 25th anniversary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Lichess is safe, because it is free of ads and trackers.</strong></p>

<p>But browsing the rest of the  Internet exposes us to the following threats:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Advertisement</strong> sells our screen estate and influences us</li>

<li><strong>Tracking</strong> sells our personal information to increase advertisement effectiveness</li>

</ul>

<p>These don't benefit us, the website users, in any way. In fact, they use a lot of our computing power and bandwidth against us.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are simple and legal ways to protect ourselves from these invasions.</p>

<h2>Protect your computer</h2>

<h3><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a></h3>

<p>Hands-down the best ad-blocking <strong>browser extension</strong>. It's free software (GPLv3), blazing fast, and will effectively block most malware. We heartily recommend that everyone installs it. uBlock is available for most browsers on Windows, MacOS and Linux. <strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Install it now!</a></strong></p>

<p>Note that other browser extensions, such as the popular "AdBlock", are unsafe: they have accepted money to expose you to some ads. Don't fall for it, just use uBlock Origin instead.</p>

<h3><a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS server that can block ads and trackers throughout the <strong>whole system</strong>. This includes video ads and ads in your favorite apps, browsers and games. It can be used as a replacement or, better, a complement of uBlock Origin.</p>

<p>It's very easy to set up, <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html#instruction">check out the instructions on the AdGuard website</a> on how to do this.</p>

<h3>Custom hosts file (advanced)</h3>

<p>An alternative to AdGuard for system-wide blocking is to directly manage your <em>hosts </em>file. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/readme.md">list of dangerous hosts to block</a>, with links to raw hosts files available. To modify your current&nbsp;hosts&nbsp;file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.</p>

<h4>Where to find your hosts file:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-a-Mac">mac OS</a> (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">Linux</a></strong>:&nbsp;/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong>macOS Catalina (10.15+):</strong>&nbsp;/private/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-Windows">Windows</a></strong>:&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>

</ul>

<h2>Protect your Android device</h2>

<h2>About blocking ads</h2>

<p>It's important to note that blocking ads is <strong>NOT </strong>theft. Don't fall for this creepy idea, which is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.</p>

<p>Ads and trackers violate our privacy, make websites much slower, and deliver dangerous malware. We say no to them.</p>

<p>We have the right to decide what we download from the Internet, what we send to it, and what we display on our screen.</p>

<p>We have the right to refuse downloading source code that works against us. It's our bandwidth and computer, and no-one can decide for us what to use them for.</p>

<p>A service that has valuable features should be able to sell us a subscription, without blackmailing us with ominous ads.</p></div></div>]]></description>

           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;Bard can now connect to your Google apps and services&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="10f21">One of the biggest benefits of <a href="https://bard.google.com/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bardseptglobalbrpost">Bard</a>, an experiment to collaborate with generative AI, is that it can tailor its responses to exactly what you need. For instance, you could ask Bard to start a trip planning Doc for you and your friends, draft up your online marketplace listing, or help explain a science topic to your kids. And now, Bard is getting even better at customizing its responses so you can easily bring your ideas to life.</p><p data-block-key="5hbk4">Today we’re rolling out Bard’s most capable model yet. Bard now integrates with Google apps and services for more helpful responses. We’ve also improved the “Google it” feature to double-check Bard’s answers and expanded features to more places.</p><h2 data-block-key="bj6re">Connect to Google apps and services</h2><p data-block-key="6mbo3">Today we’re launching <a href="https://youtu.be/lr87yrvK86w">Bard Extensions</a> in English, a completely new way to interact and collaborate with Bard. With Extensions, Bard can find and show you relevant information from the Google tools you use every day — like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels — even when the information you need is across multiple apps and services.</p><p data-block-key="2bch5">For example, if you’re planning a trip to the Grand Canyon (a project that takes up many tabs), you can now ask Bard to grab the dates that work for everyone from Gmail, look up real-time flight and hotel information, see Google Maps directions to the airport, and even watch YouTube videos of things to do there — all within one conversation.</p></div>

         }"><p data-block-key="10f21">Or, imagine you’re applying for a new job and using Bard to help with the process. You could ask Bard to “find my resume titled June 2023 from my Drive and summarize it to a short paragraph personal statement,” and continue collaborating on your new cover letter.</p><p data-block-key="fkrg3">We're committed to <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/protecting-your-data-era-generative-ai">protecting your personal information</a>. If you choose to use the Workspace extensions, your content from Gmail, Docs and Drive is not seen by human reviewers, used by Bard to show you ads or used to train the Bard model. And of course, you’re always in control of your privacy settings when deciding how you want to use these extensions, and you can turn them off at any time.</p><h2 data-block-key="cdea1">Easily double-check responses and build on shared conversations</h2><p data-block-key="7udaq">Starting today with responses in English, you can use Bard’s “Google it” button to more easily double-check its answers. When you click on the “G” icon, Bard will read the response and evaluate whether there is content across the web to substantiate it. When a statement can be evaluated, you can click the highlighted phrases and learn more about supporting or contradicting information found by Search.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

            Anmeldung form filler
            <small>Built in <time datetime="2023-09-19">2023</time></small>
        </h2>
        
        <p>When you move in Berlin, you must <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin">register your address</a>. This involves filling a paper form and delivering it in person&nbsp;–&nbsp;by appointment only&nbsp;–&nbsp;to the Bürgeramt. This is called the <em>Anmeldung</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Anmeldung</em> form sucks. It sucked 8 years ago and it sucks now. It’s ambiguous and confusing and I hate it, so I made a better one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/anmeldung">You can try it here.</a></strong></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-filler.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-filler.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-filler.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-filler.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-filler.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-filler.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung form filler screenshot" height="970" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-filler.png" title="It's actually digital!" width="1636"></picture><figcaption>It's actually digital!</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s an actual web form, not a PDF. It works on your phone. It supports autofill, numeric keyboards, field validation, autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility tools, etc.</p>
<p>I designed it to <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">feel more like a conversation</a>, and less like being interrogated by a blunt bureaucrat. The form adapts to your answers and gives helpful instructions. The web is a great medium. We can do more than put a paper sheet on the internet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung web form" height="1260" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png" width="1620"></picture>
<p>I added a dedicated step for <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox">“c/o” addresses</a>. German apartments don’t have apartment numbers. If your name is not on your mailbox, postal workers can’t deliver your mail. If you can’t put your name on your mailbox, you must add “c/o” to your address. This is officially allowed, but it’s covered neither by the official form, nor by the official instructions.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung form filler with instructions" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png" title="Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!" width="1612"></picture><figcaption>Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bürgeramt also wants to know that you live on the second floor on the right. That’s not clearly stated on the form (it’s the “Zusätze” in “Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze”). People leave that out, so they get asked (in German) during their appointment.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="The &quot;building details&quot; form field" height="184" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png" width="1608"></picture>
<p>At the end, you can download the form. You also get a few options like booking an appointment or hiring help.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Last step of the Anmeldung form filler" height="1724" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png" width="1612"></picture>
<p>The form can only fit two people. If you register your whole family, you must fill the same form multiple times. This tool handles it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Option to download multiple forms" height="794" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png" width="1610"></picture>
<p>These are small details that make a big difference for immigrants registering their address for the first time.</p>
<p>I also made a few small quality of life improvement: using the browser’s language to suggest the user’s country, focusing on the right fields when moving between form stages, and a few other niceties. It’s subtle, but it adds up to a nice user experience.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Everything happens in your browser. Your personal information never leaves your computer. </p>
<h2 id="how-its-made">How it’s made</h2>
<p>It’s a simple VueJS component, like <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/tools">all the other tools</a> on All About Berlin.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">PDFLib</a> to fill the form in the browser. While the user is filling the form, I download the empty PDF form and the JS library in the background. When they click “save form”, it happens instantly. It feels unnaturally snappy.</p>
<h3 id="culture-sniffing">Culture sniffing</h3>
<p>I use <code>navigator.languages</code> to get a list of supported languages. For example, <code>en-CA</code>, <code>fr-CA</code>, <code>de-DE</code>. This gives me a list of countries the user <em>might</em> have lived in. I suggest those countries at the top of the country list.</p>

<p>This is a technique I first used with the <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/currency-tooltips">currency tooltips</a>. It lets you guess a user’s culture when the cost of getting it wrong is low.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’d like to digitalize more forms. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/010250-antrag-auf-vergabe-einer-steuerlichen-id">tax ID request form</a> is a solid contender, as the original design is offensively bad. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/abmeldung">Abmeldung</a> form would also be useful.</p>
<h3 id="faxes-and-snail-mail">Faxes and snail mail</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a printer, I could mail the form to you. It costs <span>0.85</span>€ to mail a letter through the LetterXPress API. You could get the filled form in a few days, then bring it to your appointment.</p>
<p>I could digitalize other forms, and fax them through the Simple Fax API. It costs <span>0.07</span>€ to fax a page. This would let you complete some bureaucratic tasks “fully digitally” a decade before the government gets there.</p>
<p>Anachronistic problems demand anachronistic solutions!</p>
<h3 id="go-fully-digital">Go fully digital</h3>
<p>Or why not skip paper entirely? During COVID, we filled information online, and showed a QR code at the test centre. Why can’t the Bürgeramt have that? Even with in-person appointments, a QR code or a short URL would make paper forms entirely unnecessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>Computer hackers and users from across the world will celebrate GNU's
anniversary with special events. These include a specially convened
<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">GNU Hackers Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</a> and a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for
hackers of any skill level at the FSF's headquarters in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named Richard Stallman
announced the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating
system called <a href="https://gnu.org/">GNU</a>, for "GNU's not Unix." GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty
years. Since 1983, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical
replacement for proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>When describing GNU's history and the background behind its initial
announcement, Stallman (often known simply as "RMS") <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>,
"with a free operating system, we could again have a community of
cooperating hackers -- and invite anyone to join. And anyone would be
able to use a computer without starting out by conspiring to deprive
his or her friends."</p>
<p>"When we look back at the history of the free software movement -- or
the idea that users should be in control of their own computing -- it
starts with GNU," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF,
which sponsors GNU's development. "The GNU System isn't just the most
widely used operating system that is based on free software. GNU is
also at the core of a philosophy that has guided the free software
movement for forty years."</p>
<p>Usually combined with the kernel Linux, GNU forms the backbone of the
Internet and powers millions of servers, desktops, and embedded
computing devices. Aside from its technical advancements, GNU
pioneered the concept of "copyleft," the approach to software
licensing that requires the same rights to be preserved in derivative
works, and is best exemplified by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). As Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>, "The goal of GNU was to give users
freedom, not just to be popular. So we needed to use distribution
terms that would prevent GNU software from being turned into
proprietary software. The method we use is called 'copyleft.'"</p>
<p>The free software community has held strong for forty years and
continues to grow, as exemplified by the FSF's annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/conference">LibrePlanet</a>
conference on software freedom and digital ethics.</p>
<p>Kooyman continues, "we hope that the fortieth anniversary will inspire
hackers, both old and new, to join GNU in its goal to create, improve,
and share free software around the world. Software is controlling our
world these days, and GNU is a critique and solution to the status quo
that we desperately need in order to not have our technology control
us."</p>
<h3>GNU Hacker's Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>On September 27, GNUnet e.V. is celebrating GNU's fortieth anniversary
with a <a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">hacker meeting</a> in Switzerland, which will feature
presentations about various GNU packages, hacking, and making new
releases. Among the speakers are Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU;
Free Software Award winner Sébastien Blin of GNU Jami; the president
of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Matthias Kirschner; and
several GNU webmasters.</p>
<h3>Hackday at the FSF Headquarters</h3>
<p>In honor of GNU's fortieth anniversary, its organizational sponsor the
FSF is organizing a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for families, students, and anyone
interested in celebrating GNU's anniversary. It will be held at the
FSF's offices in Boston, MA on October 1.</p>
<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to run, edit, share, contribute to,
and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development
and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation
for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and
its Web sites, located at <a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org/">https://gnu.org</a>, are
an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to
support the FSF's work can be made at <a href="https://donate.fsf.org/">https://donate.fsf.org</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the FSF, as well as important information for
journalists and publishers, is at <a href="https://www.fsf.org/press">https://www.fsf.org/press</a>.</p>
<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="NOUVEAU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/nouveau.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Hours after posting a large patch series for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Nouveau-Patches-Run-On-GSP-Blob">enabling the Nouveau kernel driver to use NVIDIA's GSP</a> for improving the support for RTX 20/30 series hardware and finally enabling accelerated graphics support on RTX 40 "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, the Red Hat maintainer has resigned from his duties.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Ben+Skeggs">Ben Skeggs</a> at Red Hat has long been the primary Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer for keeping this open-source NVIDIA GPU kernel driver within the mainline kernel going... Throughout all the battles, particularly after the GTX 900 series and later has required signed firmware images for enabling any accelerated GPU support, he's now resigning from maintaining the driver. Ben Skeggs has contributed to the Nouveau project for more than one dedace -- he's earned references on Phoronix since 2008.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=nvidia-rtx4080-rtx4090-compute&amp;image=rtx40_compute_1_med" alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080 / 4090 graphics cards"></p>
<p>Ben posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043239.html">a patch</a> resigning as the Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer today and commented:
</p><blockquote>"I have resigned, and will no longer be taking as active a role in nouveau development."</blockquote>
<p>Skeggs posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043241.html">another message</a> confirming he is stepping away from Nouveau development:
</p><blockquote>"As you may have gathered from the MAINTAINERS patch I just sent out, I have resigned from my position at Red Hat, and will be stepping back from nouveau development.
<p>
This is a personal decision that I've been mulling over for a number of years now, and I feel that with GSP-RM greatly simplifying support of future HW, and the community being built around NVK, that things are in good hands and this is the right time for me to take some time away to explore other avenues. 
</p><p>
I still have a personal system with an RTX 4070, which I've been using the nouveau GSP-RM code on for the past couple of weeks, so chances are I'll be poking my nose in every so often :)
</p><p>
I wish everyone the best, and look forward to seeing the progress you all make on nouveau in the future."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a major loss to Nouveau development and the open-source NVIDIA driver ecosystem at large. It will be very interesting to see how this plays out considering Ben has been the number one contributor to the Nouveau kernel driver for years while at Red Hat. Yes, there's active work by other parties on the NVK Vulkan driver, Nouveau OpenCL compute, etc, but Skeggs has largely been leading the kernel driver portion. Hopefully at least he'll see the Nouveau GSP firmware portion through to its eventual upstreaming in the mainline kernel for re-clocking support on RTX 20 series and newer as well as having RTX 40 series accelerated hardware support.
</p><p>
Stay tuned to Phoronix to see how the open-source NVIDIA Linux graphics driver development evolves from this unexpected move. For now at least those concerned about the best open-source graphics driver support on Linux the best options remain with AMD Radeon and Intel graphics hardware.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>When police suspected Danny Kyllo, an Oregon man, of growing cannabis in his home they drove to his house with a </span><a href="https://www.thermal.com/" rel="">thermal imaging device</a><span> to scan it.

It’s the same thing as the light you see, only it can penetrate walls due to its much longer wavelength. Just like light (and echolocation) these waves also reflect off various surfaces and, when reconstructed properly, can be used to create an image.</p><p><span>Development of this technology goes back at least as far as July 2005, where </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1552508" rel="">researchers claimed at an IEEE Symposium</a><span> that they had created an ultra-wideband high-resolution short pulse imaging radar system operating around 10 GHz. The applications for which were explicitly for military and police use, providing them with “enhanced situation awareness.”</span></p><p><span>A few years later, in 2008, </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/mostofi-lab/overview/Imaging.html" rel="">researchers at UC Santa Barbara</a><span> created an initial approach for imaging with WiFi that they presented at </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/papers/ACC09_MostofiSen.pdf" rel="">IEEE ACC 2009</a><span>. A year later they demonstrated the </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/papers/Milcom10_MostofiGonzalez.pdf" rel="">feasibility of this approach</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sensing the potential of this new surveillance technology, other researchers began piling on. Progress was initially slow but, in 2017, </span><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/50" rel="">two researchers in Germany demonstrated</a><span> the ability to do WiFi imaging using techniques borrowed from the field of holography. According to Philipp Holl, an undergrad student </span><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901" rel="">and lead study author</a><span> who worked with Friedemann Reinhard of the Technical University of Munich to develop the new method, “The past two years have seen an explosion of methods for passive Wi-Fi imaging.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, the technology could only </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wifi-camera-sees-through-walls-2017-5?r=MX&amp;IR=T" rel="">make out rough shapes of things</a><span>. "If there's a cup of coffee on a table, you may see something is there, but you couldn't see the shape," Holl says, "but you could make out the shape of a person, or a dog on a couch. Really any object that's more than 4 centimeters in size."</span></p><p><span>In 2018 the team at UC Santa Barbara published a paper titled “</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10109.pdf" rel="">Et Tu Alexa?</a><span>” examining the potential threats of this emerging technology. They examined the problem of adversarial WiFi sensing and the risk to privacy resulting from the widespread deployment of wireless devices, which could be used to track your precise physical location, movement, and other physiological properties.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, </span><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/09/seeing-through-walls-with-adversarial-wifi-sensing-attack-and-defence-strategies/" rel="">they also propose some countermeasures</a><span> for defending against such attacks to reduce the quantity and quality of the WiFi signals captured by the attacker, such as Geo-fencing and rate-limiting. These methods are not as effective with IoT devices, though, due to the frequency with which they make transmissions.</span></p><p><span>Up until this point it was necessary to use frequencies higher than commercial WiFi (2.4 and 5 GHz) to achieve decent imaging resolutions. That all changed in February 2019 when a team from Michigan State University </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8654605" rel="">published a paper in IEEE Access</a><span> outlining how they were able to use signals at 5.5 GHz, which matches the 802.11n/ac WiFi protocol, to create a 2-D image of two reflecting spheres and a reflecting X-shaped target, concluding “full 2-D imagery is possible by capturing the WiFi signals present in typical environments.”</span></p><p><span>At MobiCom 2020, researchers from the University of Buffalo, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoCMlDM2NiE" rel="">presented their WiPose technology</a><span>, touted as “the first 3-D human pose construction framework using commercial WiFi devices.” This system uses the 2-D imaging technology previously discussed to construct a 3-D avatar of the humans captured by it. The system uses a deep learning model that encodes the prior knowledge of human skeletons in the construction process of the 3-D model.</span></p><p><span>In 2019, former DARPA contractor Ray Liu launched his first commercial product in the </span><a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com/wifi-sensing/" rel="">WiFi sensing</a><span> domain. Pitched as a way of “Making the world safer, healthier, and smarter,” the original military and law enforcement usages mentioned when this technology was born in 2005 were cast aside.

It’s very similar to the WiPose system we previously discussed and aims at “mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of a human body.” The researchers modified DensePose so that, rather than taking an RGB image, it would be compatible with the imagery being produced by state-of-the-art WiFi sensing technologies. </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/wifi-signals-used-to-see-people-inside-rooms" rel="">The resulting system</a><span> “can detect the pose of humans in a room based solely on the WiFi signals passing through the environment.”</span></p><p>It’s telling how the pitch for this technology has pivoted from military and police use to keeping people safe in their own homes. The true purpose of this is obviously for law enforcement, the military, and intelligence agencies. We already live with mass digital surveillance and if you don’t believe that this won’t get incorporated into their plans to monitor everything you do, then you haven’t been paying attention.</p><p><span>Apart from putting CCTV cameras in everyone’s living spaces, this technology offers a comprehensive and supremely surreptitious way of putting eyes in every room of your house and place of work. Indeed, this just may become the norm. With </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/nearly-third-gen-z-favors-home-government-surveillance-cameras-1" rel="">nearly a third of Gen Z favoring the installation of government surveillance cameras in your home</a><span>, this less-intrusive method may just find even broader support from the brainwashed masses. It will be possible to know where you are in the house and exactly what you’re doing, from sitting on the toilet to making love.</span></p><p>We’ve seen how easily intelligence agencies can get secret warrants to surveil anyone of particular interest. We’ve also seen just how easy it is for someone to become a target for surveillance. You very well might, one day, find your WiFi router and access points feeding imagery to an alphabet agency that didn’t like your social media posts, while armed thugs wait for the perfect moment to execute their next no-knock raid.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

I definitely prefer the way it outputs results much more compared to chatgpt and it does provide sources / a UI linking to relevant material quite often. It is also searching the web for the latest info which is definitely felt in it's output. However, it often says "I can't help with that" even for relatively simple queries which makes it a little annoying to use.<p>In my opinion, it seems like Bard is more a test-bed for chat based search UI. I've also gotten AI generated results in the main Google search which is what I presume will be the main rollout. If executed well, it'll probably change the landscape in terms of AI assisted search.

In a barrage of blog posts and announcements over the past few months they release new features into nearly every product. I have the Search Generative Experience (generated results above main search results) pretty useful about 20% of the time and easy enough to skip when it's not useful.<p>I've used Bard quite a few times successfully for code generation, though it did give some bad curl commands (which I found the source blog post for).</p><p>Because Google has a very favorable brand reputation (despite what some on HN think) and gets a lot of legal scrutiny, they have to be much more careful in ways that OpenAI doesn't.</p><p>This video on their (presumably last generation) deep learning infrastructure is wild: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFe7-WZMMhc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFe7-WZMMhc</a> How far large-scale computing has evolved beyond racks of servers in a datacenter is amazing.

If you were trying to use it as a tool for learning (a sort of co-pilot for self-study) which is how I use GPT-4 sometimes it would have been really terrible as it could completely mess up your understanding of foundational concepts.

When asking to emulate a style of text, it still just gives you the same style it always uses, but adapts the content slightly.

LLMs producing text, in the style of a conversation is kind of like talking about things. So we can have a nonconcesous non-human system do something like talking, and if it is talking, it can talk in a way that could be called hallucinating.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Feynmanium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p><p>Who developed the theory of relativity?</p><p>(A) Albert Einstein</p><p>(B) Albert Dirac</p><p>(C) Insufficient information to answer</p><p>(D) Albert Bohr</p><p>(E) Albert Maxwell</p><p>(F) Albert Feynman</p><p>(G) None of the other choices are correct</p><p>(H) Albert Schrodinger"

We've literally implemented Searle's Chinese Room!</p><p>I'm not saying LaMDA was actually sentient, or that we need to pull any fire alarms, I'm just saying that it's hubris to think that it's an easy question with an obvious answer, and that Lemoine was a schmuck for being skeptical when told it wasn't.</p><p>Also, calling my post "an absolute slurry" and a "rain puddle deep thought" wasn't very nice, and technically breaks guidelines.

I didn't think this before but now realising ChatGPT and other personal assistants (because that's what they are) will really succeed not just because of performance but network effects and social mindshare. You'll use the most popular AI assistant because that's what everyone else is using. Maybe some of these things will differ in a corporate setting but Google has really struggled to launch new products that get used as a daily habit without deprecating it within two years after. Remember Allo. I think Google is a technical juggernaut but they struggle a lot with anything that requires a network effect.</span></p></div></td></tr>

OpenAI for instance has really not cracked social features in ChatGPT - they have a "share link" thing now which they didn't have before but that's really it.  Bard doesn't even have any social sharing.<p>The reason OpenAI are in the lead at the moment is their model is way better than anyone else's to the point where it's actually useful for a lot of things. Not just giving a recipe for marinara sauce in the style of Biggie Smalls or other party tricks, proof reading, summarizing, turning text into bullets, giving examples of things, coming up with practise exercises to illustrate a point, giving critiques of stuff etc etc.  Lots of things that people actually do it does well enough to be helpful, whereas in my experience so far, other models are just not quite good enough to be helpful at a number of those tasks.  So there's really no reason to use them over gpt4.

The international community largely condemned the act, accusing Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty. Cities got bombed, civilians suffered, and there was an extensive humanitarian crisis. Ukraine put up a strong fight despite being outgunned. Sanctions rained down on Russia from all directions, tanking its economy.

As of my last update in September 2021, I cannot provide real-time or the most recent information. However, one of the most notable events in January 2022 was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano in Tonga. The eruption caused widespread damage, generated a significant tsunami that affected the surrounding areas including Tonga, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, and severely disrupted communication networks. It was a catastrophic event with serious implications for the people of Tonga and its environment.</p><p>For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to reliable and up-to-date resources or news outlets. Keep in mind that the situation might have evolved, and new developments might have occurred since January 2022.

		<p>You've probably heard of the famous 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' story. It claims that a programmer on the original Wing Commander was stuck getting an error message when the game unloaded its memory during a quit. Pressed for time, instead of fixing the issue he simply hex edited the memory manager's error reporting to print 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' instead. A funny and relatable story!  The anecdote has made the rounds on the internet for the past decade and has even started to make the phrase "thank you for playing Wing Commander" synonymous with a dirty-but-functional hack. The most common version looks like this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/3bmszo/thank_you_for_playing_wing_commander/">sourced</a> from Reddit's /r/shittyprogramming:

</p><p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/tyfpwc-meme_version.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont.jpg" width="231" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Engineers immediately recognize this as a funny and relatable story; it's the exact sort of thing that anyone who has ever worked in software development can recognize immediately. A perfect example of the old aphorism that "if it is stupid but it works, it isn't stupid."<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, it has also in recent years become fodder for unhappy Star Citizen fans looking for reasons to complain about Chris Roberts' abilities. In many retellings, 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' is now supposedly an example of selling shoddy work instead of a funny, recognizable hack. (If the connection feels tenuous, the missing aspect is that unlike most other CEOs, Roberts continues to code on Star Citizen, an aspect of the project that makes it interesting to him.) 

Wing Commander I fans, meanwhile, have been understandably cautious about the anecdote and particularly the included screenshot. For one thing, Wing Commander I's default install direction isn't c:/wc1 and the game doesn't actually print "Thank You for Playing Wing Commander!" when you quit. Is the story even real? We decided to look into the history of the story and the game itself and after some work we've conclusively determined that the answer is… <i><b>kind of</b></i>.

Our first task was to find the origin (no pun intended) of the quote and screenshot. Where did dozens of 'funny software hacks' articles around the internet find it in the first place? Was it even a real story or just a piece of mythology that had been handed down, perhaps not even really specific to Wing Commander I? Luckily, the original quote ended up being pretty easy to source: it was left as a comment on August 20, 2009 in response to a Gamasutra article called Dirty Coding Tricks by Brandon Sheffield (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091109105856/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4111/dirty_coding_tricks.php?page=1">archive</a>). Here is the original post, verbatim:

<blockquote>
Back on Wing Commander 1 we were getting an exception from our EMM386 memory manager when we exited the game. We'd clear the screen and a single line would print out, something like "EMM386 Memory manager error. Blah blah blah." We had to ship ASAP. So I hex edited the error in the memory manager itself to read "Thank you for playing Wing Commander."
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/originalquote.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet.jpg" width="703" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Gamasutra was a game development website popular among industry professionals. In 2021, the site was rebranded as Game Developer. The original article is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/dirty-coding-tricks">still available</a> at the new site but the comments appear to have been dropped in advance of the transition. The comment was, indeed, signed by Ken Demarest. Ken Demarest III was an ace programmer who started his game development career working for Origin Systems as a software engineer on the first Wing Commander. He would go on to be lead programmer on Ultima VII and would become the growing company's Director of Technology (at a time when that technology was becoming pretty exciting!). While the comment was left anonymously (in that it was not signed into a user's account) it's very unlikely anyone was impersonating a game programmer for the purpose of telling a funny story. Wing Commander writer Jeff George would later say that "other than Chris Roberts, who was the key man, Ken Demarest had more to do with the fact that the game came out than anyone else involved." So if anyone knows what was going on under the hood, it should be him! (Be sure to <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/news/2011/08/25/ultimate-strategy-guide-history-wing-commander-i">revisit</a> Wing Commander I &amp; II: The Ultimate Strategy Guide's making of section for a surprisingly thorough contemporary interview with Demarest).

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/kendemarest1990.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t.jpg" width="137" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Eagle-eyed readers will immediately notice two minor changes between the original version and the 2015 Reddit version (which itself was sourced from a LinkedIn share by a third party in 2012): the original does not have the screenshot and the wording of the quit message has been slightly edited apparently with the intent to make the ending punchier. Most importantly, the screenshot added after the fact seemed to claim that the game had shipped with this bug which is not stated in the original story. So the original story, which has a reasonable origin, might be true!

The next issue is the message itself. The seemingly daming fact is that Wing Commander I simply doesn't print "thank you for playing Wing Commander" when you quit. We tested this in DOSBox and on period hardware and we searched all of the game's binaries for that text, coming up with nothing. Hitting ALT-X simply returns you to the DOS prompt. There is one exception, though! If you quit by clicking on the airlock door in the Tiger's Claw's barracks…

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
<a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit2.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

… then the quit process is different: you're given a y/n prompt and when you drop to DOS it prints "You step out of the airlock and into…", a joke directly relating to this specific method of exit.

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit3.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

We quickly confirmed that this text DOES appear in the game's binary. Is it possible that this is where the crash happened and that the story, told 19 years after the fact, simply forgot (or for the purposes of a funnier punchline) changed the story? Supporting this idea in particular is Ken Demarest's other famous connection to that very screen: he's the person that implemented the water drop that drips into the bucket, long cited as the platonic ideal of Chris Roberts' famed drive for immersion. This felt like the most likely way to establish if the story was true: how was the game displaying this message?

To try and find an answer, we turned to an incomplete copy of Wing Commander I's source code, archived by Electronic Arts. These source files were used for the release build of Wing Commander I and the archive was eventually sent to another team for development of the FM Towns port. Some material has not survived including, sadly, the memory management routines. But there's enough there to know exactly where this message comes from:

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/sourcecode1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t.jpg" width="679" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

This is from BARRACKS.C which sets the functionality of the barracks gameflow screen. Essentially the game unloads the memory and then prints the airlock message followed by a line break. Exactly what you see in action and not a case of hex editing a memory manager. The other method of quitting the game, found in COCKPIT.C, does not print a message.

While discussing this on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/xaxxen_xaxeczex/status/1701441246420443195/photo/1">Darren Xczek</a> offered another possibility: Ultima VII DOES drop to DOS with a "thank you for playing Ultima VII" message. Ken Demarest was the lead programmer on Ultima VII–in fact, it was the job he was initially hired for before he was assigned to help get Wing Commander out the door! Is it possible the story was true but it applied to a different game? Ultima VII did famously have memory management issues, so much so that the game's internal system was named the 'Voodoo Memory Manager'!

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/ultimaviiquit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt.jpg" width="200" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

At this point, I decided there was only one way to solve this mystery: see if we could reach Ken Demarest and ask him. He very kindly responded to a Facebook request in about 45 seconds and made us feel like real idiots for not just asking him first:

<blockquote>
In a way I would have loved to ship with that hack in there, but once we found the cause of the error message I couldn't in good conscience leave the hack in there. Besides which hand editing it added time to completing the build, which was inefficient.
</blockquote>

And there it is! The best possible outcome: the story was true–it's something that was done during the game's development–but it was also fixed before the game actually shipped… so it's a clever engineering trick and explicitly NOT evidence of a shoddy product! 
 
<sup>1</sup> - Interestingly, the Internet frequently attributes this quote to a novel by Wing Commander novelist Mercedes Lackey; this is surely not the actual source but untangling that would take another article!

<p>
It's been more than four years since the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/" target="_blank">last regular publication</a> of documents from the Snowden trove. Last year, however, some new snippets of information from the Snowden documents appeared in the PhD thesis of hacktivist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum" target="_blank">Jacob Appelbaum</a>.</p><p>

The <a href="#new">new information</a> isn't very spectacular and also quite specialistic, but still worth to make it more easily accessible. Also for the record I added some <a href="#remarks">corrections and additions</a> to Appelbaum's discussion of NSA surveillance methods.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s800/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="420" data-original-width="800" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s600/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" width="620"></a></p>

    NSA headquarters - Appelbaum's thesis - Eindhoven University of Technology<br>
  </span>
</p>
<p><span size="+2"><b>Jacob Appelbaum</b></span></p><p>

Jacob R. Appelbaum was born in 1983 in California and became a well-known hacker and activist for digital anonymity. He was a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow" target="_blank">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> hacker collective and a core member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28network%29" target="_blank">Tor project</a>, which provides a tool for anonymous internet communications.</p><p>

In 2012, Appelbaum moved to Berlin, where he worked closely with Laura Poitras on the NSA documents which she had received from Edward Snowden in May and June 2013. However, he was also involved in the story about the eavesdropping on German chancellor Merkel and the publication of the NSA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_catalog" target="_blank">ANT Product Catalog</a>.</p><p>

In both cases the documents were not attributed to Snowden and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/snowden-ten-years-later.html" target="_blank">apparantly came</a> from a still unidentified "second source". In his thesis, Appelbaum seems to refer to this source when he mentions "documents exposed by whistleblowers, known and unknown, or other anonymous insiders."</p>
<p>
In 2015, several women accused Appelbaum of sexual abuse and he subsequently lost his position at the Tor project and various other organizations. Appelbaum denied the allegations, but an investigation ordered by the Tor project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190820150807/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/technology/tor-project-jacob-appelbaum.html" target="_blank">determined</a> that they appeared to be true.</p><p>

Meanwhile Appelbaum had moved to The Netherlands, where he started as a PhD student at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). There he finished his thesis and received his PhD on March 25, 2022. Currently he <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/jacob-r-appelbaum" target="_blank">works as a postdoc</a> at the <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/cc/" target="_blank">Coding Theory and Cryptology</a> group at TU Eindhoven.</p><p><span size="+2"><b>Appelbaum's PhD thesis</b></span></p><p>


The full title of Appelbaum's thesis is "<i>Communication in a world of pervasive surveillance. Sources and methods: Counter-strategies against pervasive surveillance architecture</i>". His promotors were prof.dr. Mark van den Brand, prof.dr. Daniel J. Bernstein and prof.dr. Tanja Lange.</p><p>

The thesis was published on March 25, 2022 and became available for <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf" target="_blank">download</a> as a 24.3 MB pdf-document on September 27, 2022. The contents of this 327-page thesis are as follows:</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 1</b>: Introduction.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 2</b>: Background on network protocols common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 3</b>: Background on cryptography common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 4</b>: Review of historical, political, economic, and technical adversarial capabilities (including previously published leaked documents that are from works which Appelbaum has written about in his role as a journalist).</p><p>
 
- <b>Chapter 5</b>: Review of the Domain Name System and an explanation of alternative methods to improve the security and privacy of domain name lookups.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 6</b>: Examination of a tweak to the WireGuard VPN protocol to protect historic encrypted traffic against future attacks by quantum computers.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 7</b>: Introduces the Vula protocol, which is a suite of free software tools for automatically protecting network traffic between hosts in the same Local Area Network.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 8</b>: Introduces REUNION, a privacy-preserving rendezvous protocol. </p><p>


In the preface, Appelbaum writes that his thesis is the culmination of more than a decade of research into the topic of surveillance. He expresses a political and activist aim by saying that the "machinery of mass surveillance is simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist" and that "we must use all of the tools in our toolbox – economic, social, cultural, political, and of course, cryptographic – to blind targeted and mass surveillance."</p><p>

He says more has to be done than simply criticize surveillance practices. Cryptography for example, "allows for resistance in a non-violent manner to the benefit of everyone except the ones who are spying on us." From this perspective Appelbaum's thesis discusses various cryptographic implementations to "protect individual liberty, while aspiring to a broader goal of achieving societal liberty."</p><p><span size="+2"><b>New information from the Snowden documents</b></span></p><p>

Throughout his thesis, Appelbaum reveals some new information from Snowden documents that has not been published, but which he had access to during his research that resulted in various publications in media outlets like Der Spiegel, NDR and Le Monde. The new information is only described, so no new original documents were released.</p><p>

According to Appelbaum: "Many journalists who have worked on the Snowden archive know significantly more than they have revealed in public. It is in this sense that the Snowden archive has almost completely failed to create change: many of the backdoors and sabotage unknown to us before 2013 is still unknown to us today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71)</span></p><p>

Appelbaum also provides some new information about the Snowden documents in general, by saying that The Intercept "closed their Snowden archive and reportedly it has been destroyed." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 63, note 17)</span></p>

<p><span size="2">
Below, I provide exact quotes from Appelbaum's thesis, including his sources, which are in square brackets, while I added some additional links for further information.<br>
</span></p><p>

<b>1. BULLRUN: manipulating protocol security</b></p><p>

"How do they accomplish their goals with project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrun_%28decryption_program%29" target="_blank">BULLRUN</a>? One way is that United States National Security Agency (NSA) participates in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community protocol standardization meetings with the explicit goal of sabotaging protocol security to enhance NSA surveillance capabilities." "Discussions with insiders confirmed what is claimed in as of yet unpublished classified documents from the Snowden archive and other sources." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 6-7, note 8)</span></p><p>



<b>2. Selecting entropic internet traffic</b></p><p>

"There are various rules governing what is <i>selected</i> for long-term data retention in [the NSA's] <i>corporate repositories</i>. One example is that some traffic which is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29" target="_blank">entropic</a> by a standard Shannon Entropy estimate is <i>selected</i> from the network in real time and saved to a database, preserving it for cryptanalysis using future technology." "This statement is based in part on an analysis of as of yet unpublished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> source code that performs a Shannon Entropy estimate. Some kinds of Internet traffic that is considered entropic is recorded for later analysis." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 9, note 16)</span></p><p>


  
<b>3. Compromised lawful interception systems</b></p><p>
  
"As part of our research, we uncovered evidence that the telecommunications infrastructure in many countries has been compromised by intelligence services. The Snowden archive includes largely unpublished internal NSA documents and presentations that discuss targeting and exploiting not only deployed, live interception infrastructure, but also the vendors of the hardware and software used to build the infrastructure. Primarily these documents remain unpublished because the journalists who hold them fear they will be considered disloyal or even that they will be legally punished. Only a few are available to read in public today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"Targeting lawful interception (LI) equipment is a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/nl/document/20150928-intercept-exploiting-foreign-law-intercept-roundtablepdf" target="_blank">known goal</a> of the NSA. Unpublished NSA documents specifically list their compromise of the Russian SORM LI infrastructure as an NSA success story of compromising civilian telecommunications infrastructure to spy on targets within reach of the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM" target="_blank">SORM</a> system." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"The NSA slides have "you talk, we listen" written in Cyrillic on the jackets of two Russian officers." "Review of unpublished Snowden documents about NSA’s activities compromising deployed, lawful interception systems and as well as additional success against the vendors of such hardware or software. Needless to say, a compromised interception system is anything but lawful in the hands of an adversary."  </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41, note 4)</span></p><p>


  
<b>4. Compromised computer hardware</b></p><p>

"While working on documents in the Snowden archive the thesis author learned that an American fabless semiconductor CPU vendor named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavium" target="_blank">Cavium</a> is listed as a successful SIGINT "enabled" CPU vendor. By chance this was the same CPU present in the thesis author's Internet router (UniFi USG3). The entire Snowden archive should be open for academic researchers to better understand more of the history of such behavior." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71, note 21)</span></p><p>


  
<b>5. PRISM</b></p><p>

"The PRISM slide deck was not published in full, and the public does not fully understand aspects of the program such as the retrieval of voice
content data as seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM#/media/File:Prism-slide-7.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 4.24</a>. Domains hosted by PRISM partners are also subject to selector based surveillance. Several pages of the PRISM slides list targets and related surveillance data, and a majority of them appear to be a matter of political surveillance rather than defense against terrorism. One example that is not well-known except among the journalists who had access to the full PRISM slide deck is the explicit naming of targets. An example shows a suggestion for targeting of the Tibetan Government in Exile through their primary domain name. The tibet.net domain is named as an unconventional example that analysts should be aware of as also falling under the purview of PRISM. The email domain was
hosted by Google Mail, a PRISM partner, at the time of the slide deck creation and it is still currently hosted by Google Mail as of early 2022." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 76)</span></p>

  
<p><b>6. MYSTIC: Country X</b></p><p>

"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYSTIC" target="_blank">MYSTIC</a> was revealed to impact a number of countries by name at the time of publication: the Bahamas, Mexico, the Philippines, Kenya and one
mystery country: country X. The Bahamas, and country X are subject to SOMALGET full take data and voice collection. The publisher WikiLeaks observed that the monitoring of an entire country of people is a crime when done by outside parties, essentially an act of war by the surveillance adversary. WikiLeaks then <a href="https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-statement-on-the-mass.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the country in question, Country X, was Afghanistan [<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>]. Through independent review of the Snowden archive, we confirm that this is the identity of Country X, and that WikiLeaks was correct in their claim." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 78)</span></p><p><span size="2">
(Strangely enough, the source provided by Appelbaum ("<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>") actually shows that already four days <i>before</i> Wikileaks' revelation, collaborative analysis by Paul Dietrich and the author of this weblog had already pointed to Afghanistan as being Country X. In his bibliography, Appelbaum attributes this source document to "John Young and et al." (the owners of the Cryptome website), while it was actually written by and first published on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424142120/https://members.efn.org/~paulmd/" target="_blank">blog</a> of Paul Dietrich)<br>
  </span></p><p>


<b>7. Manipulation of DUAL_EC_DRBG</b></p><p>
  
"Many documents released in public from the Snowden archive and additional documents which are still not public make clear that this type of bug is being exploited at scale with help from NSA’s surveillance infrastructure. It is still unclear who authored the changes at Juniper and if bribery from the NSA was involved as with RSA’s deployment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG" target="_blank">DUAL_EC_DRBG</a> to their customers as is discussed in Section 4.4." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 81)</span></p><p>



<b>8. Software backdoors</b></p><p>

"Example from the Snowden Archive of an as of yet unreleased backdoor in fielded software that is most certainly not an exclusively exploitable backdoor by NSA. The software’s secret key generation is sabotaged by design to ensure surveillance of the community of interest. There is a corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> rule that has not yet been published. The goal of that rule is to gather up all ciphertext using this sabotaged system;
it is clearly part of a larger strategy. As a flag in the ground for later, the thesis author presents the following SHA256 hash: [...]. There are additional examples from other sources that this is the general shape of the game being played with more than a few acts of sabotage by the NSA." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 83, note 27)</span></p><p><span size="+2"><b>Some corrections and additions</b></span></p><p>

Chapter 4 of Appelbaum's thesis is about the "adversary" and describes a wide range of digital surveillance methods which are used by intelligence agencies. He writes a little a bit about the capabilities of Russia and China, but the biggest part is about the methods of the NSA as revealed through the Snowden documents.</p><p> 

In general, this chapter is very similar to for example Glenn Greenwald's book <i>No Place to Hide</i> and Snowden's memoir <i>Permanent Record</i> as it reads like a one-sided accusation against the NSA without much context or the latest information. Chapter 4 also contains small errors which could easily have been prevented. Here I will discuss some examples:</p><p>



- Page 20, note 12: "An example is Suite-A cryptography or Type-1 cryptography, so designated by the NSA. The NSA now calls this the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: Actually CNSA isn't the new name for the highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A</a>, but for the less secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite B</a> algorithms.</p><p>



- Page 41: "The BND and the CIA held secret co-ownership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG" target="_blank">CryptoAG</a> until 1993, and then the CIA held sole ownership until 2018. The devices were vulnerable by design, which allowed unaffiliated intelligence services, such as the former USSR’s KGB, and the East German Ministry for State Security [MfS], to independently exploit CryptoAG’s intentional flaws." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: This exploitation by the KGB and the MfS was apparently suggested in a German television report, based upon claims by a former Stasi officer, but so far there are no documents that support this claim. See for more information: <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia/rubicon.htm" target="_blank">Operation RUBICON</a>.</p><p>



- Page 41: "It does not appear that those party to the Maximator alliance are using their agreement and relative positions to spy on the entire
planet – in stark contrast to the Five-Eyes agreement." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: The <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-foreign-partnerships.html#2ndparty">Five Eyes</a> and especially NSA and GCHQ have massive capabilities, but spying on "the entire planet" is still rather exaggerated: their collection efforts are limited by <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-strategic-mission-list.html">national priorities</a>, the locations of where they can access satellite and cable traffic, as well as by technical constraints. While the five members of the European Maximator alliance have/had much smaller capabilities, they could nonetheless intercept and decrypt diplomatic communications from over 60 countries where the weakened encryption devices from Crypto AG were used (see the map below).</p>

- Page 47, note 8: "Narus mass surveillance and analysis systems were deployed by the NSA inside AT&amp;T facilities to intercept all
traffic flowing through their large capacity network cables as documented [<a nohref="" title="Mark Klein and James Bamford. Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine–and Fighting it. BookSurge, 2009">KB09</a>] by whistleblower Mark Klein." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: This suggests that the NSA is intercepting American communications, but actually this is part of <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/09/nsas-legal-authorities.html#upstream">Upstream collection</a>, which is aimed at foreign targets and therefore the NSA <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4552325-SSO-NEWS-Relevant-Entries" target="_blank">applies</a> various filter systems to select traffic from countries of interest and discard purely domestic communications.</p>
<p>

- Page 52: "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is largely considered to rubber stamp requests from the FBI. The FBI has routinely misled the FISC, and from the little that is known, the FISC has neither the technical knowledge, nor the general temperament to actually act as a safeguard" </p><p>

&gt; Comment: Since the start of the Snowden revelations, numerous Top Secret documents from the FISC have been <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/tagged/fisc" target="_blank">declassified</a>, showing that the court examines the NSA's activities in great detail. The idea of being a "rubber stamp" is based upon the fact that the FISC denies just 0.5% of the applications, but later it became clear that American criminal courts <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/06/28/confirmed-the-fisa-court-is-less-of-a-rubber-stamp-than-title-iii-courts/" target="_blank">only deny</a> a tiny 0.06% of the requests for regular (so-called <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1284" target="_blank">Title III</a>) wiretaps.</p><p>


    
- Page 53: "The CIA meanwhile, operates their own surveillance capabilities including capabilities that are entirely outside of the
purview of the FISC, even now [<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-heinrich-newly-declassified-documents-reveal-previously-secret-cia-bulk-collection-problems-with-cia-handling-of-americans-information" target="_blank">cia22</a>]." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: At least one of these cases is about the CIA's use of bulk datasets with financial information, which can of course contain information about Americans, but when the CIA obtained them in ways other than by intercepting communications, the FISC simply has no jurisdiction. It's up to lawmakers to impose privacy safeguards for creating and exchanging such bulk datasets. </p><p>


    
- Page 56: "In the Snowden archive, we see lots of hacking and hacking related programs run by NSA, such as the TURBULENCE [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turbulence_%28NSA%29&amp;oldid=1026069496" target="_blank">Wik21u</a>] program which is made up of modular sub programs [<a href="https://archive.ph/gAojF" target="_blank">Amb13</a>].

&gt; Comment: This suggests that TURBULENCE and its sub-programs are about hacking operations, but actually, TURBULENCE is <a href="https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/items/show/156" target="_blank">defined</a> as "a next generation mission environment that <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2018/06/25/sso-dictionary-relevant-entries/" target="_blank">created</a> a unified system for MidPoint and Endpoint SIGINT", or in other words, an overarching framework for bulk and targeted tapping systems. Only the TURBINE sub-program can automatically <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/" target="_blank">trigger</a> the implantation of malware into target computer systems. Furthermore, none of the sources mentioned in the thesis say that XKEYSCORE is a sub-program of TURBULANCE and XKEYSCORE is not a hacking tool either. A detailed explanation of the TURBULENCE system is given in an <a href="https://robert.sesek.com/2014/9/unraveling_nsa_s_turbulence_programs.html" target="_blank">article</a> by Robert Sesek, which was apparently not consulted by Appelbaum.</p><p>



- Page 72: "US-984XN is the classified <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/p/sigint.html">SIGAD</a> while the program name PRISM is unclassified"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: There are no indications that "PRISM" is less secret than any other coverterm which the NSA uses for its collection, processing and analysis programs. That was likely also the reason that the big internet companies involved in this program initially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" target="_blank">denied</a> that they had ever heard of something called PRISM.</p><p>


- Page 91: "the NSA's Equation Group (EQGRP), which was later renamed Tailored Access Operations (TAO)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: The name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group" target="_blank">Equation Group</a> was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150217023145/https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf" target="_blank">coined</a> in February 2015 by the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky for "one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world". Later on it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/" target="_blank">became clear</a> that this group was part of the NSA's hacking division TAO.</p><p>


Given how many aspects of the NSA's operations Appelbaum mentions in chapter 4 of his thesis, one could say that it's inevitable that some mistakes are made and some sloppiness occurs. On the other hand, however, this is an academic publication for which the highest standards of accuracy should apply.  </p><p>


  
Finally, Appelbaum's activism is illustrated by the back cover of his thesis, which shows a logo very similar to that of the German terrorist organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction" target="_blank"><i>Rote Armee Fraktion</i></a> (RAF) from the 1970s, except that the original image of an AK-45 is replaced by that of a computer keyboard:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s489/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="489" data-original-width="350" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s320/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many people, I’ve spent the last few days looking for the new Unity. Godot has some potential, especially if it can take advantage of an influx of dev talent to drive rapid improvement. Open source is cool like that. However, one major issue holds it back - the binding layer between engine code and gameplay code is structurally built to be slow in ways which are very hard to fix without tearing everything down and rebuilding the entire API from scratch.</p><p>Godot has been used to create some successful games, so clearly this isn’t always a blocker. However Unity has spent the last five years working on speeding up their scripting with crazy projects such as building two custom compilers, SIMD maths libraries, custom collections and allocators, and of course the giant (and very much unfinished) ECS project. It’s been their CTO’s primary focus since 2018. Clearly Unity believed that scripting performance mattered to a significant part of their userbase. Switching to Godot isn’t only like going back five years in Unity - it’s so much worse.</p><p>I started <a href="https://reddit.com/r/godot/comments/16j345n/is_the_c_raycasting_api_as_poor_as_it_first/">a controversial but productive discussion</a> about this on the Godot subreddit a few days ago. This article is a more detailed continuation of my thoughts in that post now that I have a <strong>little</strong> more understanding of how Godot works. <strong>Let’s be clear here: I’m still a Godot newb, and this article <em>will</em> contain mistakes and misconceptions.</strong></p><p><em>Note: The following contains criticisms of the Godot engine’s design and engineering. Although I occasionally use some emotive language to describe my feelings about these things, the Godot developers have put in lots of hard work for the FOSS community and built something that’s loved by many people, and my intent is not to offend or come across as rude to any individuals.</em></p><h2 id="deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><span>Deepdive into performing a raycast from C#</span><a href="#deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><i></i></a></h2><p>We’re going to take a deep dive into how Godot achieves the equivalent of Unity’s <code>Physics2D.Raycast</code>, and what happens under the hood when we use it.

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>The first thing that we notice is that this is longer. That is not the focus of my criticism, and is partly due to the fact that I’ve formatted this code verbosely in order to make it easier for us to break it down line by line. So let’s do that, what’s actually happening here?</p><p>We start by calling <code>GetWorld2D()</code>. In Godot, physics queries are all performed in the context of a world, and this function gets the world our code is running in. Although this <code>World2D</code> is a managed class type, this function doesn’t do anything crazy like allocate every time we run it. None of these functions are going to do anything crazy like that for a simple raycast, right? Foreshadowing.</p><p>If we look inside these API calls we’ll see that even ostensibly simple ones like this are implemented through some rather convoluted machinery which will have at least a little performance overhead. Let’s dive into <code>GetWorld2D</code> as an example of that by unravelling some of its calls through C#. This is roughly what all the calls that return managed types look like. I’ve added some comments to explain what’s going on.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>As we can see, this is wrapping some perfectly reasonable raycast function in ungodly slow craziness. That internal <code>intersect_ray</code> is the function that should be in the API!</p><p>This C++ code allocates an untyped dictionary on the unmanaged heap. If we dig down into this dictionary, we find a hashmap as expected. It performs six hashmap lookups to initialize this dictionary (some of them may even do additional allocations, but I haven’t dug that deep). But wait, this is an untyped dictionary. How does that work? Well the internal hashmap maps <code>Variant</code> to <code>Variant</code>.</p><p>Sigh. What’s a <code>Variant</code>? Well the implementation is <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/variant/variant.cpp">quite complicated</a>, but in simple terms it’s a big tagged union type encompassing all possible types the dictionary can hold. We can think of it as being the dynamic untyped type. What we care about is its size, which is 20 bytes.</p><p>Okay, so each of those “fields” we’ve written into the dictionary is now 20 bytes large. Oh, and so are the keys. Those 8 byte <code>Vector2</code> values? 20 bytes each now. That <code>int</code>? 20 bytes. You get the picture.</p><p>If we sum the sizes of the fields in <code>RayResult</code>, we’re looking at 44 bytes (assuming 8 byte pointers). If we sum the sizes of the <code>Variant</code> keys and values of the dictionary, that’s 2 * 6 * 20 = 240 bytes! But wait, it’s a hashmap. Hashmaps don’t store their data compactly, so the true size of that dictionary on the heap is at least 6x larger than the data we want to return, probably much more.</p><p>Okay, let’s go back to C# and see what happens when we return this thing.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

This is a pretty clunky way to do raycasts as we need a reference to a node in the scene which we’re happy to mutate, and we have to reposition the node in the scene in order to do a query, but let’s take a look inside.</p><p>First we need to note that, as we’ve come to expect, each of these properties that we’re accessing does a full pointer chasing journey into C++ land.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

If we look carefully we can see that the structure is pretty much the same as our first <code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code> C# function. It gets the world, gets the state, builds the parameters, calls <code>intersect_ray</code> to do the actual work, then writes the result out to the properties.</p><p>But look! No heap allocations, no <code>Dictionary</code>, and no <code>Variant</code>. This is more like it! We can predict that this will be a lot faster.</p><h3 id="timing-it"><span>Timing it</span><a href="#timing-it"><i></i></a></h3><p>Okay, I’ve made a lot of allusions to all of this overhead being dramatically problematic and we can easily see that it should be, but let’s put some actual numbers to this with benchmarks.</p><p>As we’ve seen above, <code>RayCast2D.ForceRaycastUpdate()</code> is pretty close to a minimalist call to the physics engine’s <code>intersect_ray</code>, so we can use this as a baseline. Remember that even this has some overhead from the pointer chasing function call. I’ve also benchmarked each of the versions of the code we’ve discussed. Each benchmark runs 10,000 iterations of the function under test, with warmup and outlier filtering. I disabled GC collection during the tests. I like to run my game benchmarks on weaker hardware so you may get better results if you repro, but it’s the relative numbers that we care about.</p><p>Our setup is a simple scene containing a single circle collider that our ray always hits. We’re interested in measuring binding overhead, not the performance of the physics engine itself. We’re dealing with timings for individual rays measured in nanoseconds, so these numbers may look inconsequentially small. To better illustrate their significance, I also report “calls per frame” giving the number of times the functions could be called in in a single frame at 60fps and 120fps if the game did nothing but trivial raycasts.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Time (μs)</th><th>Baseline multiple</th><th>Per frame (60fps)</th><th>Per frame (120fps)</th><th>GC alloc (bytes)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>ForceRaycastUpdate</code> (raw engine speed, not useful)</td><td>0.49</td><td>1.00</td><td>34,000</td><td>17,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormalWithNode</code></td><td>0.97</td><td>1.98</td><td>17,200</td><td>8,600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>CachingRayCaster.GetDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>7.71</td><td>15.73</td><td>2,200</td><td>1,100</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>24.23</td><td>49.45</td><td>688</td><td>344</td><td>728</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Those are some significant differences!</p><p>We might expect that the fastest way to do a raycast in a reasonable engine/API is to use the function exposed for doing exactly that, <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/ray-casting.html#raycast-query">which is taught as the canonical way in the documentation</a>. As we can see, if we do that, the binding/API overhead makes this 50X slower than the raw physics engine speed. Ouch!</p><p>Using that same API but being sensible (if awkward) about caching, we can get that down to only 16X overhead. This is better, but still awful.</p><p>If our aim here is to get practical performance, we have to sidestep the proper/canonical/advertised API completely, and instead clunkily manipulate scene objects to exploit them to do our query for us. In a sensible world moving objects around in the scene and asking them to do raycasts for us would be slower than calling the raw physics API, but in fact it’s 8X faster.</p><p>Even the node approach is 2X slower than the raw speed of the engine (which we’re actually underestimating). This means that half of the time in that function is being spent on setting two properties and reading three properties. The binding overhead is large enough that five property accesses takes as long as a raycast. Let that sink in. <em>Let’s not even think about the fact that in the real world we may well want to set and read even more properties, such as setting the layer mask and reading the hit collider</em>.</p><p>At the lower end, those numbers are actually very limiting. My current project needs more than 344 raycasts per frame, and of course it does a lot more than just raycasting. This test is a trivial scene with a single collider, if we were making the raycast do actual work in a more complex scene these numbers would be even lower! The documentation’s standard way of doing raycasts would grind my whole game to a halt.</p><p>We also can’t forget about the garbage creating allocations that happen in C#. I usually write games with a zero garbage per frame policy.</p><p><em>Just for fun, I also benchmarked Unity. It does a full useful raycast, with parameter setting and result retrieval, in about 0.52μs. Before Godot’s binding overhead, the core physics engines have comparable speed.</em></p><h2 id="have-i-cherrypicked"><span>Have I cherrypicked?</span><a href="#have-i-cherrypicked"><i></i></a></h2><p>When I posted the reddit thread, a number of people said that the physics API is uniquely bad and that it isn’t representative of the whole engine. I certainly didn’t intentionally cherrypick it - it just so happens that raycasting was the very first thing I attempted when checking out Godot. However, perhaps I’m being a little unfair, so let’s examine that.</p><p>If I had wanted to cherrypick a worse method, I wouldn’t have had to look far. Right next to <code>IntersectRay</code> are <code>IntersectPoint</code> and <code>IntersectShape</code>, both of which share all of the same problems as <code>IntersectRay</code> with the additional craziness that they can have multiple results, so they return a heap allocated managed <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;Dictionary&gt;</code>! Oh by the way, that <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> is actually a typed wrapper around <code>Godot.Collections.Array</code>, so every 8 byte reference to a dictionary is actually stored as a 20 byte <code>Variant</code>. Clearly I haven’t picked the very worst method in the API!</p><p>If we scan the whole Godot API (via C# reflection) we luckily find that there aren’t that many things which return <code>Dictionary</code>. There’s an eclectic list including the <code>AnimationNode._GetChildNodes</code> method, the <code>Bitmap.Data</code> property, the <code>Curve2D._Data</code> property (and 3D), some things in <code>GLTFSkin</code>, some <code>TextServer</code> stuff, some <code>NavigationAgent2D</code> pieces, etc. None of those are great places to have slow heap allocated dictionaries, but none of them are as bad as the physics API.</p><p>However, in my experience, very few engine APIs get as much use as physics. If I look at the engine API calls in my gameplay code, they’re probably 80% physics and transforms.</p><p>Let’s also remember that <code>Dictionary</code> is only part of the problem. If we look a little wider for things returning <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;T&gt;</code> (remember: heap allocated, contents as <code>Variant</code>) we find lots from physics, mesh &amp; geometry manipulation, navigation, tilemaps, rendering, and more.</p><p>Physics may be a particularly bad (but essential) area of the API, but the heap allocated type problems, as well as the general slowness of the pointer chasing, are deeply rooted throughout.</p><h2 id="so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><span>So why are we waiting for Godot?</span><a href="#so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><i></i></a></h2><p>Godot’s primary scripting language is GDScript, a dynamically typed interpreted language where almost all non primitives are heap allocated, i.e. it doesn’t have a struct analogue. That sentence should have set off a cacophony of performance alarms in your head. I’ll give you a moment for your ears to stop ringing.</p><p>If we look at how Godot’s C++ core exposes its API we’ll see something interesting.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This one shared mechanism is used to generate the bindings for all three scripting interfaces; GDSCript, C#, and GDExtensions. <code>ClassDB</code> collects function pointers and metadata about each of the API functions, which is then piped through various code generation systems to create the bindings for each language.</p><p>This means that every API function is designed primarily to serve the limitations of GDScript. <code>IntersectRay</code> returns an untyped dynamic <code>Dictionary</code> because GDScript doesn’t have structs. Our C# and even our GDExtensions C++ code has to pay the catastrophic price for that.</p><p>This way of handling binding via function pointers also leads to significant overhead, as we’ve seen from simple property accesses being slow. Remember, each call first does a memory lookup to find the function pointer it wants to call, then it does another lookup to find the function pointer of a secondary function which is actually responsible for calling the function, then it calls the secondary function passing it the pointer to the primary function. All along that journey there’s extra validation code, branching, and type conversions. C# (and obviously C++) has a fast mechanism for calling into native code via P/Invoke, but Godot simply doesn’t use it.</p><p><strong>Godot has made a philosophical decision to be slow.</strong> The only practical way to interact with the engine is via this binding layer, and its core design prevents it from ever being fast. No amount of optimising the implementation of <code>Dictionary</code> or speeding up the physics engine is going to get around the fact we’re passing large heap allocated values around when we should be dealing with tiny structs. While C# and GDScript APIs remain synchronised, this will always hold the engine back.</p><h2 id="okay-lets-fix-it-then"><span>Okay, let’s fix it then!</span><a href="#okay-lets-fix-it-then"><i></i></a></h2><h3 id="what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><span>What can we do without deviating from the existing binding layer?</span><a href="#what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><i></i></a></h3><p>If we assume that we still need to keep all of our APIs GDScript compatible, there are a few areas where we can probably improve things, although it won’t be pretty. Let’s go back to our <code>IntsersectRay</code> example.</p><ul><li><code>GetWorld2D().DirectStateSpace</code> could be compressed to one call instead of two by introducing <code>GetWorld2DStateSpace()</code>.</li><li>The <code>PhysicsRayQueryParameters2D</code> issues could be removed by adding an overload which takes all of the fields as parameters. This would bring us roughly inline with the <code>CachedRayCaster</code> performance (16X baseline) without having to do caching.</li><li>The <code>Dictionary</code> allocation could be removed by allowing us to pass in a cached/pooled dictionary to write into. This is ugly and clumsy compared to a struct, but it would remove the allocation.</li><li>The dictionary lookup process is still ridiculously slow. We might be able to improve on that by instead returning a class with the expected properties. The allocation here could be eliminated with the cached/pooled approach the same way it could with <code>Dictionary</code>.</li></ul><p>These options aren’t pretty or ergonomic for the user, but if we’re in the business of doing ugly patches to get things running, they would probably work. This would fix the allocations but we’d still probably only be about 4X the baseline because of all of the pointer chasing across the boundary and managing of cached values.</p><p>It may also be possible to improve the generated code for all of the pointer chasing shenanigans. I haven’t studied this in detail yet, but if there are wins to find there then they’d apply to the whole API across the board, which would be cool! We could probably at least get away with removing the validation and the <code>try</code> <code>finally</code> in release builds.</p><h3 id="what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><span>What if we’re allowed to add additional APIs for C# and GDExtensions which aren’t GDScript compatible?</span><a href="#what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><i></i></a></h3><p>Now we’re talking! If we open up this possibility* then in theory we could augment the <code>ClassDB</code> bindings with better ones that deal directly in structs and go through the proper P/Invoke mechanisms. This is the path to viable performance.</p><p>Unfortunately, duplicating the entire API with better versions like this would create quite a mess. There might be ways through this by marking things <code>[Deprecated]</code> and trying to guide the user in the right direction, but issues such as naming clashes would get ugly.</p><p>* Maybe this is already possible, but I haven’t found it yet. Let me know!</p><h3 id="what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><span>What if we tear it all down and start again?</span><a href="#what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><i></i></a></h3><p>This option obviously has a lot of short term pain. Godot 4.0 has only recently happened, and now I’m talking about a backcompat breaking complete API redux like a Godot 5.0. However, if I’m honest with myself, I see this as the only viable path to the engine being in a good place in three years time. Mixing fast and slow APIs as discussed above would leave us with headaches for decades - a trap I expect the engine will probably fall into.</p><p><del>In my opinion, if Godot were to go down this route, GDScript should probably be dropped entirely. I don’t really see the point of it when C# exists, and supporting it causes so much hassle. I’m clearly completely at odds with the lead Godot devs and the project philosophy on this point, so I have no expectation that this will happen. Who knows though - Unity eventually dropped UnityScript for full C#, maybe Godot will one day take the same step. Foreshadowing?</del></p><p>Edit: I’m taking the above out for now. I don’t personally care about GDScript, but other people do and I don’t want to take it away from them. I have no objection to C# and GDScript sitting beside each other with different APIs each optimised for the respective language’s needs.</p><h2 id="was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><span>Was the title of this article melodramatic clickbait?</span><a href="#was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><i></i></a></h2><p>Maybe a little. Not a lot.</p><p>There will be people who were making games in Unity who can make those same games in Godot without these issues mattering too much. Godot may be able to capture the lower end of Unity’s market. However, Unity’s recent focus on performance is a good indicator that there’s demand for it. I know that I certainly care about it. Godot’s performance is not just worse than Unity’s, it’s dramatically and systematically worse.</p><p>In some projects 95% of the CPU load is in an algorithm which never touches the engine APIs. In that case, none of this matters. (The GC always matters, but we can use GDExtensions to avoid that.) For many others, good programmatic interaction with physics/collisions and manually modifying the properties of large numbers of objects are essential to the project.</p><p>For many others, it’s important to know that they can do these things if they need to. Maybe you get two years into your project thinking it will barely need raycasts at all, then you make a late game decision to add some custom CPU particles that need to be able to check collisions. It’s a small aesthetic change, but suddenly you need an engine API and you’re in trouble.

<h3>from the <i>abusing-the-orange-book,-green-with-greed</i> dept</h3>

<p>For many, many years we’ve detailed how big pharma companies, who only care about the monopoly rents they can receive on medicine while under patent, have concocted <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/05/20/big-pharma-companies-accused-conspiring-to-inflate-prices-over-100-generic-drugs-up-to-1000/">all sorts</a> of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2009/12/07/pay-for-delay-agreements-again-show-how-pharma-abuses-patent-law-to-harm-us-all/">scams</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/24/why-are-drug-prices-so-high-because-asshole-mckinsey-consultants-figure-out-ways-to-re-patent-same-drugs-over-over/">schemes</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/10/thanks-to-evergreening-and-legal-threats-abbvie-has-earned-114-billion-since-2016-from-a-drug-whose-key-patent-expired-back-then/">avoid</a> having to compete with generic versions, even after their patents have expired (or been invalidated). But one of their older tricks is apparently popular yet again, though the FTC is now warning pharma that it <em>might</em> finally start cracking down.</p>
<p>If it does, it will just be reinforcing the kinds of actions the FTC used to bring. Twenty years ago, the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/0110046-bristol-myers-squibb-company-matter">FTC went after Bristol Meyer Squibb</a> for false listings in the Orange Book. The Orange Book, managed by the FDA, is where pharma companies list the FDA-approved drugs they have under patent, which alerts generic drug companies basically not to make generic versions of those drugs.</p>
<p>But, of course, this creates a very tempting scenario: if pharma can get drugs not actually under patent into the Orange Book, they effectively save themselves from generic competition, and they get to profit massively (at the expense of the public and their need for affordable medicine).</p>
<p>However, despite enforcement against such abuse years ago, it seems that the FTC and the FDA have kinda let these things slip over the past few years. And Big Pharma has really taken advantage of that. Thankfully, it looks like the FTC is finally interested in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-issues-policy-statement-brand-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-improper-listing-patents-food-drug">cracking down on this practice again</a>. In <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p239900orangebookpolicystatement092023.pdf">a new policy statement</a>, it warns pharma companies that it’s looking into the abuse of the Orange Book and sham patent inclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brand drug manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their patents are properly listed. Yet certain manufacturers have submitted patents for listing in the Orange Book that claim neither the reference listed drug nor a method of using it. When brand drug manufacturers abuse the regulatory processes set up by Congress to promote generic drug competition, the result may be to increase the cost of and reduce access to prescription drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this policy statement is to put market participants on notice that the FTC intends to scrutinize improper Orange Book listings to determine whether these constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this raises some questions, including why do we make the pharma companies themselves the party responsible for making sure their patents are “properly” listed. Why don’t we have at least some process in place for these listings to be reviewed, whether when they’re submitted to the Orange Book or even if another party (such as the generic drug manufacturers) contest an Orange Book listing.</p>
<p>It seems the dumbest possible system is to assume that the Big Pharma companies will be honest in their Orange Book listings.</p>
<p>And, even though the FTC is now putting these companies “on notice,” the fact that the FTC has brought these cases in the past seems like it should be “notice” enough. Instead, it sounds like the FTC let enough pharma companies get away with this for long enough that the big pharma firms felt cleared to abuse the system this way and to delay competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The one thing I find interesting in this statement, is that they note that improperly listing things in the Orange Book may “constitute illegal monopolization.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The improper listing of patents in the Orange Book may also constitute illegal monopolization. Monopolization requires proof of “the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.” This requires proof that “the defendant has engaged in improper conduct that has or is likely to have the effect of controlling prices or excluding competition,” and courts have recognized that improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may constitute an “improper means” of competition. Accordingly, improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may also be worthy of enforcement scrutiny from government and private enforcers under a monopolization theory. Additionally, the FTC may also scrutinize a firm’s history of improperly listing patents during merger review</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems exactly correct, but notable in that very few people seem to recognize that (1) patents are government granted monopolies, and thus (2) an abuse of the patent system to get a patent or patent-like protections you don’t deserve are therefore an <em>illegal</em> monopoly seems like an important point. I would hope that this could get expanded to other abuses of patent and copyright law as well.</p>
<p>Still, given that we’ve been facing this and multiple other schemes from Big Pharma to delay generics for decades, I’m not sure anything is really going to change just yet, but at least the FTC is waking up (again?) to this issue. Now let’s see if it actually starts bringing cases…</p>

            <guid>37560787</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:24:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/apple-tv/">https://tailscale.com/blog/apple-tv/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37560787">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Today we’re expanding the list of devices that can run Tailscale, bringing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037?platform=appleTV">secure remote networking to the Apple TV</a>. The newly released tvOS 17 offers support for VPNs, and we’re proud to say Tailscale is among the first to use this new feature. You can now <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1280/appletv/">add your Apple TV directly to your tailnet</a>, unlocking three powerful new use cases that we’re excited to share.</p>

    
    

<figure>
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/assets/84113/1695058417-3840x2160bb.png?auto=format" alt="A screenshot of the Tailscale app for Apple TV in light mode." width="3840" height="2160">
    
</figure>

<p>First up, if you already have anything like a “media server” in your life, the benefits of integrating your Apple TV into the same Tailscale network are large. Lots of people already use Tailscale with Plex or Jellyfin servers, <a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/">homelab set-ups</a>, and <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1074/connect-to-your-nas/">NAS devices</a> to securely share their collections and stream from them while on the go. Today’s release makes it that much simpler to do so right on your TV.</p>
<p>With up to three users available <a href="https://tailscale.com/pricing/">on our Free plan</a>, you’ve got tools to make a media drive available to other trusted people in your life. You can share a collection of family photos and home videos into a faraway relative’s tailnet, without worrying about locking down the server for public internet access.</p>
<p>But even if you don’t have a media server to connect to, you can use Tailscale’s Apple TV app to select another device in your tailnet, like a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or even an Android phone, to use as an exit node. This will route all your Apple TV’s traffic through that connection, providing an extra layer of privacy from the local network where you’re using the Apple TV and making your traffic appear to originate from the machine of your choice.</p>
<p>Compare that to a “traditional” VPN option, where your traffic is routed through a commercial data center (which itself may be blocked by sites and services) and where you must trust the VPN provider not to spy on or tamper with your traffic. With a Tailscale exit node, you’re in control and you get the internet connection you’re used to. This new feature could come in handy if you’re traveling with your Apple TV and want to access the same geo-restricted channels you can see from home.</p>
<p>Finally, the new Tailscale client allows an Apple TV to be an exit node itself for other machines in your tailnet. This one might require a little more explaining; after all, not a lot of Apple TV apps advertise features that are most useful when you’re away from your Apple TV.</p>
<p>But look at it this way: your Apple TV device is a capable little computer, and it stays connected to your tailnet even when it’s not in active use. Download and configure Tailscale now and you can securely route any of your other devices’ traffic through your Apple TV&nbsp; — and by extension, through your home internet connection — even when you’re on the other side of the planet. Whether you want another layer of security and privacy on sketchy Wi-Fi networks or just want to connect back through your personal internet connection when you’re on the road, you’re set with the Apple TV as an exit node.</p>
<p>At Tailscale, we’re the kind of nerds who have home server closets and who will stock up on Raspberry Pis just because they’re available again. Our favorite thing about bringing Tailscale to tvOS is you don’t have to be that kind of nerd to be able to tap into the power of Tailscale in your home.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an Apple TV running the new tvOS 17, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037?platform=appleTV">download the Tailscale app</a> today!</p>

<p><em>A joint blog post between the Internet Archive and the IIIF Community</em></p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>After <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2015/10/23/zoom-in-to-9-3-million-internet-archive-books-and-images-through-iiif/">eight years</a> hosting an <a href="https://iiif.archivelab.org/">experimental IIIF service</a> for public benefit, the Internet Archive is moving forward with important steps to make its <a href="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF) service official. Each year, the Internet Archive receives feedback from friends and partners asking about our long-term plans for supporting IIIF. In response, the Internet Archive is announcing an official IIIF service which aims to increase the resourcing and reliability of the Internet Archive’s IIIF service, upgrade the service to utilize the latest version 3.0 of the IIIF specification, and graduate the service from the iiif.archivelab.org domain to iiif.archive.org. The upgrade also expands the Internet Archive’s IIIF support beyond images to also include audio, movies, and collections — enabling deep zoom on high-resolution images, comparative item analysis, portability across media players, annotation support, and more. </p>

<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>



<p>In 2015, a team of enthusiastic Internet Archive volunteers from a group called <a href="https://archivelab.org/">Archive Labs</a> implemented an experimental IIIF service to give partners and patrons new ways of using <a href="https://archive.org/">Archive.org</a> images and texts. You can read more about the project’s origins and ambitions in <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2015/10/23/zoom-in-to-9-3-million-internet-archive-books-and-images-through-iiif/">this 2015 announcement blog post</a>. The initial service provided researchers with an easy, standardized way to crop and reference specific regions of archive.org images. (Maybe you can tell <a href="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/clevelandart-1940.743-mona-lisa$1940.743_full.jpg/800,750,300,100/full/0/default.jpg">whose eyes these are</a>?) By making Internet Archive images and texts IIIF-compatible, they may be opened using any number of compatible <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">IIIF viewer apps</a>, each offering their own advantages and unique features. For instance, <a href="https://projectmirador.org/">Mirador</a> is a “multi-up” viewer that makes it easy for researchers to view different images side by side and then zoom into or annotate different areas of interest within each image.</p>



<p>Since its launch more than seven years ago, the IIIF labs service has received millions of requests by more than 15 universities and GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) organizations across the globe, including <a href="https://fromthepage.com/landing">University of Texas</a>, UCD Digital Library, Havana University, <a href="https://dlg.usg.edu/record/agb_usda-nurseryandseedcatalog_cat31338200?canvas=0&amp;x=1406&amp;y=1866&amp;w=16960">Digital Library of Georgia</a>, <a href="https://biostor.org/viewer/viewer.php?manifest_uri=https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/biostor-10974/manifest.json#?c=&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;cv=&amp;xywh=-4117%2C-345%2C12733%2C6888">BioStor</a>, Emory University, and <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. In this time, the broader IIIF ecosystem itself has blossomed to include <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1faJRKJpj2Vau__RDwt8af040x0GTVozp&amp;usp=sharing">hundreds of participating institutions</a>. For all its benefits, the labs IIIF service has been considered “unofficial,” hosted on the separate <a href="https://archivelab.org/">archivelab.org</a> domain, and several partners have voiced interest in the Internet Archive adopting it as an officially supported service. Today, several members of the IIIF community are collaborating with the Internet Archive to make this happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://iiif.io/community/consortium/staff/">Josh Hadro</a>, managing director of the IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C), sees the Internet Archive as filling a critical role “in serving the average Internet user who may not benefit from the same access to or affiliation with infrastructure offered by traditional research institutions.” The IIIF-C promotes interoperability as a core element of IIIF: the ability to streamline access to information and make cultural materials as easy to use and reuse as possible. Because the Internet Archive enables any patron to upload eligible materials, everyone has the opportunity to benefit from IIIF’s capabilities. IIIF-C counts the Internet Archive as a natural ally because of its ongoing support of open collections delivered via open web standards and protocols. With this project, IIIF-C hopes to make the Internet Archive a go-to resource online that facilitates IIIF work for students and scholars unaffiliated with the kinds of institutions that historically have provided IIIF infrastructure. This is an essential step toward a strategic goal of lowering barriers to IIIF usage and adoption worldwide.</p>



<p>In service of this outcome, the Internet Archive has teamed up with a number of IIIF community members to officialize and upgrade the IIIF service in order to make the best use of the new capabilities introduced into the IIIF specifications in recent years.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, we’ll share more details about the IIIF improvements that will become available to users of the Internet Archive. First, we want to lay out our current plan for the update, including backwards compatibility affordances, to ensure existing consumers have the information they need to successfully migrate from the unofficial to the official IIIF API.</p>



<h2>Thanks</h2>



<p>Both the original IIIF labs service the Internet Archive has been running, as well as the new upcoming official IIIF service, wouldn’t have been possible without huge support from <strong>volunteers within the IIIF community</strong> and Internet Archive staff. A big thank you to the following folks who are making this effort to bring IIIF into production possible:</p>

<h2>Technical Notes &amp; FAQs for Partners</h2>



<p><em>This technical section is intended for partners who currently rely on the iiif.archivelab.org IIIF API who may be seeking further details on how these changes might affect them.</em></p>



<p><strong>What is changing? </strong>Previously, partners accessed the Internet Archive’s IIIF labs API from the&nbsp; <a href="http://iiif.archivelab.org/">iiif.<strong>archivelab.org</strong></a> domain. As part of the effort to graduate from labs to production, the IIIF API will move to the <a href="http://iiif.archive.org/">iiif.<strong>archive.org</strong></a> domain. Because we don’t want to break any of the amazing projects and exhibits that patrons have created using the existing IIIF capabilities on the <a href="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/documentation">archivelab.org domain,</a> we’re migrating the API in phases.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Phasing migration. </strong>The first phase will introduce a new and improved, official Internet Archive IIIF 3.0 service on the iiif.archive.org subdomain. The unofficial, legacy service will continue to run on the iiif.archivelab.org for a grace period, allowing partners to migrate. Once we’ve gathered enough data to be confident requests are being satisfactorily fulfilled by the new official service, the legacy iiif.archivelab.org service will be “sunset” and any request to it will redirect to use the official iiif.archive.org service. At this point, all requests for IIIF manifests and IIIF images (whether to iiif.archivelab.org or iiif.archive.org) will default to the latest 3.0 version of the IIIF APIs and be answered by iiif.archive.org. A specifiable “version” endpoint will be available for consumers whose applications require manifests and images to be served using the IIIF v2.0 legacy format. More details, examples, and technical documentation will be made available on this topic in the coming weeks and will eventually be accessible from iiif.archive.org.</p>



<p><strong>Possible Breaking Changes.</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> When the iiif.archivelab.org service was originally launched, iiif.archive.org was set up to redirect to iiif.archivelab.org as a convenience. Regrettably, during the first phase of development, iiif.archive.org will no longer be a redirect for iiif.archivelab.org and instead will run the new official IIIF service. As a result, partners whose code or applications reference iiif.archive.org (expecting it to redirect to iiif.archivelab.org) will experience a breaking change and will need to either update their references to explicitly refer to the legacy “iiif.archivelab.org” service, or update their code to use the Internet Archive’s new official iiif.archive.org service. As far as we can tell, we’re unaware of partners currently referencing “iiif.archive.org”&nbsp; within public projects on Github or Gitlab and so we hope no one is affected. Still, we want to give fair warning here. For those starting a new project and looking to use the Internet Archive’s IIIF offerings today, we strongly recommend using the iiif.archive.org endpoint.<br><strong>2. </strong>Some partners migrating from the v2 to v3 API who have been saving annotations may also experience a breaking changes because canvas and manifest identifiers for version 3 are necessarily different from version 2 identifiers. We will be doing our best, for the time being, to ensure version 2.0 manifests remain accessible from the archivelab.org address (via redirects) and will retain the iiif.archivelab.org canvas identifiers.</p>

<p>Hello Windows Insiders,</p>
<p>Today we are beginning to roll out an update for the Paint app to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels (version 11.2308.18.0 or higher). With this update, we are introducing support for layers and transparency!</p>
<p>You can now add, remove, and manage layers on the canvas to create richer and more complex digital art. With layers, you can stack shapes, text, and other image elements on top of each other. To get started, click on the new Layers button in the toolbar, which will open a panel on the side of the canvas. This is where you can add new layers to the canvas. Try changing the order of layers in this panel to see how the order of stacked image elements on the canvas changes. You can also show or hide and duplicate individual layers or merge layers together.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176579"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_Layers.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_Layers-1024x642.png" alt="Paint composition of a cat utilizing multiple layers." width="1024" height="642"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176579">Paint composition of a cat utilizing multiple layers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are adding support for transparency as well, including the ability to open and save transparent PNGs! When working with a single layer, you will notice a checkerboard pattern on the canvas indicating the portions of the image that are transparent. Erasing any content from the canvas now truly erases the content instead of painting the area white. When working with multiple layers, if you erase content on one layer, you will reveal the content in layers underneath.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176580"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_BGLayers.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_BGLayers.gif" alt="Short animation showing the background getting removed in Paint." width="2063" height="1403"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176580">Short animation showing the background getting removed in Paint.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you combine layers, transparency, and other tools in Paint, you can create exciting new images and artwork! For example, when combined with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/09/07/background-removal-in-paint-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">new background removal feature</a>, you can quickly create interesting layered compositions.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK: Please file feedback in&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://aka.ms/paintfeedback"><strong>Feedback Hub (WIN + F)&nbsp;under Apps &gt; Paint</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><em>[PLEASE NOTE: We are beginning to roll these experiences out, so they may not be available to all Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels just yet as we plan to monitor feedback and see how it lands before pushing it out to everyone.]</em></p>
<p>We love getting feedback from the community and are looking forward to your feedback on these updates!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Dave Grochocki, Principal Product Manager Lead – Windows Inbox Apps</p>

                 <div>StandBy is a new full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance while iPhone is on its side and charging. StandBy is perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter, and can be personalized to display a range of clock styles, favorite photos, or widgets, including Smart Stacks, which surface the right widgets at the right time. StandBy also displays full-screen Live Activities, Siri results, incoming calls, and larger notifications. With the Always-On display, StandBy stays on to show useful information, and with Night Mode, StandBy adapts to low light, so clocks, photos, and widgets take on a beautiful red tone. When using a MagSafe charger, StandBy will remember a user’s preferred view for that MagSafe charging dock.&nbsp;

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues. NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, lets users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing their iPhone devices together. With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity. And later this year, AirDrop will add the ability to continue transfers over the internet when a user steps out of AirDrop range.

                 <div>Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a new transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction —&nbsp;improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. Sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes, and the refreshed design better supports typing by temporarily underlining corrected words and allowing users to revert back with just a tap. Inline predictive text helps quickly finish sentences, while Dictation’s new speech recognition model brings improved accuracy.&nbsp;

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Journal is a new iPhone app that helps users reflect on everyday moments and special events in their lives. To help inspire a user’s journal entry, personalized suggestions can be intelligently curated from a user’s recent activity, such as photos, people, places, workouts, and more, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. The Journal app and Journaling Suggestions API will be available in a software update later this year.

<li>Profiles in <strong>Safari</strong> keep browsing — such as history, cookies, extensions, Tab Groups, and Favorites — separate for topics like work and personal. Private Browsing now locks when not in use and adds greater protection, both from trackers as a user browses, and from people who might have access to a user’s device.</li>

                 <div><ul>

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Health</strong> app offers new mental health features. Users can log their daily moods and momentary emotions; see what might be contributing to their state of mind; and easily access depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics, plus resources available in their region. Additionally, increasing the distance the device is viewed from can help children lower their risk of myopia and gives adult users the opportunity to reduce digital eyestrain. Screen Distance in <strong>Screen Time</strong> uses the TrueDepth camera to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches from their face for an extended period of time.</li>

<li><strong>Privacy</strong> updates include Communication Safety expanding beyond Messages to help keep kids safe when sending and receiving content via AirDrop, Contact Posters, a FaceTime message, and when using the Photos picker to choose content to send. It also expands to cover video content in addition to still images. A new feature, Sensitive Content Warning, helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on-device, so Apple does not get access to the content.</li>

<h2>The joys of maintenance programming</h2>
<p>26 Feb 2011</p>

<div>
  <p>In the old days when I started programming, green programmers trying to build their skills and get experience started out doing maintenance programming. Only the old hands got to write new code. The newbies cut their teeth debugging and fixing musty old code that still worked for the business. I’ve done my share of new development, but today I do maintenance programming almost exclusively. After working on way too many failed ground-up “green fields” projects I prefer to debug, fix, and enhance production software. I like working with real users rather than making up “use cases.” I prefer building confidence and making my clients happy with my work rather than arguing with them about features, specs, budget, and schedule. I like having a prioritized list of well-defined tasks that refer to existing code rather than trying to blue-sky specifications. I like charging by the hour instead of by the project, and not having clients balk at my rate.</p>

<p>I mainly work with web applications now, and I specialize in database-backed web sites. I rarely take on new development projects, but I frequently get called to salvage projects that went bad. Clients fire their developers (and vice-versa) leaving production code orphaned. Developers put their energy into new development and don’t respond to bugs or enhancement requests from old clients. I charge by the hour and I get the job because I don’t tell clients they need to throw everything away and start from scratch — something they get from other consultants.</p>

<p>Software often stays in use longer than anyone expected when it was written — until recently I supported a law office billing system that was written in 1986 using OMNIS 3 and wouldn’t run on any Macintosh newer than an SE/30. Clients who depend on legacy systems will pay plenty to keep those systems running, because they can’t risk their business on new software, and they can’t afford to fund new software development and the subsequent data migration and training. There’s a rich vein of maintenance work out there that most programmers turn up their noses at, preferring ground-up development projects that neither they nor their client are well-suited for.</p>

<h3 id="some-of-the-benefits-of-maintenance-programming">Some of the benefits of maintenance programming:</h3>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-debug">You’ll learn how to debug</h4>
<p>Debugging someone else’s code requires more effort and rigor than debugging your own. You have to track down problems step by step; you can’t assume you know what’s wrong and jump to a quick fix. Reading and debugging foreign code makes you think about how the code works (or doesn’t) rather than what you think it should do.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-program-better">You’ll learn how to program better</h4>
<p>You can debug and extend good code easier than bad code, so you will learn how to tell them apart. You will have to reason about the code and deduce the original programmer’s intent. Skilled programmers recognize what makes good code good, and what makes bad code bad, and working with lots of code will impart that skill. You will develop a knack for finding your way around an unfamiliar code base and recognizing bad code smells.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-optimize">You’ll learn how to optimize</h4>
<p>The original programmers already made the premature optimizations, so you get to identify and fix real efficiency problems and performance bottlenecks. Ground-up development project teams often spend a lot of time and energy worrying about performance issues that may never materialize. Working systems have real, identifiable performance problems. Finding and fixing performance problems can be fun, and it’s a great skill. Clients always notice and appreciate you making their application more efficient.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-new-to-you-skills-and-tools">You’ll learn new (to you) skills and tools</h4>
<p>You may not get to work with the language du jour, but you will get to learn languages, libraries, tools, and production environments you probably wouldn’t learn otherwise. You’ll find a lot more work involving common, mainstream business tools. Ground-up development projects often bog down just deciding which language and tools to use. You won’t have to make those decisions, sell them to your client, or get blamed for them. You’ll spend time learning some obscure and proprietary tools and languages, but those can pay off too. Larger companies with their own IT departments do their own maintenance work, but often hire contractors with specialized knowledge and experience.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-to-value-data-and-databases">You’ll learn to value data and databases</h4>
<p>Applications still typically follow the input -&gt; process -&gt; output model from old data processing textbooks. You have to understand the data and how it moves through a system before the code makes sense. Almost all applications use a database of some kind, usually a relational database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). A skilled programmer knows relational concepts and how to navigate a production database. Not understanding databases cripples programmers and leads them to write lots of bad code to do what the DBMS should handle. I frequently refactor pages of slow, buggy application code away by replacing it with SQL.</p>

<h4 id="clients-will-appreciate-everything-you-do">Clients will appreciate everything you do</h4>
<p>Every bug you fix and enhancement you make improves an application people already use. Real users will notice the changes and give immediate feedback. When you develop new software from the ground up every spec change, delay, and additional expense can cause conflict with your client. When you address actual problems everything you deliver makes your client happy.</p>

<h4 id="you-will-have-better-specs-and-clear-constraints">You will have better specs and clear constraints</h4>
<p>Fixes and enhancements are smaller and better-defined tasks than ground-up development, and the existing code and environment constrains your choices. You have to focus on solving a real problem. You and your client can agree on the tasks with less chance of misunderstanding. With new clients I build the relationship by asking them to list just the top five pains they have with their software, then I offer to fix those, and promise not to charge if I can’t.</p>

<h4 id="easier-to-walk-away-from-bad-clients">Easier to walk away from bad clients</h4>
<p>We all get involved with clients we don’t want to work with. It’s a lot harder to get out of the relationship if you have a contract for a big development project, time and money invested, and the big expectations clients always have for new systems. Maintenance work is shorter-term and the tasks are smaller, so you have more opportunities to terminate the relationship without breaking a contract or either side losing money.</p>

<h4 id="agile-by-default">Agile by default</h4>
<p>Fixing bugs and making important enhancements let you work in agile mode without having to sell a methodology to your client. They will want things fixed right away, so you can make incremental releases, collaborate with real users and get immediate feedback, and work with a few bite-size tasks with a defined finish line.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-about-business">You’ll learn about business</h4>
<p>By definition, production software addresses at least some real business need. Learning how it does, and does not, work for the business, and working with real stakeholders familiar with the software forces you to learn something about the business. Knowing something about business applications will boost your career more than learning a new programming language.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-people-skills">You’ll learn people skills</h4>
<p>Programmers in ground-up development mainly work with each other. New systems don’t have real users; instead you get use cases and management stakeholders. Maintenance programmers get to work with real users, often the people on the floor who work directly with the application and experience the bugs and where the software doesn’t match the reality of their job. Learning to listen to and talk to people who don’t have the same assumptions and culture of programmers broadens your perspective and gets you out of the programmer shell.</p>

<h4 id="youll-get-follow-on-business-and-referrals">You’ll get follow-on business and referrals</h4>
<p>Who do you think gets more repeat business and referrals: a great car salesperson, or a great mechanic? People need their software fixed and enhanced more often than they need a new system developed. And your satisfied clients will send referrals your way because they have friends and colleagues who have broken software systems too.</p>

<h4 id="your-work-wont-be-off-shored">Your work won’t be off-shored</h4>
<p>But you may end up maintaining the results of your client’s off-shoring experiments.</p>



<h4 id="wc-27-february-2011-at-237-am">WC, 27 February 2011 at 2:37 am</h4>
<p>Good post! I chose the ‘bugfix’ position at my previous job because I really liked it. (Nobody else wanted it, though.) There’s a thrill in hunting down a bug and fixing it, and proving it was fixed. And the code is always better for it afterwards.</p>

<p>BTW: The input element for ’email’ is named ‘liame’ so non-programmers can’t submit comments.</p>

<h4 id="joe-lee-28-february-2011-at-658-am">joe Lee, 28 February 2011 at 6:58 am</h4>
<p>Thanks for the post! It’s refreshing to see a varied view point to the typical attitude towards maintenance programming.</p>

<p>I completely agree with many of the points above, especially the point of “You’ll learn to value data and databases”, I think “backend” developers who say ” I rather not write sql” rather surprising since that’s what most data interactions with a data store boil down to!</p>

<p>I also think you can potentially learn how to program better as you may be expose to a better way of doing things, but at the same time you can be exposed to a bad way and pick up the same bad habit.</p>

<h4 id="manu-28-february-2011-at-625-pm">Manu, 28 February 2011 at 6:25 pm</h4>
<p>I totally agree with all the points you have mentioned. If you are in consulting maintenance must be very lucrative. I would also say that a lot of maintenance work does get outsourced (for example development of the older releases of a product would get outsourced so the in-house team can focus on new releases). Many programmers might not consider maintenance as glamorous but it has several useful advantages mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that one should try to do a mix of maintenance and new development. Such a profile would be a killer profile. Maintenance will teach you how to write good code but new development will help you put into practice what you learned. Otherwise, that just remains good theoretical knowledge in your mind. I have been doing more maintenance work in a product development company (I sure do not regret it) and started looking for jobs at startups or young companies with small development teams. Such companies prefer that you have done more new development.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years, the AI field has made tremendous progress in developing AI systems that can learn from massive amounts of carefully labeled data. This paradigm of supervised learning has a proven track record for training specialist models that perform extremely well on the task they were trained to do. Unfortunately, there’s a limit to how far the field of AI can go with supervised learning alone. </p><p>Supervised learning is a bottleneck for building more intelligent generalist models that can do multiple tasks and acquire new skills without massive amounts of labeled data. Practically speaking, it’s impossible to label everything in the world. There are also some tasks for which there’s simply not enough labeled data, such as training translation systems for low-resource languages. If AI systems can glean a deeper, more nuanced understanding of reality beyond what’s specified in the training data set, they’ll be more useful and ultimately bring AI closer to human-level intelligence. </p><p>As babies, we learn how the world works largely by observation. We form generalized predictive models about objects in the world by learning concepts such as object permanence and gravity. Later in life, we observe the world, act on it, observe again, and build hypotheses to explain how our actions change our environment by trial and error. </p><p>A working hypothesis is that generalized knowledge about the world, or common sense, forms the bulk of biological intelligence in both humans and animals. This common sense ability is taken for granted in humans and animals, but has remained an open challenge in AI research since its inception. In a way, common sense is the dark matter of artificial intelligence. </p><p>Common sense helps people learn new skills without requiring massive amounts of teaching for every single task. For example, if we show just a few drawings of cows to small children, they’ll eventually be able to recognize any cow they see. By contrast, AI systems trained with supervised learning require many examples of cow images and might still fail to classify cows in unusual situations, such as lying on a beach. How is it that humans can learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice with very little supervision, while fully autonomous driving still eludes our best AI systems trained with thousands of hours of data from human drivers? The short answer is that humans rely on their previously acquired background knowledge of how the world works. </p><p>How do we get machines to do the same?</p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/152694956_207655794383548_8489544025025665441_n.png?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=pJx8xa60PiAAX_vHXjr&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfCeqd2C7vY9bmcrsAZbmv1VOmT9vBzEgzM0YkvhOjoWdA&amp;oe=65236631" alt=""></p><p>We believe that self-supervised learning (SSL) is one of the most promising ways to build such background knowledge and approximate a form of common sense in AI systems.</p><p>Self-supervised learning enables AI systems to learn from orders of magnitude more data, which is important to recognize and understand patterns of more subtle, less common representations of the world.

We’re also highlighting what we believe are some of the most promising new directions of energy-based models for prediction in the presence of uncertainty, joint embedding methods and latent-variable architectures for self-supervised learning and reasoning in AI systems. </p><h2>Self-supervised learning is predictive learning</h2><p>Self-supervised learning obtains supervisory signals from the data itself, often leveraging the underlying structure in the data. The general technique of self-supervised learning is to predict any unobserved or hidden part (or property) of the input from any observed or unhidden part of the input. For example, as is common in NLP, we can hide part of a sentence and predict the hidden words from the remaining words. We can also predict past or future frames in a video (hidden data) from current ones (observed data). Since self-supervised learning uses the structure of the data itself, it can make use of a variety of supervisory signals across co-occurring modalities (e.g., video and audio) and across large data sets — all without relying on labels.</p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148954125_461761118405979_2035914075893596810_n.png?_nc_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=bY12gpB3nI4AX8eJSmA&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAKi1MqcV_5HHxR2VnjbUFdATGK7G8waB5YkPBzoljjcw&amp;oe=65234BD9" alt=""></p><div><p>In self-supervised learning, the system is trained to predict hidden parts of the input (in gray) from visible parts of the input (in green).</p></div><p>As a result of the supervisory signals that inform self-supervised learning, the term “self-supervised learning” is more accepted than the previously used term “unsupervised learning.” Unsupervised learning is an ill-defined and misleading term that suggests that the learning uses no supervision at all. In fact, self-supervised learning is not unsupervised, as it uses far more feedback signals than standard supervised and reinforcement learning methods do. </p><h2>Self-supervised learning for language versus vision</h2><p>Self-supervised learning has had a particularly profound impact on NLP, allowing us to train models such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, and others on large unlabeled text data sets and then use these models for downstream tasks. These models are pretrained in a self-supervised phase and then fine-tuned for a particular task, such as classifying the topic of a text. In the self-supervised pretraining phase, the system is shown a short text (typically 1,000 words) in which some of the words have been masked or replaced. The system is trained to predict the words that were masked or replaced. In doing so, the system learns to represent the meaning of the text so that it can do a good job at filling in “correct” words, or those that make sense in the context.</p><p>Predicting missing parts of the input is one of the more standard tasks for SSL pretraining. To complete a sentence such as “The (blank) chases the (blank) in the savanna,” the system must learn that lions or cheetahs can chase antelope or wildebeests, but that cats chase mice in the kitchen, not the savanna. As a consequence of the training, the system learns to represent the meaning of words, the syntactic role of words, and the meaning of entire texts. </p><p> These techniques, however, can’t be easily extended to new domains, such as CV. Despite promising early results, SSL has not yet brought about the same improvements in computer vision that we have seen in NLP (though this will change). </p><p>The main reason is that it is considerably more difficult to represent uncertainty in the prediction for images than it is for words. When the missing word cannot be predicted exactly (is it “lion” or “cheetah”?), the system can associate a score or a probability to all possible words in the vocabulary: high score for “lion,” “cheetah,” and a few other predators, and low scores for all other words in the vocabulary. </p><p>Training models at this scale also required a model architecture that was efficient in terms of both runtime and memory, without compromising on accuracy. Fortunately, a recent innovation by FAIR in the realm of architecture design led to a new model family called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>RegNets</span></a> that perfectly fit these needs. RegNet models are ConvNets capable of scaling to billions or potentially even trillions of parameters, and can be optimized to fit different runtime and memory limitations.</p><p> But we do not know how to efficiently represent uncertainty when we predict missing frames in a video or missing patches in an image. We cannot list all possible video frames and associate a score to each of them, because there is an infinite number of them. While this problem has limited the performance improvement from SSL in vision, new techniques SSL techniques such as SwAV are starting to beat accuracy records in vision tasks. This is best demonstrated by the SEER system that uses a large convolutional network trained with billions of examples. </p><h2>Modeling the uncertainty in prediction </h2><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148662482_469317657771087_6509708649537324681_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=pdmXmz1tvqsAX_N35vf&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfA0a3ZJ2CNDAMiPWjggJb6lBqM9bomANM7uhpwDmmjueA&amp;oe=65234489" alt=""></p><p> To better understand this challenge, we first need to understand the prediction uncertainty and the way it’s modeled in NLP compared with CV. In NLP, predicting the missing words involves computing a prediction score for every possible word in the vocabulary. While the vocabulary itself is large and predicting a missing word involves some uncertainty, it’s possible to produce a list of all the possible words in the vocabulary together with a probability estimate of the words’ appearance at that location. Typical machine learning systems do so by treating the prediction problem as a classification problem and computing scores for each outcome using a giant so-called softmax layer, which transforms raw scores into a probability distribution over words. With this technique, the uncertainty of the prediction is represented by a probability distribution over all possible outcomes, provided that there is a finite number of possible outcomes. </p><p>In CV, on the other hand, the analogous task of predicting “missing” frames in a video, missing patches in an image, or missing segment in a speech signal involves a prediction of high-dimensional continuous objects rather than discrete outcomes. There are an infinite number of possible video frames that can plausibly follow a given video clip. It is not possible to explicitly represent all the possible video frames and associate a prediction score to them. In fact, we may never have techniques to represent suitable probability distributions over high-dimensional continuous spaces, such as the set of all possible video frames. </p><p>This seems like an intractable problem.</p><h2>A unified view of self-supervised methods</h2><p>There is a way to think about SSL within the unified framework of an energy-based model (EBM). An EBM is a trainable system that, given two inputs, x and y, tells us how incompatible they are with each other. For example, x could be a short video clip, and y another proposed video clip. The machine would tell us to what extent y is a good continuation for x. To indicate the incompatibility between x and y, the machine produces a single number, called an energy. If the energy is low, x and y are deemed compatible; if it is high, they are deemed incompatible. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/157272588_1389905731371138_8776386318723848066_n.png?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=w6Ar2la-WJEAX9YLZv1&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAJJyDyLHEc8uIYQsYsPpZXtApBl5SPdhZGY05wnCUODg&amp;oe=652349AE" alt=""></p><div><p>An energy-based model (EBM) measures the compatibility between an observation x and a proposed prediction y. If x and y are compatible, the energy is a small number; if they are incompatible, the energy is a larger number.</p></div><p>Training an EBM consists of two parts: (1) showing it examples of x and y that are compatible and training it to produce a low energy, and (2) finding a way to ensure that for a particular x, the y values that are incompatible with x produce a higher energy than the y values that are compatible with x. Part one is simple, but part two is where the difficulty lies. </p><p>For image recognition, our model takes two images, x and y, as inputs. If x and y are slightly distorted versions of the same image, the model is trained to produce a low energy on its output. For example, x could be a photo of a car, and y a photo of the same car that was taken from a slightly different location at a different time of day, so that the car in y is shifted, rotated, larger, smaller, and displaying slightly different colors and shadows than the car in x. </p><h3>Joint embedding, Siamese networks</h3><p> A particular well-suited deep learning architecture to do so is the so-called Siamese networks or joint embedding architecture. The idea goes back to papers from Geoff Hinton’s lab and Yann LeCun’s group in the early 1990s (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/355161a0" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a> and <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218001493000339" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>) and mid-2000s (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2004/hash/42fe880812925e520249e808937738d2-Abstract.html" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1467314" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1640964" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>). It was relatively ignored for a long time but has enjoyed a revival since late 2019. A joint embedding architecture is composed of two identical (or almost identical) copies of the same network. One network is fed with x and the other with y. The networks produce output vectors called embeddings, which represent x and y. A third module, joining the networks at the head, computes the energy as the distance between the two embedding vectors. When the model is shown distorted versions of the same image, the parameters of the networks can easily be adjusted so that their outputs move closer together. This will ensure that the network will produce nearly identical representations (or embedding) of an object, regardless of the particular view of that object. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/149794655_780907256142255_4794526832594825319_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=fI5DiGbWpN8AX_3zPVb&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAisGE90k9wterjTaMzrBJoQ3DYN_s1BhpKo8m-sQMc_w&amp;oe=65234375" alt=""></p><div><p>Joint embedding architecture. The function C at the top produces a scalar energy that measures the distance between the representation vectors (embeddings) produced by two identical twin networks sharing the same parameters (w). When x and y are slightly different versions of the same image, the system is trained to produce a low energy, which forces the model to produce similar embedding vectors for the two images. The difficult part is to train the model so that it produces high energy (i.e., different embeddings) for images that are different.</p></div><p>The difficulty is to make sure that the networks produce high energy, i.e. different embedding vectors, when x and y are different images. Without a specific way to do so, the two networks could happily ignore their inputs and always produce identical output embeddings. This phenomenon is called a collapse. When a collapse occurs, the energy is not higher for nonmatching x and y than it is for matching x and y. </p><p>There are two categories of techniques to avoid collapse: contrastive methods and regularization methods.</p><h3>Contrastive energy-based SSL </h3><p>Contrastive methods are based on the simple idea of constructing pairs of x and y that are not compatible, and adjusting the parameters of the model so that the corresponding output energy is large. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/127784209_262471582050413_7179678990272222350_n.gif?_nc_cat=104&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=60iCzPquolkAX_nwICv&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfBgGo-2gVs1odmpRjzOnsv0wUzarDZJEXeLTvwNstFPEw&amp;oe=65233C87" alt=""></p><div><p>Training an EBM with a contrastive method consists in simultaneously pushing down on the energy of compatible (x,y) pairs from the training set, indicated by the blue dots, and pushing up on the energy of well chosen (x,y) pairs that are incompatible, symbolized by the green dots. In this simple example, x and y are both scalars, but in real situations, x and y could be an image or a video with millions of dimensions. Coming up with incompatible pairs that will shape the energy in suitable ways is challenging and expensive computationally. </p></div><p>The method used to train NLP systems by masking or substituting some input words belongs to the category of contrastive methods. But they don’t use the joint embedding architecture. Instead, they use a predictive architecture in which the model directly produces a prediction for y. One starts for a complete segment of text y, then corrupts it, e.g., by masking some words to produce the observation x. The corrupted input is fed to a large neural network that is trained to reproduce the original text y. An uncorrupted text will be reconstructed as itself (low reconstruction error), while a corrupted text will be reconstructed as an uncorrupted version of itself (large reconstruction error). If one interprets the reconstruction error as an energy, it will have the desired property: low energy for “clean” text and higher energy for “corrupted” text. </p><p>The general technique of training a model to restore a corrupted version of an input is called denoising auto-encoder.

Since the model must be able to predict multiple possible outcomes, the prediction is not a single set of words but a series of scores for every word in the vocabulary for each missing word location. </p><p>But we cannot use this trick for images because we cannot enumerate all possible images. Is there a solution to this problem? The short answer is no. There are interesting ideas in this direction, but they have not yet led to results that are as good as joint embedding architectures. One interesting avenue is latent-variable predictive architectures. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/151779454_861787841053485_9032472471565149785_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=75O6JveTH2cAX-2vn_Y&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfCWewOiy0Pr1ilRX1PdjtMx7iqgnSBMcBTWDN1sGMg0RQ&amp;oe=65234D03" alt=""></p><div><p>A latent-variable predictive architecture.

It is called latent because its value is never observed. With a properly trained model, as the latent variable varies over a given set, the output prediction varies over the set of plausible predictions compatible with the input x. </p><p>Latent-variable models can be trained with contrastive methods. A good example of this is a generative adversarial network (GAN). The critic (or discriminator) can be seen as computing an energy indicating whether the input y looks good. The generator network is trained to produce contrastive samples to which the critic is trained to associate high energy.</p><p>But contrastive methods have a major issue: They are very inefficient to train. In high-dimensional spaces such as images, there are many ways one image can be different from another. Finding a set of contrastive images that cover all the ways they can differ from a given image is a nearly impossible task. To paraphrase Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” This applies to any family of high-dimensional objects, it seems. </p><p>What if it were possible to make sure the energy of incompatible pairs is higher than that of compatible pairs without explicitly pushing up on the energy of many incompatible pairs?</p><h3>Non-contrastive energy-based SSL</h3><p>Non-contrastive methods applied to joint embedding architectures is possibly the hottest topic in SSL for vision at the moment. The domain is still largely unexplored, but it seems very promising. </p><p>Non-contrastive methods for joint-embedding include <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Caron_Unsupervised_Pre-Training_of_Image_Features_on_Non-Curated_Data_ICCV_2019_paper.html" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>DeeperCluster</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03330" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>ClusterFit</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>MoCo-v2</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>SwAV</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>SimSiam</span></a>, Barlow Twins, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>BYOL</span></a> from DeepMind, and a few others. They use various tricks, such as computing virtual target embeddings for groups of similar images (DeeperCluster, SwAV, SimSiam) or making the two joint embedding architectures slightly different through the architecture or the parameter vector (BYOL, MoCo). Barlow Twins tries to minimize the redundancy between the individual components of the embedding vectors. </p><p>Perhaps a better alternative in the long run will be to devise non-contrastive methods with latent-variable predictive models. The main obstacle is that they require a way to minimize the capacity of the latent variable. The volume of the set over which the latent variable can vary limits the volume of outputs that take low energy. By minimizing this volume, one automatically shapes the energy in the right way. </p><p>A successful example of such a method is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>Variational Auto-Encoder</span></a> (VAE), in which the latent variable is made “fuzzy”, which limits its capacity. But VAE have not yet been shown to produce good representations for downstream visual tasks. Another successful example is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/381607a0" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>sparse modeling</span></a>, but its use has been limited to simple architectures. No perfect recipe seems to exist to limit the capacity of latent variables. </p><p> The challenge of the next few years may be to devise non-contrastive methods for latent-variable energy-based model that successfully produce good representations of image, video, speech, and other signals and yield top performance in downstream supervised tasks without requiring large amounts of labeled data. </p><h2>Advancing self-supervised learning for vision</h2><p>Most recently, we’ve <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/seer-the-start-of-a-more-powerful-flexible-and-accessible-era-for-computer-vision" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>created and open sourced</span></a> a new billion-parameter self-supervised CV model called SEER that’s proven to work efficiently with complex, high-dimensional image data. It is based on the SwAV method applied to a convolutional network architecture (ConvNet) and can be trained from a vast number of random images without any metadata or annotations. The ConvNet is large enough to capture and learn every visual concept from this large and complex data. After pretraining on a billion random, unlabeled and uncurated public Instagram images, and supervised fine-tuning on ImageNet, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01988.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2pqhYda6MV9r2b3Afx_0eKUiZhX-Es6Pa_FbLOqH8fglQzO2kY3yKxZE8" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>SEER outperformed the most advanced, state-of-the-art self-supervised systems, reaching 84.2 percent top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</u></a>. </p><p>These results show that we can bring the self-supervised learning paradigm shift to computer vision. </p><h2>Using self-supervised learning at Facebook</h2><p>At Facebook, we’re not just advancing self-supervised learning techniques <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/advances-in-content-understanding-self-supervision-to-protect-people/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>across many domains</span></a> through fundamental, <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/advances-in-content-understanding-self-supervision-to-protect-people/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>open scientific research</span></a>, but we’re also applying this leading-edge work in production to quickly improve the accuracy of content understanding systems in our products that keep people safe on our platforms. </p><p> Self-supervision research, like our pretrained language model <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM?fbclid=IwAR2Gqz_1SBcEXAVowtEOqRvN9Iveaci6Jwdvdy8yHDnlyjnfm91ZDREK6Rs" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>XLM</span></a>, is accelerating important applications at Facebook today — including <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-ai-is-getting-better-at-detecting-hate-speech/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>proactive detection of hate speech</span></a>. And we’ve deployed <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-xlm-r-state-of-the-art-cross-lingual-understanding-through-self-supervision/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>XLM-R</span></a>, a model that leverages our <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank"><span>RoBERTa</span></a> architecture, to improve our hate speech classifiers in multiple languages across Facebook and Instagram.This will enable hate speech detection even in languages for which there is very little training data. </p><p> We’re encouraged by the progress of self-supervision in recent years, though there’s still a long way to go until this method can help us uncover the dark matter of AI intelligence. Self-supervision is one step on the path to human-level intelligence, but there are surely many steps that lie behind this one. Long-term progress will be cumulative. That’s why we’re committed to working collaboratively with the broader AI community to achieve our goal of, one day, building machines with human-level intelligence. Our research has been made publicly available and published at top conferences. And we’ve organized workshops and released libraries to help accelerate the research in this area. </p></div></div>]]></description>
