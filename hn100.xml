<p>In a massive shift in North American trade policy, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced today a new “strategic partnership” with China that effectively reopens the Canadian border to Chinese electric vehicles.</p>



<p>The move marks a significant departure from the United States’ hardline protectionist stance and could bring affordable EV options like the BYD Seagull to Canadian roads as early as this year.</p>



<p>For the last two years, Canada has largely walked in lockstep with the US regarding Chinese EV tariffs. Following the Biden administration’s move to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canada implemented similar surtaxes, effectively freezing companies like BYD, Nio, and Zeekr out of the market.</p>



<p>Today, that ice is breaking.</p>	
	



<p>As part of a broader trade agreement secured by Prime Minister Carney in Beijing this week, Canada has agreed to allow an annual quota of <strong>49,000 Chinese electric vehicles</strong> into the country at the tariff rate of just <strong>6.1%</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2026/01/16/prime-minister-carney-forges-new-strategic-partnership-peoples">Prime Minister’s office</a>, this volume represents less than 3% of the Canadian new vehicle market. However, the deal explicitly targets the low end of the market, with the government anticipating that within five years, “more than 50% of these vehicles will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000.”</p>



<p>In exchange for opening the EV floodgates (or at least starting to break the dam), China has agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed from roughly 85% to 15% and to lift restrictions on Canadian lobster and crab.</p>



<p>The Canadian government claims this isn’t just about imports. The text of the agreement states that the deal is expected to “drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada” to build out the domestic EV supply chain.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>While 49,000 vehicles might sound like a small number compared to the total market, it’s a specific, targeted wedge that changes the entire dynamic of the North American EV market.</p>



<p>For years, we at <em>Electrek</em> have argued that protectionism, while perhaps protecting legacy automaker jobs in the short term, ultimately hurts consumers and slows down the transition to sustainable transport.</p>




	<p>Meanwhile, protecting domestic automakers from Chinese competition in their home market makes them less competitive on the global stage, virtually giving the global market to China.</p>



<p>The reality is that Chinese automakers are currently building some of the best, most affordable EVs in the world. Keeping them out entirely not only hurts consumers but also hurts innovation.</p>



<p>Of course, this is going to make Washington furious. The US has been trying to build a “Fortress North America” against Chinese EVs. By letting 49,000 units in tariff-free (or near tariff-free), Canada is effectively saying it values affordable climate solutions (and canola exports) more than complete alignment with US industrial policy, which is understandable since the US was the one to go hostile on trade with Canada.</p>



<p>The interesting detail here is the “Joint Venture” language. It looks like Carney is taking a page out of China’s own playbook. Canada seems to be using this quota as a carrot to get companies like BYD or CATL to set up shop in Canada and maybe help Canadian companies learn from those giants.</p>

      <p>Short-lived and IP address certificates are now generally available from Let’s Encrypt. These certificates are valid for 160 hours, just over six days. In order to get a short-lived certificate subscribers simply need to select the ‘shortlived’ <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/">certificate profile</a> in their ACME client.</p>
<p>Short-lived certificates improve security by requiring more frequent validation and reducing reliance on unreliable revocation mechanisms. If a certificate’s private key is exposed or compromised, revocation has historically been the way to mitigate damage prior to the certificate’s expiration. Unfortunately, revocation is an unreliable system so many relying parties continue to be vulnerable until the certificate expires, a period as long as 90 days. With short-lived certificates that vulnerability window is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Short-lived certificates are opt-in and we have no plan to make them the default at this time. Subscribers that have fully automated their renewal process should be able to switch to short-lived certificates easily if they wish, but we understand that not everyone is in that position and generally comfortable with this significantly shorter lifetime. We hope that over time everyone moves to automated solutions and we can demonstrate that short-lived certificates work well.</p>
<p>Our default certificate lifetimes will be going from 90 days down to 45 days over the next few years, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/02/from-90-to-45">as previously announced</a>.</p>
<p>IP address certificates allow server operators to authenticate TLS connections to IP addresses rather than domain names. Let’s Encrypt supports both IPv4 and IPv6. IP address certificates must be short-lived certificates, a decision we made because IP addresses are more transient than domain names, so validating more frequently is important. You can learn more about our IP address certificates and the use cases for them from our <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate">post announcing our first IP Certificate</a>.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank the Open Technology Fund and Sovereign Tech Agency, along with our <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsors/">Sponsors</a> and Donors, for supporting the development of this work.</p>

      </p>
      <h2 id="cursors-latest-browser-experiment-implied-success-without-evidence">Cursor's
latest "browser experiment" implied success without evidence</h2>
<p>On January 14th 2026, Cursor published a blog post titled "Scaling
long-running autonomous coding" (<a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents</a>)</p>
<p>In the blog post, they talk about their experiments with running
"coding agents autonomously for weeks" with the explicit goal of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>understand[ing] how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding
for projects that typically take human teams months to complete</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They talk about some approaches they tried, why they think those
failed, and how to address the difficulties.</p>
<p>Finally they arrived at a point where something "solved most of our
coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without
any single agent", which then led to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a
web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing
over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the
source code on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where things get a bit murky and unclear. They claim "Despite
the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make
meaningful progress" and "Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing
to the same branch with minimal conflicts", but they never actually say
if this is successful or not, is it actually working? Can you run this
browser yourself? We don't know and they never say explicitly.</p>
<p>After this, they embed the following video:</p>
<p><video src="https://embedding-shapes.github.io/content/cursor-screenshots.webm" controls=""><a href="https://embedding-shapes.github.io/content/cursor-screenshots.webm">Video</a></video></p>
<p>And below it, they say "While it might seem like a simple screenshot,
building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.".</p>
<h3 id="they-never-actually-claim-this-browser-is-working-and-functional">They
never actually claim this browser is working and functional</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>error: could not compile 'fastrender' (lib) due to 34 previous
errors; 94 warnings emitted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you try to compile it yourself, you'll see that it's very far
away from being a functional browser at all, and seemingly, it never
actually was able to build.</p>
<p>Multiple recent GitHub Actions runs on <code>main</code> show
failures (including workflow-file errors), and independent build
attempts report dozens of compiler errors, recent PRs were all merged
with failing CI, and going back in the Git history from most recent
commit back 100 commits,<br><a href="https://gist.github.com/embedding-shapes/f5d096dd10be44ff82b6e5ccdaf00b29">I
couldn't find a single commit that compiled cleanly</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the "agents" they unleashed on this codebase
actually did, but they seemingly never ran "cargo build" or even less
"cargo check", because both of those commands surface 10s of errors
(which surely would balloon should we solve them) and about 100
warnings. There is an open GitHub issue in their repository about this
right now: <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/issues/98">https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/issues/98</a></p>
<p>And diving into the codebase, if the compilation errors didn't make
that clear already, makes it very clear to any software developer that
none of this is actually engineered code. It is what is typically known
as "AI slop", low quality <em>something</em> that surely represents
<em>something</em>, but it doesn't have intention behind it, and it
doesn't even compile at this point.</p>
<p>They later start to talk about what's next, but not a single word
about how to run it, what to expect, how it's working or anything else.
Cursor's blog post provides no reproducible demo and no known-good
revision (tag/release/commit) to verify the screenshots, beyond linking
the repo.</p>
<p>Regardless of intent, Cursor's blog post creates the impression of a
functioning prototype while leaving out the basic reproducibility
markers one would expect from such claim. They never explicitly claim
it's actually working, so no one can say they lied at least.</p>
<p>They finish off the article saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing
more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we
expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which seems like a really strange conclusion to arrive at, when all
they've proved so far, is that agents can output millions of tokens and
still not end up with something that actually works.</p>
<p>A "browser experiment" doesn't need to rival Chrome. A reasonable
minimum bar is: it compiles on a supported toolchain and can render a
trivial HTML file. Cursor's post doesn’t demonstrate that bar, and
current public build attempts fail at this too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cursor never says "this browser is production-ready", but they do
frame it as "building a web browser from scratch" and "meaningful
progress" and then use a screenshot and "extremely difficult" language,
wanting to give the impression that this experiment actually was a
success.</p>
<p>The closest they get to implying that this was a success, is this
part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks,
making real progress on ambitious projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this extraordinary claim isn't backed up by any evidence. In the
blog post they never provide a working commit, build instructions or
even a demo that can be reproduced.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone expects this browser to be the next Chrome, but
I do think that if you claim you've built a browser, it should at least
be able to demonstrate being able to be compiled + loading a basic HTML
file at the very least.</p>

            <link>https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/</link>
            <guid>46646645</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:25:54 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/">https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46646645">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>The Astro Technology Company — the company behind the Astro web framework — is joining Cloudflare! Adoption of the Astro web framework continues to double every year, and <a href="https://astro.build/blog/astro-6-beta/">Astro 6</a> is right around the corner. With Cloudflare’s support, we’ll have more resources and fewer distractions to continue our mission to build the best framework for content-driven websites.</p>
<p><strong>What this means for Astro:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Astro stays open-source and MIT-licensed</li>
<li>Astro continues to be actively maintained</li>
<li>Astro continues to support a wide set of deployment targets, not just Cloudflare</li>
<li>Astro’s open governance and current roadmap remain in place.</li>
<li>All full-time employees of The Astro Technology Company are now employees of Cloudflare, and will continue to work on Astro full-time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-astro-started">How Astro started</h2>
<p>In 2021, Astro was born out of frustration. The trend at the time was that every website should be architected as an application, and then shipped to the user’s browser to render. This was not very performant, and we’ve spent the last decade coming up with more and more complex solutions to solve for that performance problem. SSR, ISR, RSC, PPR, TTI optimizations via code-splitting, tree-shaking, lazy-loading, all to generate a blocking double-data hydration payload from a pre-warmed server running halfway around the world.</p>
<p>Our mission to design a web framework specifically for building websites — what we call <em>content-driven websites,</em> to better distinguish from data-driven, stateful web applications — resonated. Now Astro is downloaded almost 1,000,000 times per week, and has been used by 100,000s of developers to build fast, beautiful websites. Today you’ll find Astro all over the web, powering major websites and even entire developer platforms for companies like Webflow, Wix, Microsoft, and Google.</p>
<p><strong>Along the way, we also tried to grow a business.</strong> In 2021 we raised some money and formed The Astro Technology Company. Our larger vision was that a well-designed framework like Astro could sit at the center of a massive developer platform, with optional hosted primitives (database, storage, analytics) designed in lockstep with the framework.</p>
<p>We were never able to realize this vision. Attempts to introduce paid, hosted primitives into our ecosystem fell flat, and rarely justified their own existence. We considered going more directly after first-class hosting or content management for Astro, but knew we’d spend much of our time playing catchup to well-funded, savvy competitors. We kept exploring different ideas, but nothing every clicked with users the same way Astro did.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all bad. <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/">Astro DB</a> (our attempt to build a hosted database product for Astro projects) eventually evolved into the open, built-in Astro database client that still lives in core today. Our exploration into building an e-commerce layer with Astro was eventually <a href="https://github.com/withastro/storefront">open-sourced</a>. It was rewarding work, but over the years the distraction took its toll. Each attempt at a new paid product or offering took myself and others on the project away from working on the Astro framework that developers were using and loving every day.</p>
<h2 id="returning-to-focus"><strong>Returning to Focus</strong></h2>
<p>Last year, Dane (Cloudflare CTO) and I began to talk more seriously about the future of the web. Those conversations quickly grew into something bigger: What does the next decade look like? How do frameworks adapt to a world of AI coding and agents?</p>
<p>It became clear that even as web technologies evolve, <strong>content remains at the center.</strong> We realized that we’ve each been working toward this same vision from different angles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> has been solving it from the <strong>infrastructure</strong> side: betting on a platform that is global by default, with fast startup, low latency, and security built-in.</li>
<li><strong>Astro</strong> has been solving it from the <strong>framework</strong> side: betting on a web framework that makes it easy to build sites that are fast by default, without overcomplicating things.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overlap is obvious. By working together, Cloudflare gives us the backing we need to keep innovating for our users. Now we can stop spending cycles worrying about building a business on top of Astro, and start focusing 100% on the code, with a shared vision to move the web forward.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-️-astro"><strong>Cloudflare ❤️ Astro</strong></h2>
<p>Cloudflare has been a long-time sponsor and champion of Astro. They have a proven track record of supporting great open-source projects like Astro, TanStack, and Hono without trying to capture or lock anything down. Staying open to all was a non-negotiable requirement for both us and for Cloudflare.</p>
<p>That is why Astro will remain free, open-source, and MIT-licensed. We will continue to run our project in the open, with an open governance model for contributors and an open community roadmap that anyone can participate in. We remain fully committed to maintaining Astro as a platform-agnostic framework, meaning we will continue to support and improve deployments for all targets—not just Cloudflare.</p>
<p>With Cloudflare’s resources and support, we can now return our focus fully towards building the best web framework for content-driven websites. The web is changing fast, and the bar keeps rising: performance, scale, reliability, and a better experience for the teams shipping content on the web.</p>
<p>You’ll see that focus reflected across our roadmap, as we prepare for the upcoming Astro 6 release (beta out now!) and our 2026 roadmap. Stay tuned!</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>I want to extend a huge thank you to the agencies, companies, sponsors, partners, and theme authors who chose to work with us over the years. Thank you to our initial investors — Haystack, Gradient, Uncorrelated, Lightspeed — without whom Astro likely wouldn’t exist. Thank you to everyone in our open source community who continues to help make Astro better every day. And finally, thank you to everyone who uses Astro and puts their trust in us to help them build for the web.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<p>Think back, if you will, to the works of art you cre­at­ed at age twelve or thir­teen. For many, per­haps most of us, our out­put at that stage of ado­les­cence amount­ed to direc­tion­less doo­dles, chaot­ic comics, and a few unsteady-at-best school projects. But then, most of us did­n’t grow up to be Michelan­ge­lo. In the late four­teen-eight­ies, when that tow­er­ing Renais­sance artist was still what we would now call a “tween,” he paint­ed <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2009/michelangelo"><em>The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny</em></a>, a depic­tion of the tit­u­lar reli­gious fig­ure beset by demons in the desert. Though based on&nbsp;a wide­ly known engrav­ing, it nev­er­the­less shows evi­dence of rapid­ly advanc­ing tech­nique, inspi­ra­tion, and even&nbsp;cre­ativ­i­ty — espe­cial­ly when placed under the infrared scan­ner.</p>
<p>For about half a mil­len­ni­um, <em>The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny&nbsp;</em>was­n’t thought to have been paint­ed by Michelan­ge­lo. As explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtUWFNPoxJM">the video from Inspi­rag­gio just below</a>, when the paint­ing sold at Sothe­by’s in 2008, the buy­er took it to the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art for exam­i­na­tion and clean­ing.</p>


<p>“Beneath the lay­ers of dirt accu­mu­lat­ed over the cen­turies,” says the nar­ra­tor, “a very par­tic­u­lar col­or palette appeared. “The tones, the blends, the way the human fig­ure was treat­ed: all of it began to resem­ble the style Michelan­ge­lo would use years lat­er in none oth­er than <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/05/take-a-3d-virtual-tour-of-the-sistine-chapel.html">the Sis­tine Chapel</a>.” Infrared reflec­tog­ra­phy sub­se­quent­ly turned up&nbsp;<em>pen­ti­men­ti</em>, or cor­rec­tion marks, a com­mon indi­ca­tion that “a paint­ing is not a copy, but an orig­i­nal work cre­at­ed with artis­tic free­dom.”</p>

<p>It was the <a href="https://kimbellart.org/exhibition/michelangelos-first-painting">Kim­bell Art Muse­um</a> in Fort Worth, Texas that first bet big on the prove­nance of <em>The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny</em>. Its new­ly hired direc­tor pur­chased the paint­ing after turn­ing up “not a sin­gle con­vinc­ing argu­ment against the attri­bu­tion.” Thus acquired, it became “the only paint­ing by Michelan­ge­lo locat­ed any­where in the Amer­i­c­as, and also just one of four easel paint­ings attrib­uted to him through­out his entire career,” dur­ing most of which he dis­par­aged oil paint­ing itself. About a decade lat­er, and after fur­ther analy­sis, the art his­to­ri­an Gior­gio Bon­san­ti put his con­sid­er­able author­i­ty behind a defin­i­tive con­fir­ma­tion that it is indeed the work of the young Michelan­ge­lo. There remain doubters, of course, and even the noto­ri­ous­ly uncom­pro­mis­ing artist him­self may have con­sid­ered it an imma­ture work unwor­thy of his name. But who else could have cre­at­ed an imma­ture work like it?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Just the Browser helps you remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from desktop web browsers. The goal is to give you "just the browser" and nothing else, using hidden settings in web browsers intended for companies and other organizations.</p>
<p>This project includes configuration files for popular web browsers, documentation for installing and modifying them, and easy installation scripts. Everything is <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser" target="_blank">open-source on GitHub</a>.</p>
<img alt="Just the Browser script on Windows and Mac" src="https://justthebrowser.com/media/screen.png">
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>The setup script can install the configuration files in a few clicks. You can also follow the manual guides for <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/edge">Microsoft Edge</a>, and <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/firefox">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong> Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Windows button in the taskbar, then selecting the "Terminal (Admin)" or "PowerShell (Admin)" menu option. Next, copy the below command, paste it into the window (<code>Ctrl+V</code>), and press the Enter/Return key:</p>
<pre><code>&amp; ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.ps1")))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Mac and Linux:</strong> Search for the Terminal in your applications list and open it. Next, copy the below command, paste it into the window (<code>Ctrl+V</code> or <code>Cmd+V</code>), and press the Enter/Return key:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.sh)"
</code></pre>

<h3>What features or settings are changed?</h3>
<p>Just the Browser aims to remove the following functionality from popular web browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most AI features</strong>: Features that use generative AI models, either on-device or in the cloud, like Copilot in Microsoft Edge or tab group suggestions in Firefox. The main exception is <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/website-translation" target="_blank">page translation in Firefox</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping features:</strong> Price tracking, coupon codes, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/edge-integrating-buy-now-pay-later-predatory-and-disappointing" target="_blank">loan integrations</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsored or third-party content:</strong> Suggested articles on the New Tab Page, sponsored site suggestions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Default browser reminders:</strong> Pop-ups or other prompts that ask you to change the default web browser.</li>
<li><strong>First-run experiences and data import prompts:</strong> Browser welcome screens and their related prompts to import data automatically from other web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Telemetry:</strong> Data collection by web browsers. Crash reporting is left enabled if the browser (such as Firefox) supports it as a separate option.</li>
<li><strong>Startup boost:</strong> Features that allow web browsers to start with the operating system without explicit permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact list of features modified for each browser can be found on the pages for <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/edge">Microsoft Edge</a>, and <a href="https://justthebrowser.com/firefox">Firefox</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I change or remove the settings?</h3>
<p>Yes. The browser guides include steps for removing the configurations, and the automated script can also do it. The browser guides explain each setting, so you can add, remove, or modify the files before you install them.</p>
<h3>Which web browsers are supported?</h3>
<p>Just the Browser has configuration files and setup scripts for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. However, <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/issues/2" target="_blank">Chrome on Linux</a> and <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/issues/1" target="_blank">Edge on Linux</a> are not currently supported.</p>
<h3>Can I install this on my phone or tablet?</h3>
<p>Not yet. See the issues for <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/issues/4" target="_blank">Android support</a> and <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/issues/5" target="_blank">iOS/iPadOS support</a>.</p>
<h3>Is this modifying the web browser?</h3>
<p>No. Just the Browser uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Policy" target="_blank">group policies</a> that are fully supported by web browsers, usually intended for IT departments in companies or other large organizations. No applications or executable files are modified in any way.</p>
<h3>Do the settings stay applied?</h3>
<p>Yes, as long as the web browsers continue to support the settings used in the configuration files. Web browsers occasionally add, remove, or replace the settings options, so if the custom configuration breaks, try installing the latest available version.</p>
<h3>Does this install ad blockers for me?</h3>
<p>No. If you want one, try <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home" target="_blank">uBlock Origin Lite</a>.</p>
<h3>Why does my browser say it's managed by an organization?</h3>
<p>The group policy settings used by Just the Browser are intended for PCs managed by companies and other large organizations. Browsers like Microsoft Edge and Firefox will display a message like "Your browser is being managed by your organization" to explain why some settings are disabled.</p>
<h3>How do I know the settings are applied?</h3>
<p>You can open <code>about:policies</code> in Firefox or <code>chrome://policy</code> in Chrome and Edge to see a list of active group policy settings.</p>
<h3>Why not just use an alternative web browser?</h3>
<p>You can do that! However, switching to alternative web browsers like Vivaldi, SeaMonkey, Waterfox, or LibreWolf can have other downsides. They are not always available on the same platforms, and they can lag behind mainstream browsers in security updates and engine upgrades. Just the Browser aims to make mainstream web browsers more tolerable, while still retaining their existing benefits.</p>

            <guid>46645176</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:57:38 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_duckdb/">https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_duckdb/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46645176">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mdx-container-div">
<p>Over the past few years, I've found myself using DuckDB more and more for data processing, to the point where I now use it almost exclusively, usually from within Python.</p>
<p>We're moving towards a simpler world where most tabular data can be processed on a single large machine<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and the era of clusters is coming to an end for all but the largest datasets.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This post sets out some of my favourite features of DuckDB that set it apart from other SQL-based tools.    In a nutshell, it's simple to install, ergonomic, fast, and more fully featured.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_sql/">earlier post</a> explains why I favour SQL over other APIs such as <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> or <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>.</p>
<p><h2 id="what-is-duckdb?"><a href="#what-is-duckdb?"><span>#</span>What is DuckDB?</a></h2></p>
<p>DuckDB is an open source in-process SQL engine that is optimised for analytics queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>'In-process' means it's similar to SQLite in that it runs within your application. You don't need to start a separate service such as Postgres to run it.</li>
<li>'Optimised for analytics queries' means that it's designed for operations like joins and aggregations involving large numbers of rows, as opposed to atomic transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance difference of analytics-optimised engines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a>) vs. transactions-optimised engines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a>) should not be underestimated. A query running in DuckDB can be 100 or even 1,000 times faster than exactly the same query running in (say) SQLite or Postgres.</p>
<p>A core use-case of DuckDB is where you have one or more large datasets on disk in formats like <code>csv</code>, <code>parquet</code> or <code>json</code> which you want to batch process.  You may want to perform cleaning, joins, aggregation, derivation of new columns - that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But you can also use DuckDB for many other simpler tasks like viewing a csv file from the command line.</p>
<p><h2 id="my-favourite-features"><a href="#my-favourite-features"><span>#</span>My favourite features</a></h2></p>
<p><h2 id="speed"><a href="#speed"><span>#</span>Speed</a></h2></p>
<p>DuckDB consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest data processing engines.  The benchmarks I've seen<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> show there's not much in it between the leading open source engines - which at the moment seem to be <a href="https://pola.rs/">polars</a>, <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a>, <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">DataFusion</a>,  <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> and <a href="https://www.dask.org/">Dask</a>.  Spark and Dask can be competitive on large data, but slower on small data.</p>
<p><h2 id="simple-to-install,-no-dependencies"><a href="#simple-to-install,-no-dependencies"><span>#</span>Simple to install, no dependencies</a></h2></p>
<p>DuckDB itself is a single precompiled binary.  In Python, it can be <code>pip install</code>ed with no dependencies.  This makes it a joy to install compared to other more heavyweight options like Spark.  Combined with <code>uv</code>, you can stand up a fresh DuckDB Python environment from nothing in less than a second - see <a href="https://akrabat.com/using-uv-as-your-shebang-line/">here</a>.</p>
<p><h2 id="ci-and-testing"><a href="#ci-and-testing"><span>#</span>CI and testing</a></h2></p>
<p>With its speed and almost-zero startup time, DuckDB is ideally suited for CI and testing of data engineering pipelines.</p>
<p>Historically this has been fiddly and running a large suite of tests in e.g. Apache Spark has been time consuming and frustrating.  Now it's much simpler to set up the test environment, and there's less scope for differences between it and your production pipelines.</p>
<p><h2 id="writing-sql-code"><a href="#writing-sql-code"><span>#</span>Writing SQL code</a></h2></p>
<p>This simplicity and speed also applies to writing new SQL, and getting syntax right before running it on a large dataset.  Historically I have found this annoying in engines like Spark (where it takes a few seconds to start Spark in local mode), or even worse when you're forced to run queries in a proprietary tool like AWS Athena.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>There's even a DuckDB UI with autocomplete - see <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/ui.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><h2 id="friendly-sql"><a href="#friendly-sql"><span>#</span>Friendly SQL</a></h2></p>
<p>The DuckDB team has implemented a wide range of innovations in its SQL dialect that make it a joy to use. See the following blog posts <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html">1</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/08/23/even-friendlier-sql.html">2</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/dialect/friendly_sql.html">3</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/08/19/duckdb-tricks-part-1.html">4</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/10/11/duckdb-tricks-part-2.html">5</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/11/29/duckdb-tricks-part-3.html">6</a>.</p>
<p>Some of my favourites are the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/expressions/star.html#exclude-clause"><code>EXCLUDE</code></a> keyword, and the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/select.html"><code>COLUMNS</code></a> keyword which allows you to select and regex-replace a subset of columns.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>  I also like <code>QUALIFY</code> and the aggregate modifiers on window functions, see <a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/02/10/window-catchup.html#qualify-clause">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another is the ability to <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/08/23/even-friendlier-sql.html#function-chaining">function chain</a>, like <code>first_name.lower().trim()</code>.</p>
<p><h2 id="fast-support-for-all-your-favourite-filetypes"><a href="#fast-support-for-all-your-favourite-filetypes"><span>#</span>Fast support for all your favourite filetypes</a></h2></p>
<p>You can query data directly from files, including on s3, or on the web.</p>
<p>For example to query a folder of parquet files:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> read_parquet</span><span>(</span><span>'path/to/*.parquet'</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div>
<p>or even (on CORS enabled files) you can run SQL directly:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> read_parquet</span><span>(</span><span>'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2015_flights.parquet'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>limit</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Click <a href="https://shell.duckdb.org/#queries=v0,select-*-from-read_parquet('https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fplotly%2Fdatasets%2Fmaster%2F2015_flights.parquet')-limit-2~">here</a> to try this query yourself in the DuckDB web shell.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to cause problems in your data pipelines is to fail to be strict about incoming data types from untyped formats such as csv.  DuckDB provides lots of options here - see <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/csv/overview.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><h2 id="python-api"><a href="#python-api"><span>#</span>Python API</a></h2></p>
<p>Many data pipelines effectively boil down to a long sequence of CTEs:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>WITH</span><span></span></p><p><span>input_data </span><span>AS</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> read_parquet</span><span>(</span><span>'...'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>step_1 </span><span>AS</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> input_data </span><span>JOIN</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>step_2 </span><span>AS</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> step_1</span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> step_2</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div>
<p>When developing a pipeline like this, we often want to inspect what's happened at each step.</p>
<p>In Python, we can write</p>
<div><pre><p><span>input_data = duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('...')")</span></p><p><span>step_1 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM input_data JOIN ...")</span></p><p><span>step_2 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_1")</span></p><p><span>final = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_2;")</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This makes it easy to inspect what the data looks like at <code>step_2</code> with no performance loss, since these steps will be executed lazily when they're run all at once.</p>
<p>This also facilitates easier testing of SQL in CI, since each step can be an independently-tested function.</p>
<p><h2 id="acid-compliance"><a href="#acid-compliance"><span>#</span>ACID compliance</a></h2></p>
<p>DuckDB offers full ACID compliance for bulk data operations, which sets it apart from other analytical data systems - see <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/09/25/changing-data-with-confidence-and-acid.html">here</a>.  You can listen to more about this on <a href="https://duckdb.org/media/duckdb-deep-dive-lakehouse-challenges/">in this podcast</a>, transcribed <a href="https://gist.github.com/RobinL/bbabbe22d9177230648b7fc9a22a84d7">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting new development, making DuckDB potentially a suitable replacement for lakehouse formats such as Iceberg or Delta lake for medium scale data.</p>
<p><h2 id="high-performance-udfs-and-community-extensions"><a href="#high-performance-udfs-and-community-extensions"><span>#</span>High performance UDFs and community extensions</a></h2></p>
<p>A longstanding difficulty with data processing engines has been the difficulty in writing high performance user defined functions (UDFs).</p>
<p>For example, in PySpark, you will generally get best performance by writing custom Scala, compiling to a JAR, and registering it with Spark.  But this is cumbersome and in practice, you will encounter a lot of issues around Spark version compatibility and security restrictions environments such as DataBricks.</p>
<p>In DuckDB high performance custom UDFs can be written in C++.  Whilst writing these functions is certainly not trivial, DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/07/05/community-extensions.html">community extensions</a> offers a low-friction way of distributing the code. Community extensions can be installed almost instantly with a single command such as <code>INSTALL h3 FROM community</code> to install hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data.</p>
<p><h2 id="documentation"><a href="#documentation"><span>#</span>Documentation</a></h2></p>
<p>The team provide documentation as a <a href="https://duckdb.org/duckdb-docs.md">single markdown file</a> so it can easily be provided to an LLM.</p>
<p>My top tip: if you load this file in your code editor, and use code folding, it's easy to copy the parts of the documentation you need into context.</p>
<p><h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts"><span>#</span>Final thoughts</a></h2></p>
<p>Much of this blog post is based on my experience supporting multiple SQL dialects in <a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">Splink</a>, an open source library for record linkage at scale.  We've found that transitioning towards recommending DuckDB as the default backend choice has increased adoption of the library and significantly reduced the amount of problems faced by users, even for large linkage tasks, whilst speeding up workloads very substantially.</p>
<p>We've also found it's hugely increased the simplicity and speed of developing and testing new features.</p>
<p><h2 id="interesting-things-to-keep-an-eye-on"><a href="#interesting-things-to-keep-an-eye-on"><span>#</span>Interesting things to keep an eye on</a></h2></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-postgres">PosgreSQL Extension</a> allows you to attach a Postgres database and query it directly from DuckDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb"><code>pg_duckdb</code></a> allows you to embed the DuckDB computation engine within Postgres.</li>
</ul>
<p>The later in particular seems potentially extremely powerful, enabling Postgres to be simultanouesly optimised for analytics and transactional processing.  I think it's likely to see widespread adoption, especially after they iron out a few of the current shortcomings around enabling and optimising the use of Postgres indexes and pushing up filters up to PostGres.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>San Francisco will offer free childcare to families earning less than $230,000 a year, and a 50% subsidy to those earning up to $310,000, in an expansion of the city’s childcare offerings designed to make <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/san-francisco-top-5-worlds-most-expensive-cities-report" data-link-name="in body link">one of the world’s most expensive cities</a> more affordable for residents.</p><p>San Francisco’s mayor, Daniel Lurie, <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news-mayor-lurie-launches-family-opportunity-agenda-to-make-san-francisco-more-affordable-for-families" data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> the initiative as part of his “Family Opportunity Agenda” on Wednesday, alongside a package of housing, education, food, healthcare, transportation and other programs focused on affordability.</p><p>“Today marks the beginning of a powerful effort to reduce the cost of living for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">San Francisco</a> families by tens of thousands of dollars each year,” Lurie said in a press release announcing the subsidies. “We’re committed to making San Francisco a place where families can stay, grow, and build their future.”</p><p>Democrats such as Lurie have seized on opportunities to respond to the affordability crisis across the United States in recent months, even as Donald Trump calls affordability “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/12/democrats-affordability-trump" data-link-name="in body link">a hoax</a>”. In his first week in office, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2026/01/mayor-mamdani---governor-hochul-to-launch-free-child-care-for-tw" data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> a program offering free childcare to all of the city’s two-year-olds, alongside a program led by Governor Kathy Hochul to invest in offering universal childcare to all children under age five in the state by August of 2028.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/new-mexico-universal-free-childcare-campaign" data-link-name="in body link">New Mexico became the first state in the nation</a> to offer free childcare to all its residents.</p><p>While many cities calculate eligibility for benefits based on national federal poverty guidelines, San Francisco generally uses area median income to calculate the cost of living. In 2025, the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/" data-link-name="in body link">federal poverty level</a> nationwide was $32,150 for a family of four, while the <a href="https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/2025_AMI-IncomeLimits-HMFA_08Rw8dU.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">area median income</a> for a family of four in San Francisco was $155,850.</p><p>San Francisco’s measure will make childcare free for a family of four making less than $230,000 a year, or 150% of the area median income, and offer a 50% subsidy to families earning less than $310,000 a year, or 200% of the area median income. Previously, free childcare was available to families earning less than 110% of the area median income.</p><p>The Children’s Council of San Francisco <a href="https://www.childrenscouncil.org/families/understanding-child-care/child-care-costs/" data-link-name="in body link">estimates</a> that the average cost of childcare in the city is between $20,000 and $30,000 per child each year. And <a href="https://www.epi.org/child-care-costs-in-the-united-states/#/CA" data-link-name="in body link">the Economic Policy Institute</a> ranks California fourth out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for most expensive infant care. According to the Institute, infant care for one child would take up more than 18% of a median family’s income in California; and care for two children could take up close to 30% of a family’s income.</p><p>According to US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, childcare is only considered “affordable” if it takes up <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-12-24/pdf/2015-31883.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">less than</a> <a href="https://acf.gov/occ/law-regulation/overview-2024-ccdf-final-rule-improving-child-care-access-affordability#:~:text=Prohibits%20Family%20Co%2Dpayments%20Above,Start%20or%20Early%20Head%20Start" data-link-name="in body link">7%</a> of a family’s income. Even for families earning six-figure salaries in the Bay Area, that goal is far out of reach. The mayor’s new childcare proposal brings that 7% just within reach, even for families earning what would be an extravagant salary elsewhere in the country.</p><p>San Francisco will use unspent tax dollars collected after voters approved Proposition C, or “Baby Prop C”, in 2018, which was delayed by an ultimately unsuccessful court challenge. The unspent funds amount to more than $550m. Families will be able to access free or reduced-cost childcare from more than <a href="https://sfdec.org/early-learning-for-all/early-learning-programs/" data-link-name="in body link">500 providers</a> citywide.</p><p>“Affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for families to stay in San Francisco, but the cost can make it really challenging,” said Ingrid X Mezquita, the director of the city’s department of early childhood. “This is a big step toward making San Francisco a place where families can thrive.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.</p><p>In an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/DCA26MA024%20Investigative%20Update.pdf">update report</a>, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue "would not result in a safety of flight condition".</p><p>The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997.</p><p>The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of "fatigue" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.</p><p>It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a "service letter" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.</p><p>In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.</p><p>Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading.</p><p>"The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag," he explained.</p><p>"It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences," he claimed.</p><p>Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.</p><p>Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.</p><p>Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.</p><p>In a statement, Boeing said: "We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected."</p><p>The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.</p></div></div>]]></description>

that the host running on another CPU will see updates to the

Log message:
vio: Support MTU feature

Add support for the VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU which allows to get the hardmtu
from the hypervisor. Also set the current mtu to the same value. The
virtio standard is not clear if that is recommended, but Linux does
this, too.

Use ETHER_MAX_HARDMTU_LEN as upper hardmtu limit instead of MAXMCLBYTES,
as this seems to be more correct.

If the hypervisor requests a MTU larger than ETHER_MAX_HARDMTU_LEN,
redo feature negotiation without VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU.

With this commit, OpenBSD finally works on Apple Virtualization.

            <p>For the next release of <a href="https://leanpub.com/logic/" target="_blank">Logic for Programmers</a>, I'm finally adding the sections on Answer Set Programming and Constraint Logic Programming that I TODOd back in version 0.9. And this is making me re-experience some of my pain points with Prolog, which I will gripe about now.  If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/a48fce5b-8a05-4302-b620-9b26f057f145/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://ianthehenry.com/posts/drinking-with-datalog/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://logicprogramming.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<h3>No standardized strings</h3>
<p>ISO "strings" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog. </p>
<h3>No functions</h3>
<p>Code logic is expressed entirely in <em>rules</em>, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>length</span><span>([</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>],</span> <span>Len</span><span>).</span>

   <span>Len</span> <span>=</span> <span>3.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates "in reverse". To generate lists of length 3, you can write <code>length(L, 3)</code>. But it also means that if you want to get the length a list <em>plus one</em>, you can't do that in one expression, you have to write <code>length(List, Out), X is Out+1</code>.</p>
<p>For a while I thought no functions was necessary evil for bidirectionality, but then I discovered <a href="https://picat-lang.org/" target="_blank">Picat</a> has functions and works just fine. That by itself is a reason for me to prefer Picat for my LP needs.</p>
<p>(Bidirectionality is a killer feature of Prolog, so it's a shame I so rarely run into situations that use it.)</p>
<h3>No standardized collection types besides lists</h3>
<p>Aside from atoms (<code>abc</code>) and numbers, there are two data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked lists like <code>[a,b,c,d]</code>.</li>
<li>Compound terms like <code>dog(rex, poodle)</code>, which <em>seem</em> like record types but are actually tuples. You can even convert compound terms to linked lists with <code>=..</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>L</span> <span>=..</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>].</span>
   <span>L</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>).</span>
<span>?-</span> <span>a</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>))</span> <span>=..</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span>
   <span>L</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)].</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's no proper key-value maps or even struct types. Again, this is something that individual distributions can fix (without cross compatibility), but these never feel integrated with the rest of the language. </p>
<h3>No boolean values</h3>
<p><code>true</code> and <code>false</code> aren't values, they're control flow statements. <code>true</code> is a noop and <code>false</code> says that the current search path is a dead end, so backtrack and start again. You can't explicitly store true and false as values, you have to implicitly have them in facts (<code>passed(test)</code> instead of <code>test.passed? == true</code>).</p>
<p>This hasn't made any tasks impossible, and I can usually find a workaround to whatever I want to do. But I do think it makes things more inconvenient! Sometimes I want to do something dumb like "get all atoms that don't pass at least three of these rules", and that'd be a lot easier if I could shove intermediate results into a sack of booleans. </p>
<p>(This is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_as_failure" target="_blank">Negation as Failure</a>". I think this might be necessary to make Prolog a Turing complete general programming language. Picat fixes a lot of Prolog's gripes and still has negation as failure. ASP has regular negation but it's not Turing complete.) </p>
<h3>Cuts are confusing</h3>

<p>Prolog finds solutions through depth first search, and a "cut" (<code>!</code>) symbol prevents backtracking past a certain point. This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs. </p>
<p>You're not supposed to use cuts if you can avoid it, so I pretended cuts didn't exist. Which is why I was surprised to find that <a href="https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=(-%3E)/2" target="_blank">conditionals</a> are implemented with cuts. Because cuts are spooky dark magic conditionals <em>sometimes</em> conditionals work as I expect them to and sometimes leave out valid solutions and I have no idea how to tell which it'll be. Usually I find it safer to just avoid conditionals entirely, which means my code gets a lot longer and messier. </p>
<h3>Non-cuts are confusing</h3>
<p>The original example in the last section was this: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>:-</span>
    <span>\+</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>B</span><span>),</span>
    <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>2.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>foo(1, 2)</code> returns true, so you'd expect <code>f(A, B)</code> to return <code>A=1, B=2</code>. But it returns <code>false</code>.  Whereas this works as expected.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>:-</span>
    <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
    <span>\+</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>B</span><span>).</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I <em>thought</em> this was because <code>\+</code> was implemented with cuts, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Prolog-Using-ISO-Standard/dp/3540006788" target="_blank">Clocksin book</a> suggests it's <code>call(P), !, fail</code>, so this was my prime example about how cuts are confusing. But then I tried this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>member</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span> <span>\+</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>3.</span>
<span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>3.</span> <span>% wtf?</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's no way to get that behavior with cuts! I don't think <code>\+</code> uses cuts at all! And now I have to figure out why 
<code>foo(A, B)</code> doesn't returns results. Is it <a href="https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/other_notes/about_negation/floundering.md" target="_blank">floundering</a>? Is it because <code>\+ P</code> only succeeds if <code>P</code> fails, and <code>A = B</code> always succeeds? A closed-world assumption? Something else?<sup id="fnref:dif"><a href="#fn:dif">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Straying outside of default queries is confusing</h3>
<p>Say I have a program like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>n1</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>n2</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>n11</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n2</span><span>,</span> <span>n21</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n2</span><span>,</span> <span>n22</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n11</span><span>,</span> <span>n111</span><span>).</span>
<span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>n11</span><span>,</span> <span>n112</span><span>).</span>

<span>branch</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)</span> <span>:-</span> <span>% two children</span>
    <span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>,</span> <span>C1</span><span>),</span>
    <span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>,</span> <span>C2</span><span>),</span>
    <span>C1</span> <span>@&lt;</span> <span>C2</span><span>.</span> <span>% ordering</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And I want to know all of the nodes that are parents of branches. The normal way to do this is with a query:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span><span>),</span> <span>branch</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>).</span>
<span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>n2</span><span>;</span> <span>% show more...</span>
<span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>n11</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is interactively making me query for every result. That's usually not what I want, I know the result of my query is finite and I want all of the results at once, so I can count or farble or whatever them. It took a while to figure out that the proper solution is <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=bagof/3" target="_blank"><code>bagof(Template, Goal, Bag)</code></a>, which will "Unify Bag with the alternatives of Template":</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>bagof</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span><span>),</span> <span>branch</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)),</span> <span>As</span><span>).</span>

<span>As</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>n1</span><span>],</span> <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>n11</span><span>;</span>
<span>As</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>n</span><span>],</span> <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>n2</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Wait crap that's still giving one result at a time, because <code>N</code> is a free variable in <code>bagof</code> so it backtracks over that. It surprises me but I guess it's good to have as an option. So how do I get all of the results at once?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>bagof</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span><span>^</span><span>(</span><span>tree</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span><span>),</span> <span>branch</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)),</span> <span>As</span><span>).</span>

<span>As</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>n1</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The only difference is the <code>N^Goal</code>, which tells <code>bagof</code> to ignore and group the results of <code>N</code>. As far as I can tell, this is the <em>only</em> place the ISO standard uses <code>^</code> to mean anything besides exponentiation. Supposedly it's the <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/latest4/html/sicstus.html/ref_002dall_002dsum.html" target="_blank">existential quantifier</a>? In general whenever I try to stray outside simpler use-cases, especially if I try to do things non-interactively, I run into trouble.</p>
<h3>I have mixed feelings about symbol terms</h3>
<p>It took me a long time to realize the reason <code>bagof</code>  "works" is because infix symbols are mapped to prefix compound terms, so that  <code>a^b</code> is <code>^(a, b)</code>, and then different predicates can decide to do different things with <code>^(a, b)</code>.</p>
<p>This is also why you can't just write <code>A = B+1</code>: that unifies <code>A</code> with the <em>compound term</em> <code>+(B, 1)</code>. <code>A+1 = B+2</code> is <em>false</em>, as <code>1 \= 2</code>. You have to write <code>A+1 is B+2</code>, as <code>is</code> is the operator that converts <code>+(B, 1)</code> to a mathematical term.</p>
<p>(And <em>that</em> fails because <code>is</code> isn't fully bidirectional. The lhs <em>must</em> be a single variable. You have to import <code>clpfd</code> and write <code>A + 1 #= B + 2</code>.)</p>
<p>I don't like this, but I'm a hypocrite for saying that because I appreciate the idea and don't mind custom symbols in other languages. I guess what annoys me is there's no official definition of what <code>^(a, b)</code> is, it's purely a convention. ISO Prolog uses <code>-(a, b)</code> (aka <code>a-b</code>) as a convention to mean "pairs", and the only way to realize that is to see that an awful lot of standard modules use that convention. But you can use <code>-(a, b)</code> to mean something else in your own code and nothing will warn you of the inconsistency.</p>
<p>Anyway I griped about pairs so I can gripe about <code>sort</code>.</p>
<h3>go home sort, ur drunk</h3>
<p>This one's just a blunder:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>?-</span> <span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>],</span> <span>Out</span><span>).</span>
   <span>Out</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>].</span> <span>% wat</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>According to an expert online this is because sort is supposed to return a sorted <em>set</em>, not a sorted list. If you want to preserve duplicates you're supposed to lift all of the values into <code>-($key, $value)</code> compound terms, then use <a href="https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=keysort/2" target="_blank">keysort</a>, then extract the values. And, since there's no functions, this process takes at least three lines. This is also how you're supposed to sort by a custom predicate, like "the second value of a compound term". </p>
<p>(Most (but not all) distributions have a duplicate merge like <a href="https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=msort/2" target="_blank">msort</a>. SWI-Prolog also has a <a href="https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=predsort/3" target="_blank">sort by key</a> but it removes duplicates.)</p>
<h3>Please just let me end rules with a trailing comma instead of a period, I'm begging you</h3>
<p>I don't care if it makes fact parsing ambiguous, I just don't want "reorder two lines" to be a syntax error anymore</p>
<hr>
<p>I expect by this time tomorrow I'll have been Cunningham'd and there will be a 2000 word essay about how all of my gripes are either easily fixable by doing XYZ or how they are the best possible choice that Prolog could have made. I mean, even in writing this I found out some fixes to problems I had. Like I was going to gripe about how I can't run SWI-Prolog queries from the command line but, in doing do diligence finally <em>finally</em> figured it out:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>swipl<span> </span>-t<span> </span>halt<span> </span>-g<span> </span><span>"bagof(X, Goal, Xs), print(Xs)"</span><span> </span>./file.pl
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's pretty clunky but still better than the old process of having to enter an interactive session every time I wanted to validate a script change.</p>
<p>(Also, answer set programming is pretty darn cool. Excited to write about it in the book!)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>In the Game of Life, which still lifes can be produced by crashing
gliders together? We’ve known for a few years that the answer cannot
be “all of them”, because in 2022 Ilkka Törmä and Ville Salo <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=140258#p140258">found</a> a
patch of still life that, if it exists in the universe, must have
existed since the beginning of time. And so, there is no way we could
have produced it out of empty space through glider collisions. Similar
such patches have been found since, with the goal of optimising size
or population, and at the time of writing the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6830#p209209">record holder</a> is an
unsynthesizable still life with population 154 produced by forum user
“400spartans”.</p>
<p>Finding syntheses for small still lifes is easy, but at some unknown
point below 154 it becomes impossible. Today, we completed our
collaborative project to notch the lower bound up from 22 to 23, by
giving explicit syntheses for all 1,646,147 (strict)<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>A still life is
strict when all its islands are necessary to maintain the stability of
the pattern.</span></span> still lifes with population 23. <!--more--></p>
<p>The final holdout shown below has systematic name
<a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/object/xs23_g88m9icz1iu146/b3s23">xs23_g88m9icz1iu146</a>, and was <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7031&amp;start=150#p223246">solved</a> by vilc.</p>


<p>As you might imagine, this is not the first project of this kind; all
still lifes with 18 bits were synthesised in October 2019, 19 bits in
February 2020, 20 bits in March 2021, 21 bits in November 2022 and 22
bits in August 2024.</p>
<p>As the number of bits increases, the number of distinct still lifes
explodes exponentially, so that the 23-bit project had about 2.4× as
many still lifes to consider as the 22-bit project. The situation is
actually worse than that: not only are there more problems to get
through, but each additional bit reveals knotty new ways for a still
life to fit together.</p>
<p>My contribution was the mass generation of synthesis recipes through
computer searches. These disposed of roughly 99.97% of the targets,
letting the people with actual synthesis talent focus on the ones
where new ideas were needed. I’ll spend the rest of the post talking
about the things I tried.</p>
<p>Here’s the solution for that final still life, split into steps:</p>


<p>Solutions like this are typical: there is a natural reaction that
produces a large chunk of still life, and then many “synthesis
components” massage that into the target.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>There is an unfortunate
clash of terminology between this kind of “component” and a connected
component of a pattern.</span></span></p>
<p>Many of these first steps are discovered via soup searches. Sometimes,
a random soup will produce a still life of interest through the random
collision of some simple reagents. If we are lucky, it is possible to
reproduce the reaction by using gliders to re-create the same
configuration of reagents. We can also find first steps by randomly
colliding gliders directly; this was the topic of a <a href="https://mvr.github.io/posts/cool-still-lifes.html">previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the action happens after this first step, in finding sequences
of components that massage a known still life into the target.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-and-stomp">Transfer and Stomp</h2>
<p>As you can see in the above example, most synthesis steps only touch a
small part of the still life. And because pattern behaviour in the
Game of Life is determined locally, the incoming gliders in a
synthesis step don’t particularly care what the rest of a still life
looks like, only that the part they interact with is correct.</p>


<p>For this reason, there is hope of “transferring” synthesis steps from
one still life to another. There is a <code>transfer.py</code> script in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/parclytaxel/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> that does exactly this: from each component, one can
extract a “component template” which only remembers the placements of
the gliders and the part of the still life which is affected. Then,
for each component template and each target, the script tests whether
the output of the template matches any location on the target, and for
anywhere that matches, whether the component actually effects that
change successfully. This script, together with some <a href="https://github.com/AlexGreason/Transfer">extensions</a> by
Alex Greason, were important in all the synthesis projects up to the
current one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>transfer.py</code> is a little slow, and a little limited.
Independently, vilc and myself worked on some C++ replacements:
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=216201#p216201"><code>transfer.cpp</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/mvr/LifeAPI/blob/master/tools/Stomp.cpp">Stomp</a> respectively.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>The <code>transfer.py</code> script
spends a lot of its time in the underlying C++ <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib"><code>lifelib</code></a> library, so
the change of language doesn’t have as much of an impact as you might
think.</span></span> Stomp is what I used to do the initial mass solving of the
still lifes that only required one step to be transferred from a known
component, as well as to find the long recipes that were necessary for
some of the trickier still lifes.</p>
<p>Stomp does a few things that make it a lot faster; the first is that
it is multithreaded. This is easy enough: processing each target is an
embarrassingly parallel problem. Next, it uses a more refined notion
of “template” that also takes into account neighbourhood counts for
cells that don’t change. This cuts down on the number of false
positive matches a lot. The templates are also not simply applied one
at a time, instead, Stomp builds a tree of templates, where each node
branches on the state of an additional cell in the template (up to
some fairly shallow depth).<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>This was apparently the intended strategy
to be used in the <code>transfer.py</code> script; one of the crucial functions
is called <code>apply_tree</code> but doesn’t actually use a tree.</span></span> This allows
us to throw out a lot of the templates without checking individually
whether they match, once we reach a branch in the tree that no longer
matches any location in the target pattern.</p>
<p>On top of all the above, Stomp is quite discerning about which
component templates it’s willing to consider. I tried a lot of
heuristics while working on Stomp, and here are the ones I landed on
by the end. We ignore components in any of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure cleanup steps, where the thing being deleted is unattached to
the remainder of the still life. Because we are doing a backwards
search for components that lead to a target, allowing cleanup steps
would lead to an explosion of precursors with, say, an extra block
in all possible positions. (<code>transfer.py</code> does the same.)</li>
<li>All the input still lifes are small (<span>&lt;7</span> in population). These are
likely first steps derived from soups as discussed above, and not
generalisable.</li>
<li>Less than 30% of the original still life survives unchanged; to
avoid junk “components” that essentially blow up a still life and
replace it with a new one.</li>
<li>There are multiple disconnected changes to the still life. These
often arise when performing symmetric changes to a symmetric base,
and we may as well apply both steps separately.</li>
<li>The component involves an unnecessary
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Boat-bit">boat-bit</a> reaction. There are
a lot of these, and we may as well do that as a separate step.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all the above, we still run into trouble with the search space exploding. The biggest problem is components that create a small still life, together with additional components that just shove it around pointlessly. For this reason, we further cut down on the new synthesis components we’re willing to consider while the search is running. We skip any new component where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input or output is too sparse. For these purposes, “sparse”
means that there is some connected component that is too far away
from the largest component by population.</li>
<li>The gliders interact with the largest connected component but not
any smaller ones (if there are any).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all glued into a tree search, prioritising precursors with
lowest population. At the end of this post, you can see a solution
that required a very deep tree search to find, and which would
certainly not have been possible without these improvements.</p>
<p>Using the existing components extracted from the Shinjuku database got
us a lot of the way, with only around 2000 23-bit targets resisting
solution at this point.</p>
<p>So, how do we find new components to feed into this machine?</p>
<h2 id="component-farming">Component Farming</h2>
<p>The simplest strategy is to fire some gliders at an object and hope
that it modifies it without destroying it. I did this using a
modification of the GPU searcher from the <a href="https://mvr.github.io/posts/cool-still-lifes.html">previous
post</a>, to iterate through a list of
objects and all possible 3-glider collisions that interact within a
certain time range. If the still life is still mostly present but not
exactly identical to the starting object, the configuration is logged.
Sometimes some extra ash is left behind, so an additional script hunts
for a minimal cleanup.</p>
<p>This kind of random searching surfaces components that couldn’t be
found any other way, because they’re too weird and unexpected to have
been dreamed up by a human. Here’s a few random examples, three of which have automatically-generated cleanup gliders:</p>


<p>With a little more work and a more restricted search area, going
through 4-glider collisions is manageable, though I ended up getting
fewer interesting results than the 3-glider set. One additional
strategy was to place entire spark-producing configurations of gliders
rather than individual gliders. For this, I stole a large set of such
configurations from <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2380">this forum thread</a>. Again, this turned up some
interesting results, but not as many as I had hoped.</p>
<h2 id="mr.-component">Mr.&nbsp;Component</h2>
<p>Kazyan had the following idea on Discord way back in 2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a look at the final step for <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/object?apgcode=xs26_08o0u1eoz32q9871&amp;rule=b3s23"><code>xs26_08o0u1eoz32q9871</code></a>. It
consists of two very distinct halves. Those two subcomponents, at
the time, were known, but since <code>transfer.py</code> had never seen them be
used together, it wouldn’t have known to use them if asked to take
apart that xs26. This vaporware, which I’ve been thinking of as “Mr.
Component”, would be supplied with a list of these halves, assemble
as many complete pairings from that list as possible, and dump the
resulting full components into shinjuku. Then, <code>transfer.py</code> would
do its thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference, here’s that last step that he’s referring to:</p>


<p>I’ve highlighted the crucial cell in red. This cell is never active,
but is the single spot where the two halves of the component interact.
In a single generation this cell goes from underpopulated to
overpopulated, and to achieve this the two halves have to be correctly
synchronised. Applying them to the starting still life in sequence
would not work.</p>
<p>I wrote<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>(For “wrote” read “vibecoded”, this worked disturbingly
well.)</span></span> a small tool to realise Kazyan’s idea. This first goes through
all known components and identifies the above situation; when there
are two barely-interacting pieces that rely on each other to succeed.
Each piece stores the “timing” it requires, that is, on which
generation the above sort of neighbourhood change occurs.</p>
<p>Then, like Stomp above, we run through some list of targets and try to
apply all of these discovered parts to it. Each pair of matching parts
is tested to see whether they actually succeed simultaneously, once
their timing is aligned.</p>
<p>Of course this is not fully general; in principle a component may have
more than two pieces that require synchronisation at multiple
generations. If you have any examples let me know! The two-part
version of the tool worked well enough.</p>
<p>Overall Mr.&nbsp;Component worked well, and resulted in a bunch of
automated solutions that I think would have had to be found by hand
otherwise. Here’s a couple of example steps, with the crucial cells
highlighted. Notice that the cell in the rightmost example actually
goes from overpopulated to underpopulated, giving that tricky bridge
motif in the middle.</p>


<h2 id="the-trickiest-recipe">The Trickiest Recipe</h2>
<p>To conclude, here’s the 23-bit still life with the most complicated
recipe at the time of writing: 47 steps and 178 gliders in total. This
was found through a Stomp search with unlimited depth and maximum
intermediate population of 32. If it works, it works!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><p dir="auto">Hey all, update on the tldraw policy with regard to contributions.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the good of the project, we're going to begin <strong>automatically closing pull requests from external contributors</strong>. We will of course continue to welcome issues, bug reports, and discussions. This is a temporary policy until GitHub provides better tools for managing contributions.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Getting ahead of it</h3>
<p dir="auto">Like many other open-source projects on GitHub, we’ve recently seen a significant increase in contributions generated entirely by AI tools. While some of these pull requests are formally correct, most suffer from incomplete or misleading context, misunderstanding of the codebase, and little to no follow-up engagement from their authors.</p>
<p dir="auto">An open pull request represents a commitment from maintainers: that the contribution will be reviewed carefully and considered seriously for inclusion. For that commitment to remain meaningful, we need to be more selective. For now, that means closing first and selectively re-opening pull requests that are actually under consideration, with the expectation that most unsolicited submissions will not be reviewed.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Weird year coming</h3>
<p dir="auto">I first made the tldraw repository public in 2021, and I’ve been proud to invite public contribution to its code and have been happy to have many improving pull requests over the years. I’m sorry to shut that down, however I sincerely believe this decision is in the best interests of the project, our code, and our community. With luck, GitHub will soon roll out management features that let us open things back up.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is going to be a weird year for programmers and open source especially. For now, whether you’ve contributed before, are interested in contributing in the future, or just are a friend of the project: thank you and please hang on while we all figure this stuff out.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I was a junior engineer, my manager would occasionally confide his frustrations to me in our weekly 1:1s. He would point out a project another team was working on and say, “I don’t believe that project will go anywhere, they’re solving the wrong problem.” I used to wonder, “But you are very senior, why don’t you just go and speak to them about your concerns?” It felt like a waste of his influence to not say anything.</p><p>So it’s quite ironic that I found myself last week explaining to a mentee why I thought a sister team’s project would have to pivot because they’d made a poor early design choice. And he rightfully asked me the same question I had years ago: “why don’t you just tell them your opinion?” It’s been on my mind ever since because I realized I’d changed my stance on it a lot over the years.</p><p><strong>The answer is that being right and being effective are different.</strong></p><p>In large companies, speaking up about what you see as a “bad project” is a good thing. But only in moderation. Sometimes the mark of seniority is realizing that arguing with people who won’t listen isn’t worth it; it’s better to save your counsel.</p><h2 id="bad-projects">Bad projects</h2><p>What I mean by a “bad project” is many things:</p><ul><li><strong>UX</strong>: making product complicated, solving a problem which doesn’t exist, breaking existing workflows</li><li><strong>Technical</strong>: overcomplicated design, wrong library, poor performing architecture</li><li><strong>Political</strong>: chasing hype cycles, exists primarily to justify a promotion</li></ul><p>It’s important to point out that for much of the lifecycle of a project, whether it’s “bad” is <em>highly</em> subjective. Software engineering is largely a game of tradeoffs and making decisions which are not perfect but the best possible with the information available. There often can be disagreements on whether correct choices are made and it only becomes obvious much later on, potentially years after a project has shipped.</p><p>But as you become more senior, you’ll start to have “taste” when it comes to software projects and that will cause you to look at some fraction of the software projects and feel “this doesn’t make sense”. And this gut feeling is the sign to me of a “bad project”, one which you can see in advance of when it’s obvious to everyone.</p><p>Drawing on my personal experience, the most memorable example was a few years ago at Google . There was a high-profile announcement internally of a “game changer” project that sat right at the intersection of two extremely large organizations. It was technically amazing and elegant, and full of clever ideas for really hard problems.</p><p>But I distinctly remember sitting in the room for the announcement, turning to my lead and whispering, “This project has no chance of succeeding, right?” He turned to me and just said, “Yup.” We both realized the problem immediately. The project was entirely based on a platform team asking a flagship product team to give up control of their core user flow: technically the right move, but no lead or PM would ever cede ownership of something that central to another team. Politically, this project was a total fantasy.</p><p>The project kept quietly chugging away in the background for almost two years. Every time it got close to launch, it would get pushed back as “not ready yet.” Over time, we heard less and less about it until, eventually, the inevitable “strategic pivot” email appeared in my inbox. Resources were reallocated and the code was deleted. We were told the company “learned a lot from the effort,” but to me it felt like it was doomed from the beginning. Politics and solving the correct problem matter just as much as technical beauty.</p><h2 id="why-you-cannot-stop-them-all">Why you cannot stop them all</h2><p>When I started noticing “bad projects” and I felt that I had some expertise to share, the temptation for me was to start calling them out. Reach out to the team doing it, tell them “this doesn’t make sense” and explain to them why. Use facts and logic to persuade.</p><p>And I did do this. But only for a very short time before I realized that there are a lot of costs to doing this that I just wasn’t thinking about.</p><p>Firstly, software companies have an inherent bias for action. They value speed and shipping highly. Concerns, by definition, <em>slow things down</em> and mean people have to look at things which they hadn’t budgeted for. And so unless your concern is big enough to overcome the “push for landing”, there’s little chance for any meaningful change to come from you saying something. In fact, it’s very likely that you’ll be largely ignored.</p><p>Related to this, even if the team <em>does</em> take your concern seriously, you have to be careful not to do it too often. Once or twice, you might be seen as someone who is upholding “quality”. But do it too often and you quickly move to being seen as a “negative person”, someone who is constantly a problem maker, not a problem “fixer”. You rarely get credit for the disasters you prevented. Because nothing happened, people forget about it quickly.</p><p>There’s also the problem that every time you push back, you are potentially harming someone’s promotion packet or a VP’s “pet project.” You are at risk of burning bridges and creating “enemies”, at least of a sort. Having a few people who disagree in a big company with you is the cost of doing business, but if you have too many, it starts affecting your main work too.</p><p>Finally, there is also the psychological impact. There is one of you and hundreds of engineers working in spaces that your expertise might help with. Your attention is finite, but the capacity for a large company to generate bad ideas is infinite. Speaking from experience, getting too involved in stopping these quickly can make you <em>very</em> cynical about the state of the world. And this is really not a good place to be.</p><h2 id="manage-influence-like-a-bank-account">Manage influence like a bank account</h2><p>So if you cannot stop all the bad projects, what do you do? You get strategic. Instead of trying to fix everything, view your influence as a bank account. You have a certain amount of “influence” coming in every month as you do your job, help people, ship successful projects, and generally remain low friction.</p><p>Then, when it matters, you should be ready to make “withdrawals.” Every time you block something or raise concerns, no matter how small, you are writing a check against your balance. But not all checks are the same size:</p><ul><li><strong>The $5 Check:</strong> A nitpick on a code review. Cheap, daily expense.</li><li><strong>The $500 Check:</strong> Challenging an architectural decision or pushing back on a timeline. Requires some savings.</li><li><strong>The $50,000 Check:</strong> Trying to kill a VP’s pet project. This is a massive spend. You might only afford this once every few years.</li></ul><p>The problem comes if you spend $5 on every minor inefficiency you see. If you are constantly saying “no” to small things, your account will be empty when you need to write the big check to stop a true disaster.</p><p>If you “go overdrawn,” you enter political bankruptcy. People stop inviting you to meetings, they stop asking for your opinion, they essentially start working around you. Once you are bankrupt, your influence drops to zero and you not only harm your ability to influence things but also start hurting your own ability to get things done.</p><h2 id="when-to-spend-influence">When to spend influence</h2><p>Given that we’ve now accepted that we cannot weigh in on everything, we need to figure out when it <em>does</em> make sense to do so.</p><p>The most important thing to do first is to be humble and evaluate whether you actually have the expertise to make a judgment. Seniority often brings opinions, but those are not always informed opinions. For example, while I have some frontend experience, I do not feel qualified to give deep advice on it because my knowledge is “enough to get by” rather than deep expertise that comes from long term ownership. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that high-quality judgments require informed opinions. If you find yourself in this position, see yourself as an opinionated observer and stop there.</p><p>You must also internalize the fact that just because you say something does not make it the truth. You are raising awareness of a point of view, not issuing a decree. So if some team doesn’t listen to your concerns and decides to go ahead with what they were doing anyway, then you have to accept that and move on: at the end of the day, you’re an engineer, not a CEO with authority over them!</p><p>Given these points, I use three main factors to decide when to speak up:</p><ol><li><strong>How close is the project to my team?</strong></li><li><strong>If it goes wrong, how much impact will it have on my team?</strong></li><li><strong>If it goes wrong, how big will the problem be for the company?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Proximity.</strong> If a project is close to you, the “price tag” of saying something is lower. If it is within your own team, the cost is near zero because you have high trust and a quick conversation often solves it. If it is in your broader organization, the price goes up; you have to spend social capital and potentially stake your reputation. If it is outside your org? The cost is often prohibitive. You have zero leverage, different reporting chains, and stopping it would require a massive withdrawal.</p><p><strong>Team Impact.</strong> Sometimes another org does something that deeply affects your work. For example, because <a href="https://perfetto.dev/">Perfetto</a> (the performance tool I work on) has users throughout Google, sometimes a team will ask us to sign off on a very complex integration. This is a classic risk: if things go right, they get the credit, but if things go wrong, your leadership might expect <em>you</em> to help solve a problem you didn’t create. In these cases, the payoff of speaking up is high because you are protecting your team.</p><p><strong>Company Scale.</strong> Finally, consider the blast radius. Some projects are self-contained; if they fail, they only take themselves down. Others are so intertwined with core systems that their failure causes widespread damage or creates technical debt that persists for years. These can be deadly to the long-term health of a project.</p><h2 id="how-to-act-with-bad-projects">How to act with bad projects</h2><p>It’s also not just about when you put your opinions forward but how you do it. There’s a very wide range of actions you can take depending on what you’re facing.</p><h3 id="when-you-intervene">When you intervene</h3><p>The nuclear option is to directly say “we should not do this” and try to shut the project down. This almost always requires escalation to your leads and the leads of the owning team, requiring great conviction in both the fact that you’re right and that this project will be actively harmful. But on some occasions, this is the right thing to do, especially if the cost of not saying something can be existential to your project or team.</p><p>A slightly softer but still quite risky variant of this is, instead of doing a direct escalation, you raise concerns in directly with the team. Usually this is done with a meeting with the team or a strongly worded “concern” or “rebuttal” doc. The goal is to speak in strong enough terms that the team themselves conclude that this the project might not be a good idea.</p><p>Then there are the smaller interventions, nudging things in the right direction. These are perfect for when a team is about to do something that makes sense from a high level but they are going about this the wrong way. I see this often with Perfetto: a team sends a design doc proposing a complex use of Perfetto that I know will cause them pain later. I sit down with them, understand their actual problem, and guide them to a better solution. It costs an hour but saves them months. If you do it right, you can even be seen as a helper rather than a hindrance, even if you do slow down the team.</p><h3 id="when-you-dont">When you don’t</h3><p>Sometimes you conclude that the ROI just isn’t there to do anything direct: the political momentum is too strong, or the issue is too small to justify spending any influence. At this point, what you do depends on how much your team is involved.</p><p>If it overlaps with your team’s work heavily then it might be best to make some subtle contingency plans: reducing your dependency on it or building abstractions to cope if it goes away. There is also a long game trick here. Even a bad project usually has an “essence” of a good idea, a specific problem it was trying to solve or an insight it was based on. If it fits with your job, it’s often a good idea to take that essence and see if you can naturally incorporate a better version of that specific solution into your own project. That way, if the bad project stalls or gets canceled, you can be proactive instead of reactive to the fallout.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’re not involved, it’s easy: just stay out of the picture. Vent to friendly colleagues in private, commiserate, but in public, live with the reality.</p><h3 id="managing-your-team-through-it">Managing your team through it</h3><p>Finally, you must manage your own team through the process. If you can see the flaws in a project, other senior engineers probably see them too. Don’t try to gaslight them or “walk the company line” by pretending a bad project is actually good. It destroys trust.</p><p>Instead, be honest about the facts on the ground without going into unnecessary political details. Tell them that you will do the best you can under these constraints.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So what did I tell my mentee? “I’ve learned that being right and being effective are different things. I could go tell them my concerns. They probably wouldn’t listen. I’d burn some goodwill. And in six months, nobody will remember that I called it, they’ll just remember I was the guy who tried to block their work”.</p><p>When you’re earlier in your career, you want to believe that good ideas win on merit, that if you just explain clearly enough, people will see reason. It took me quite some time to accept that big companies don’t work that way.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean you stop caring. It means you get strategic about when to spend your credibility. Pick the battles where you can actually change the outcome, where your team will be hurt if you stay silent, where the cost of being wrong is low but the cost of the project failing is high.</p><p>And for everything else? You vent to colleagues, you make quiet contingency plans, and you watch. Sometimes you learn something. Sometimes you’re wrong and the project actually works. And sometimes you get to feel that grim satisfaction of predicting exactly how things would fall apart.</p><p>None of this is as satisfying as fixing everything. But it works and keeps me sane.</p></section></div>]]></description>
