<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’re already signed up, great! If you’d like to sign up and receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Happy belated Thanksgiving. I didn’t say this last week, but I truly am grateful for you reading this newsletter and sending me your thoughts and ideas. It’s been a wonderful ride so far, and hopefully we’ll keep at it for a long time.</p><p>Today I’m writing about how the giant government contracting firm Booz Allen and 13 government agencies have been renting back to the public access to our own lands by forcing us to pay junk fees to use national parks. It involves a tour through late 19th century political economy thinking, with the first appearance of the great anti-monopolist Henry George, whose focus was land. Plus, a weird attempted monopoly of ID management software, controlled by software private equity giant Thoma Bravo.</p><p><em>“I Seen My Opportunities and I Took ’Em.” - George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</em></p><p><span>Two of the classic works of late 19th century American political literature, representing precisely opposite views of how commerce in an industrialized democracy ought to work, are Henry George’s </span><em>Progress and Poverty</em><span>, and the speeches of George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall.</span></p><p>George was one of the great political economists of his day, and he ran and lost for mayor of New York City on an anti-monopoly and land reform ticket. George was interested in why we experienced tremendous inequality in the midst of great wealth, and traced it to the exploitation of land. </p><p><span>George was an international superstar, influencing both Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, as well as environmentalists and the modern libertarian movement. (There’s an iconic statue of the greatest mayor in Cleveland history, Tom Johnson, with Johnson </span><a href="https://www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/items/show/356" rel="">holding</a><span> a copy of </span><em>Progress and Poverty.) </em><span>The modern academic profession of economics arose in part as a reaction to the popular success of George’s work. The game </span><em>Monopoly</em><span> comes directly from George, and in many ways, the national parks, as well as everything from spectrum allocation to offshore oil drilling, must wrestle with Georgeist thinking. </span></p><p><span>But by land, he meant far more than just the plots upon which we live. “The term land,” George wrote, “necessarily includes, not merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water and the air, but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it is only by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man can come in contact with or use nature.” Unlike Marx, who saw the exploitation of capital over labor, George thought that the root of social disorder was a result of the power of the </span><em>landowner</em><span> over both capital and labor. </span></p><p>By land, he meant all value drawn purely from nature or from collective human existence. He would, for instance, consider ‘network effects’ a form of land, and likely seek regulation or national control of search engines. George had his first run-in with monopoly in San Francisco, where a telegraph monopolist destroyed his newspaper by denying him wire service. But his key work, in 1879, was written before the rise of the giant trusts, just as railroads, which were really land kingdoms, were becoming dominant.</p><p>A much more cynical set of works are the speeches of Plunkitt. Plunkitt was a political boss in New York City, a proud machine politician in office at the same time in the same political arena as George. Both men were interested in modern industry and wealth, and in both cases, the key fulcrum around which power flowed was not capital, but land. But while George sought a better world, Plunkitt just wanted to get rich, and saw in the purchase of land one of the key ways to do that.</p><p>Plunkitt’s key moral guidepost was the practical wielding of political power to enrich oneself. He posited something called “Honest Graft,” which he distinguished from crime in a formulation that every important corporate lobbyist, knowingly or not, has since used. To Plunkitt, stealing would be taking something that doesn’t belong to you. But if you happened to know that the city would need a piece of land, and you got there first, well, that was simply smart. As Plunkitt put it:</p><blockquote><p>"I could get nothin' at a bargain but a big piece of swamp, but I took it fast enough and held on to it. What turned out was just what I counted on. They couldn't make the park complete without Plunkitt's swamp, and they had to pay a good price for it. Anything dishonest in that?"</p></blockquote><p><span>George was part of the land reform anti-monopoly school of Anglo-American thought, from </span><a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/02/frederick-douglass-accumulation-wealth-land-reformer" rel="">Frederick Douglass</a><span> to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/grahamcclark1/status/1596534617024368640" rel="">Thaddeus Stevens</a><span>. Plunkitt was a machine politician, and proud of it. The battle between these two elements of America, the desire to conserve the public weal versus the desire to cynically plunder it, is still fierce today. It will probably never end. </span></p><p>And that brings me to the political conflict over our national parks, and the strange situation whereby a large government contractor, Booz Allen, somehow found itself in a position to rent us back our own land.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png" width="874" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:874,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1128379,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Red Rock Canyon in Nevada.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Every day, visitors to Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in Northern Arizona hike into an area named Coyote Buttes North to see one of the “most visually striking geologic sandstone formations in the world,” which is known as The Wave. On an ancient layer of sandstone, millions of years of water and wind erosion crafted 3,000-foot cliffs, weird red canyons that look like you are on the planet Mars, and giant formations that look like crashing waves made of rock. There are old carvings known as ‘petroglyphs’ on cliff walls, and even “dinosaur tracks embedded in the sediment.”</p><p><span>The Wave is unlike anywhere else on Earth. It is also part of a U.S. national park, and thus technically, it’s open to anyone. Yet, to preserve its natural beauty, the Bureau of Land Management lets just 64 people daily visit the area. Snagging one of these slots is an accomplishment, a ticket into The Wave is </span><a href="https://canyonsandchefs.com/blog/how-to-win-the-wave-lottery/" rel="">known</a><span> as “The Hardest Permit to Get in the USA” by Outside and Backpacker Magazines. </span></p><p>To apply requires going to Recreation.gov, the site set up to manage national parks, public cultural landmarks, and public lands, and paying $9 for a “Lottery Application Fee.” If you win, you get a permit, and pay a recreation fee of $7. The success rate for the lottery is between 4-10%, and some people spend upwards of $500 before securing an actual permit.</p><p>But while the recreation fee of $7 goes to maintaining the park - which is what Henry George would appreciate - the money for the “Lottery Application Fee” is pure Plunkitt. That money goes to the giant D.C. consulting firm, Booz Allen and Company. In fact, since 2017, more and more of America’s public lands - over 4,200 facilities and 113,000 individual sites across the country at last count - have been added to the Recreation.gov database and website run by Booz Allen, which in turn captures various fees that Americans pay to visit their national heritage.</p><p><span>You can do a lot at Recreation.gov. You can sign up for a pass to cut down a Christmas tree on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, get permits to fly-fishing,&nbsp;rifle hunting or target practice at thousands of sites, or even secure a tour at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. There are dozens of </span><a href="https://www.recreation.gov/lottery/available" rel="">lotteries</a><span> to enter for different parks and lands that are hard to access. And all of them come with service fees attached, fees that go </span><a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/articles/no-recgov-doesnt-fund-public-lands" rel="">directly</a><span> to Booz Allen, which built Recreation.gov. The deeper you go, the more interesting the gatekeeping. As one angry writer found out after waiting on hold and being transferred multiple times, the answer is that Booz Allen “actually sets the Recreation.gov fees for themselves.”</span></p><p><span>Lately, hundreds of sites have begun requiring the use of the site. A typical example is Red Rock Canyon, which added "timed entry permit" in the past two years. Such parks, before adding these new processes, usually do a "trial" period followed by a public comment period, and then the fees are approved by a Resource Advisory Council, </span><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5442009.pdf" rel="">objects of derision</a><span> composed of people appointed by the government bureaus. As one person involved in the process told me, these councils are sort of ridiculous. “Agencies fill it with people beholden to them,” he said. “so the council playing committee rubber stamps whatever they send their way, often even if it makes no sense.”</span></p><p>The&nbsp;entry permit almost always become permanent. This includes heavily visited lands like Acadia National Park (4 million annual&nbsp;visitors), Arches National Park (1.5 million), Glacier National Park (3 million), Rocky Mountain National Park (4.4 million), and Yosemite (3.3 million). There’s nothing wrong with charging a fee for the use of a national park, as long as that fee is necessary for the upkeep and is used to maintain the public resource. </p><p><span>That was in fact the point of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/108th-congress/house-report/790" rel="">law passed</a><span> in 2004 - the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act - to give permanent authority to government agencies to charge fees for the use of public lands. But what Booz Allen is doing is different. The incentives are creating the same dynamics for public lands that we see with junk fees across the economy. Just as airlines are charging for carry-on bags and hotels are forcing people to pay ‘resort fees,’ some national parks are now </span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/national-park-reservations/" rel="">requiring</a><span> reservations with fees attached. And as scalpers automatically grabbed Taylor Swift tickets from Ticketmaster using high-speed automated programs, there are now </span><a href="https://www.rvtravel.com/battling-bots-995b/" rel="">bots</a><span> booking campsites.</span></p><p>None of this is criminal, though the fee structure may not be lawful, but it is very George Washington Plunkitt. “I Seen My Opportunities,” he said, “and I Took ’Em.”</p><p>The entry point for Booz Allen can be traced back to the Obama administration, and a giant failed IT project. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, pledging that by 2014, the government would have a website up in which uninsured Americans could buy health insurance with various subsidies. In perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments of the Obama administration, Healthcare.gov failed to launch the day the new health law came into force, and millions couldn’t sign up to take advantage of it.</p><p><span>It’s hard to overstate the shame of that moment. The government had spent $400 million over four years - more time than it took the U.S. to enter and win World War II - and yet, the dozens of contractors </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/" rel="">couldn’t</a><span> set up a website to take sign-ups. The whole thing was an embarrassing disaster, a festival of incompetence and greed. (Despite the failure, the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/" rel="">main IT contractor</a><span>’s CEO became a billionaire. Honest graft indeed.)</span></p><p>President Obama hired Google’s Mike Dickerson to come in and fix the Healthcare.gov website, which Dickerson and his team did. This wasn’t some miracle, it’s not like websites were new technology. The government itself created the internet and most of the underpinnings of digital technology, and it had many functional and important systems. But the Google name at that point was magic, and so the U.S. Digital Service, designed to help the government use technology, was born. After Dickerson, the new head was Google’s Matt Cutts, and then health care monopolist Optum’s Mina Hsiang. The U.S. Digital Service, far from being particularly competent, is a branding exercise. It is full of people from Amazon and Google, and tends to push the government to outsource its technology to third party contractors.</p><p><span>Following the U.S. Digital Service’s </span><a href="https://www.doi.gov/ocl/recreationgov" rel="">playbook</a><span> is what led the government to bid out and allow the creation of Recreation.gov, with its weird and corrupt fee structure. In 2017, Booz Allen </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/seeking-happy-campers-government-offers-revamped-travel-portal-11570742343" rel="">got</a><span> a 10-year $182 million contract to consolidate all booking for public lands and waters, with 13 separate agencies participating, from the Bureau of Land Management to the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration to the National Park Service to the Smithsonian Institution to the Tennessee Valley Authority to the US Forest Service.</span></p><p><span>The funding structure of the site is exactly what George Washington Plunkitt would design. Though there’s a ten year contract with significant financial outlays, Booz Allen says the project </span><a href="https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/thought-leadership/reinventing-the-recreation-gov-customer-experience.html" rel="">was built</a><span> “at no cost to the federal government.”</span><strong> </strong><span>In the contractor’s words, “the unique contractual agreement is a transaction-based fee model that lets the government and Booz Allen share in risk, reward, results, and impact.” In other words, Booz Allen gets to keep the fees charged to users who want access to national parks. Part of the deal was that Booz Allen </span><a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/technology-main/2017/02/amid-bid-battle-recreation-gov-high-hopes-connecting-vacationers-federal-data/" rel="">would get</a><span> the right to negotiate fees to third party sites that want access to data on Federal lands.</span></p><p><span>It’s a bit hard to tell how much Booz Allen was paid to set up the site. Documents suggest the firm received a lot of money to do so, but it’s also possible that total amount was the anticipated financial return. I wrote to Recreation.gov team leader Julie McPherson at Booz Allen to find out what they were paid to build the site, and I haven’t heard back. Regardless, there’s a lot of money involved. For instance, as one </span><a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/articles/no-recgov-doesnt-fund-public-lands" rel="">camper</a><span> noted, in just one lottery to hike Mount Whitney, more than 16,000 people applied, and only a third got in. Yet everyone paid the $6 registration fee, which means the gross income for that single location is over $100,000. There’s nothing criminal about this scheme, but it is a form of Honest Graft, or of handing a Ticketmaster-like firm control of our national parks.</span></p><p>In 2020, an avid hiker named Thomas Kotab sued the Bureau of Land Management over the $2 “processing fee it charges to access the mandatory online reservation system to visit the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area.” He claimed, among other things, that the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act mandated that this fee was unlawful, because it had not gone through the notice-and-comment period required by the act. Kotab, an electrical engineer by training, is one of those ass-kickers in America, who just goes after a grift because, well, it’s just wrong.</p><p>A few years later, a judge named Jennifer A. Dorsey, appointed by Obama in 2013, agreed with him. She looked at the statute and found that Congress authorized the charging of recreation fees for the purpose of taking care and using Federal lands, not administrative fees that compensated third parties. As such, Booz Allen’s ability to set its own prices was inconsistent with the law mandating the public’s right to comment on what we are charged for using our own land.</p><p>The BLM sought to appeal, but then dropped it in July. Rather than a bitter procedural argument about classifying fees, the government and Booz Allen have decided they’ll just go through the annoying process of having the public comment on Booz Allen’s compensation, and then ignore us using their phony advisory council process. Here, for instance, is the Mojave-Southern Great Basin Resource Advisory Council Meeting in August simply proposing to substitute new standard amenity fees “equal to the associated Recreation.gov reservation service fee.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Canyon’s timed entry system from 2020-2022, but they’ll probably ignore that and steal the money. That verges into actual graft from the ‘honest’ type, but I suspect Plunkitt did that as well from time to time.</p><p><span>And yet, it’s not over. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act authorization </span><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10151.pdf" rel="">runs out</a><span> in October of 2023, which means that Congress has to renew it. Hopefully, an interested member of Congress who loves Federal lands could actually tighten the definitions here, and find a way to stop Booz Allen and these 13 government agencies from engaging in this minor theft via junk fees. It wouldn’t be hard, and it would be fun to force a bunch of government agencies to actually do their job and either take over the site themselves or pay Booz Allen a fee for its service. (Another path would be Joe Biden, through his anti-junk fee initiative, simply </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/" rel="">asserting</a><span> through the White House Competition Council to the 13 different agencies that they end Booz Allen’s practice of charging these kinds of fees.)</span></p><p>It’s easy enough to see scams everywhere, and here is certainly one of them. But let’s not lose sight of the broader point. Henry George, at least in this fight, has won. Yes, Booz Allen gets to steal some pennies, but we have a remarkable system of public lands and waters that are broadly available for all of us to use on a relatively equal basis. And we can still see the power of George-ism in the advocacy of hikers and in the intense view that members of Congress had when they passed the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act in 2004, which strictly regulated fees that Americans would have to pay to access our Federal lands. Indeed, the anger and revulsion I felt at the fees Booz Allen puts forward comes from George, even if I didn’t necessarily trace it there at first.</p><p>We are in a moment of institutional corruption, but these moments are transitory as institutions change. George Washington Plunkitt, and his political descendants at Booz Allen, might have gotten rich, but Henry George imparted instincts to Americans that are far more permanent.</p><p><span>Last week, I published a piece on Thoma Bravo, the private equity </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters" rel="">bridge trolls</a><span> of enterprise software, and how they are trying to roll up the corporate software that large firms use to manage the identity and logins of customers and workers across their many apps and devices. The PE firm, which was responsible for the SolarWinds catastrophic hack in 2020, recently bought both Ping Identity and ForgeRock, which are two of the three firms that sell this product to very large security conscious multi-nationals. </span></p><p><span>This is a worrisome roll-up, because you don’t want to have important software in the hands of a private equity firm that has a dedicated track record of cyber-security screw-ups. And yes, Thoma Bravo is that bad. One researcher had previously </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-solarwinds/hackers-used-solarwinds-dominance-against-it-in-sprawling-spy-campaign-idUSKBN28Q07P" rel="">alerted</a><span> the company that “anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123.’” Ouch.</span></p><p><span>You can read the </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters" rel="">full article here</a><span>. </span></p><p><a href="https://www.baronpa.com/podcast/welcome-to-the-jungle/" rel="">Welcome to the Jungle</a><span>, </span><em>Baron Public Affairs. </em><span>On this podcast from a D.C.-intelligence firm, the hosts note that Amazon has hired roughly 3,000 former government officials to staff its various divisions.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code
optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch
to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized
assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program.
Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts
before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary
learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model
and improve the model's depth of understanding.
<br>We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0%
improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two
state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore,
the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating
compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the
compiler 70% of the time.

<ul><li>You can reference or even clone a  <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwc/archive">recent virtual HWC event</a> as a starting point</li>
<li>If this is the first time you are hosting your meetup, you will need to write your own description for the event. Feel free to use existing pages on the events page as inspiration and to understand the format event pages typically use.</li>
<li>Include a link to a unique <a href="https://indieweb.org/etherpad" title="etherpad">etherpad</a> for the event using YYYY-MM-DD format and a short description, e.g. <a href="https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2023-01-18-hwc-pacific">https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2023-01-18-hwc-pacific</a></li>
<li>Use one of the <a href="#Logos_and_Graphics">HWC Logos and Graphics</a> for the event image. The retro image has been a popular one the last several years.</li></ul></li>
<li>Invite everyone who attended previous Homebrew Website Club meetups in the event's timezone, those you've invited before, and any friends you know who may be interested in having their own website, upgrading their blog, etc.
<ul><li>Use <a href="https://indieweb.org/invitation" title="invitation">invitation</a> posts</li>

<h4><span id="Setting_up_the_meeting_room">Setting up the meeting room</span></h4>
<ul><li>If you are using the IndieWeb Zoom account, familiarize yourself with <a href="https://indieweb.org/Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts" title="Zoom">Zoom - Tips for Hosts</a>
<ul><li>Access to the IndieWeb Zoom account can be requested in the #indieweb-chat channel</li>
<li>Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.</li>
<li>Start the Zoom meeting 10 minutes before the scheduled start time. The event listing on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a> will automatically update to include a "Live Now" link that attendees can click to join.</li></ul></li>
<li>If you are using a different video service, you will need to update the event listing on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a> with the link to join.</li>
<li>Post a message in the #indieweb channel that the meeting is starting</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Running_the_event">Running the event</span></h3>
<ul><li>Welcome
<ul><li>Direct attendees to <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">https://indieweb.org/discuss</a> for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat</li>
<li>Point out the <a href="https://indieweb.org/code_of_conduct" title="code of conduct">code of conduct</a> at <a href="https://indieweb.org/coc">https://indieweb.org/coc</a></li>

<li>Introductions
<ul><li>Introduce yourself and your site following <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast" title="Homebrew Website Club">HWC Broadcast</a>, then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: Explain you're taking a group photo (screenshot) that will appear in the event page, <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week-in-the-indieweb" title="this-week-in-the-indieweb">This Week in the IndieWeb newsletter</a>, and the @indiewebcamp <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> post. Allow people to turn off their video if they prefer to not be in the photo.
<ul><li>In Zoom, choose the option "Hide Non-video Participants" before taking the screenshot.</li></ul></li>
<li>Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
<ul><li>Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.</li>
<li>Looser, general discussion without timeboxes</li>
<li>A quiet writing period followed by discussion</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo</li>
<li>If you are meeting regularly, announce when the next event will be</li></ul>

<h3><span id="Setup">Setup</span></h3>
<ul><li>17:00 arrive at the venue and:
<ul><li>make sure there is suitable seating for those that have RSVPd</li>
<li>make or bring a sign that clearly indicates the presence of an IndieWebCamp Homebrew Website Club meeting. If you come up with a nice sign design, please upload it to the wiki!</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>17:20 put the sign out (or put up the IndieWebCamp logo on monitors in the space if any)
<ul><li>save seats for at least a few of the folks who RSVPd</li>
<li>consider setting aside a separate room or space for "Conversation Corner" for those that can't help but want to carry on a conversation during Quiet Writing Hour!</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>17:25 test your projector setup to make sure people can show demos of their sites during the "Broadcast" half-hour from 18:30-19:30.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Quiet_Writing_Hour">Quiet Writing Hour</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour</b>: some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Broadcast">HWC Broadcast</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>18:30-19:00: Broadcast</b> - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:</li>
<li>if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.</li>
<li>something <b>new you created on or for your site</b> since the last time you attended</li>
<li><b>questions</b> about anything you're stuck on <b>about your personal site</b></li>
<li><b>notable</b> indieweb / ownyourdata related <b>press</b> / events</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Group_Photo">HWC Group Photo</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:00: Group photo</b> - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.</li></ul>
<p>Please be sure to:
</p>
<ul><li>Give folks a heads-up before you take a photo, especially in virtual meetups, to give folks an opportunity to opt-out</li>
<li>Make sure there are 2+ people who want to be in the photo, otherwise it looks like a meetup by one person with only one person which isn't really a meetup.</li></ul>
<p>You may omit a photo if there is only one person who wants to be in the photo.
</p>
<h3><span id="HWC_Peer_to_Peer">HWC Peer to Peer</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer</b> - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with <a href="https://indieweb.org/getting_started" title="getting started">getting started</a> with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Group_Photo_2">HWC Group Photo 2</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:30: Group photo</b> - If you forgot to take a group photo, or anyone new showed up, use the end of the peer-to-peer session as an opportunity to take another group photo.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Clean-up_and_close">HWC Clean-up and close</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure</b> - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Immediately_after">HWC Immediately after</span></h3>
<ul><li>Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post.
<ul><li>(Optionally) Syndicate the post to <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieNews" title="IndieNews">IndieNews</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Add to the event page on the wiki:
<ul><li>At least one group photo from your meeting.</li>
<li>Any other wrap-up posts with notes from the meeting.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Planning_Questions">Planning Questions</span></h2>
<p>In rough order of when a co-organizer might encounter these:
</p>
<h3><span id="Finding_a_venue">Finding a venue</span></h3>
<p>How do I find a venue?
</p>
<ul><li>Check out cafes that have an environment where people are sparse and the cafe is ok with hanging out with laptops for an hour or two.</li></ul>
<p>What kind of food venue is works well?
</p>
<ul><li>Cafe style is best, where you order at the counter separately, and can come and go independently.</li>
<li>Wifi is a nice to have (or get someone to bring a mifi hotspot and share)</li>
<li>Power outlets are also a nice to have</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Adding_to_the_wiki">Adding to the wiki</span></h3>
<p>How should a co-organizer add a HWC-event to the wiki?
</p><p>We are now using <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org/</a> for HWC-events!
</p><p>The easiest is to clone an existing event, e.g.:
</p>
<ul><li>Find the most recent HWC in your city in <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/archive">https://events.indieweb.org/archive</a></li>
<li>Click the drop-down next to "Edit" on the right and choose "Clone Event"</li>
<li>Edit the event details to fix the date, confirm the time &amp; venue, update the description</li>
<li>Save!</li></ul>
<p>If there isn't a previous HWC event in your city, feel free to clone from another HWC event, e.g.:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/homebrew-website-club-san-francisco-KTBJlSw7JJKm">https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/homebrew-website-club-san-francisco-KTBJlSw7JJKm</a></li></ul>
<h3><span id="Promoting_an_HWC_event">Promoting an HWC event</span></h3>
<p>How do I promote an HWC event? 
</p>
<ul><li>Invite participants from previous HWC events in the same city.</li>
<li>Invite participants from <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps" title="IndieWebCamps">IndieWebCamps</a> from that city</li></ul>
<p>There are several <a href="#Logos_and_Graphics">logos and graphics</a> you can use in your promotions.
</p>
<h3><span id="Promoting_Regular_HWC_Meetups">Promoting Regular HWC Meetups</span></h3>
<p>Some organizers have found it useful to create a separate web and social media presence for their group. This allows potential attendees to stay up-to-date on upcoming events without needing to follow the organizers' feeds, and (potentially) allows multiple organizers to manage announcements and marketing. 
</p>

<h3><span id="How_to_wrap_up">How to wrap up</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Make sure to take a photo</b> and upload it to the event on events.indieweb.org!
<ul><li>There's a convenient "Add Photo" option in the drop-down menu next to "Edit" in the top right of the event page.</li></ul></li>
<li>Let folks know you have to wrap up, and either
<ul><li>If the venue is public like a cafe, encourage them to stay as long as they like</li>
<li>If you’re the venue host like in an office, provide suggestions of nearby eating and drinking places where folks can continue discussions and perhaps grab a snack</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Familiarize yourself with <a href="https://indieweb.org/Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts" title="Zoom">Zoom - Tips for Hosts</a>
<ul><li>Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Welcome
<ul><li>Direct attendees to <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">https://indieweb.org/discuss</a> for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat</li>
<li>Point out the <a href="https://indieweb.org/code_of_conduct" title="code of conduct">code of conduct</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Introductions
<ul><li>Introduce yourself and your site following <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast" title="Homebrew Website Club">HWC Broadcast</a>, then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: Explain you're taking a screenshot for the event page and the weekly newsletter, allowing people to turn their video on or off as they prefer.</li>
<li>Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
<ul><li>Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.</li>
<li>Looser, general discussion without timeboxes</li>
<li>A quiet writing period followed by discussion</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo</li></ul>

<p>This is an archive of the HWC 2016 planning, <a href="https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&amp;oldid=50980#HWC_2016">originally found here</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<p><span id="HWC">2016 <a>Homebrew Website Club</a></span> start date! Should we start the 2016 HWC meetups on:
</p>
<ul><li><s>2016-01-06 only one week after 2015-12-30, </s>
</li>
<li><b>2016-01-13 two weeks after 2015-12-30</b>,
<ul><li>but collides with Wednesday before US Thanksgiving thus unlikely to have much (any) participation at US venues.</li>
<li>0 <span><img src="https://tantek.com/logo.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek Çelik</a></span> ok with this.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Based on lack of strong input on this, we are going with the default continuing every two weeks from 2015-12-30 and <b>starting 2016 HWC with 2016-01-13.</b> - <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek</a> 14:56, 23 December 2015 (PST) (updated, no objections, going with this plan. <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek</a> 07:51, 31 December 2015 (PST))
</p><p>Getting some feedback that pages on organizing HWC hard to find, I think it maybe best to make a new page that is an HWC toolkit and port most of this content over. 
</p><p>At top of this page put two buttons one "Attend an HWC" and another "Organize an HWC"

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://vladar.bearblog.dev/latex-for-tabletop/">https://vladar.bearblog.dev/latex-for-tabletop/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37547099">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>LaTeX, which is pronounced "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech" (to rhyme with "blech" or "Bertolt Brecht"), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple RPG-oriented LaTeX templates: from old-school<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> to contemporary<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> ones. What are the Pros and Cons of using this academia-oriented tool for writing your tabletop rulebooks, adventures, or zines?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<h4 id="consistent-style">Consistent Style</h4>
<p>Just as I write this blog in Markdown, and the site's engine fashions it with consistent margins, fonts, and colors, LaTeX does the same (and much more) for the PDF it outputs. You specify the visual style once and forget about it (until you decide to shake things up a little), which allows you to concentrate on the writing.</p>
<h4 id="automation">Automation</h4>
<p>LaTeX does all the boring tasks for you. Table of contents? Index? List of tables? All will be accounted for and updated on its own.</p>
<h4 id="macros">Macros</h4>
<p>Not only LaTeX has a vast library of commands, but you could create your own, suited for your specific needs, including math operations and simple programming procedures.</p>
<h4 id="version-control-and-collaboration">Version Control and Collaboration</h4>
<p>Since the LaTeX source files are plain text, they are perfect for version control systems like Git.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> You'll have all the chronology of edits done you your documents, as well as benefits of working on a different branches and along with other people.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<h4 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h4>
<p>You <u>need</u> to know the syntax in depth to get the most of the LaTeX experience. You don't need to learn it all at once though — just extend your knowledge base when needed.</p>
<h4 id="installation-size">Installation Size</h4>
<p>TeX Live distribution with additional packages that I use to compile <a href="https://vladar4.github.io/itdr/" target="_blank">ItDR</a> takes almost 2 GB of space. Maybe not that much by modern standards, but you should keep that in mind.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2>
<p>It is not hard to find a LaTeX beginner-level tutorial. Here's <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/~physlab/Lab_Main/Latexguide.pdf" target="_blank">one from the NYU</a>. Also, some kind of <a href="https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> will be useful.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
<p>There are multiple editors available. My editor of choice is <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TeXstudio</a>, but you might find than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors">another one</a> will suit you better.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sty-files">STY files</h2>
<p>It is quite useful to keep all of your custom formatting parameters and macros in a separate file. Here is a quick reference on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Writing_your_own_package" target="_blank">how to write your own packages</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>So, with that information in mind, here's a minimal working example of a LaTeX document.</p>
<p><strong><code>example.tex</code></strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\documentclass</span><span>[10pt,twoside,twocolumn,openany]</span><span>{</span>book<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>example<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>[utf8]</span><span>{</span>inputenc<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>lipsum<span>}</span>

<span>\title</span><span>{</span><span>\scshape\LaTeX</span>~Example<span>}</span>
<span>\author</span><span>{</span>Vladar<span>}</span>

<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>

<span>\maketitle</span>

<span>\chapter</span><span>{</span>Example<span>}</span>

Here's an example of a custom command defined in <span>\verb</span>|example.sty| that formats a monster stat block:

<span>\statblock</span><span>[d6]</span><span>{</span>Orcs<span>}{</span>MV 40'; AC 6; HD 1; AB +1; <span>\#</span>AT 1 scimitar (1d8); SV F1; AL C; Int 7; ML 8; XP 10.<span>}{}</span>

<span>\vspace</span><span>{</span><span>\baselineskip</span><span>}</span>

What follows is a dummy ``Lorem ipsum'' text.

<span>\lipsum</span><span>[1-4]</span>

<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong><code>example.sty</code></strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\ProvidesPackage</span><span>{</span>example<span>}</span>

<span>\RequirePackage</span><span>{</span>xcolor<span>}</span>

<span>% \statblock[number]{Name}{stats}</span>
<span>% Outputs a monster statblock.</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\statblock</span><span>}</span>[3][1]<span>{</span><span>%</span>
    <span>\noindent</span>
    <span>\colorbox</span><span>{</span>black!20<span>}{</span><span>%</span>
    	<span>\parbox</span><span>{</span>0.98<span>\linewidth</span><span>}{</span><span>%</span>
    		<span>\textbf</span><span>{</span>#2 (#1)<span>}</span> #3
    	<span>}</span><span>% parbox</span>
    <span>}</span><span>% colorbox</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now try to compile it and see what you'll get!</p>
<hr>
<p>With this information, you can start tinkering with LaTeX and adapt it for your specific purposes. In the future I will highlight specific use-cases and some useful packages.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Concepts</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is a programming language adapted for socio-fiscal legislative literate
programming. By annotating each line of the legislative text with its meaning
in terms of code, one can derive an implementation of complex socio-fiscal
mechanisms that enjoys a high level of assurance regarding the code-law
faithfulness.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concretely, you have to first gather all the laws, executive orders, previous
cases, etc. that contain information about the socio-fiscal mechanism that
you want to implement. Then, you can proceed to annotate the text article by
article, in your favorite text editor :</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Once your code is complete and tested, you can use the Catala
compiler to produce a lawyer-readable PDF version of your
implementation. The Catala language has been specially designed
in collaboration with law professionals to ensure that the code
can be reviewed and certified correct by the domain experts, which
are in this case lawyers and not programmers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The Catala language is special because its logical structure mimics
the logical structure of the law. Indeed, the core concept of
"definition-under-conditions" that builds on default logic has been formalized
by Professor Sarah Lawsky in her article
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206" rel="nofollow">A Logic for Statutes</a>.
The Catala language is the only programming language to our knowledge that
embeds default logic as a first-class feature, which is why it is the only
language perfectly adapted to literate legislative programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting started</h2>
<p dir="auto">To get started, the best place is the <a href="https://catala-lang.org/en/examples/tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>
of the language. A <a href="https://catala-lang.org/fr/examples/tutoriel" rel="nofollow">French version</a>
is also available but might be out of sync with the latest language features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> bleeding-edge version</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are interested in the latest development version, pre-built artifacts
including binaries and API documentation can be found at
<a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala" rel="nofollow">https://catalalang.github.io/catala</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is available as an <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/catala/" rel="nofollow">opam package</a>!
If opam is installed on your machine, simply execute:</p>

<p dir="auto">To get the cutting-edge, latest version of Catala, you
can also do</p>

<p dir="auto">The top-level <code>Makefile</code> contains a lot of useful targets to run. To display
them, use</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugin backends</h3>
<p dir="auto">While the compiler has some builtin backends for Catala (Python, Ocaml, etc.),
it is also possible to add a custom backend to the Catala compiler without
having to modify its source code. This plugin solution relies on dynamic
linking: see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/compiler/plugins/README.md">the dedicated README</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Clerk</h3>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>clerk --help</code> if you have installed it to get more information about the
command line options available. To get the development version of the help, run
<code>make help_clerk</code> after <code>make build</code>. The <code>clerk</code> binary corresponds to the
Catala build system, responsible for testing among other things.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pierre Catala</h2>
<p dir="auto">The language is named after Pierre Catala, a professor of law who
pionneered the French legaltech by creating a computer database of law cases,
Juris-Data. The research group that he led in the late 1960s, the
Centre d’études et de traitement de l’information juridique (CETIJ),
has also influenced the creation by state conselor Lucien Mehl of the
Centre de recherches et développement en informatique juridique (CENIJ),
which eventually transformed into the entity managing the LegiFrance website,
acting as the public service of legislative documentation.</p>

        Run large language models at&nbsp;home, BitTorrent‑style
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Generate text with <b>Llama&nbsp;2</b> (70B), <b>Falcon</b> (180B), <b>BLOOM</b> (176B) (or their derivatives),
          and fine‑tune them for your tasks — using a consumer-grade GPU or Google Colab.
        </li>
        <li>
          You load a small part of the model, then join a
          <a target="_blank" href="https://health.petals.dev/">network</a>
          of people serving the other parts.
          Single‑batch inference runs at up to <b>6&nbsp;tokens/sec</b> for <b>Llama&nbsp;2</b> (70B) and
          up to <b>4&nbsp;tokens/sec</b> for <b>Falcon</b> (180B) — enough for

        <li>
          Beyond classic LLM APIs —
          you can employ any fine-tuning and sampling methods, execute custom paths through the model, or see its hidden states.
          You get the comforts of an API with the flexibility of <b>PyTorch</b> and 🤗 <b>Transformers</b> interfaces.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Like a lot of troubled young men, I used to pay close attention to Apple’s developer conferences and special announcements, eagerly anticipating each new generation of iPhone and operating system. In the 2000s and 2010s these regular public demonstrations were filled with suspense and anticipation What would the phones look like this year? Which executive would Steve Jobs personally execute in a windowless room immediately following the presentation? Would the new iPhone finally solve my problems and make me happy?</p><p>Here in 2023, that air of mystery and expectation is gone. Every phone looks the same; every announcement has been widely leaked. But there is still a good reason to attend to Apple’s marketing extravaganzas: The fake texts.</p><p>I’m talking about the mocked-up texts and emails Apple puts together to demonstrate new messaging features in its operating-system updates, presumably written by some well-paid professionals in Apple’s marketing department. These eerily cheery, aggressively punctuated messages suggest a alternate dimension in which polite, good-natured, rigorously diverse groups of friends and coworkers use Apple products exactly how they are designed to be used, without complaint or error. Here are some of the more recent examples of what I am talking about, used to tout this year’s updates, iOS 17 and MacOS Sonoma: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png" width="1454" height="1064" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1064,&quot;width&quot;:1454,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:534353,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Every new update to Apple software brings along with it marketing materials populated by new casts of characters engaged in a new set of projects, but storylines are never elaborated, let alone resolved, and campaigns pass without any questions being answered.

(As my friend Emma put it to our group chat “if any of you texted me like this I would immediately call your significant others to make sure you hadn’t been kidnapped.”) But in the last year or so I have realized that Dimension Apple does exist--or at least overlaps with our own--in one very specific place: The WhatsApp groups that the parents at my son’s daycare/school create to share information or set up play dates. In these groups, and only in these groups, do I encounter the same kind of earnest helpfulness and baffling ebullience that exists in the Dimension Apple. Naturally, I find them totally alienating.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" width="1456" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/baaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>To aid future study of the Dimension Apple, I’m publishing all the screenshots and images of fake Apple texts I was able to pull from the Wayback Machine below.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I’ve been getting a little obsessed with chili oil. A little…lost in
the sauce so to speak. Here’s some notes and general thoughts on chili oil.</p>

<p>There are two main ways of extracting flavor from chilies with oil:
hot flash or slow infusion. A hot flash basically means you heat up
the oil until it’s really hot, almost smoking , i.e. 375F. You pour it
over the chilies in one dramatic swoop. A slow infusion is less
dramatic. You heat the oil and infuse the chilies at a lower
temperature, say 200-250F.</p>
<p>In my experiments, the hot flash produces a noticably more intense
flavor with some roasted notes. However, with that flavor, there is
some bitterness. The slow infusion comes out milder, but no
bitterness. That said I’ve only tried at the above
temperatures. Perhaps a slow infusion at 250-300F or a hot flash at
325F could be better?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the hot flash creates an oil with the chili
pieces noticably suspended in the oil, while the slow infusion results
in an oil with the pieces all at the bottom. I suspect this is because
the chili pieces are more intensely fried in the hot flash one, which
either dissolves more soluble materials into the oil, making them
lighter, or causes the pieces to unfurl and be more buoyant.</p>
<p>In some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0aGgCuvH4">Chinese
videos</a> that I’ve
watched, people do a sort of hybrid style where you add hot oil
multiple times, with the idea to almost “temper” the oil, i.e. not put
such a large quantity of hot oil into the chilies all at once. I could
see that working too. They also temper with baijiu, i.e. strong
Chinese liquor. That could also potentially be another avenue for
extraction since alcohol is known to extract more flavor compounds
than water? Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, so maybe this could boost
spiciness?</p>
<p>This does put into question whether the ratio of oil to solid material
matters. I usually make the Serious Eats <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp">chili
crisp</a> recipe
by Sohla El-Waylly. It uses the hot flash method, but it also includes
a lot of other ingredients like ginger, cardamom, cumin, sugar,
mushroom powder, etc. Perhaps the sheer quantity of solids means more
thermal mass and therefore less overcooking?</p>
<p>I’ve also thought about doing a really low and slow extraction, say by
using a sous vide machine. You do run into food safety issues, since
the chilies can contain botulism.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could try doing multiple extractions at different
temperatures or even blending different styles.</p>
<h2 id="oil-type">Oil Type</h2>
<p>The easiest oil to use is a neutral oil of your choosing. It won’t add
any flavor, which will let the chilies shine through. This is fairly
important for experiments since you don’t want the taste of the oil to
obscure results (I learned this the hard way).</p>
<p>But there are some other options. Classic Sichuan oil is caiziyou, or
roasted rapeseed oil. It’s hard to find in the US, but you can get it
at more and more Chinese supermarkets or <a href="https://themalamarket.com/collections/regional-chinese-sauces-pickles/products/caizi-you-sichuan-roasted-rapeseed-oil">online at Mala
Market</a>. At
a Chinese supermarket, you’ll probably have to read some Chinese to
make sure you’re buying the right stuff. Caiziyou is nutty, roasted,
almost like a milder sesame oil. It’s great stuff to cook with and it
does make a nice chili oil. Budget-wise it is more expensive,
especially if you’re buying from Mala Market.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen people use clarified butter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJtOATAZl4">like
here</a>, or beef fat like
in hot pot bases. I imagine an olive oil could be good if you stick to
slow infusion.</p>
<p>Of course there are also combinations that could be made. Maybe a
chili oil with a little spike of beef fat just for flavor.</p>
<h2 id="chili-type">Chili Type</h2>
<p>I usually keep quite a few different kinds of dried chilies
around. Right now I have Thai birds-eyes, er ting jiao, xiao mi la,
kashmiri, Japones. Of course it’s hard to determine what exactly a lot
of chilies are, since there could be multiple names depending on the
country. Perhaps Japones are really Heaven-Facing chilies. Or xiao mi
la is birds-eye.</p>
<p>I used to spike the oil with some extra spicy chilies like ghost
peppers or Carolina reapers. I stopped doing that because they were
way more expensive than other chilies, it was extremely painful to
seed them and grind, and I wasn’t convinced they actually added that
much heat. One or two ghost peppers could easily be matched by a
couple handfuls of birds-eye or xiao mi la. Especially since these
super hot peppers are not always consistent in spice level. I did once
make a chili oil with chocolate bhutlah that was delightfully spicy.</p>
<p>I also used to spike the oil with some chipotle peppers to add some
smokiness. I might do an experiment to see how much of a difference
that actually made.</p>
<h2 id="spices--aromatics">Spices &amp; Aromatics</h2>
<p>Recipes run the gamut of no spices at all to lots and lots of
spices. Generally I’m of the view that more spices are better. But
this might be worth testing. I usually add star anise, black pepper
(often omitted, idk why), cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, black
cardamom. Potentially also cinnamon, and sand ginger.</p>
<p>There’s also aromatics like garlic, ginger, scallions, orange peel,
etc. In Sohla’s crisp recipe, you fry a bunch of crispy shallots and
garlic chips before making the oil. That way the oil gets infused with
lots of shallot and garlic flavor. I do love that, but it is a <em>lot</em>
of work.</p>
<h2 id="seasoning">Seasoning</h2>
<p>Should you season the chili oil? Most recipes do call for some salt,
which interestingly is not soluble in oil. I guess the salt ends up
sticking to the chilies and therefore seasoning that aspect. Some
recipes go as far as adding sugar, MSG, and other
MSG-alternatives. This is where the ontology of the chili oil
matters<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: Are you making a condiment or an ingredient? In my view,
a condiment should be seasoned sufficiently that it has some sort of
inherent tastiness. You’d be willing to eat a spoonful of ketchup or a
spoonful of mayo, even if it’d be a little intense. An ingredient does
not have to fulfill that requirement. Nobody’s just eating a spoonful
of flour. So a chili oil that’s an ingredient will omit sugar and MSG
and taste a little bland. That’s fine if you’re adding it to a dish
like a cold poached chicken, where there will be other seasoning. A
chili oil that’s a condiment will taste balanced on its own.</p>
<p>I do think if you add seasoning, you should go all the way and add
sugar, salt and MSG. They balance each other out really nicely.</p>
<p>If you add seasoning, you could be veering into a chili sauce or a
chili crisp. <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-chiu-chow-sauce/">Chiu chow chili
sauce</a> is a great
example. For a lot of people, especially in the US, what they consider
chili oil is actually chili crisp, specifically Lao Gan Ma, the most
popular brand by far. Lao Gan Ma actually has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douchi">douchi</a> or
fermented black beans. Note that these are fermented black <strong>soy</strong>
beans, not the black beans that we eat in the West. Personally I find
douchi a little too strong of a flavor. They’re intensely salty and
can overpower the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the oil will stay a little bland
regardless because salt does not dissolve into oil. Interestingly
enough it appears that sugar does dissolve.</p>
<h2 id="chili-grinding">Chili Grinding</h2>
<p>For the longest time I used a spice grinder to blitz up the
chilies. It was fast and simple. I never loved the texture I got
though. You’d end up going too fine too quickly. Plus it tended to
create a lot of inhalable dust which made the process pretty painful.</p>
<p>I’ve recently switched over to toasting the chilies in a tiny bit of
oil, then pounding them in a mortar and pestle. It’s definitely more
manual labor, but you end up with these beautiful large flakes that
have great texture. It’s also releases less dust into the air. You do
have to make sure all of the chilies are properly toasted. They should
be shiny, lightly puffed up, and brittle. Otherwise you end up with
these large chunks that are too flexible to be ground down and end up
mixed into the flakes.</p>
<p>If we’re getting really nerdy here (and hey, this is already pretty
nerdy), I’d wonder about the particle distribution of grinding chilies
and how that affects flavor extraction. As any coffee nerd can tell
you, a spice grinder is pretty awful for grinding coffee because it
produces a very uneven particle distribution. You can end up with what
are called fines and boulders, fines being tiny, dust-like pieces of
coffee that create bitterness in the cup, and boulders being large
chunks that create sourness or emptiness in the cup. A mortar and
pestle isn’t that much better. If anything you end up more
bimodal. The end result is a bunch of large flakes covered with very
fine chili dust. Likely due to the combination of pounding and
grinding motions in the mortar and pestle. The pounding breaks the
chilies into big chunks, and the grinding produces the fine powder.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get better particle distribution? You could in
theory sift the chilies. But often times the powder appears stuck to
the flakes a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="styles">Styles</h2>
<p>So far we’ve mostly been talking about Chinese style chili oil,
specifically Sichuan style. But what about other chili oils? Salsa
macha is a very popular Mexican style. And you could argue that a
<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-tadka-tarka-chaunk-chhonk-baghaar">tadka</a>
is essentially an ad-hoc chili oil made at the last second. Could you
make a batch of Indian chili oil in advance, say by infusing mustard
seeds, curry leaves, cumin and coriander in some ghee and substitute
it for a tadka? I bet you could.</p>
<p>As for more European flavors, ChefSteps does an interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkeZb6tN-c">Thanksgiving flavored
oil</a>. I bet a Calabrian
chili oil would be incredible.</p>
<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>As you can see, there’s a lot of questions and ideas here. Therefore,
I’m gonna need to do some experiments! But first, we should think
about methodology and potential issues with the experiments. The most
important criterion for an experiment is
reproducibility. Unfortunately, that is rather hard with chili oil,
because the chilies are organic compounds with variable
spiciness. We’re also using manual grinding so grind size is not
easily controllable either. This means that while we can grind up a
batch of chilies, use them in two different oils, and compare, we
can’t necessarily compare these oils to oils from a separate
experiment. Of course we should still try to make the experiments as
reproducible as possible, so we should standardize the chili blend,
ratio, and so on.</p>
<p>It’s also important to make the base oil as neutral as possible. I
tried doing an experiment with caiziyou as the base oil, and its
nuttiness occluded any differences between the two chili oils.</p>
<p>Of course, like coffee, you can never get a fully reproducible
setup. Instead it’s probably best to make a bunch of oils, do some
experiments, then learn about the general variables and how they
affect the flavor. In coffee that’s grind size, temperature, time,
ratio, dose, brew style. Chili oil has likely similar variables.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to the potential experiments. Here are a few that I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infuse chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Hot flash chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Adjust the ratio of chilies to oil</li>
<li>Add alcohol to extract more flavor</li>
<li>How much do the spices actually affect the flavor?</li>
<li>Sous vide chili oil</li>
<li>Mortar and pestle vs spice grinder</li>
<li>Add oil for a hot flash multiple times.</li>
<li>Does stirring matter?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to hear if someone has other experiment ideas or other
thoughts about chili oil. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:nick@nicholasyang.com">nick@nicholasyang.com</a>!</p>

<section id="why">
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
Tech independence is <strong>not depending on any particular company or software</strong>.
</p><p>
The only tools you need are the common open source basics built into any Linux or BSD operating system — <strong>free public-domain tools that are not owned by anyone</strong>, and can run on any computer.
</p><p>
<strong>Learn a few of these basic tools</strong>, and you can run your own private server on any computer forever, for the rest of your life.
Host your own website and email.
Keep your own contacts and calendars synced with your phone.
Back up and sync your photos, movies, and music to your own private storage.
No more subscriptions needed.
</p><p>
You can <strong>ignore</strong> all the companies offering “<strong>solutions</strong>”, even if they are free, because they take away <strong>self-reliance</strong>.
The point is to <strong>know how to do it yourself</strong>, not to have somebody do it for you.
It’s worth a little up-front work, like learning how to drive.
</p><p>
Below are <strong>simple step-by-step instructions</strong> that work.
Instead of drowning you in options, it uses an operating system called <a href="https://sive.rs/openbsd">OpenBSD</a> and a hosting company called <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9541378-8H">Vultr</a> because I’ve used them for years and I know they are good and trustworthy.
But you could do this same setup with <strong>any free Linux or BSD operating system</strong>, with <strong>any hosting company</strong> that gives you “root” access to your own private server.
You could even do it on <strong>an old laptop in your closet</strong>.
</p><p>
So if a company turns evil or goes out of business, no problem!
You can set up a new server anywhere else in an hour, point your domain name to the new IP address, and it’s done.
<strong>That’s tech independence</strong> — never dependent on any particular provider or software.
It’s very empowering.
The instructions below will show you how.

<h2>Use your encypted storage</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> script will eventually prompt you, “Now upload anything while I wait...”.  Here’s how.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Type <code><strong>rsync -avz Documents <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span>:/mnt/</strong></code> and you will see it uploading your Documents folder to your private encrypted storage. Use this same format to upload any other folders, replacing “Documents” in the command. If you are happy synchonizing on the command line like this, you can skip over the next FreeFileSync section.</p>
<h3><a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></h3>
<p>Everyone using <strong>Windows</strong> should <strong>use <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></strong>. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://freefilesync.org/download.php">Download FreeFileSync</a> and please give an optional donation there if you can afford to. Donating also unlocks more features. Thanks to Jon Lis for the recommendation.</li>
<li>Install and open FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Top-center: click the grey <strong>[Browse]</strong> button and find the folder with the stuff you want to upload.</li>
<li>Top-far-right: click the white <strong>cloud icon</strong> then <strong>SFTP</strong> at the top.</li>
<li>Server name or IP address: <span>yourdomain.name</span></li>
<li>Left side: click <strong>(*) Key File</strong></li>
<li>Username: <span>yourusername</span></li>
<li>Browse to find your <strong>private</strong> key, called <strong>id_ed25519</strong> from the “<a href="#ssh">Create an SSH key</a>” section. (Not the file that ends in “.pub”, but the one next to it.) NOTE: Because the /Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh directory is “hidden” by Windows and Mac by default, I find it easier to just type the path directly, like this:<ul>
	<li><em>The username, for this next line, should be your username on your home computer, not your remote server.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Windows?</strong> Type <code><strong>C:\Users\<span>yourusername</span>\.ssh\id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	<li><strong>Mac?</strong> Type <code><strong>/Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh/id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Directory on server</strong>: <strong>/mnt</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-right: click the <strong>green gear wheel</strong>.</li>
<li>Left button: click “<strong>MIRROR →</strong>”</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-center: click “<strong>COMPARE</strong>”, and make sure your files are there.</li>
<li>Top-right: click “<strong>SYNCHRONIZE Mirror →</strong>” then <strong>[Start]</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Verify and unmount</h3>
<ol>
<li>When it’s done uploading, <strong>log in to your server</strong> again, from your terminal.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code></li>
<li>You should see a long list of the files you uploaded.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>m-x</strong></code> to detach your encrypted storage.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code> again, and now you should see nothing there! Congratulations! You now see <strong>how this will work in the future</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m</strong></code>” to <strong>attach</strong> your encrypted storage.</li>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> your files with rsync or FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m-x</strong></code>” to <strong>detach</strong> the storage, for security.</li>

<h2>Contacts and Calendar</h2>
<p>
Your phone currently keeps its contacts and calendars with Google or Apple.
Now you can get them off the cloud and keep them privately on your own server.
</p><p>
My <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> setup script installs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> server for contacts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> server for calendars.
</p><p>
Here’s how to connect your phone.
</p>
<h3>Android phone</h3>
<p>You need an app called “<a href="https://www.davx5.com/"><strong>DAVx⁵</strong></a>”, so <a href="https://www.davx5.com/download">install it first</a>. Then…</p>

<h2>Email settings</h2>
<p>To do email from your phone, computer, or anywhere else, you now have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a> server, called <a href="https://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a>.
So on any device, you can <strong>add a new IMAP Mail account</strong>, with these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account type: IMAP</li>
<li>Email address: <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span></li>

<section id="web1">
<h2>Simple website</h2>
<ol>
<li>On your home computer, in your main home directory, <strong>make a directory/folder called “htdocs”</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/template.html">Download this file called “template.html”</a> and save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/style.css">Download this file called “style.css”</a> and also save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><strong>Make a copy</strong> of the “template.html” file, and <strong>name the copy “index.html”</strong>. This will be your home page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit the index.html file</strong> in a text editor (NotePad or TextEdit) and change my default text to whatever you want.</li>
<li>When you need to add a new page, just <strong>copy the template again</strong>, call it “about.html” or whatever, and make a link to it from the home page.  The header of each page will link back to index.html : your home page.</li>
<li>If you want to <strong>change the look</strong> of your site, just edit the style.css file.  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+tutorial">Search the web for “CSS tutorial”</a> if needed.</li>
<li><strong>To upload it</strong> to your public server, do one of the next two steps:</li>
<li>Apple Mac? <strong>Open a new terminal window</strong> on your computer, type <br><code><strong>rsync -avz htdocs <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span>:/var/www/</strong></code></li>
<li>Windows? <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a> again, but now change the “<strong>Directory on server</strong>” to <strong>/var/www/</strong> (you can find it by clicking [browse] or typing it directly) then upload this htdocs directory there.</li>
<li>Go to https://<span>yourdomain.name</span> in your web browser, <strong>refresh the page</strong>, and you should see your updated website.</li>
<li>Any trouble, just know that the goal is to get that index.html file into this location on your server: <code><strong>/var/www/htdocs/index.html</strong></code> because that’s where the web server is expecting it to be. That’s where we put the original test file, so your new <code>index.html</code> file should replace that one.</li>
<li>If you want <strong><a href="https://sive.rs/su">short URLs</a></strong>, without the .html, you can (for everything except index.html) because I set the default type to be HTML. Just remove the “.html” from your HTML filenames, update your links, and voilà!</li>
</ol>
It’s important to know how to make a simple website by hand, and not let people sell you on complex solutions that are the equivalent of saying you need a jumbo jet when you really need a bicycle.
For real tech independence, start by typing your HTML files yourself.
Only later, after you have many <em>many</em> pages, consider a more complicated solution.
</section>


<section id="web2">
<h2>File sharing in /pub/</h2>
<p>
Your website is configured to list all files in the /pub/ directory of your website.
So basically anything in /var/www/htdocs/pub/ is public.
Upload any files you want to share.
</p><p>
It replaces Dropbox and similar services for sending big files.
Just upload the file to /var/www/htdocs/pub/
then find it in your web browser, copy its URL, and send someone the URL.
</p>
<p>
If the files you want to share are already on your computer, then just <strong>make a pub/ directory inside htdocs/</strong> (so, <strong>htdocs/pub/</strong>), put your files in there, then use FreeFileSync or rsync to upload them as you did in the previous section called “<a href="#web1">Simple website</a>”.
Consider them part of your website.
</p><p>
Or if you have a URL from somewhere else online that you want to download to your server, just do it as we did in the numbered steps above.
Then use FreeFileSync or rsync to download from your server to your computer first, before your next upload sync.

<section id="indie">
<h2>More indie tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> in Firefox and Chrome.</li>
<li>In Firefox settings, under “Privacy and Security”, choose “[X] Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed”, then close Firefox often to erase all your cookies and logins. Browse the web anonymously, not logged-in.</li>
<li>Replace Google Authenticator with <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis on Android</a> or <a href="https://raivo-otp.com/">Raivo on iPhone</a>.</li>
<li>If you use Windows, replace it with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu Linux</a>. (Use both at first, then slowly transition.)</li>
<li>Keep your new email address as a <a href="https://sive.rs/pe">private email account</a> that you only give to those few people who you really want to hear from.  Then your old gmail/yahoo/outlook/etc address can be just low-priority junk, and your new private email account won’t need spam protection.</li>
<li>Or if you don’t want to run your own email server, use <a href="https://mailbox.org/">Mailbox.org</a> or <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> but <strong>only</strong> by using your own domain name. Be <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span> from now on. Don’t depend on anyone else’s domain for your email or you’ll be stuck with them.</li>
</ol>

<section id="storage5">
<h2>More storage?</h2>
<p>
If you need hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes of storage, I recommend Hetzner’s “<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Storage Box</a>”.
It’s the best storage value I’ve found.
Also consider <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal">Backblaze Personal Backup</a>.
</p><p>
I personally use Vultr’s storage (as described above) for sensitive information I definitely want completely encrypted.
Then I use Hetzner’s Storage Box for all my photos, videos, music, and other big files that don’t absolutely need to be encrypted.

<section id="mutt">
<h2>Mutt = email in the terminal</h2>
<p>Unless you want to read email directly on your server, skip this step.</p>
<ol>
<li>ssh in to your server, then <strong>type <code>mutt</code></strong></li>
<li>You should see the subject headers, with the first email highlighted. <strong>Type <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> a few times</strong> to go down and up the list of emails.</li>
<li>To <strong>read an email, hit [enter] or [return]</strong> when it is highlighted.</li>
<li>To go <strong>back to the list, type <code>i</code></strong> (for “index”)</li>
<li><strong>To reply, hit <code>r</code></strong> then:<ul>
	<li>It shows “<code>To:</code>” so you can edit or add recipients. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It shows “<code>Subject:</code>” so you can edit the subject. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It asks “<code>Include message in reply? ([yes]/no/?):</code>”. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> for the usual norm of echoing someone’s email back at them below your reply. Or <code>n</code> for not.</li>
	<li>Now you are inside the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor"><strong>vi</strong> text editor</a> which is not self-explanatory, so I’ll walk you through a simple reply:</li>
	<li>Hit <code><strong>i</strong></code> (no [return] or [enter]) to go into “insert mode” and <strong>type your message</strong>. You’ll notice it’s on the same line as some other text, so you might want to start by hitting [return] or [enter] a few times, then <strong>up-arrow</strong> to go back to the first line again.</li>
	<li>When done typing your message, <strong>hit your [esc] key</strong> in the very top-left corner of your keyboard. Nothing will change on the screen, yet.</li>
	<li>Type <code><strong>:wq</strong></code> (the “:” at the beginning is important) then [enter] or [return].</li>
	<li>Then you’ll see the “Compose Menu” which I think of as the “last chance before sending” screen. <strong>Hit <code>y</code> to send it</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To <strong>send a new email</strong>, hit <code><strong>m</strong></code> then repeat those steps like you did for a reply, except now the “<code>To:</code>” and “<code>Subject:</code>” are blank and waiting for you to create. (For “<code>To:</code>”, type the email address of the person you’re emailing.)</li>
<li>To <strong>quit</strong>, hit <code><strong>q</strong></code></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt</a> is a great program for reading and sending email on the command line. It’s been my email client for 20 years. <a href="http://mutt.org/doc/manual/">Read its manual here</a> if you want to go deeper. It does everything.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor">vi text editor</a> is a useful tool to edit text on a server. It takes a few minutes to learn, but it’s worth learning because it’s installed by default on every Linux/BSD server.</p>

<section id="upkeep">
<h2>Upkeep</h2>
<p>
You honestly don’t have to do anything to maintain your server.
It will just work as-is for decades!
But if you like to keep it up-to-date, it only takes a minute, so run these next steps any time.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>syspatch</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>fw_update</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>pkg_add -u</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysupgrade</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that last “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step did <strong>not</strong> give an “Error retrieving … 404 Not Found” error, that means your OpenBSD operating system is upgrading itself. They release an upgrade every 6 months. In that case, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/">go to this OpenBSD page</a> and follow the link at the top that says “<strong>Upgrading to</strong> (7.4, etc)” to see if there’s anything else you should know.
</p><p>
If the “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step updated your operating system and your server rebooted, then there is just one more step:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysmerge</strong></code></li>
<li>Follow any instructions. Don’t worry about messing up because you can always start over, as described below.</li>
<li>Re-do the <code>syspatch ; fw_update ; pkg_add -u</code> steps, above.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="redo">
<h2>Trouble? Start over</h2>
<p>I’ve tested the steps above very carefully and repeatedly. They work. So if you hit a major problem, something not happening like it says it should, please do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type “<code><strong>cd ; m-x ; exit</strong></code>” in any terminals you still have open, until they are all closed.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://my.vultr.com/">your Vultr account</a>.</li>
<li>See your server instance?  See to the far right, a subtle <strong>···</strong>?  Click that.</li>
<li>From its pop-up menu, click the last option: “<strong>Server Destroy</strong>”.</li>
<li><strong>Tick the box</strong> next to “[X] Yes, destroy this server.”</li>
<li>Click the big red <strong>[Destroy Server]</strong> button.</li>
<li>This will not destroy your encrypted storage. That’s another reason we kept it separate from the start. So <strong>if</strong> you already uploaded a bunch of your files and want to save them, they should still be there.</li>
<li>On your own computer, <strong>in the terminal, type: <code>rm .ssh/known_hosts</code></strong></li>
<li>Go back to the section called “<a href="#server1">Create your server</a>” and try again.</li>
</ol>

		<div data-first_letter="M">
		<p>Macs have brought a great deal to us over the years: desktop publishing, design, image editing and processing, multimedia, and more. One of the few fields where they have failed is programming, despite many attempts. Here I look back at some of those opportunities we missed.</p>
<h4>HyperTalk (1987)</h4>
<p>First released in 1987, Apple’s hypertext authoring environment HyperCard contained its own scripting language, HyperTalk. For many of those who built brilliant HyperCard stacks, this new scripting language was the first programming language they had used. Sadly, although seriously cool in its day, HyperTalk was both limited and limiting, as most came to discover. By 2000, HyperCard and HyperTalk were all but dead.</p>
<h4>AppleScript (1993)</h4>
<p>In some respects a successor to HyperTalk, AppleScript was released in October 1993, with System 7 Pro version 7.1.1, making it almost thirty years old. Despite all the odds, and several determined attempts to strangle it, it’s still supported in macOS Sonoma.</p>
<p>The concept behind AppleScript is simple: scripts that compile to a series of instructions for dispatch by macOS to their destination application, which in turn is controlled by those commands to perform a co-ordinated sequence of functions. At their simplest, these can open a document and print it, for instance. At their most complex, they can automate intricate and repetitive tasks that are messy in a GUI.</p>
<p>As a minimum, every application supports a small core of commands to play clean with the Finder and macOS. Those, and the suites of additional commands that bring joy to the scripter, are documented in standard formats within each application’s <em>dictionary,</em> which can be browsed by Script Editor and other tools. Rather than having to locate additional documentation sets specific to each application, all a scripter should need to do is open the dictionary.</p>
<p>Complexity comes because AppleScript is in fact an object-oriented language as sophisticated as Objective-C, as used by pro Mac developers; don’t be deceived by its apparently relaxed and informal style, with examples such as<br>
<code>tell application "System Events"<br>
set mailIsRunning to application process "Mail" exists<br>
end tell<br>
if mailIsRunning then<br>
-- do one thing<br>
else<br>
-- do another thing<br>
end if</code></p>
<p>You might use that code to set up a script that interacts with the Mail app. It first asks macOS whether it knows that Mail is running, and depending on the answer it executes the code that you insert where the comments (prefaced by <code>‘--‘</code> characters) are placed. Unlike the majority of programming languages, punctuation marks are used sparsely in AppleScript, making it considerably easier to write code that works, rather than tripping over a missing semicolon.</p>
<p>When ready to test your script, it compiles into intermediate code, and the editor automatically checks, formats and colours your source code, reporting any errors that it finds. When run, the intermediate code works through macOS to fire off AppleEvents (AEvents) to trigger the target applications to perform the actions.</p>
<p>Although it was integrated into Apple’s Xcode as AppleScript Studio, in recent years it has been left to languish, with occasional rumours of its demise.</p>
<h4>Prograph (1989)</h4>
<p>Innovative languages for Macs haven’t been Apple’s preserve. In 1989, the visual programming language Prograph was launched on the Mac. Sometimes described as a dataflow language, and thoroughly object-oriented, it won awards, was ported to Windows in the late 1990s, but was last seen running as Marten in Yosemite.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png"><img data-attachment-id="5471" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/2015/11/16/polyglot-programmer-visual-programming-with-marten-prograph/marten1/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png" data-orig-size="606,610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="marten1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=298" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=606" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=940" alt="marten1" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png 606w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=298&amp;h=300 298w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"></a></span></p>
<p>In this example method, data flows from the top to the bottom. Normally terminals on the top ‘shelf’ of the method diagram represent the inputs to that method. Data then flows from the top shelf through the intermediate processes, until it reaches the bottom. If there are outputs from the method, they are gathered by connections made to terminals on the bottom ‘shelf’ in the method. Order of execution is not prescribed, and can take place whenever data is available; this allows for inherent concurrency, and the potential to exploit multiprocessor systems without the need for language primitives.</p>
<h4>Automator (2005)</h4>
<p>Even ‘natural’ programming languages like AppleScript have to be learned, a task that many find too verbal and mechanical. Recognising this, Apple introduced <em>Automator</em> in OS X 10.4 in 2005 to help produce custom workflows and apps using more intuitive visual tools.</p>
<p>Although often assumed to be a development of AppleScript, apart from its ability to run AppleScript objects, Automator is actually very different. Instead of relying on AppleEvents and dictionaries, Automator’s modular actions are separate code objects installed in the Automator folder in a Library folder. macOS comes with a huge free library of actions that can accomplish tasks you might pay good money for, so familiarity can save you cost.</p>

<p>Automator is highly extensible, as its actions can include both AppleScript code and Terminal shell scripts. Thus if you cannot find a standard action to do what you want, if it can be expressed in a suitable script, you can build that into your workflow. Nevertheless, in 2021 Apple announced that Automator was to be succeeded by Shortcuts.</p>
<h4>Swift Playgrounds (2014-16)</h4>
<p>From the early days of the Mac, Apple has invested in programming languages designed to make best use of its APIs. In Classic times, that was Object Pascal, and its open-source class library MacApp. In 2014, Apple released a new language destined to be its preferred choice across all its platforms, Swift. From those early days, Swift has had an interactive mode, based on the ‘read-eval-print loop’ (REPL) popularised by Lisp. This versatility has been developed in Swift Playgrounds, both within Xcode and as a standalone app targeted at children (and adults) learning to code for the first time.</p>

<p>As an introduction to Swift in education, this has been impressive, but it hasn’t proved a gateway for those who didn’t really want to learn how to use Xcode in the first place.</p>
<h4>Shortcuts (2014-21)</h4>
<p>Shortcuts started out in the winter of 2014-15 as Workflow by DeskConnect. Apple bought it in 2017, and it became Shortcuts the following year, when it was integrated into Siri in iOS 12. Its arrival in macOS 12 was announced at WWDC in 2021, as Automator’s ultimate successor.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="61698" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/shortcuts1/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg" data-orig-size="1372,1029" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="shortcuts1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=940" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=940" alt="shortcuts1" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg 1372w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px"></span></p>
<p>While Shortcuts on macOS can run AppleScript and shell scripts, the mechanisms involved in Shortcuts’ actions are completely different from AppleScript and Automator. For an app to support all three well requires it to present four different interfaces: one for the user in the GUI, AppleEvents, Automator actions, and now Shortcuts actions.</p>

<p>While Shortcuts has attracted quite a following, its impact has so far been limited. Like all its predecessors, it hasn’t yet brought programming to the people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In Rust, there are certain API decisions about what is and isn’t sound that impact all Rust code.
That is, a decision was made to allow or not allow types which have certain safety requirements, and
now all users are committed to that decision. They can’t just use a different API with different
rules: <em>all</em> APIs must conform to these rules.</p><p>These rules are determined through certain “marker” traits. If a safe API could do something to a
value of a type which some types don’t support, the API must be bound by that marker trait, so that
users can not pass values of those types which don’t support that behavior to that API. In contrast,
if Rust allows APIs to perform that behavior on any type, without any sort of marker trait bound,
then types which don’t support that behavior cannot exist.</p><p>I’m going to give three examples to show what I mean, each of which Rust has considered at different
points, though only the first one actually exists in Rust.</p><h2 id="rules-of-rust">Rules of Rust</h2><h3 id="send"><code>Send</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t be sent across threads. There are a couple of
examples of <em>why</em> you would want this:</p><ul><li>The type provides shared ownership without synchronizing interior mutable writes to the reference
count (e.g. <code>Rc</code>)</li><li>The type may wrap an OS API that doesn’t guaranteee thread safety (e.g. <code>Args</code>, <code>MutexGuard</code>)</li></ul><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Send</code>, which is the set of types which
<em>can</em> be sent across threads. Any API which might send a value to another thread needs to include a
<code>Send</code> bound, such as:</p><ul><li><code>thread::spawn</code>, which spawns a thread</li><li><code>rayon::join</code>, which runs two tasks on a thread pool</li><li><code>tokio::spawn</code>, which may move this task to another thread of the executor</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust chose to support types which can’t be sent across threads, and so it has a <code>Send</code>
bound. But an alternative Rust could have just as easily chosen that <em>all</em> types in Rust must
support sending across threads, and effectively all interior mutability would need to be
synchronized. Indeed, the <code>Send</code> trait is actually a decision fully enforced by the standard
library: someone could release an “alternative libcore” which imposes this requirement with no
change to rustc, though it wouldn’t be compatible with any of the Rust code that exists in the
world.</p><h3 id="move"><code>Move</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t be invalidated without running their destructor
once their address has been witnessed. This is a sort of wonky and specific definition of
“immoveable type,” but it happens to fit perfectly for what stackless coroutines and intrusive
data structures require.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Move</code>, which is the set of types that can
be moved freely. Unlike <code>Send</code>, <code>Move</code> requires some language support: I think the simplest way to
implement it would be to say that operations that take the address of something take ownership of
types if they don’t implement <code>Move</code> (so <code>let x = &amp;mut y;</code> takes ownership of <code>y</code>, effectively
preventing you from ever moving it again.) And the magic behavior of <code>Box</code> which lets you move out
of it would need to be bound by <code>Move</code> as well.</p><p>Additionally, certain APIs would need to be bounded by <code>Move</code>, which let you move out of a
reference, such as:</p><ul><li><code>mem::swap</code> lets you swap values behind two mutable references</li><li><code>mem::replace</code> lets you replace the value behind a mutable reference with another</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that Rust doesn’t have a <code>Move</code> trait; instead, it provides the same guarantees using
the <code>Pin</code> wrapper around pointer types. Even though the <code>Move</code> trait would have probably been a
much easier to use API, it proved difficult to add in a backward compatible way (I’ll explain why in
a moment), so instead the <code>Pin</code> API was added and used only in the new interfaces that required
these semantics.</p><h3 id="leak"><code>Leak</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t go out of scope without running their
destructor. This is one of the two different definitions of “linear types,” it is less expressive
than the other (which would also prevent a destructor from running, requiring the type to be
destructured as its final end), but it is the easier of the two to add to the language (because it
works better with generics), and it supports all of the most compelling use cases for linear types.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Leak</code>, which is the set of types that can
go out of scope without running their destructors. Like <code>Send</code> and unlike <code>Move</code>, this would require
no language support at all: its not possible to “leak” a value in the core language of Rust, you
have to use standard library APIs to do it.</p><p>Certain APIs would have to be bound by <code>Leak</code>:</p><ul><li>APIs that always leak a value (<code>mem::forget</code>)</li><li>APIs that make it your responsibility to run the destructor (<code>ManuallyDrop::new</code>)</li><li>APIs that allow cyclic shared ownership and can accidentally leak values (<code>Rc::new</code>, <code>Arc::new</code>)</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust doesn’t have the <code>Leak</code> trait, but it almost did. This discussion came to a head in
early 2015, when the scoped thread API that Rust was using was found to be unsound, because its
safety depended on its guard type never leaking. It was decided (in some haste, because the 1.0
release was scheduled within a few months of the controversy) that Rust would not support types that
can’t be leaked, and so the <code>Leak</code> trait would not be added.</p><h2 id="changing-the-rules">Changing the rules</h2><p>There’s been a renewed interest in supporting linear types in Rust, especially because of what I
called the <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-scoped-task-trilemma">scoped task trilemma</a>, which is only true because of the fact that destructors
cannot be guaranteed to run. Unlike immoveable types, there is no isolated API addition that could
support guaranteeing that a destructor will run, the way there was with <code>Pin</code>. (You can guarantee a
destructor will run if you never give up ownership of the object and use a kind of closure passing
style, but this isn’t adequate for the “scoped task” use case). So some users would like to see Rust
add a <code>Leak</code> trait.</p><p>There are two possible ways a marker trait like <code>Leak</code> could be added to Rust:</p><ol><li><strong>Auto trait:</strong> you could add a new auto trait, like <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code></li><li><strong>?Trait:</strong> you could add a new “?Trait,” like <code>Sized</code></li></ol><p>Each of these presents certain challenges regarding backward compatibility.</p><h3 id="auto-traits">Auto traits</h3><p>At first glance, adding auto traits might seem like a backward compatible change. You add a new
trait, <code>Leak</code>, which says that a type can be leaked. Types that don’t implement this trait
cannot go out of scope without running their destructor. Because all types in Rust today necessarily
can be leaked (this is a consequence of the decision <em>not</em> to have a <code>Leak</code> trait), its perfectly
fine for all types to implement <code>Leak</code>. This is the semantics of an auto trait, so it sounds like it
should work great.</p><p>The problem comes when you go to add bounds to the APIs that can be used to leak values, like <code>mem::forget</code>. If you want to make it so that types that don’t implement <code>Leak</code>d
cannot be leaked, you need to add a bound to <code>mem::forget</code>. But there are two ways in which this
is not backward compatible.</p><p>First, it does not work with generics. This code is legal today, but would break if you add a
<code>Leak</code> bound to <code>mem::forget</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_generic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is because there is no <code>Leak</code> bound on the type parameter for this function. Adding such a
bound to the API of <code>mem::forget</code> (or any other API that can forget values) would be a breaking
change.</p><p>Another way in which it is not backward compatible is that trait object types will not implement
<code>Leak</code> unless they add <code>+ Leak</code>. Trait object types do not inherit impls by way of auto traits,
because you don’t actually know what type the trait object is. So a trait object like <code>dyn Future</code>
does not implement <code>Leak</code>. For example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_trait_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span>: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>Display</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="traits">?Traits</h3><p>So if adding an auto trait is not backward compatible, we are left turning to the <code>?Trait</code> solution.
But there are problems here as well.</p><p>in the strictest sense, adding a new trait like <code>?Leak</code> is backward compatible. Instead of adding
new bounds to APIs like <code>mem::forget</code>, you would be <em>relaxing</em> the bounds on other APIs. So all of
the code above would be fine, because to make a generic function that takes a linear type, you would
have to write a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The first problem with this for something like <code>Leak</code> is that the vast majority of generic APIs in
Rust cannot possibly forget their value; after all, even though memory leaks are not undefined
behavior, they are still undesirable and mostly avoided. This is quite different from <code>Sized</code>:
because passing something by value requires <code>Sized</code>, the large majority of generic APIs in Rust
require <code>Sized</code>, and so <code>?Sized</code> bounds are relatively rare. In contrast, adding <code>?Leak</code> would
create a permanent scar across the ecosystem, as the vast majority of generics would gain a <code>T: ?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The second problem is bigger, though: the interaction between <code>?Traits</code> and associated types means
that it is a breaking change to add a <code>?Trait</code> bound to an associated type. This means that any
stable associated type in the standard library cannot gain a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>Consider this example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_iterator</span><span>(</span><span>iter</span>: <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>iter</span><span>.</span><span>for_each</span><span>(</span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will forget every element of the iterator, even though the <code>Iterator::Item</code> associated type is
never mentioned. Therefore, <code>Iterator::Item</code> must implement <code>Leak</code>, always. The compiler is allowed
to assume that the item of every iterator implements <code>Leak</code>, and it would be a breaking change to
invalidate that assumption.</p><p>The implications of this are far reaching. If <code>Leak</code> were added as a <code>?Trait</code>, all of these things
would not be possible with linear types:</p><ul><li><strong>Iterator:</strong> You couldn’t construct an iterator of linear types.</li><li><strong>Future:</strong> You couldn’t construct a future that evaluates to a linear type (and so you couldn’t
return a linear type from an async function).</li><li><strong>Deref:</strong> You couldn’t dereference a Box containing a linear type, or dereference a vector of
linear types to a slice of linear types, or any other smart pointer type.</li><li><strong>Index:</strong> You couldn’t index a collection of a linear type, so you couldn’t index into a slice of
linear types or into a map with linear values.</li><li><strong>Add/Sub/Mul/Div:</strong> You couldn’t have a linear type as the output value of any overloaded
arithmetic operator.</li></ul><p>One special set of associated types is the return value of the <code>Fn</code> traits. The Rust project has
specifically made it difficult to refer to the <code>Output</code> associated type of these traits, so that it
would have flexibility to change this in the future. Still, certain issues were encountered in the
past when experimenting with a <code>Move</code> trait. It’s not clear to me if these issues would have been
encountered with other traits (like <code>Leak</code>) or if they were specific to the built-in semantics of
<code>Move</code>.</p><p>Basically, there is a very steep trade off in choosing to add a new <code>?Trait</code> - especially one that
wouldn’t be relevant to very many bounds, like <code>Leak</code> - because you will add confusing new syntax to
a huge variety of generic interfaces in exchange for getting a very limited new feature. I would
consider adopting something like <code>?Leak</code> a poor cost-benefit analysis, even if we do accept that the
current Rust rules are “wrong” and we wish Rust had linear types.</p><h3 id="editions">Editions</h3><p>The final thing that needs to be considered is the edition mechanism. Is it possible, using the
edition mechanism, to introduce one of these traits? Maybe.</p><p>Each edition in effect forms a “dialect” of Rust, all of which are supported by the same compiler.
So at first glance it sounds plausible that in one dialect of Rust, all types can be forgotten, and
in another dialect, the <code>Leak</code> trait exists. The problem is that a hard requirement on editions is
that crates from one edition can depend on crates from another edition, so that the upgrade from one
edition to the next is seamless and voluntary.</p><p>Consider that the Rust project decided to add the <code>Leak</code> trait in the 2024 edition. All of the
code in the 2021 edition needs to still work - including code like the examples I showed above.
Sure, you can use a tool like cargo fix to add <code>Leak</code> bounds everywhere and expect users to relax
them on their own as they move into the 2024 edition, but the code from the 2021 edition needs to
work without modification.</p><p>A way to possibly do this would be to make trait coherence depend on edition, so that in pre-2024
editions, every type meets the <code>Leak</code> bounds, even types that absolutely shouldn’t, like unbounded
generics, and trait object types that don’t mention <code>Leak</code>. If, in the pre-2024 editions, all
types implement <code>Leak</code>, then the added bounds will never fail.</p><p><em>However</em> - and this is the big, enormous caveat of this section - this would rely on the compiler
effectively implementing some kind of unbreakable firewall, to prevent a type that does not
implement <code>Leak</code> from ever getting used with pre-2024 code. This would mean:</p><ul><li>Any time post-2024 code instantiates a generic from pre-2024 code, it needes to check that the
type it instatiates it with implements <code>Leak</code>, even though the pre-2024 code doesn’t have such a
bound.</li><li>Any time pre-2024 code calls post-2024 code, it needs to check that the types it gets from that
API implement <code>Leak</code> (under the 2024 edition rules). Note that the standard library would be
considered post-2024 code, so every call to a std API would involve checking types for <code>Leak</code> in
the pre-2024 editions.</li></ul><p>I don’t know if this is even possible to implement, probably it would have pretty bad effect on
compile times at least on pre-2024 edition code, and it would likely create a very difficult
transition at first. But in the longer term at least it would leave <code>Leak</code> in the “right” state
(as an auto trait, which can be used with old associated types correctly, and not as a ?Trait).</p><h2 id="what-should-be-done">What should be done</h2><p>If I could go back in time to 2015, I think I would probably add both <code>Move</code> and <code>Leak</code> to Rust.
There are certain downsides, which were highlighted by the team at the time in their decision not to
add <code>Leak</code>: any trait object type which needs to meet these bounds needs to add <code>+ Move</code> or <code>+ Leak</code> to their definition. Having two auto traits of such global significance (<code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>)
was already considered enough of a burden.</p><p>But if I’m honest, I have the impression (I wasn’t there) that the decision to exclude <code>Leak</code> was at
least partly a matter of expediency: my understanding is that the Rust team at Mozilla was under
incredible pressure from their management to ship a 1.0 on the deadline they set, and this probably
influenced their decision not to make any last minute changes to the rules that could impact meeting
that deadline.</p><p>In a language with <code>Leak</code>, the scoped task trilemma wouldn’t exist, the simpler scoped thread API
would be safe, GC-integration would possibly be easier, and I’ve gotten the impression many systems
APIs would be easier to wrap safely (though I don’t know the details of this).</p><p>In a language with <code>Move</code>, the <code>Pin</code> type wouldn’t need to exist, users would therefore not have
such annoyance dealing with it, and so-called “pin projections” wouldn’t be an issue requiring
macros to solve, and making self-referential generators would present no complication for the
<code>Iterator</code> trait.</p><p>However, making these changes now is a much thornier problem. I think the edition-based technique is
the only viable solution for adding a new, globally relevant marker trait (except for certain unique
exceptions, like <code>DynSized</code>, not discussed here). And I think there are all kinds of reasons to
think that wouldn’t work - that it would be too difficult to implement, that the implementation
would have too many soundness holes, that the transition would be too disruptive, that it’s actually
totally impossible because I’ve missed something important.</p><p>This is why I’m very glad we found the <code>Pin</code> solution for immoveable types, and were able to ship
self-referential futures and async/await syntax on top of them, in a reasonable time frame without
major disruption to all existing users. When it comes to <code>Leak</code> and linear types, I just despair.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>A</span></span>s Vladimir Nabokov revised his autobiography,<em> </em><em>Speak, Memory</em>, he found himself in a strange psychological state. He had first written the book in English, published in 1951. A few years later, a New York publisher asked him to translate it back into Russian for the émigré community. The use of his mother tongue brought back a flood of new details from his childhood, which he converted into his adopted language for a final edition, published in 1966.</p><p>“This re-Englishing of a Russian re-version of what had been an English re-telling of Russian memories in the first place, proved to be a diabolical task,” he wrote. “But some consolation was given me by the thought that such multiple metamorphosis, familiar to butterflies, had not been tried by any human before.”</p><p>Over the past decade, psychologists have become increasingly interested in using such mental metamorphoses. Besides altering the quality of our memories, switching between languages can influence people’s financial decision-making and their appraisal of moral dilemmas. By speaking a second language, we can even become more rational, more open-minded and better equipped to deal with uncertainty. This phenomenon is known as the “foreign language effect” and the benefits may be an inspiration for anyone who would like to enrich their mind with the words of another tongue.</p><p>The foreign language effect should not be confused with the older concept of “linguistic determinism”, which proposes that the specific words and grammar of a language can change the way we perceive the world. In this view, people’s colour perception should change according to the terms that we use to divide the rainbow, while people’s perception of time may be influenced by the grammatical tenses they use.</p><p>You may be familiar with this idea from the film <em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-century-old-linguistic-hypothesis-center-film-arrival-have-any-merit-180961284/" data-link-name="in body link">Arrival</a></em>, in which the aliens’ language mysteriously shapes their experience of the world. Whether this happens in real life, however, is still a matter of considerable scientific debate. The foreign language effect does not depend on the particular features of the language that someone speaks; instead, it is concerned with the general experience of moving from a first to a second language. How will my thinking change, for example, when I move from English, which I absorbed in my cot, to Italian, which I have painstakingly studied as an adult?</p><h2 id="influencing-moral-reasoning-the-trolley-problem">Influencing moral reasoning: the ‘trolley problem’</h2><p>For Prof Boaz Keysar at the University of Chicago, who pioneered this research, the inspiration was personal. He grew up in Israel, and has now lived in the US for more than three decades, but still finds that Hebrew has more emotional resonance than English. Driving home from work one day, he started to wonder whether this might influence our moral reasoning, which is often driven by our gut feelings rather than logical reasoning.</p><p>Imagine, for instance, that you are standing on a footbridge when you see that an oncoming train is about to kill five people walking on the track. The only way to save these five people is to push a heavy man off the bridge in front of the train. He will die but the impact will prevent the train from hitting the other five people. This is considered the “utilitarian” choice in a version of the thought experiment known as the “trolley problem”. Many people feel such strong revulsion at the idea of pushing the man to his death that they would prefer to take no action at all, even though that means that many more lives will be lost.</p><p>In a preliminary experiment, Keysar’s team asked participants who had learned Spanish as a second language to consider this dilemma in either their native or adopted tongue. As he had hypothesised, they were far more likely to make the utilitarian choice when they used Spanish compared with English.

Previous experiments showed that people are unwilling to risk losing a small amount of money for the chance of winning a bigger sum, even if the odds are tipped in their favour. If you give people a 50% chance of winning £2.50, for example, or offer them the opportunity to take £1 for sure, most people go for the guaranteed money. This may pay off in the short term, but when you have made many such decisions, it severely limits your profits.</p><p>Myopic loss aversion is a serious problem for investors, but Keysar found that this tendency was much less pronounced when the bets were presented in a foreign language. “People just hate the prospect of losing,” says Keysar. “But they hate it less in a foreign language.” Further experiments have shown that speaking a foreign language can also reduce the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771300228X" data-link-name="in body link">framing effect</a>, which is our tendency to be swayed by the particular phrasing of information, and the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20445911.2023.2216918" data-link-name="in body link">sunk cost effect</a>, which is our reluctance to leave a failing endeavour.</p><p>One of the most intriguing recent studies tested the “bias blind spot” – the expectation that we are less susceptible to error than the average person. “We believe that other people are stupid, and we are not,” explains Michał Białek, an associate professor at the University of Wrocław, Poland. In line with Keysar’s findings, he found that speaking a foreign language <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13670069221110383" data-link-name="in body link">punctures this egotistical way of thinking</a>.</p><p>It is now 11 years since Keysar published his first paper on the foreign language effect. Over the same period, many psychological findings have crumbled under scrutiny – but not the foreign language effect. “It’s consistent and replicable,” says Simone Sulpizio, an associate professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, who conducted a recent <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/decisionmaking-depends-on-language-a-metaanalysis-of-the-foreign-language-effect/357CDDF948DB7FC3C101534F1EA3442A" data-link-name="in body link">meta-analysis</a> examining the evidence to date, though both he and Białek emphasise that we need more research into the mechanisms behind the effect.</p><h2 id="the-memory-game">The memory game</h2><p>Psychologists have also started to explore how the foreign language effect may touch many other areas of our psyche. Consider memory, the topic of Nabokov’s musings. We encode our recollections with verbal narratives, particular words triggering specific associations attached to an event. As a result, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11006905/" data-link-name="in body link">childhood memory</a> may seem less vivid when someone recalls it using a language that was acquired later in life. That may be a disadvantage for someone writing a memoir in a foreign tongue. On the plus side, it could help people to process painful events. People who recalled a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1133915/full" data-link-name="in body link">childhood trauma in a second language</a> showed less emotional distress than those recounting the event in their native tongue.</p><p>Keysar’s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001378" data-link-name="in body link">latest study</a>, led by his PhD student Leigh Grant, has shown that the foreign language effect can discourage the creation of false memories. In one experiment, the participants were first given a list of connected words, such as “dream”, “snooze”, “bed” and “rest”. When their recall was tested later, many people mistakenly remembered hearing the word sleep, which was not on the list. This is a standard technique to test people’s tendency to form false memories, and it was considerably less likely to happen if they performed the task in their foreign language.</p><p>In a follow-up experiment, the team showed participants two clips of robberies from the films <em>The Pink Panther</em> and <em>Rififi</em>, before playing them audio narratives of the same events that contained some false details. This can muddy people’s memories so that they begin to incorporate the misinformation into their own recollections. Once again, participants managed to avoid more of those errors when they heard the descriptions in their second language.</p><p>Keysar suggests that people employ more careful and deliberative thinking when using their foreign language: “You need to make sure that what you say, and how you understand things, is correct.” And they apply the same attention to the monitoring of their memories, leading them to question the accuracy of their recollections rather than simply recounting the first thing that comes into their heads.</p><p>The foreign language effect may even stretch to elements of our personality. Silvia Purpuri at the University of Trento, Italy has examined “tolerance of ambiguity”, which concerns people’s appreciation of uncertainty, and their willingness to enter unfamiliar situations. This can influence our behaviour in a changing workplace. “Those with high levels of tolerance of ambiguity display more flexibility and adaptability, leading to a more harmonious working environment and overall successful performance,” explains Purpuri. By allowing people to entertain new ideas, tolerance of ambiguity can improve people’s creative problem-solving. Recruiting Italian-English bilingual speakers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/foreign-language-effect-on-tolerance-of-ambiguity/54A1ABB8E1A2609F155512821A4CC41E" data-link-name="in body link">Purpuri and her colleagues found</a> that people naturally score more highly on this trait when primed to use their second language.</p><p>In today’s increasingly globalised world, many people regularly use two or more languages in their day-to-day lives, yet they may be completely unaware how that may influence their thinking. “People need to realise that if they choose to use one language over the other, that will have a systematic effect on the process and outcome of what they do,” says Keysar.</p><p>We still need much more research examining the limits of the foreign language effect and the cases where it may backfire. But in certain situations, it could be <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.549083/full" data-link-name="in body link">a useful tool</a> to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/11/6/103" data-link-name="in body link">switch mindsets</a>, allowing us to be a little more detached, objective and flexible in our thinking. You could deliberately swap to your second language when investigating important investments, for instance, so that you can more rationally appraise the risks. Or, when facing a personal upset, you may find that describing the situation in your second language helps to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.22283671v1" data-link-name="in body link">calm some of your fears or anxieties</a>. And if you are considering a controversial new environmental policy, you might try to read about it in a foreign newspaper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-017-0005-9" data-link-name="in body link">the research suggests</a> that this may render you more open-minded to the facts at hand and less easily swayed by your immediate gut reaction.</p><p>For those who already speak another language, this may be an unexpected payoff for all your studies. For those who do not, such benefits may offer an extra incentive to pick up your old French textbooks, sign up for a night class in Spanish, or download Duolingo. Nabokov’s experience may have been exceptional, but we may all undergo a mini-metamorphosis as we immerse our minds in the words and idioms of another culture.</p><ul>

							<!-- Title -->
							

							<!-- Content -->
							<p>Last week, Unity announced that they will soon start charging developers $0.20 each time their games are installed, past certain (high) thresholds. This came as a surprise to me and a few thousand other developers who chose Unity, invested in it, and paid for it in large part because they told us they wouldn’t take any of our revenue.</p>
<p>The reaction has been huge, but it’s not clear yet if Unity will make it right. The hasty, vague, conflicting clarifications they’ve offered all seemed aimed at reassuring people “No no, we’re not gonna steal much of <em>your</em> money, because you won’t be successful. Our plan is to steal <em>that</em> guy’s money.”</p>
<p>That’s not my issue, so I just wanna spell out exactly what my issue is.</p>
<h5>My issue</h5>
<p>We chose Unity for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> over 5 years ago. The deal was, it costs $125 per month per programmer, but that’s it – they take no share of your income when you release. Unreal, a rival engine, has no monthly fee but takes 5% of your revenue when you release. If Unity wanted any part of our revenue, whether percentage or per-install, we wouldn’t have used it – I had more experience in Game Maker, which takes no rev share and has a lower sub cost.</p>
<p>So now we’ve spent 5+ years investing in Unity on that understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our coding and implementation work (about 70% of my job, and all of my programmer’s job) is in Unity, and could not be pasted into some other engine – it would need to be redone.</li>
<li>To be able to even do that productive work, I spent a ton of this time learning Unity.</li>
<li>Relatedly, I took around 3,824 points of psychic damage during this time from Unity’s bizarre, maddening quirks.</li>
<li>I’ve also paid Unity over $10,000 in subscription fees so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>And not for a slew of useful new features – we use Unity 2019.3. In the last 4 years, the only additional value Unity have provided us is bug fixes to that version. But that’s OK! I’m happy to pay a large fee up front to avoid having our income skimmed forever.</p>
<p>In case we were worried about how much we were investing, in 2019 Unity went out of their way to say, and cement in their Terms of Service, that <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform">“When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.”</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png" alt="When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project." width="933" height="373" srcset="https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png 933w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-500x200.png 500w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-178x71.png 178w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<p>But, well, EULA’s say the darnedest things!</p>
<p>A year ago, they quietly removed that part of the TOS. I probably clicked agree on something since then. It wasn’t on my radar that the most reputable indie engine might be silently laying the groundwork for a moustache-twirling betrayal next year.</p>
<p>The new per-install fee is not in the current terms I’ve agreed to, so you might think I have an out – just don’t agree to the new ones! But Unity is a subscription, not a product I bought one time. I have to accept the new terms to continue paying for it, which we have to do to keep legally using Unity, which we have to do to finish our game – because by this point we’re trapped in their platform to the tune of 5 years’ work.</p>
<h5>The situation</h5>
<p>This is why I am not remotely mollified by reassurances that the&nbsp;<em>current</em> profit-skimming terms won’t sting&nbsp;<em>me in particular</em> too badly. That’s not the fuckin’ headline! The headline is that you (surprisingly) can and (staggeringly) will change how much of our revenue you wish to take at any time after we’ve already committed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not just the size of the monthly fee, but the very conceptual structure of what <em>kind of debt</em> we owe you.</li>
<li>Not just to use future versions of your engine, with whatever features you think justify this sharp hike, but even for past versions you previously promised would be usable under the old terms forever.</li>
<li>And not just for games that are starting development now, or mid development – even for games that are <em>already released</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re cool with punishing our trust and investment in your platform by using it as a trap to pressure us into terms we would never agree to if we had free choice.</p>
<p>So if I don’t seem impressed that the current terms won’t brutalise my expected revenue, it’s cos it doesn’t take a genius to flash forward to your next twist of the knife. Even after Breach Wizards is finished and released, apparently you’re able and willing to change the terms under which we used your engine, placing the fees and thresholds wherever you like to see what you can force out of us.</p>
<p>The only difference with a released game is our recourse: instead of having to abandon development of our game, we’d just have to abandon the game – never patch, never update. Which sucks for players almost as much as it sucks for devs.</p>
<h5>Maybe they won’t force worse terms on us later??</h5>
<p>Well, as far as trusting Unity not to do something scummy if they think they legally can: *waves vaguely at the whole situation*</p>
<p>But more specifically, forcing this new fee structure is a <em>desperate</em> move. They knew it would be roundly despised – their own staff told them so – and they did it anyway. The money was more important than their integrity or reputation. Under those terms, what wouldn’t a corporation do? If taking 100% of our revenue would make them more money than it loses, is anyone confident they wouldn’t do it? For some people, they already have: one dev calculated they’d owe Unity 108% of the year’s revenue under the current terms.</p>
<h5>But I heard it’s not retroactive?</h5>
<p>Unity are saying it’s ‘not retroactive’ in the sense that when they count how many installs you owe them money for, they won’t count installs that happened before Jan 2024.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;<em>is</em> retroactive in the sense that it doesn’t matter how long ago your game released, or what version of Unity it was made in, if you still need to use Unity at all, you agree to pay Unity for each install of any of your Unity games, over the thresholds.</p>
<p>Again, the thresholds are high, and again, the thresholds are not the point. If this change is allowed to be retroactive in that sense, there’s nothing to stop them making a “100% of your revenue” TOS retroactive in that sense.</p>
<h5>But they have to do this, their game engine business isn’t profitable!</h5>
<p>Ah, I didn’t know that, perhaps because I don’t give a fuck? It’s not the customer’s job to make your business plan pay off. I didn’t ask them to offer terms that don’t work for them, I didn’t ask them to hire 7,000 people, I never even made a feature request. They asked me to pay them $10,000 in sub fees on the promise that it meant no fee per-sale, then once I was in too deep to switch, they changed the deal.</p>
<h5>But game engines are hard to make and update, it’s not reasonable to expect them to be cheap</h5>
<p>I have no opinions about how much they should cost. My thing is, if you offer me Unity 2019 at $150 a month, it’s a scumbag move to wait til I’m too far invested to switch, then change it to a per-install deal <em>even if I keep using the old version.</em> You can change the price, and even the nature of the cost, for any and all future versions, no probs! I get to not buy those. I can’t not-buy Unity 2019 cos I already paid you $10k and spent over 5 years work on it, so you shouldn’t be able to layer on a new type of debt I owe you.</p>
<p>Especially, I feel, if you promised not to.</p>

<b> Explanation: </b> 

On September 12, from a location just south of the Arctic Circle,
stones of Iceland's
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230327.html">modern Arctic Henge</a>
point skyward in this startling scene.

Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a
<a href="https://spaceweather.com/">geomagnetic storm</a>,
alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky
when a stunning
<a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/">fireball meteor</a>
explodes.

Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHitRCagcE">captured video and still
images</a>
of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon.

Though quickly fading from view, the fireball left a lingering
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7281-1s_1024.jpg">visible trail</a>
or persistent train.

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180817.html">The wraith-like trail</a> was seen for
minutes wafting in the upper atmosphere at altitudes
of 60 to 90 kilometers along with the
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aurora">auroral glow</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main"><p>Authors: Andrew Kelley and Loris Cro</p><p>Please don’t use bounties to incentivize Zig development.</p><p>This blog post is inspired by this GitHub issue from three days ago: <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support WASIX</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/wasmerio/status/1701168305103331701?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see also</a>)</p><p>Here are some reasons why we believe bounties are a poor form of sponsorship when it comes to software development:</p><ul><li>Bounties foster competition at the expense of cooperation.</li><li>Bounties are an utterly simplistic way of dealing with the business management side of creating software:<ul><li>Instead of scouting for a suitable candidate, you’re letting battle royale dynamics pick a winner for you, at the expense of everybody who’s going to lose the competition.</li><li>Instead of creating a clear contract where you take on some of the risk, you implicitly put the entirety of the risk on the contestants (eg partial solutions don’t get any payout).</li><li>Instead of allocating time and resources to proper due diligence, you instead penalize any form of thoughtfulness in favor of reckless action (eg a solution just needs to pass a test suite).</li><li>Instead of planning for the full lifecycle of software, which also includes maintenance, you end up with a quickly bitrotting artifact that is of no practical use to anybody.</li><li>Instead of spreading unease to all the people involved, it would be preferable you instead learned how to do business properly.</li></ul></li><li>On projects less radical than Zig, you might also put pressure on the development team to accept the winning submission, which, given the above, will probably not be the most well-thought-out and maintainable solution.</li></ul><p>While we do understand that continued exposure to venture capital might have caused some to build an appreciation for endless rat racing, we <em>kindly</em> request that you keep unwarranted hustling away from the Zig community.</p><p>We’re not only building free and open source software but, most importantly, we’re building <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software you can love</a> and this can only be done by employing well-designed business management processes.</p><h2 id="a-word-about-bug-bounties">A Word About Bug Bounties</h2><p>We do believe that bug bounties, like the one
<a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/viewstamped-replication-made-famous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered by TigerBeetle</a>,
can be a virtuous way of sponsoring development since they focus on the
<em>discovery</em> aspect of software defects. Yes, it’s possible for different people
to independently discover the same bug, but that’s an unlucky coincidence, not
a structural aspect of the resulting system.</p><hr><p>If you’re interested in investing in the Zig ecosystem, we’re happy to chat with you and give you all the necessary insight both when it comes to the project’s roadmap, and also in terms of publicizing the opportunity within the community to help you find a suitable candidate, but we do expect that you treat your collaborators with the respect they deserve.</p><p>For more info, contact Loris Cro (VP of Community) at <a href="mailto:loris@ziglang.org">loris@ziglang.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>
