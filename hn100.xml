            <p>Today I’m excited to announce the next steps we’re taking to radically improve TypeScript performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="A 10x Faster TypeScript" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNlq-EVld70?si=OaEgTg6ROtfYDYLt" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The core value proposition of TypeScript is an excellent developer experience.
As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.</p>
<p>To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will <strong>drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage</strong>.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of <code>tsc</code> capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.</p>
<p>You can <strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go">build and run the Go code from our new working repo</a></strong>, which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run <code>tsc</code> and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-faster">How Much Faster?</h2>
<p>Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/src/compiler">the TypeScript compiler itself</a>.
Here are times to run <code>tsc</code> on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:</p>

<p>While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.</p>
<p>We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.</p>
<h2 id="editor-speed">Editor Speed</h2>
<p>Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.</p>
<p>Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an <strong>8x improvement in project load time</strong> in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.</p>
<p>Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.</p>
<h2 id="versioning-roadmap">Versioning Roadmap</h2>
<p>Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.</p>
<p>When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as <strong>TypeScript 7.0</strong>.
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.</p>
<p>While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.</p>
<p>Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/categories/faqs">FAQs</a> on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the <a href="https://discord.gg/typescript">TypeScript Community Discord</a> at <strong>10 AM PDT | 5 PM UTC</strong> on March 13th.</p>
<p>A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!</p>

                            <p>
                                Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly saturating existing benchmarks, necessitating new open-ended evaluations.
                                We introduce the <b>Factorio Learning Environment (FLE)</b>, based on the game of Factorio, that tests agents in long-term planning, program synthesis, and resource optimization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                FLE provides open-ended and exponentially scaling challenges - from basic automation to complex factories processing millions of resource units per second.
                                We provide two settings:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Lab-play</b> consisting of 24 structured tasks with fixed resources.</li>
                                <li><b>Open-play</b> with the unbounded task of building the largest factory from scratch on a procedurally generated map.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                We demonstrate across both settings that models still lack strong spatial reasoning.
                                In lab-play, we find that LLMs exhibit promising short-horizon skills, yet are unable to operate effectively in constrained environments, reflecting limitations in error analysis.
                                In open-play, while LLMs discover automation strategies that improve growth (e.g electric-powered drilling), they fail to achieve complex automation (e.g electronic-circuit manufacturing).
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
          <div>
                <h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>

                <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex question-answer (QA) problems, saturating benchmarks in factual recollection, reasoning and code generation.
                    Benchmark saturation presents a critical challenge for the AI research community: how do we meaningfully evaluate and differentiate increasingly capable models?

                    We introduce the <b>Factorio Learning Environment (FLE)</b>: a novel framework built upon the game of Factorio that addresses this challenge by enabling <i>unbounded</i> agent evaluation. FLE provides the infrastructure, API, and metrics for assessing frontier LLM agents in code generation, spatial reasoning and long-term planning.
                    In this environment, agents must navigate rapidly scaling challenges—from basic resource extraction producing ~30 units/minute to sophisticated production chains processing millions of units/second. This dramatic growth in complexity, driven by geometric increases in research costs and the combinatorial expansion of interdependent production chains, creates natural curricula for evaluating increasingly capable agents.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Within FLE, we define two complementary evaluation protocols: (1) <b>lab-play</b> with structured, goal-oriented tasks that have clear completion criteria, allowing targeted assessment of specific capabilities, and (2) <b>open-play</b> with no predetermined end-state, supporting truly unbounded evaluation of an agent's ability to autonomously set and achieve increasingly complex goals.

                                    Using 23 core API tools, agents compose programs that interact with the environment and observe the results through <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> streams.
                                    The Python namespace allows agents to store variables and define functions for later use, enabling increasingly sophisticated strategies as experience grows.
                                    This approach mirrors the way human programmers learn - through iteration, debugging, and refinement based on direct feedback.
                                    Agent programs yield both a Production Score (PS) representing the economic value of all items produced, and milestones that reflect technological advancements.

                <p>
                    To systematically evaluate agent capabilities in the Factorio Learning Environment, we introduce two complementary experimental settings that test different aspects of planning, automation, and resource management; namely <i>open-play</i> and <i>lab-play</i>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We evaluate six frontier language models across both settings: Claude 3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini, Deepseek-v3, Gemini-2-Flash, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.
                    Each model interacts with the environment through a consistent prompting approach, receiving the API schema, a guide describing common patterns, and memory of past actions and observations.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Open-Play</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Agents begin in a procedurally generated world with instruction to "build the largest possible factory". This setting tests agents' ability to set appropriate goals, balance short-term production against long-term research, and navigate the complex tech tree and game map without external guidance.
                </p>

                            <b>Agent capabilities are clearly differentiated by their production scores in open-play.</b>
                                    Left: By plotting Production Score (PS) against steps on a log/log scale, we can observe distinct performance trajectories for each model.
                                    More capable models not only achieve higher scores but demonstrate steeper growth curves, indicating better long-term planning.
                                    Milestone annotations show when the median agent first created key entities, revealing how quickly each model progresses through the tech tree.
                                    Right: Final rewards reveal how weaker models struggle to advance when complex automation and logistics become necessary.

                                <b>Production strategies reveal differences in agent planning and capabilities.</b>
                                    We track how various models produce items with multiple antecedent ingredients in open-play, showing not just what they build but how they approach factory design.
                                    Claude 3.5-Sonnet demonstrates sophisticated strategy by immediately beginning complex crafting and investing in research and automation, ultimately unlocking <code>electric-mining-drills</code> around step 3k - a decision that boosts <code>iron-plate</code> production by 50% thereafter.
                                    In contrast, less advanced models like GPT-4o-Mini produce minimal quantities of multi-ingredient items, revealing limitations in planning horizons.
                                    Interestingly, Deepseek showed stronger capabilities in lab-play than open-play, suggesting that its general capabilities exceed its objective-setting abilities in open-ended environments.

                <p>
                    Agents are provided with resources and given a time-limit to achieve an objective.
                    We task agents to build production lines of 24 distinct target entities of increasing complexity, starting from a single resource mine requiring at most 2 machines (making <code>iron-ore</code>) to a late game entity requiring the coordination of close to 100 machines (making <code>utility-science-pack</code>).
                    The target entities cover items from early to late game, requiring agents to use a wide variety of machines present in Factorio (drills, furnaces, assembling machines, oil refineries, chemical plants). As the task difficulty naturally increases with resource requirements, this provides a measure of the complexity that agents are capable of creating in a limited number of steps.
                    All tasks provide the agent with sufficient resources to complete the task with all technologies unlocked.

                                    <b>Item production complexity creates a natural difficulty gradient for agent evaluation.</b> Top: We measure task success rates across the first 8 complexity levels, revealing a clear decline as target entity crafting complexity increases. Even the most capable models struggle with coordinating more than six machines when producing items with three or more ingredients. Bottom: Production progress over time shows a pattern of initial rapid advancement followed by stagnation or regression. This reveals a key limitation in current agents' abilities: they often break existing functional structures when attempting to scale production or add new factory sections. The high variance in task progress across runs further demonstrates the challenge of consistent performance in complex automation tasks.

                                    The factory consists of a electricity steam generator (top-left), a coal mine with storage buffer (top), a crude-oil to petroleum gas pipeline (bottom) and a chemical plant  (bottom-right).
                                    The chemical plant creates plastic bars using the coal and petroleum gas as inputs. By themselves, the cumulative raw resources generate a production score of $224$.
                                    With this specific layout, the factory creates $40$ plastic bars per $60$ in-game seconds, for a production score of $352$.
                                    This factory was created by Claude Sonnet 3.5.

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>
                Our experiments revealed several key patterns that highlight both the capabilities and limitations of current AI agents when faced with open-ended industrial challenges:

                                <h4>1. Coding skill predicts performance</h4>
                                <p>Models with stronger coding abilities (Claude 3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o) achieved higher Production Scores and completed more lab tasks. Claude outperformed others with a PS of 293,206 and 28 milestones, progressing beyond early-game resource extraction.</p>
                            </div>

                        <div>
                                <h4>2. Technology investment drives growth</h4>
                                <p>Only Claude consistently invested resources in researching new technologies, despite their importance for long-term progression. After deploying electric mining drills at step 3k, Claude's PS grew by 50% (from 200k to 300k), demonstrating the value of strategic investment.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>3. Planning is essential in open-play</h4>
                                <p>In open-play, agents frequently pursue short-sighted objectives — like Gemini-2.0 manually crafting 300+ wooden chests over 100 steps — rather than investing in research or scaling existing production. This reveals a telling discrepancy: while Gemini-2 and Deepseek demonstrate early-game automation capabilities in structured lab-play, they rarely attempt to create cohesive factories during open-ended exploration, resulting in poorer overall performance.</p>

                       <div>
                                <h4>4. Spatial reasoning is a major limitation</h4>
<!--                                <p>Models struggled with spatial planning when building multi-section factories. Common failures included placing entities too close together, not leaving room for connections, or incorrect inserter placement, leading to significant underperformance in complex tasks.</p>-->
<!--                            -->
                                <p>All models exhibited limitations in spatial planning when constructing multi-section factories. Common failures included placing entities too close together, not allocating space for connections, or incorrect inserter placement - issues that severely impacted performance in complex tasks requiring coordination of multiple production lines.</p>

                                <p>Models frequently become trapped in repetitive error patterns, attempting the same invalid operations repeatedly rather than exploring alternative solutions. For instance, GPT-4o repeated the same API method incorrectly for 78 consecutive steps despite identical error messages.</p>

                                <h4>6. Programming styles vary significantly</h4>
                                <p>Models exhibited distinct coding approaches: Claude favored a REPL style with extensive print statements (43.3% of code lines) but few assertions (2.0%), while GPT-4o used a defensive style with more validation checks (12.8% assertions) and fewer prints (10.3%).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not long ago, I was auditing a codebase for work (looking for bugs) when I realized that despite the quality of the code, I was becoming mentally fatigued extremely quickly and had a hard time working on it for long stretches of time…</p><p>I ended up figuring out what made this codebase so difficult to stick with, but it didn’t turn out to be what I expected (<a href="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/cyclomatic-complexity-illustrated/">Cyclomatic Complexity</a>). After doing a little reflection and research, it ended up being something more related to readability–something I didn’t have a lot of data on, but was curious to learn if there was objective terminology or common metrics.</p><p>So today we’re jumping into the results of that investigation, which means instead of visualizing code, we’re talking about <strong>visual patterns</strong> of code, specifically the ones that make my brain hurt!</p><p>Be warned! Tis a murky and ill-defined realm… some of the data points include popular metrics, academic papers, and practical opinions (including my own), but by the end of the search we’ll distill it down to <a href="#8-patterns-for-improving-code-readability">8 visually-observable properties</a> that can help programmers of any language improve the readability of code.</p><h2>Code readability metrics and alternate complexity metrics<span><a href="#code-readability-metrics-and-alternate-complexity-metrics" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Let me be upfront: there is no commonly-used and accepted metric for code readability.</p><p>All I could find was 1) academic papers that didn’t seem to be used by the real world and 2) opinions… when I was looking for something more tangible.</p><p>Since I wasn’t looking to invent my own metric, my goal was to collect a set of visual patterns that anyone could use in a discussion about what makes code easier to read.</p><p>For example, take the examples below where the primary difference is just the shape or pattern of logic. Is any one of them the <em>easiest</em> to read? Or are some of them objectively <em>worse</em> to read?</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/6-oddness.png" alt="Six ways to write a simple getOddness function"></figure><p>The differences between some of the examples above are a matter of preference, but it is interesting to look for patterns that point out the “bad” ones… especially if those are easy to spot visually, with no special tools required!</p><p>My first thought for finding such patterns was to look at complexity metrics, but interestingly there’s not a huge number of well-known software complexity metrics or academic readability ideas that fit what I was looking for, specifically measures that:</p><ol><li>Work on source code snippets or a single function</li><li>Don’t focus on “core complexity”: certain measurements like cyclomatic complexity are to some degree inseparable from the algorithm being implemented</li><li>Don’t focus on superficial style factors: length of variable names, whitespace usage, choices of indentation or brackets/parens placement, etc.</li></ol><p>But the good news was that there was two metrics that seem to be in use that did fit the criteria, so that’s where the journey begins.</p><h2>Halstead Complexity Metrics<span><a href="#halstead-complexity-metrics" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In the late 70’s, a fellow named Maurice Halstead came up with a set of metrics in an attempt to build empirical measures of source code.
This means they are translatable across languages and platforms, which is really nice for our purpose because they focus on how something is written rather than the complexity of underlying algorithms being described.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/halstead-and-book.png" alt="Maurice Halstead and his seminal work"></figure><p>The root of his metrics was four measurements based around counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_%28computer_programming%29" target="_blank">operators</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand" target="_blank">operands</a>:</p><ul><li>Number of <em>distinct</em> <em>operators</em> (<code>n1</code>)</li><li>Number of <em>distinct</em> <strong>operands</strong> (<code>n2</code>)</li><li>Number of <strong>total</strong> <em>operators</em> (<code>N1</code>)</li><li>Number of <strong>total</strong> <strong>operands</strong> (<code>N2</code>)</li></ul><p>Halstead’s focus was building a system of related metrics such as program “length”, “volume”, and “difficulty” with a series of equations describing the relationships between them… ambitiously culminating in a numerical value that would estimate the number of bugs contained in the implementation!</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/halstead-equations.png" alt="Halstead Complexity Metrics Equations"></figure><p>These metrics definitely are debatable (they were made in the 70’s…), but they give us numbers that are a starting point for at least comparison, and the reasoning seems to make sense</p><p>Intuitively, the more operators in play, the more one has to reason about potential interactions.
Similarly, a larger number of operands means understanding possibilities of dataflow become more complex.</p><h3>Halstead Complexity Javascript Example<span><a href="#halstead-complexity-javascript-example" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>If we go back to our early example we can make two variations that attempt to be on separate ends of the spectrum in terms of operands and operators, and we can see how that affects two of the Halstead metrics, <em>Volume</em> and <em>Difficulty</em>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>getOddnessA</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can tell just by looking that the first one has fewer operators and operands and is a bit easier to read, and the Halstead Volume and Difficulty numbers confirm this. That’s kinda nice!</p><p>The big downside here is that it’s not well-defined what exactly counts as an <strong>operator</strong> or <strong>operand</strong> for all languages, so it’s best to just use a specific tool or implementation for measurement and stick with it. I used <a href="https://ftaproject.dev/playground" target="_blank">this site</a> for the measurements reported above, whereas the picture below shows my estimation of trying to color code operators/operands to show visually that fewer colors is simpler:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seeinglogic.com/posts/visual-readability-patterns/halstead-colors.png" alt="Pictures of operands and operators colored for getOddnessA and B"></figure><h3>Halstead Complexity Takeaways<span><a href="#halstead-complexity-takeaways" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>From a practical standpoint, these metrics suggest a couple of useful patterns to me:</p><ul><li>Smaller functions with fewer variables are generally easier to read, and redundant variables are only for when you hate the people that read your code</li><li>Prefer to <em>not</em> use language-specific operators or syntactic sugars, since additional constructs are a tax on the reader. Try reading someone else’s Perl or Ruby if this doesn’t resonate with you.</li><li>Chaining together <code>map</code>/<code>reduce</code>/<code>filter</code> and other functional programming constructs (lambdas, iterators, comprehensions) may be concise, but long/multiple chains hurt readability<ul><li>This seems more common in Javascript and Rust, or when a Python programmer gets fascinated with itertools</li></ul></li></ul><p>As mentioned, the Halstead metrics have been debated fiercely in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4523.pdf" target="_blank">academic</a> and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1990.pdf" target="_blank">other</a> circles, but we don’t need to wait for <em>science</em>.</p><p>Pfft, we can take the ideas and run!</p><h2>“Cognitive Complexity”<span><a href="#cognitive-complexity" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>A more recent metric developed in an effort to more accurately capture the difficulty of reading is a measure called “<a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf" target="_blank">Cognitive Complexity</a>” developed by SonarSource, a company that makes static analysis products.</p><p>Some people find the name of the metric misleading, feeling that it makes the measure sound more scientific or objective, rather than naming it something that sounds like a heuristic developed from experience.</p><p>Being a practitioner who really only cares about effectiveness, I’ll take good metrics with bad names over bad metrics, and I have respect for heuristics as long as they work!</p><p>The authors break down Cognitive Complexity into three ideas:</p><ol><li>Shorthand constructs that combine statements decreases difficulty</li><li>Each break from linear flow increases difficulty</li><li>Nested control flow increases difficulty</li></ol><p>Seems straightforward and reasonable, but the whitepaper goes into <em>much</em> more depth than just three points, so let’s get into the meat of this to see what a group of static analysis developers believe hurt readability.</p><h3>Shorthand Constructs<span><a href="#shorthand-constructs" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>For the first principle, their whitepaper uses the following two snippets, arguing that the first increases difficulty for the reader while the second doesn’t:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span><span><span>// 1
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>MyObj</span> <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>myObj</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// 2
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>MyObj</span> <span>myObj</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>?</span><span>.</span><span>myObj</span><span>;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The second is shorter and takes less time to read, but I’d argue that in the second construct there’s a better chance that the programmer forgets to properly handle all of the possibilities… case in point, these code snippets aren’t actually equivalent!</p><p>In the first case <code>myObj</code> will either be <code>a.myObj</code> or <code>null</code> and in the second it will be <code>a.myObj</code> or <code>undefined</code>!</p><p>This may seem like splitting hairs, but if I’ve got my bug-hunting hat on, I look for the small unexpected behaviors like this to see if I can leverage them into something useful!</p><p>Even using languages with solid type-checking like TypeScript or Rust, they only reduce the chance you <em>omit</em> handling such a case, but it doesn’t mean that you handle it <em>correctly</em> in all cases.</p><p>Without the assistance of type checking, like in vanilla JavaScript, the chances of that corner case not being handled are much higher.
So while I won’t argue that shorthand constructs are simpler to write and easier to read, there’s still some tradeoff in terms of conciseness and density.</p><h3>Linear Flow Breaks<span><a href="#linear-flow-breaks" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>One thing that seems obvious is that “linear” code with no conditionals is easier to scan than code with conditionals, and is a big focus for Cognitive Complexity.</p><p>Naturally they assess additional difficulty for any conditionals, loops, or <code>goto</code>s, but they also get a bit fancier and include conditional macros, try/except blocks, sequences of logical operators, and recursion.</p><p>I totally agree that each of these things generally affect readability, but I think there are four fine points worth talking about.</p><p>Point 1. They count <code>switch</code> statements as a single group, but they penalize each additional <code>else-if</code> in a chain because each <code>else-if</code> <strong>can</strong> make more than one comparison, even the one in question doesn’t.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I think switches look better than if-else chains, but they aren’t innocent either; switch case fall-throughs definitely increase reading difficulty and missing <code>break</code>s have caused needless headaches for many programmers, myself included!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>// Switches are preferred by this metric

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/">https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43330331">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Overview<span><a href="#overview" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Espressif has already provided a <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Response_ESP32_Bluetooth" target="_blank">formal response</a> to the recently published claims about ESP32 Bluetooth controller serving as a potential “backdoor” or having “undocumented features” that can cause security concerns.</p><p>This post highlights the technical details about the relevant commands (HCI Commands) that were undocumented and establishes that the mentioned undocumented HCI commands do not pose a security threat and are certainly not a “backdoor”.</p><h3>What are HCI Commands?<span><a href="#what-are-hci-commands" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The Bluetooth protocol stack consists of two primary layers:</p><ul><li><strong>Bluetooth Controller (Lower Layer)</strong> – Handles radio operations, link management, and low-level Bluetooth communication. Each ESP32 series chip implements a controller through a combination of hardware and software.</li><li><strong>Bluetooth Host Stack (Upper Layer)</strong> – Manages higher-level Bluetooth functionality, such as pairing, encryption, and application-layer interactions. This is fully implemented in software. The ESP32 series of chips support open-source NimBLE and Bluedroid as Bluetooth host stacks.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/bluetooth_architecture.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/bluetooth_architecture.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These layers communicate via a standard interface call the Host Controller Interface (HCI). HCI defines a set of standard commands for the Bluetooth Host stack to use. The Bluetooth controller implements standard HCI commands along with a set of Vendor-specific HCI commands that are primarily used for custom hardware initialization on control as well as for debugging purposes.</p><h3>What is the Reported Security Issue?<span><a href="#what-is-the-reported-security-issue" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The reported security issue highlights that the ESP32 contains a set of undocumented HCI commands. The issue claims that these could be used to gain malicious access to devices running Bluetooth on the ESP32.</p><h3>What are these Undocumented Commands?<span><a href="#what-are-these-undocumented-commands" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The “undocumented” HCI commands mentioned in the report are debug commands present in the Bluetooth controller IP in the ESP32. These commands are mostly for assisting the debug (e.g., read/write RAM, memory mapped flash read, send/receive packets, etc.) and do not play any active role in the HCI communication from a standard Bluetooth host stack such as NimBLE or Bluedroid used on the ESP32.</p><p>Such debugging commands, a common paradigm for Bluetooth Controller implementations, assist developers to debug Controller behavior. This is particularly helpful in dual-chip solutions.</p><h2>ESP32 Bluetooth Architecture<span><a href="#esp32-bluetooth-architecture" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In ESP32, the Controller and the Host both run on the same MCU. The Host continues to communicate with the Controller over HCI. But since both are running on the same MCU, the HCI can be treated as a <strong>virtual</strong> HCI layer, an internal layer of communication.</p><p>Any code accessing this virtual HCI layer should itself be first executing on the ESP32, with full execution privileges.</p><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_vhci.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_vhci.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><h2>Impact<span><a href="#impact" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><ul><li>For the majority of the ESP32 applications, the Bluetooth Host and Controller are part of the same application binary running on ESP32. There is no security risk because the application already has full privileged access to the memory and registers as well as ability to send/receive Bluetooth packets irrespective of the availability of these HCI commands.</li><li>These undocumented HCI commands cannot be triggered by Bluetooth, radio signals, or over the Internet, unless there is a vulnerability in the application itself or the radio protocols. Presence of such vulnerabilities will be a bigger problem and the presence of these undocumented commands does not offer additional attack surface.</li><li>Only the original ESP32 chip has these commands. ESP32-C, ESP32-S and ESP32-H series chips are unaffected as they don’t have these commands supported in their Bluetooth controller.</li></ul><h2>ESP32 Hosted Mode Operation (Less Commonly Used)<span><a href="#esp32-hosted-mode-operation-less-commonly-used" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In a not-so-commonly-used alternate configuration, ESP32 can tunnel HCI commands over a serial (e.g., <strong>UART HCI</strong>) interface to an external host system. This is typically used in scenarios where ESP32 acts just as a communication coprocessor. This type of use of ESP32 is not as common as the standalone mode of operation.</p><figure><img src="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_serial_hci.webp" alt="Zoom Image"><figcaption><p><a href="https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/03/esp32-bluetooth-clearing-the-air/img/esp32_bluetooth_serial_hci.webp">Zoom Image</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>In such a system, the ESP32 fully trusts the host. If an attacker maliciously gains control over the host system, they could potentially issue these debug commands to influence ESP32’s behavior. However, an attacker must first compromise the host device, making this a second-stage attack vector rather than a standalone vulnerability. Or, gain a physical access to the device to send the HCI commands over serial interface.</p><p>For these UART-HCI-based implementations, the attack is not self-exploitable. Still, a software fix can disable debug commands via an OTA update for added security. We will have more updates in our software stack regarding this soon.</p><h2>Mitigation<span><a href="#mitigation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>As summarized above, there is no real, known security threat that these undocumented commands pose. Regardless, Espressif has decided to take the following measures:</p><ul><li>Espressif will provide a fix that removes access to these HCI debug commands through a software patch for currently supported ESP-IDF versions</li><li>Espressif will document all Vendor-specific HCI commands to ensure transparancy of what functionality is available at the HCI layer</li></ul><h2>Summary<span><a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>To summarize, for most ESP32 applications, we do not foresee any impact from the reported issue provided the product has the recommended platform security features enabled. For a small number of Bluetooth HCI serial use-cases, we can mitigate the issue by disabling debug commands and we will provide an update on that front soon.</p><p>We follow a standardized <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/Espressif%20Security%20Incident%20Response%20Process%20v1.0_EN.pdf" target="_blank">Product Security Incident Response process</a> and we believe in responsible disclosure.</p><p>We believe that the security of devices based on Espressif chips is of paramount importance and are committed to transparency and best security practices. We will continue to work with the community to ensure that our devices are secure and that all security-related information is responsibly disclosed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

He found plenty that remained enraging: mud huts, primitive ploughs, “barefoot old men” and “bone-thin children”. One older villager, Ram Dass, recalled the bitter deprivation of his younger years, when he would work long days on someone else’s land for the meagre reward of 1.5kg of grain. On cold nights, the poor stuffed rice stalks into old clothes to keep warm. “What did we know what a quilt was?” A man was lucky to own a single pair of shoes from his wedding to his

<p dir="auto">Bash scripting is a powerful and valid approach for shell automation. Shef isn't designed to replace bash scripts, but
rather provides a toolkit that compliments bash when you need specific features.</p>
<p dir="auto">Shef implements some common tooling like built-in support for interactive prompts, conditional logic, and command
piping. This structured approach can simplify certain tasks that might require more verbose code in bash.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider Shef as another tool in your automation toolkit. Absolutely use bash scripts when they're the right fit, and
reach for Shef when its features align with your specific needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ugh. YAML? Really?</h2><a id="user-content-ugh-yaml-really" aria-label="Permalink: Ugh. YAML? Really?" href="#ugh-yaml-really"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sigh. Yep. Another config format. I considered several options, and YAML emerged as the most practical choice for
this particular use case. JSON lacks comments and multiline string support, which are essential when defining shell
commands and documenting workflows. XML would have been unnecessarily verbose. TOML, while nice, doesn't handle nested
structures as elegantly for complex workflows.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="I need help creating a Shef recipe. Shef is a CLI tool that combines shell commands into reusable recipes defined in YAML.

[DESCRIBE YOUR WORKFLOW IN DETAIL]

A Shef recipe is defined in YAML with this structure:

recipes:
  - name: &quot;short-name&quot;
    description: &quot;Human-readable description&quot;
    category: &quot;category&quot;
    author: &quot;optional author&quot;
    operations:
      - name: &quot;Operation Name&quot;
        id: &quot;unique_id&quot;
        command: &quot;shell command&quot;
        execution_mode: &quot;standard|interactive|stream&quot;  # How the command runs
        silent: true|false  # Whether to suppress the command's output
        condition: &quot;optional condition&quot;
        on_success: &quot;next_op_id&quot;
        on_failure: &quot;fallback_op_id&quot;
        transform: &quot;{{ .input | transformation }}&quot;
        prompts:
          - name: &quot;variable_name&quot;
            type: &quot;input|select|confirm|password|multiselect|number|editor|path|autocomplete&quot;
            message: &quot;Prompt message&quot;
            default: &quot;Default value&quot;
            help_text: &quot;Additional help information&quot;
            required: true|false  # Whether input is required
            options: [&quot;option1&quot;, &quot;option2&quot;]  # For select/multiselect/autocomplete types
            source_operation: &quot;operation_id&quot;  # For dynamic options
            source_transform: &quot;{{ .input | transform }}&quot;  # For processing source options
            min_value: 0  # For number type
            max_value: 100  # For number type
            file_extensions: [&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;json&quot;]  # For path type
            multiple_limit: 3  # For multiselect type
            editor_cmd: &quot;vim&quot;  # For editor type
        control_flow:
          type: &quot;foreach|for|while&quot;  # Type of control flow
          collection: &quot;Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3&quot;  # Items to iterate over (foreach loops)
          as: &quot;item&quot;  # Variable name for current item (foreach loops)
          count: 5  # Number of iterations (for loops)
          variable: &quot;i&quot;  # Variable name for iteration index (for loops)
          condition: &quot;{{ lt .counter 5 }}&quot;  # Condition to check (while loops)
        operations:  # Operations to perform for each iteration
          - name: &quot;Sub Operation&quot;
            # command: &quot;echo 'Processing {{ .item }}'&quot; # foreach loop
            # command: &quot;echo 'Iteration {{ .i }} of 5'&quot; # for loop
            # command: &quot;echo 'While iteration {{ .iteration }}'&quot; # while loop

RECIPE MECHANICS:
1. Operations execute in sequence unless redirected by on_success/on_failure
2. Each operation's output becomes input to the next operation
3. Variables from prompts are accessible as {{ .variable_name }}
4. Operation outputs are accessible as {{ .operation_id }}
5. You can combine variables and operation outputs in command templates
6. Control flow structures like foreach allow iterating over collections

CONTROL FLOW STRUCTURES:
- foreach: Iterate over a collection of items
  - collection: Newline-separated list of items (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - as: Variable name to assign each item during iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute for each item (with access to the iteration variable)
- for: Execute operations a fixed number of times
  - count: Number of iterations to perform (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - variable: Variable name for the current zero-based index (optional, defaults to &quot;i&quot;)
  - operations: Operations to execute for each iteration (with access to the index variable and .iteration)
- while: Execute operations as long as a condition is true
  - condition: Expression to evaluate before each iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute while the condition is true (with access to .iteration)

INTERACTIVE PROMPTS:
- input: Free text input (default: string)
- select: Choose from options (static or dynamic from previous operation)
- confirm: Yes/no boolean question
- password: Masked text input
- multiselect: Choose multiple options
- number: Numeric input with range validation
- editor: Multi-line text input in an editor
- path: File path with validation
- autocomplete: Selection with filtering

TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:
- Trim whitespace: {{ .input | trim }}
- Split by delimiter: {{ .input | split &quot;,&quot; }}
- Join array: {{ .input | join &quot;\n&quot; }}

[DESCRIBE YOUR WORKFLOW IN DETAIL]

A Shef recipe is defined in YAML with this structure:

recipes:
  - name: "short-name"
    description: "Human-readable description"
    category: "category"
    author: "optional author"
    operations:
      - name: "Operation Name"
        id: "unique_id"
        command: "shell command"
        execution_mode: "standard|interactive|stream"  # How the command runs
        silent: true|false  # Whether to suppress the command's output
        condition: "optional condition"
        on_success: "next_op_id"
        on_failure: "fallback_op_id"
        transform: "{{ .input | transformation }}"
        prompts:
          - name: "variable_name"
            type: "input|select|confirm|password|multiselect|number|editor|path|autocomplete"
            message: "Prompt message"
            default: "Default value"

            source_operation: "operation_id"  # For dynamic options
            source_transform: "{{ .input | transform }}"  # For processing source options
            min_value: 0  # For number type
            max_value: 100  # For number type
            file_extensions: ["txt", "json"]  # For path type
            multiple_limit: 3  # For multiselect type
            editor_cmd: "vim"  # For editor type
        control_flow:
          type: "foreach|for|while"  # Type of control flow
          collection: "Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3"  # Items to iterate over (foreach loops)
          as: "item"  # Variable name for current item (foreach loops)
          count: 5  # Number of iterations (for loops)
          variable: "i"  # Variable name for iteration index (for loops)

            # command: "echo 'Iteration {{ .i }} of 5'" # for loop
            # command: "echo 'While iteration {{ .iteration }}'" # while loop

RECIPE MECHANICS:
1. Operations execute in sequence unless redirected by on_success/on_failure
2. Each operation's output becomes input to the next operation
3. Variables from prompts are accessible as {{ .variable_name }}
4. Operation outputs are accessible as {{ .operation_id }}
5. You can combine variables and operation outputs in command templates
6. Control flow structures like foreach allow iterating over collections

CONTROL FLOW STRUCTURES:
- foreach: Iterate over a collection of items
  - collection: Newline-separated list of items (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - as: Variable name to assign each item during iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute for each item (with access to the iteration variable)
- for: Execute operations a fixed number of times
  - count: Number of iterations to perform (can be fixed or from operation output)
  - variable: Variable name for the current zero-based index (optional, defaults to "i")
  - operations: Operations to execute for each iteration (with access to the index variable and .iteration)
- while: Execute operations as long as a condition is true
  - condition: Expression to evaluate before each iteration
  - operations: Operations to execute while the condition is true (with access to .iteration)

INTERACTIVE PROMPTS:
- input: Free text input (default: string)
- select: Choose from options (static or dynamic from previous operation)
- confirm: Yes/no boolean question
- password: Masked text input
- multiselect: Choose multiple options
- number: Numeric input with range validation
- editor: Multi-line text input in an editor
- path: File path with validation
- autocomplete: Selection with filtering

TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:
- Trim whitespace: {{ .input | trim }}
- Split by delimiter: {{ .input | split "," }}
- Join array: {{ .input | join "\n" }}
- Filter lines: {{ .input | filter "pattern" }} or {{ .input | grep "pattern" }}
- Extract field: {{ .input | cut ":" 1 }}
- Remove prefix/suffix: {{ .input | trimPrefix "foo" }} {{ .input | trimSuffix "bar" }}
- Check content: {{ if contains .input "pattern" }}yes{{ end }}
- Replace text: {{ .input | replace "old" "new" }}
- Math operations: {{ .input | atoi | add 5 | mul 2 | div 3 | sub 1 }}
- Execute command: {{ exec "date" }}

CONDITIONAL LOGIC:
- Variable equality: variable == "value" or variable != "value"
- Operation success/failure: operation_id.success or operation_id.failure
- Boolean operators: condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2, condition1 || condition2, !condition
- Numeric comparison: value &gt; 5, count &lt;= 10

ADVANCED FEATURES:
- Dynamic selection options from previous commands
- Conditional branching based on operation results
- Multi-step workflows with error handling
- Custom error messages and recovery steps

<hr>

<p>
One of the things I detested about being a little kid was that every
time I thought of something really cool to do, I was invariably
thwarted by my little brother shouting, “<em>Mom!  Kelvin's
mixing rocket fuel in the bathtub again!</em>” or
“<em>Mom!  Kelvin's making a submarine out of the old
refrigerator!</em>”.  Well, middle age has its drawbacks, but at
least you can undertake a project like this without fear of getting
nipped in the bud at the cry, “<em>Mom! Kelvin's down in the
basement bending spacetime!</em>”.  It's important to recall the
distinction between “grownup” and “grown up”.
Let's us grownups head for the basement to bend some serious
spacetime.
</p>

<h2>Matters of Gravity</h2>

<p>
Apart from rare and generally regrettable moments of free-fall, we
spend our entire lives under the influence of the Earth's
gravity, yet rarely, if ever, do we experience the
<em>universal</em> nature of gravitation.  It's a tremendous
philosophical leap from “stuff falls” to “everything in the universe
attracts everything else”.  That leap, made by Isaac Newton in the
17th century, not only allowed understanding the motion of the Moon
and the planets, but inoculated in Western culture the idea that
the universe as a whole was governed by laws humans could discover.
This realisation fueled the Enlightenment and the subsequent
development of science and technology.
</p>

<p>
This page presents a “basement science” experiment which
reveals the universality of gravitation by demonstrating the
gravitational attraction between palpable objects on the human scale.
The experiment deliberately uses only
the crudest and most commonplace materials, permitting
anybody who's so inclined to perform it.
Einstein's 1915 theory of General Relativity explains
gravitation as spacetime curvature created by
matter and energy.  So, by demonstrating how every object
in the universe attracts everything else, we're
<em>bending spacetime in the basement</em>.
</p>

<p>
But, if gravitation is ubiquitous, why was it not discovered millennia
before Newton's 1687 <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philosophiæ
naturalis principia mathematica</cite>?  The reason lies in the
extraordinary <em>weakness</em> of the gravitational force.
</p>

<h2>Feeble Attraction</h2>

<p>
Now you might say, “What do you mean, <em>weak</em>?  I fell down a
flight of stairs a couple of years ago, and gravity sure didn't feel
weak to me!“.  And yet, of the four forces of nature known to
physics, gravitation is the weakest, by the mindboggling factor of
4.17×10<sup>42</sup> (4 followed by 42 zeroes) times weaker than
the electromagnetic force.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/magrav.jpg" width="202" height="317" alt="Electromagnetism vs. gravity">
The stark difference in the strength of the electromagnetic and
gravitational forces is evident in the picture to the left.  The
bright square in the jaws of the pliers is a 4 mm cubical magnet.  It
is lifting a spherical steel pétanque (a lawn bowling game popular in
southern France and Switzerland) ball which weighs 550 grams.
Consider this picture in the following way: we're pitting our valiant
little magnet, with a volume of 0.064 cubic centimetres, weighing
less than one gram, pulling <b>up</b> with the electromagnetic force,
against the entire Earth, pulling <b>down</b> with gravity.  And the
winner is…the magnet.  A one gram magnet (I'm being generous: I
don't have a scale on which its weight reads other than zero)
out-pulls the Earth, which weighs 5.9736×10<sup>27</sup> grams and has
a volume of more than 10<sup>27</sup> cubic centimetres.
</p>

<p>
(The apparent discrepancy between the ratio of masses of the Earth
and the magnet and the 4.17×10<sup>42</sup> strength ratio
of electromagnetism and gravitation is due to the
fact that only an infinitesimal fraction of the mass of the magnet
contributes to the [electro]magnetic attraction on the ball,
while every gram of the Earth's mass exerts gravitational force.
To obtain the correct ratio of force strengths, one must compare
the gravitational attraction between two electrons at a given
distance with the electromagnetic repulsion
resulting from their charge.  This calculation arrives at the
correct strength ratio for the two forces.)
</p>

<p>
If gravity were not so weak compared to the electromagnetic force, you
wouldn't be reading this page; it's only because the electromagnetic
force that bonds the atoms in your body together so easily defeats the
Earth's gravity that you, along with all other solid objects,
don't slump into a puddle and eventually merge into a perfectly
spherical (actually, slightly ellipsoidal thanks to rotation) planet.
<br>
</p>

<p id="gravcalc">
If your browser supports JavaScript, you can use the following calculator
to determine the gravitational force between any two objects.  The
gravitational force between two masses <em>m</em> and <em>m'</em>
whose centres of gravity are separated by a distance <em>r</em> is
given by:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/gforce.png" alt="F = G\frac{m m'}{r^2}" width="96" height="42">
</p>

<p>
where <em>G</em>, the <em>gravitational constant</em>, is:
</p>

<p>
6.67408×10<sup>−8</sup> cm³/g-sec²
</p>



<form name="calc1">
Given:<br>
Mass 1: <em>m</em> =  grams<br>
Mass 2: <em>m'</em> =  grams<br>
Distance: <em>r</em> =  centimetres<br>

<br>
Gravitational force: <em>F</em> =  dyne

<p>
Since most folks don't encounter forces in dynes on an everyday basis,
not to mention small fractions of a dyne, it's useful to express
this force in terms of the weight of something one can visualise.
We can calculate the mass of an object from its weight at the
Earth's surface merely by solving the gravitational force
equation above for <em>m</em> and plugging in the Earth's
mass, <em>m<sub>e</sub></em> = 5.9736×10<sup>27</sup> grams,
and the Earth's equatorial radius, <em>r<sub>e</sub></em> =
6.37814×10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;cm:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/gravmass.png" alt="m = \frac{{r_e}^2 F}{G m_e}" width="84" height="47">
</p>

<p>
The value below, then, is the mass of an object whose weight
at the Earth's surface equals the gravitational force displayed
in the box above.  This value is automatically updated when you
press the “Calculate” button.
</p>

<p>
Equivalent mass:   grams
</p><p id="monofilament">
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/monofilament.jpg" width="256" height="234" alt="Picture of 0.02 cm nylon monofilament, with micrometer and distance scale">
This mass is equivalent to the following
length of nylon monofilament fishing line with a diameter of 0.02&nbsp;cm
(0.2 millimetres) like that shown at the left (the scale at top shows
centimetres and millimetres; the micrometer holding the segment of
monofilament is, regrettably, calibrated in English inches—one inch
is 2.54 centimetres.
</p>

<p>
Monofilament length:   mm
</p>

<p>
This is small, but it is an object visible to the naked eye (easily
with a modest magnifier), and heavy enough to fall under
the influence of Earth's gravity, as opposed to smaller and
lighter particles of dust and smoke which stay suspended
in the air for long periods of time.
<br>
</p>
</form>

<h2>Do the Twist!</h2>

<p>
Even though the force of gravity between objects of modest mass is
palpable compared to the weight of objects one can see,
detecting such a tiny force seems a daunting, if not hopeless,
endeavour for the basement tinkerer.  Certainly, painstakingly
designed and constructed laboratory apparatus has allowed measuring
the gravitational constant to great precision and verifying the
equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, and precision
gravitometers are routinely used in oil and gas exploration and
mineral prospecting, but we're trying to see if we can experience
the universal attraction of gravity without any high tech, high
budget gear.
</p>

<p>
Measuring tiny gravitational forces would be easy if we were in deep
space, far from any massive bodies.  The only forces on objects in our
space laboratory, then, would be those entirely under our control.  As
long as we made sure none of the objects we were experimenting with
were magnetic or electrically charged (easily arranged, assuming they
are conductive, simply by bringing them into contact so all excess
charges equilibrate), the only force remaining between objects would
be gravity, so however weak it be, we need only be sufficiently
patient to observe its effects.  (The other two forces, the strong and
weak nuclear interactions, are limited in range to distances on the
order of the size of an atomic nucleus and can be neglected on the
human scale.)
</p>

<p>
What we'd like to do, then, is <em>cancel</em> the Earth's gravity so
that the much smaller gravitational forces between objects that fit in
the basement become evident.  Fortunately, we don't need a 25th
century WarpMan to accomplish this, only a modest helping of 18th
century technology.
</p>

<h3>Differential Cleverness</h3>

<p>
One of the great all-purpose sledgehammers in the toolbox of
physicists and engineers is <em>differential measurement</em>; in
other words, don't worry about the absolute value of something, but
only the <em>difference</em> between things you can measure.  For
example, it is common practice for linemen repairing high-voltage
power transmission lines to work on them, without cutting power, from
insulated baskets raised by a crane.  As long as the lineman is
insulated from the ground, only the voltage difference between his
hands and the line he's working on matters; after attaching the basket
to the line, this is zero, so he might as well be repairing a grounded
conductor.  Now if, while working on a conductor at, say, 200,000
volts above Earth potential, he should happen to touch the tower,
grounded to Earth, that would make for a really bad day.  The trick is
keeping the <em>difference</em> small; you can live your entire life
at 1 million volts, and as long as everything around you is near that
value, there is no way, even in principle, you could discover the
absolute potential.  This is the consequence of all the
forces of physics being <em>gauge invariant</em>:
absolute values don't exist—only differences matter.
</p>

<h3>The Torsion Balance</h3>

<p>
What we're looking for, then, is a device which responds only to
differences in gravitational attraction, canceling out the
much stronger constant gravitational attraction of the
Earth.  We need look no further than a slightly modified version of
the same device Henry Cavendish used in 1798 to first measure
the gravitational constant, <em>G</em> in the equations above.
Ever since, the <em>torsion balance</em> has been the primary tool
used both for measuring the gravitational constant
and testing the <em>equivalence principle</em>, which states
that all bodies experience the same gravitational force regardless
of composition; Einstein's General Relativity showed this to be
a fundamental consequence of the structure of space and time.
</p>

<p>
State of the art torsion balances have measured the gravitational
constant to better than one part per million and confirmed
the equivalence principle to more than 11 decimal places.  This
requires extraordinarily refined and delicate laboratory apparatus and
experimental design, in which a multitude of subtle effects must be
compensated for or canceled out.  We, however, aren't going to
<em>measure</em> anything—we're only interested in <em>observing</em>
universal gravitation.  This allows simplifying the torsion balance to
something we can set up in the basement.
</p>

<p>
The principle of the torsion balance is extremely simple.  Suspend a
horizontal <em>balance arm</em> from a vertical elastic fibre.  At
each end of the balance arm are masses, much denser than material of
the arm, which respond to the gravitational force.  Once the
suspending fibre, balance arm, and weights are set up and brought into
balance, the downward force of gravitation acts equally on every
component.  The balance arm is then free to rotate without any
hindrance from the Earth's gravity.  It is constrained only by air
friction and the <em>torsional strength</em> of the support fibre—its
resistance to being twisted.  We can then place
<em>test masses</em> near the ends of the balance arm and observe
whether the gravitational attraction between them and the masses on
the arm causes the balance arm to move.  When measuring the
gravitational constant one must precisely calibrate the torsional
strength of the fibre, but to simply observe gravitation we need only
make sure the fibre is sufficiently limp to allow the gravitational
force to overcome its resistance to twisting.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the balance arm is <em>so</em> free to move that once any
force sets it into motion, it oscillates for a long period, spinning
round and round if free or bouncing back and forth off the stops if
constrained.  To avoid this we need to <em>damp</em> the system so
kinetic energy acquired by the bar is more rapidly dissipated.  Well,
nothing's more damp than water, so we add a <em>water brake</em> to
the arm which turns in a fixed reservoir.  The resulting drag as the
balance arm moves is much greater than air resistance and frictional
losses in the fibre, and reduces the oscillations to a tolerable
degree.

</p>

<p>
So here's the sophisticated, high-tech, big science apparatus we'll
use to observe the subtle curvature of spacetime.  An aluminium ladder
serves as the support from which the balance arm is suspended.  Nylon
monofilament fishing line, as <a href="#monofilament">shown above</a>,
is knotted to the middle of the third cross-beam at the back of the
ladder, one above the brace bearing the little white box, about which
<a href="#spycam">more later</a>.  Using a ladder or similar movable support frame allows
setting up the balance in the middle of the room.  This is important
because we <em>are</em> bending spacetime in the basement, in this
case an underground storage room at Fourmilab.  Ground level is about
even with the ceiling of this room, about 45&nbsp;cm above the top of the
ventilation window at the upper right of the picture.  An underground
room is ideal because it minimises temperature variations and
vibration which might perturb the balance arm.  Both walls shown in
this picture are sunk into solid limestone rock—if you set up the
balance near one of these walls, the gravitational field from all that
rock will mask that of the test masses, and the balance will assume a
“gravity gradient” position with one of the ends of the bar pointing
toward the wall, and will budge only slightly under the influence of
the test masses.  With the bar in the middle of the room, the tidal
influence of the mass of the wall and the rock behind it is reduced to
a negligible value.  The pipe on the wall at the right is part of the
serpentine pressurised hot water heating system; it was disabled to
prevent air currents from disrupting the balance arm.  In fact, since
the room is underground, the heating system is rarely engaged, and
only in the depths of winter, never in June.
</p>

<h4>The Balance Arm and Cradle</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appdetail.jpg" width="320" height="297" alt="Detail of balance arm">
The balance arm is a 5 × 5 × 30&nbsp;cm bar of plastic foam, hacked from a
5&nbsp;cm thick slab of packing material with a
<a href="http://www.victorinox.ch/" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">Swiss Army knife</a>.  The
bar is suspended in a cradle made of insulated telephone wire.
The bar is held in its cradle by friction and the indentation made
in the soft plastic foam due to the weights at either end of the
bar; it's easier to adjust the bar for proper alignment this way
than if it were glued to the cradle.
</p>

<h4>The Support Fibre</h4>

<p>
The nylon monofilament that suspends the cradle is barely visible at
the top of the picture—it is fastened by a knot to a loop formed
into the cradle wires by twisting them.  The monofilament is a very
fine “six pound test” (about 3&nbsp;kg capacity) fishing line
manufactured in Japan; a 300 metre spool of it costs about US$9. The
masses which cause the bar to turn when a gravitational force acts
upon them are lead “sinkers” used by fishermen, each
weighing 169 grams.  Two are placed on each end of the balance beam,
giving it a total weight of 676 grams.  Be sure to place the weights
on both ends of the beam simultaneously so it doesn't topple, then
adjust the placement so the beam is horizontal.  Nylon monofilament is
very elastic: when you put the weights on the beam the support line
will stretch and the beam will end up closer to the ground.  You may
have to adjust the attachment of the line to the ladder (or other
support) or, as I did, twist the cradle wires to restore the beam to
the desired height. Finally, when you first hang the beam, it may take
some time to release stresses in the fibre remaining from the
manufacturing process and from its having been rolled onto a spool. 
It's best to let the arm hang for a couple of days, free to turn, to
allow these initial stresses to equalise before attempting any
experiments with gravitation.
<br>
</p>

<h4>The Water Brake</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appclose.jpg" width="320" height="175" alt="Closeup of beam and water brake">
The height of the beam is important because of the need for it to fit
properly with the water brake.  If the beam is allowed to swing
freely, it will be terribly underdamped—once it starts to swing,
only air friction and the minuscule losses in the fibre will act to
stop it.  This causes the beam to bounce around incessantly, masking
the steady influence of gravitation.  The water brake dissipates the
energy of these unwanted oscillations precisely as an automotive shock
absorber does; the flap's motion does work on a viscous fluid, water
in this case, and deposits its energy in heating it.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/brakeflap.jpg" width="200" height="193" alt="Closeup of water brake flap">
The water brake consists of a flap which projects downward from the
balance arm (in this case, a piece of aluminium cut with scissors from
the tray of a “heat and eat” meal, fixed with white glue
into a slot cut into the bottom of the balance beam).  The flap
projects into a reservoir (a tuna fish can) filled with water.  A more
viscous fluid such as salad oil would provide greater damping and less
bouncing than water, but I opted for water since it's less icky to
clean up when the inevitable spill occurs and can be disposed of when
the experiment's done without a visit to the village recycling barrel.
</p>

<p>
If I were rebuilding the balance beam, I would use a longer and
narrower flap and/or a larger and deeper water reservoir.  If
the flap is only slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the
reservoir, you have to be very careful that the flap and reservoir are
centred on the beam.  Otherwise, the flap will touch the edge of
the reservoir and freeze the beam in place, as that frictional force is many
orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational force we wish
the beam to respond to.  The water reservoir can be as large as
you like, as long as it doesn't interfere with placing the
test masses; the larger it is, the less you have to worry
about its being precisely centred.
<br>
</p>

<h4>Test Masses and Supports</h4>

<p>
Blocks of plastic foam support the test masses so their centre of
gravity is at the same height as the masses at the ends of the balance
beam, maximising the attraction.  The foam also keeps the balls from
tending to roll away.  The black rectangle, actually an inverted mouse
pad, serves as a background for the time display superimposed by the
video camera, rendering it more readable when images are reduced in
scale so movies download more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Use the densest objects you can obtain for the ends of the balance
beam and as test masses: lead sinkers, steel balls, plutonium
hemispheres, etc.  Density is important because the gravitational
force varies as the inverse square of the distance <em>between the
centres of mass</em> of two objects.  With a dense substance, the
centre of mass is closer to the surface, so you can get the centres of
mass closer together and enhance the gravitational force.  For
example, consider two pairs of one-kilogram spheres, the first made of
lead (density 11.3&nbsp;g/cm³), the second of pine wood (density about
0.43&nbsp;g/cm³), placed so the surfaces of each pair of spheres are
1&nbsp;cm apart.  A one kilogram lead sphere has a radius of 2.76&nbsp;cm,
so the centres of mass are separated by 1+2.76×2, or 6.52&nbsp;cm.  A
one kilogram sphere of pine has a radius of 8.22&nbsp;cm, by comparison,
so the centres of mass of the two pine spheres are 1+8.22×2 = 17.44&nbsp;cm
apart.  Taking the square of the ratio of these distances shows that
the gravitational force between the lead spheres is more than 7
times that of the pine spheres.  Since attraction is linear by mass but
inverse square in distance, you're better off with a modest mass of
high-density material than a large mass of a substance with lesser density.
</p>

<p>
It's best to use a nonmagnetic material like lead for the weights
on the ends of the balance arm.  The forces we're working with are
so small that if you use, for example, steel ball bearings on the
arms, you may end up accidentally reinventing the compass instead of
detecting the force of gravity.
</p>

<h4 id="spycam">The Spy Cam</h4>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/bsrmon.jpg" width="256" height="267" alt="BSR surveillance monitor">
“So what's the little white box on the back of the
ladder?”, you ask. Okay….  It's a BSR Model 500
surveillance camera which lets me observe the state of the experiment
as it runs.  The Sony camcorder I use to make movies doesn't generate
video output while recording, so I can't use its video feed to monitor
what's happening.  Popping into the room where the experiment's
running is a no-no—air currents from opening and closing the
door, not to mention walking around in the room could seriously
disrupt things.  The BSR camera and accompanying 13&nbsp;cm (diagonal)
monitor allows keeping tabs on what's happening in a non-intrusive
manner.  I made a custom interface of the BSR camera/monitor cable to
Fourmilab's ubiquitous RJ-45 cabling, so I can place two BSR cameras
anywhere on the site and monitor either from anywhere else.  At the
right is an image from the surveillance camera taken at the end of an
experiment, confirming that the balance beam has come to a stop
against the foam block supporting the mass at the top.  The camera is
sensitive to infrared and includes infrared LEDs to illuminate nearby
objects, and has a microphone linked to a speaker in the monitor. 
This makes it ideal for anxious parents who wish to monitor their
sleeping baby; spacetime hackers can use the infrared illumination to
view the balance beam without the thermal disruption of incandescent
lamps or direct sunlight.  The storage room where I ran this
experiment has fluorescent strip lighting on the ceiling, and I
observed no detrimental effects from its being illuminated.  Of
course, if the room you're using is equipped with that low-tech
miracle called a window, you can dispense with all this complexity.

<h2>Gravitation in Action</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/appcam.jpg" width="256" height="192" alt="View showing camera angle used in the movies">
The following time-lapse movies (about 30 seconds per frame) show the
torsion balance responding to the gravitational field generated by two
740 gram competition pétanque balls.  The picture at left shows the
camera angle employed in both movies.  In each, the movie begins with
the bar stationary, in contact with one of the balls or the foam
supporting it.  The balls are then shifted to the opposite corners,
where they attract the lead weights on the ends of the bar.  The bar
then turns, slowly at first and then with increasing speed as it is
accelerated by the gravitational force growing as the inverse square
of the decreasing distance between the masses.  The bar bounces when
it hits the stop on the other end, and finally, after a series of
smaller and smaller bounces as the water brake dissipates its kinetic
energy, comes to rest in contact with the closer ball or support.
This is the lowest energy state, at which the bar will always arrive
at the end of the experiment.

<p>
Pay no attention to the plastic robot ant—she's just curious.
It's a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/hackants13.html" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">long story</a>.
</p>

<h2>A Tide in the Affairs of Man</h2>

<p>
What we've demonstrated by these experiments is the universality of
gravitation; there is nothing special about the Earth that makes
objects fall toward it.  Everything attracts everything else;
the Earth's attraction is greater simply because the Earth is
so much more massive than the objects we encounter in everyday
life.  Only by canceling out the Earth's gravitation by means of
a torsion balance were we able to observe the gravitational
attraction between masses of less than a kilogram.
</p>

<p>
The universality of gravitation means that every object in the
universe is interlinked in a web of mutual attraction; the universe is
transparent to gravitation.  The most distant galaxies exert a pull on
you, as you do upon them—immeasurably tiny to be sure, but
present just the same.  From a practical standpoint, universality
means there's no way to shield your torsion balance from the
gravitational attraction of masses in its vicinity; you can only set
it up sufficiently far from other massive objects so the attraction of
the test masses predominates.  One interesting massive object to
consider is yourself (I use “massive” only in the sense of
"possessing mass", not pejoratively; if you took it that way, perhaps
you should check out my on-line
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/" target="Fourmilab_Bending_Aux">diet book</a>).
</p>

<p>
Using the <a href="#gravcalc">gravitational force calculator</a>
earlier in this document, we can compute the gravitational attraction
between the 338 gram mass at the end of the balance beam and the 740
gram test mass at the 14&nbsp;cm distance when the beam is at the midpoint
between the masses to be 0.000085 dynes.  Now suppose you're crouching
down in order to move the test masses, with your centre of gravity one
metre from the closer test mass, and that you weigh 65&nbsp;kg.  Plugging
these numbers into the calculator shows that your own gravitational
attraction on the nearer end of the beam is 0.000147 dynes, 1.7 times
as great as that of the test mass.  Your actual influence on the
motion of the balance arm is less, however, since what matters is the
<em>difference</em> in force exerted on the masses at the two ends of
the balance arm.  Since your centre of gravity is more distant than
the test masses, the difference is less.
</p>

<p>
Let's work it out.  Assume the centres of gravity of the two masses on
the balance arm are 25&nbsp;cm apart, and that you're crouching so the arm
makes a 45° angle with your centre of gravity, one metre from the
centre of the arm.  The nearer mass is then 17.68&nbsp;cm closer than the
more distant one and the difference in gravitational attraction (or <em>tidal
force</em>) on the two masses is the difference in attraction on a
mass 91.16&nbsp;cm distant and one 108.84&nbsp;cm away.  The calculator gives
the attraction on the near end of the arm as 0.0001764 dynes and the
far end as 0.0001238 dyne, with a difference of 0.0000527 dynes.
Now recall that the force exerted by the test mass was 0.000085 dynes,
only 1.6 times as large, so even taking into account the reduced tidal
influence due to your greater distance, the force you exert on the
balance cannot be neglected.  This makes it essential to remotely monitor
the experiment so your own mass doesn't disrupt it.
</p>

<p>
In practice, air currents due to your motion and resulting from convection
driven by your body's temperature being above room temperature may exert
greater forces on the balance arm than the gravitational field generated
by your mass.  In any case, it's best to let the experiment evolve
on its own, observed from elsewhere.
</p>

<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/archimede.png" width="161" height="250" alt="Archimedes">
<h2><em>Enlightenment Deferred:</em><br>An Historical Speculation</h2>

<p>
Nineteen centuries elapsed between the death of Archimedes in
212&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span> and the publication of
Newton's <em>Principia</em> in 1687.  Given the philosophical
implications of Newton's theory, it's interesting to speculate what
might have happened had Archimedes discovered the universal nature of
gravitation.
</p>

<p>
To do this, he would have had to suspect that attraction was
universal, suggest an experiment to confirm this, and perform that
experiment, with results validating the hypothesis.  Here is
information in Archimedes' possession which might have suggested the
universality of gravitation.
<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>    The Earth is a sphere.  The shape of its shadow on the Moon
	    during a lunar eclipse demonstrated this, and was
	    confirmed by the next item.  The assertion that “the
	    ancients thought the world was flat” is
	    nonsense—Columbus didn't “discover the world
	    was round”: he discovered that his own estimate of
	    the diameter of the world was wrong by a factor of two
	    compared to that available to Archimedes; if he hadn't
	    inadvertently discovered the New World, he and his
	    unfortunate crew would have died of starvation far from
	    the coast of China.</li>

    <li>    The approximate radius of the Earth.  Around
	    250&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span>, by measuring the
	    difference in the angle of sunlight at noon on the June
	    Solstice, which illuminated the bottom of a well at Syene
	    (now Aswan) Egypt near the Tropic of Cancer, with the
	    length of the shadow cast on the same date and time by a
	    vertical pillar in Alexandria, a known distance to the
	    North, Eratosthenes determined the Earth's circumference. 
	    Archimedes corresponded extensively with Eratosthenes and
	    other scholars in Alexandria, and knew of this result. 
	    Archimedes himself calculated the value of π as between 3
	    10/71 and 3 1/7, with a mean value of 3.14185, allowing
	    accurate computation of the Earth's radius from the
	    circumference.</li>

    <li>    The approximate mass of the Earth.  Assuming the Earth
            to have the same density as common rocks such as
            limestone (2.7&nbsp;g/cm³) gives an estimate within a
            factor of two of the correct value.  The actual density of
            the Earth is 5.52&nbsp;g/cm³.</li>

    <li>    How to calculate with very large numbers.  
            In <cite>The Sand Reckoner</cite>
	    (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Ψαμμίτης</span>)
            in 215&nbsp;<span>B.C.</span>, Archimedes
            invented a positional number system which allowed writing
            and calculating with arbitrarily large quantities, which he
            demonstrated by calculating not only how many grains of
            sand would fill the volume of the Earth, but how many
            grains of sand would fill the entire universe (which the
            Greeks estimated to be about one light year in diameter).
            The latter number, about 10<sup>63</sup>, is comfortably
            larger than any of the quantities associated with
            gravitation.</li>
             
    <li>    The existence of electrostatic and magnetic forces which
            appeared to act at a distance.  The inverse square
            behaviour of these forces was not
            known in antiquity, however.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Suppose then that, given these facts, Archimedes embarked upon the
following chain of reasoning.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>    Objects fall, not in a fixed direction, but toward the
            centre of our world.  If they fell in a fixed direction,
            if I dropped a rock down a well in the south of
            Egypt and a well in Syracuse, separated by a
            substantial percentage of the world's circumference,
            one would hit the wall of the well before striking the
            bottom.  This doesn't happen, so objects fall everywhere
            toward the centre of the world.</li>

    <li>    Why does the world attract falling objects?  Is there
            something special which endows it with
            this property?  Yet the world seems to be made of the same
            substances as everything else.  What is the difference
            between the world and a rock?</li>

    <li>    <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="Eureka, eureka!">Εὕρηκα,
    	    εὕρηκα!</span>
            The world is <em>much larger</em> than
            a rock!  Perhaps <em>every object</em> attracts
            <em>every other</em>.  We only feel the world's attraction
            because it is so large.</li>

    <li>    But if this is so, might the celestial bodies be objects
            no different from the world and its inhabitants, and subject
            to the same forces?</li>

    <li>    If attraction is universal, might an artificer
            be able to build a device to show it?</li>

    <li>    Such a device must be isolated from falling down.  Perhaps
            a horizontal balance, free to turn in either direction,
            with weights at each end to be attracted to objects
            in their vicinity….</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Archimedes Apparatus</h3>

<p>
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/figures/archapp.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Balance built from materials available to Archimedes">
It seems plausible, then, given the knowledge at hand and a chain of
inference which, in retrospect at least, appears straightforward, that
Archimedes could have suspected the universality of gravitation.  But
could he have <em>demonstrated it</em>?  Unlike many scholars in
ancient Greece who contented themselves with philosophical arguments,
Archimedes was an intensely practical man, renowned as a military
engineer as well as a mathematician and philosopher.  His laws of the
lever and buoyancy were tested experimentally, and so we should expect
he would subject any inference about gravitation to experimental
confirmation.  Now that we've succeeded in bending spacetime in the
basement with common household materials of the late 20th century,
let's see if the experiment can be done using only materials
Archimedes might have employed.
<br>
</p>

<p>
Let's try to redesign the torsion balance using only materials
available in antiquity.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>The Balance Arm</dt>
    <dd>Instead of plastic foam, we use a strip of pine wood,
	2&nbsp;cm wide, ½&nbsp;cm high, and 30&nbsp;cm long. 
	Notches are cut in the edges of the beam near each end to
	secure the support cradle. For masses at the ends of the
	balance beam we may continue to use lead, which was produced
	in Egypt in the 2nd millennium <span>B.C.</span>
	and in Europe no later than the 6th century <span>B.C.</span> As the discoverer of specific
	gravity, Archimedes would understand the merit in using the
	densest substance available. (Gold, almost twice as dense as
	lead, would be an even better choice.  Perhaps King Hiero of
	Syracuse, grateful to Archimedes for exposing the goldsmith
	who adulterated the gold in his crown with silver, might have
	contributed gold weights for the balance beam, thereby taking
	the first small step down the road to government-funded Big
	Science.  Wishing to remain in the domain of basement science,
	we shall forgo royal subsidies and soldier on with lead.)</dd>

<dt>The Cradle</dt>
    <dd>To support the balance arm, we substitute twine
        made of vegetable fibre for telephone wire.  Actually,
        since copper was known for thousands of years before
        the Greeks, a lightweight copper cradle could have been
        made, but it would have been more work to fabricate
        and has no advantage compared to the twine.  Thread,
        string, and rope were made from a variety of natural
        fibres by all ancient cultures.</dd>

<dt>The Support Fibre</dt>
    <dd>The support fibre is the most difficult component to
        replace with a 3rd century <span>B.C.</span> analogue.  Nylon
        monofilament so closely approaches the ideal of a
        massless support free of torsional resistance that
        doing without it requires experimenting with a variety
        of alternatives and compromising with the shortcomings
        of whatever is selected.  I finally settled on a very thin 
        vegetable fibre support “peeled” from a piece of
        twine by unwinding it.  The fibres you find in rope or
        twine are a variety of lengths—you have to separate them
        and then select individual fibres long enough to support
        the balance arm.  To obtain sufficient strength, I used
        four separate fibres selected from the twine.  If the
        rope or twine has been twisted or braided, you'll have
        to let the fibre hang for an extended period of time (three
        or four days at least) to release its internal stresses.
	
    	<p> In choosing and using any natural fibre support, you have to
        approach the project with a willingness to learn by trial and
        error and a great deal of patience.  Each kind of fibre has
        its own “personality”, and the quirks can take some time to
        understand.  For example, many plant and animal fibres are
        sensitive to moisture—if a summer thunderstorm increases the
        relative humidity from 50% to 99% in the space of an hour,
        your balance arm may start to swing wildly as the fibre
        absorbs moisture from the air.  Further,
        plant fibres tend to tear, both under tensile stress and
        when twisted.  This can cause your balance beam to
        “spontaneously” shift to a different equilibrium point or,
        after having been displaced, return to a different location
        than the starting point.</p>

        <p>Would Archimedes have appreciated the importance of choosing a
        supple and well-behaved support fibre?  I think so.  From the
        radius of the Earth, which he knew, and assuming its density
        to be the same as rocks such as limestone (about half the
        actual density of the Earth), the ratio of the Earth's
        mass to that of whatever test masses were employed could be
        estimated within a factor of two.  Making the simplest
        assumption (which has the additional merit of being correct)
        that attraction is proportional to mass, it is clear that
        the force acting on the masses at the ends of the balance
        arm is minuscule, so a fibre which offers the least possible resistance
        to twisting should be employed.</p></dd>

<dt>Test Masses</dt>
    <dd>Lead or gold (<em>Monarch!  Archimedes is doing natural
        philosophy in the bathtub again!</em>) test masses would be
        preferable, but to show how robust this experiment is I opted
        for a couple of rocks—two kilogram paving stones like those
        which border every highway in Switzerland, where roads are so
        built to last that Julius Cæsar would shake his head in
        admiration.</dd>

<dt>No Water Brake</dt>
    <dd>After experimenting with a variety of vegetable fibres,
        I decided to proceed without a water brake for this
        experiment.  The balance arm is more prone to oscillation,
        but the friction in the support fibre, much greater than
        in synthetic nylon monofilament, damps the oscillations
        adequately.  Allowing the lead weights on the balance arm
        to collide with the stone test masses also dissipates
        substantial energy, further reducing the need for a brake.</dd>

<dt>Unreconciled Residua</dt>
    <dd>I didn't bother to replace the aluminium ladder with a support
        Archimedes might have used.  Any carpenter could fashion a
        more suitable replacement for the ladder.  In fact, a wooden
        saw-horse would have been better for all these experiments,
        but I don't have one and didn't feel like making one from
        various pallets and spare lumber in the High Bay.

    	<p>The concrete floor would also seem strange to Archimedes, but
        it is irrelevant to the experiment.  A smooth stone floor, as
        existed for millennia before, would produce identical results.</p></dd>

</p><h3>The Archimedes Enlightenment?</h3>

<p>
Suppose this had happened.  Consider how easily it could have.
Would such a discovery in Archimedes' time have had an impact
comparable to Newton's or, occurring in a very different social
and intellectual milieu, would it have been regarded as no more than
a curiosity?  How might human history have played out had the
Enlightenment begun 1900 years before Newton?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the first act of the wittiest Irish play of the nineteenth century, Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of Being Earnest,” there is much ado about a shortage of food. The fearsome Aunt Augusta is coming to tea, but we have watched the feckless Algernon eat all the cucumber sandwiches prepared for her by his manservant, Lane. The servant saves the day when the aunt arrives, expecting her sandwiches, by lying: “There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I went down twice.” Algy responds with high emotion: “I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.”</p><p>The play, first performed in 1895, is subtitled “A Trivial Comedy for Serious People,” and this scene is an exquisite exercise in trivialization. Wilde is imagining what a food crisis might look like if it were happening among the English upper classes rather than in his home country. The panic and dread of searching for nourishment and finding none is transformed into an airy nothing: a fake story about the nonexistent dearth of a plant that has relatively little nutritional value, and a charade of great distress. The comedy is so wonderfully weightless as to seem entirely free from the gravitational pull of the history that had preoccupied Wilde’s family, and of a place called Ireland, where the unfortunately unavailable food was not the cucumber but the potato.</p><p>In 1854, when Oscar was born, his father was also engaged in the sublimation of horror. William Wilde, a pioneering surgeon and medical statistician, was the assistant commissioner for the census of Ireland that was conducted in 1851—the one that recorded the disappearance from what was then the richest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced country in the world, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, of some one and a half million people. They had died in, or fled from, what the Irish poor called in their native language An Gorta Mór, the Great Hunger, a catastrophe that was then continuing into its sixth year.</p><p>The year Oscar turned two, William published the results of his immersion in the minutiae of the famine as an official report of the British Parliament. The two-volume work is called the “Tables of Deaths.” Because the census relied on the information given by survivors, and thus did not count many victims whose entire families had been wiped out or had left Ireland as desperate refugees, it actually underestimated the number of lives lost in the Great Hunger.</p><p>William and his assistants were nonetheless able to build solid pillars of data, mass death broken down into discrete numerals to represent sexes, ages, locations, seasons, years, and causes of mortality, which included starvation, scurvy, dysentery, cholera, typhus, and relapsing fever. The tables of deaths occupy hundreds of double-page spreads, laid out with exemplary clarity and precision. They speak of order, regularity, the capacity of Victorian governance for infinite comprehension. The staggering rise in mortality may have demanded extraordinary efforts from the statisticians, but they were equal to their task. They tabulated calamity, confined it safely within vertical and horizontal lines on the pages of sturdily bound official tomes. There are no names of human beings.</p><p>This dutiful, sober, and rigorously unemotional work might also have been titled “The Importance of Being Earnest,” albeit without a hint of Oscar’s playful irony. William’s safely anonymized figures are, in their way, just as weightless as Oscar’s sharply amusing figments. In the introduction to his volume, he uses the remote and clinical language of officialdom: “The labours of the Commissioners in this particular portion of their work greatly exceed those connected with the Tables of Deaths published in the Census of 1841, chiefly owing to the extraordinary increase in the numbers of deaths.” It almost seems as though the reader’s sympathy is being evoked not for the people behind the statistics but for the commissioners who had to work so hard to categorize the circumstances in which those people expired.</p><p>There was also a third kind of language used to cloak the horrors of the famine: an accusatory rage against the British authorities who had failed to prevent it. As it happens, it was another Wilde, Oscar’s mother and William’s wife, Jane, writing as a passionate and incendiary Irish nationalist under the pen name Speranza, who helped to invent that language. In 1847, she published a poem about the famine whose voice is that of the “wretches, famished, scorned,” who warn their oppressors that their deaths will be avenged: “But our whitening bones against ye will rise as witnesses,&nbsp;/&nbsp;From the cabins and the ditches, in their charred, uncoffin’d masses,&nbsp;//&nbsp;A ghastly, spectral army, before the great God we’ll stand,&nbsp;/&nbsp;And arraign ye as our murderers, the spoilers of our land.”</p><p>Jane’s fiercely unforgiving tone was adopted by militant Irish nationalists for whom the famine stood as the ultimate proof of English perfidy. But in her poem, too, the victims appear as an undifferentiated mass. Her avenging army of the undead is in its own way just as distanced as the numbers in her husband’s tables.</p><p>One difficulty in writing about the Great Hunger is scale. There have been, in absolute terms, many deadlier famines, but as Amartya Sen, the eminent Indian scholar of the subject, concluded, in “no other famine in the world [was] the proportion of people killed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as large as in the Irish famines in the 1840s.” The pathogen that caused it was a fungus-like water mold called <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>. Its effect on the potato gives “Rot,” a vigorous and engaging new study of the Irish famine by the historian Padraic&nbsp;X. Scanlan, its title. The blight began to infect the crop across much of western and northern Europe in the summer of 1845. In the Netherlands, about sixty thousand people died in the consequent famine—a terrible loss, but a fraction of the mortality rate in Ireland. It is, oddly, easier to form a mental picture of what it might have been like to witness the Dutch tragedy than to truly convey the magnitude of the suffering in Ireland.</p><p>Another difficulty is that the Great Hunger was not just an Irish event. It bled far beyond its own borders, seeping into the national narratives of the rest of the Anglophone world. Only about one in three people born in Ireland in the early eighteen-thirties would die at home of old age. The other two either were consumed by the famine or joined the exodus in which, between 1845 and 1855, almost 1.5 million sailed to North America and hundreds of thousands to Britain and Australia, making the Irish famine a central episode in the history of those countries, too.</p><p>There has long been something inarticulable about this vast human disaster. In a preface to the monumental “Atlas of the Great Irish Famine,” published in 2012, the former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, observed that “for many years the event was cloaked in silence, its memory for the most part buried or neglected.” The editors of the “Atlas” noted that, until recently, “there was a strange reluctance on the part of historians, historical geographers and others to address” the vast archival records. Right up to the nineteen-nineties, the annual rate of publication of scholarly papers on the subject of the famine never rose above a half-dozen.</p><p>The novelist Colm Tóibín suggested, in 1998, that the problem “may lie in the relationship between catastrophe and analytic narrative. How do you write about the Famine? What tone do you use?” He speculated, moreover, that the Great Hunger had created a great divide even in Irish consciousness. If, he said, he were to write a novel about his home town, Enniscorthy, that took place after the famine years, “I would not have to do much research”—because the place would resemble the one he grew up in. But he would find the years before and during the event itself “difficult to imagine.”</p><p>It is easy to sympathize with this difficulty. The famine set in motion a process of depopulation—even now, after many decades of growth, the island has a million fewer inhabitants than it had in 1841. It disproportionately affected those who spoke the Irish language, creating an Anglophone Ireland. It led ultimately to a radical reform of land ownership, which passed to a new class of Catholic farmers. The profoundly uncomfortable truth is that Ireland started to become modern when its poorest people were wiped out or sent into exile—a reality that is too painful to be faced without deep unease.</p><p>Even before the potato blight, there was a degree of hunger among the Irish rural underclass that seemed like an ugly remnant of a receding past. In 1837, two years after Alexis de Tocqueville published the first volume of “Democracy in America,” his lifelong collaborator, Gustave de Beaumont, went to Ireland, a country the two men had previously visited together. The book de Beaumont produced in 1839, “L’Irlande: Sociale, Politique et Religieuse,” was a grim companion piece to his friend’s largely optimistic vision of the future that was taking shape on the far side of the Atlantic. De Beaumont, a grandson by marriage of the Marquis de Lafayette, understood that, while the United States his ancestor had helped to create was a vigorous outgrowth of the British political traditions he and de Tocqueville so admired, Ireland was their poisoned fruit. America, he wrote, was “the land where destitution is the exception,” Ireland “the country where misery is the common rule.”</p><p>The problem was not that the land was barren: Scanlan records that, “in 1846, 3.3 million acres were planted with grain, and Irish farms raised more than 2.5 million cattle, 2.2 million sheep and 600,000 pigs.” But almost none of this food was available for consumption by the people who produced it. It was intended primarily for export to the burgeoning industrial cities of England. Thus, even Irish farmers who held ten or more acres and who would therefore have been regarded as well off, ate meat only at Christmas. “If an Irish family slaughtered their own pig, they would sell even the intestines and other offal,” Scanlan writes. He quotes the testimony of a farmer to a parliamentary commission, in 1836, that “he knew other leaseholders who had not eaten even an egg in six months. ‘We sell them now,’ he explained.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Scanlan notes, fewer than four thousand people owned nearly eighty per cent of Irish land. Most of them were Protestant descendants of the English and Scottish settlers who benefitted from the wholesale expropriation of land from Catholic owners in the seventeenth century. Many lived part or all of the year in England. They rented their lands to farmers, a large majority of whom were Catholics. Scanlan points out that, whereas in England a tenant farmer might pay between a sixth and a quarter of the value of his crops in rent, in Ireland “rent often equalled the entire value of a farm’s saleable produce.”</p><p>Landlords could extract these high rents because their tenants, in turn, made money by subletting little parcels of land, often as small as a quarter of an acre, to laborers who had none of their own. The whole system was possible only because of the potato. Most years, those micro farms could produce enough of this wonder crop to keep a family alive. It provided enough calories to sustain hardworking people and also delivered the necessary minerals and vitamins. By the eighteen-forties, as many as 2.7 million people (more than a quarter of the entire population) were surviving on potatoes they grew in tiny fields that encroached on ever more marginal land, clinging to bogs and the sides of stony mountains.</p><p>De Beaumont, noting that these laboring families had to endure a “life of fasting” when their store of potatoes ran out in the summer or when the crop was scanty, grasped the precarity of this situation. One of his most striking insights was that the exceptionally cruel nature of Irish poverty made it seem incredible to outsiders: “The word <em>famine</em>, employed to describe the misery of Ireland, appeared to them a metaphorical expression for great distress, and not the exact term to express the state of human beings <em>really</em> famishing and perishing from sheer want of food.” It was, he suggested, particularly in England that “persons were pleased to keep themselves in this state of doubt.”</p><p>Yet de Beaumont himself felt he could not describe what he saw on his travels. Words were not adequate to the task. Adopting a disembodied third-person voice, he asked, “Shall he relate what he saw?—No. There are misfortunes so far beyond the pale of humanity, that human language has no words to represent them.” If he were to “recall the sinister impressions produced” by the contrasts between the wealth of the Irish landowning aristocracy and the destitution of the rural poor, “he feels that the pen would fall from his hands, and that he would not have the courage to complete the task which he has undertaken to accomplish.”</p><p>This feeling that Irish reality was at once incredible and indescribable became almost a standard response to the Great Hunger. In one of the first widely circulated eyewitness accounts, an open letter written to the Duke of Wellington by Nicholas Cummins, a magistrate in Cork, Cummins struggled to articulate what he saw when he entered a settlement outside Skibbereen, in December, 1846. “I was surprised to find the wretched hamlet apparently deserted,” he wrote. “I entered some of the hovels to ascertain the cause, and the scenes which presented themselves were such as no pen or tongue can convey the slightest idea of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is impossible to go through the details.”</p><p>Asenath Nicholson, a woman from Vermont who began a one-person relief operation in Ireland, in 1847, recorded a moment when a man invited her to inspect a cabin where a mother, a father, and their two children lay dead: “The man called, begging me to look in. I did not, and could not endure, as the famine progressed, such sights&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were too real, and these realities became a dread.”</p><p>The Great Hunger was excessively real to many European and North American observers because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was happening not in India or China but in what was supposed to be the Empire’s heartland. Its victims were white, Christian, and (notionally, at least) subjects of the United Kingdom with the same rights as the inhabitants of Hampstead Heath or Tunbridge Wells.</p><p>It was also an affront to the liberal Victorian certainty that progress was linear and inevitable. The British Prime Minister Lord John Russell told the House of Commons, in January, 1847, that “the famine is such as has not been known in modern times; indeed, I should say it is like a famine of the thirteenth century acting upon the population of the nineteenth.” What the British ruling class could not grasp was that the Irish famine was a phenomenon of “modern times,” the product, as Scanlan convincingly argues, of a particularly virulent form of exploitative capitalism that left millions of people utterly exposed to the instability of short-term rental of land, to fluctuating food markets, and to wages driven downward by the pressure of too many laborers looking for too little work.</p><p>Militant Irish nationalism would follow Jane Wilde in seeing the famine as mass murder and thus as what would later be categorized as a genocide. Under pressure from Irish Americans, this even became an official doctrine in New York, where a state law signed in 1996 by then governor George Pataki required schools to portray the famine “as a human rights violation akin to genocide, slavery and the Holocaust.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Pataki announced that “history teaches us the Great Irish Hunger was not the result of a massive failure of the Irish potato crop but rather was the result of a deliberate campaign by the British to deny the Irish people the food they needed to survive.” But this is not what history teaches us. A much more accurate conclusion is the one drawn by the Irish historian Peter Gray, who wrote that there was “not a policy of deliberate genocide” on the part of the British. Instead, Gray argued, the great failure of the British government was ideological—“a dogmatic refusal to recognise that measures intended to ‘encourage industry, [and] to do battle with sloth’&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were based on false premises.” The British did not cause the potatoes to rot in the ground. They did launch, by the standards of the mid-nineteenth century, very large-scale efforts to keep people alive, importing grain from America, setting up soup kitchens, and establishing programs of public works to employ those who were starving. But they were blinded by prejudice, ignorance, and a fanatical devotion to two orthodoxies that are very much alive in our own time: their belief that poverty arises from the moral failings of the poor and their faith in the so-called free market. The famine was so devastating because, while the mold was rotting the potatoes, mainstream British opinion was infected with a cognitive blight.</p><p>It was obvious to outsiders that the root of Ireland’s misery was what de Beaumont characterized as a “bad aristocracy”—the monopolization of land by a small élite that had no cultural or religious affinity with its tenantry and little sense of obligation to develop sustainable agriculture. But an English ruling class in which many leading politicians were themselves owners of vast estates in Ireland was unable to acknowledge this inconvenient truth. Who, if not the landlord system, could be to blame? It must be the Irish poor themselves. As Scanlan puts it, “Intensive monoculture made Irish potatoes vulnerable to blight. The solutions proposed to mitigate famine were themselves the product of a kind of intellectual and political monoculture. Solutions were unimaginable outside the market that fuelled the crisis to begin with.”</p><p>In a neatly circular argument, the conditions that had been forced on the laboring class became proof of its moral backwardness. It was relatively easy to plant and harvest potatoes—therefore, those who did so had clearly chosen the easy life. “Ireland, through this lens,” Scanlan writes, “was a kind of living fossil within the United Kingdom, a country where the majority of the poor were inert and indolent, unwilling and unable to exert themselves for wages and content to rely on potatoes for subsistence.” Or, as William Carleton, the first major writer in the English language to have sprung from the Irish Catholic peasantry, put it with withering sarcasm, the Irish poor had not learned “to starve in an enlightened manner”: “Political economy had not then taught the people how to be poor upon the most scientific principles.”</p><p>Civilized people ate meat—England’s unofficial national anthem was “The Roast Beef of Old England.” The desire to consume animal flesh stimulated effort and enterprise. Thus, the destruction of the potato crop, however terrible and regrettable its short-term effects, would teach the Irish to crave meat instead and become proper capitalist wage earners so that they could afford to buy it. “When the Celts once cease to be potatophagi,” wrote the editors of the London <em>Times</em>, “they must become carnivorous.” Let them, as Marie Antoinette did not say, eat steak.</p><p>This arrant nonsense obscured the reality that the Irish had no particular love of potatoes. Their historically varied diet, based on oats, milk, and butter, had been reduced by economic oppression to one tuber. Nor were they reluctant to work for wages. Many travelled long distances to earn money as seasonal migrant laborers on farms in England and Scotland, and Irish immigrants were integrating themselves into the capitalist money economy in the mills of Massachusetts and the factories of New York.</p><p>Yet, as stupid as this bigotry undoubtedly was, it was also deadly. The idea of Irish indolence fused with a quasi-religious faith in the laws of the market to shape the British response to the famine. In its first full year, 1846, Robert Peel’s Conservative government imported huge quantities of corn, known in Europe as maize, from America to feed the starving. The government insisted that the corn be sold rather than given away (free food would merely reinforce Irish indolence), and those who received it had little idea at first how to cook it. Nonetheless, the plan was reasonably effective in keeping people alive.</p><p>The general assumption, however, was that the blight of 1845 was a one-off event. At the end of July, 1846, it became crushingly obvious that the blight had spread even wider, wiping out more than ninety per cent of the new crop. By then, most of the poor tenants had sold whatever goods they had, leaving nothing with which to stave off starvation. Fishermen on the coasts had pawned their nets for money to buy maize. The terrible year that followed is still remembered in Ireland as Black ’47, though the famine would, in fact, last until 1852.</p><p>In London, the realization that this was not a temporary crisis coincided with the coming to power of a party with a deep ideological commitment to free trade. The Liberals, under Lord John Russell, were determined that what they saw as an illegitimate intervention in the free market should not be repeated. They moved away from importing corn and created instead an immense program of public works to employ starving people—for them, as for the Conservatives, it was axiomatic that the moral fibre of the Irish could not be improved by giving them something for nothing. Wages were designed to be lower than the already meagre earnings of manual workers so that the labor market would not be upset.</p><p>The result was the grotesque spectacle of people increasingly debilitated by starvation and disease doing hard physical labor for wages that were not sufficient to keep their families alive. Meanwhile, many of the same people were evicted from their houses as landowners used the crisis to clear off these human encumbrances and free their fields for more profitable pasturage. Exposure joined hunger and sickness to complete the task of mass killing.</p><p>“Rot” provides a convincing answer to Tóibín’s question of what tone you should use in writing about the famine. Scanlan’s voice is cool but never cold. The book is richly underpinned by research in contemporary sources and firmly rooted in historical scholarship, and it does not fall into the trap of oversimplifying the famine as deliberate genocide. But a proper sense of outrage runs between the lines and carries a consistently high voltage.</p><p>Above all, “Rot” reminds us that the Great Hunger was a very modern event, and one shaped by a mind-set that is now again in the ascendant. The poor are the authors of their own misery. The warning signs of impending environmental disaster can be ignored. Gross inequalities are natural, and God-given. The market must be obeyed at all costs. There is only one thing about the Irish famine that now seems truly anachronistic—millions of refugees were saved because other countries took them in. That, at least, would not happen now.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A British tourist on a four-month backpacking trip around North America has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the US for 10 days after trying to enter the country via the Canadian border.</p><p>Rebecca Burke, 28, a graphic artist from Monmouthshire, was trying to cross into the state of Washington when she was refused entry.</p><p>She was planning to stay with a host family where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation and was told she should have applied for a working visa, instead of a tourist visa.</p><p>She had previously been staying with a host family in Portland, Oregon, under a similar arrangement after spending some time sightseeing in New York City, where she first arrived from the UK at the start of the year.</p><p>“She’s basically living with a family, doing a little bit of housework, taking the dog for a walk, whatever it is. She’s been a part of a family,” her father, Paul Burke, a consultant in the steel industry, said.</p><p>Canadian authorities told her to go back to the US and fill in new paperwork before returning to cross into Canada.</p><p>However, when she tried to re-enter the US she was handcuffed and put in a cell before being taken to Tacoma Northwest detention facility in Washington state.</p><p>“She’s been there for over 10 days now,” Paul Burke said. “We haven’t got any clear timeline for her release. I really can’t understand why someone, a tourist, would be incarcerated and locked up.”</p><p>“It’s like we’re living in a nightmare we can’t wake up from,” he added. “It’s like we’re having an out-of-body experience. We’re watching ourselves go through the motions of life, but we’re not really doing it, we’re not really there.”</p><p>His daughter wants to leave the country and fly back to the UK, he said, but he feared the immigration crackdown in the US meant there could be a long delay before her case was dealt with.</p><p>“She’s in this orange prison outfit,” he said. “She just feels so isolated and desperate, you can imagine, she’s saying, ‘I want to come home’.”</p><p>She is safe, he said, but living “in horrendous conditions” and had not had access to legal representation. He was taking comfort from the fact that the other women at the facility, many of whom have been incarcerated for months or even years while fighting deportation, had “all been really nice to Becky,” Burke said.</p><p>Burke said he and his wife, Andrea, had naturally had some worries about their daughter travelling, but thought the US and Canada would be one of the safest places for her to go as a solo traveller, and her plan to stay with host families provided further reassurance.</p><p>“The only thing really we were concerned with, in general, was our little girl was going off for four months as a solo traveller,” he said.</p><p>“We knew for a long time in advance of Trump being inaugurated what his plans were for immigration, but that didn’t enter our minds with respect to Becky,” he added. “She was going on a four-month backpacking tourist trip. We wouldn’t even think of her as an immigrant.</p><p>“We were horrified about what was planned for immigrants and illegal aliens in the US, just like many people around the world were,” he added. “But why would we put that together with Becky making this trip? We now know better, because we believe it’s had a direct impact.”</p><p>Burke said he wanted to warn other families who may have children travelling to the US. “The key thing is check and double-check and triple-check the visa requirements, especially if it’s an extended visit like Becky’s was, rather than just a couple of weeks’ holiday,” he said. “I really don’t want anyone else to go through this.”</p><p>The family’s local MP Catherine Fookes, the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, said: “I am deeply concerned about my constituent’s welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family.</p><div><p>“Her family is desperate to bring her home, and I share their urgency in seeking a resolution.<strong></strong>“Since being made aware of the case, my team have been in regular contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and other relevant authorities to press for urgent action. We have relayed the family’s request for voluntary departure and continue to push for clear answers on the next steps to get her home as soon as possible.</p><p>
 “My team and I will continue doing everything in our power to secure a swift resolution and will not stop working until my constituent is safely reunited with her family.”</p></div><p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting a British national detained in the USA and are in contact with the local authorities.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why a new book on reinforcement learning?</h2><a id="user-content-why-a-new-book-on-reinforcement-learning" aria-label="Permalink: Why a new book on reinforcement learning?" href="#why-a-new-book-on-reinforcement-learning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This book aims to provide a <strong>mathematical but friendly</strong> introduction to the fundamental concepts, basic problems, and classic algorithms in reinforcement learning. Some essential features of this book are highlighted as follows.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The book introduces reinforcement learning from a mathematical point of view. Hopefully, readers will not only know the procedure of an algorithm but also understand why it was designed in the first place and why it works effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The depth of the mathematics is carefully controlled to an adequate level. The mathematics is also presented in a carefully designed manner to ensure that the book is friendly to read. Readers can selectively read the materials presented in gray boxes according to their interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Many illustrative examples are given to help readers better understand the topics. All the examples in this book are based on a grid world task, which is easy to understand and helpful for illustrating concepts and algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When introducing an algorithm, the book aims to separate its core idea from complications that may be distracting. In this way, readers can better grasp the core idea of an algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The contents of the book are coherently organized. Each chapter is built based on the preceding chapter and lays a necessary foundation for the subsequent one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9789819739431" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/raw/main/springerBookCover.png" alt="Book cover"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contents</h2><a id="user-content-contents" aria-label="Permalink: Contents" href="#contents"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The topics addressed in the book are shown in the figure below. This book contains ten chapters, which can be classified into two parts: the first part is about basic tools, and the second part is about algorithms. The ten chapters are highly correlated. In general, it is necessary to study the earlier chapters first before the later ones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Figure_chapterMap.png"><img src="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/raw/main/Figure_chapterMap.png" alt="The map of this book"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Readership</h2><a id="user-content-readership" aria-label="Permalink: Readership" href="#readership"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This book is designed for senior undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in reinforcement learning.</p>
<p dir="auto">It does not require readers to have any background in reinforcement learning because it starts by introducing the most basic concepts. If the reader already has some background in reinforcement learning, I believe the book can help them understand some topics more deeply or provide different perspectives.</p>
<p dir="auto">This book, however, requires the reader to have some knowledge of probability theory and linear algebra. Some basics of the required mathematics are also included in the appendix of this book.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lecture videos</h2><a id="user-content-lecture-videos" aria-label="Permalink: Lecture videos" href="#lecture-videos"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By combining the book with my lecture videos, I believe you can study better.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>(Dec 2024) 4,000+ stars</strong>
This textbook has received 4,000+ stars! Glad that it is helpful to many readers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Oct 2024) Book cover</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The design of the book cover is finished. The book will be officially published by Springer early next year. It has been published by Tsinghua University Press.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Sep 2024) Minor update before printing by Springer</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I revised some very minor places that readers may hardly notice. It is supposed to be the final version before printing by Springer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Aug 2024) 3000 Stars and more code</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The book has received 3000+ stars, which is a great achievement to me. Thanks to everyone. Hope it really helped you.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also received more code implementation from enthusiastic readers. For example, this <a href="https://github.com/SupermanCaozh/The_Coding_Foundation_in_Reinforcement_Learning">GitHub page</a> provided Python implementation of almost all examples in my book. On the one hand, I am very glad to see that. On the other hand, I am a little worried that my students in my offline class may use the code to do their homework:-). Overall, I am happy because it indicates that the book and open course are really helpful to the readers; Otherwise, they would not bother to develop the code by themselves:-)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Jun 2024) Minor update before printing</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This is the fourth version of the book draft. It is supposed to be the final one before the book is officially published. Specifically, when proofreading the book manuscript, I detected some very minor issues. Together with some reported by enthusiastic readers, they have been revised in this version.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Apr 2024) Code for the Grid-World Environment</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">We added the code for the grid-world environment in my book. Interested readers can develop and test their own algorithms in this environment. Both Python and MATLAB versions are provided.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that we do not provide the code of all the algorithms involved in the book. That is because they are the homework for the students in offline teaching: the students need to develop their own algorithms using the provided environment. Nevertheless, there are third-party implementations of some algorithms. Interested readers can check the links on the home page of the book.</p>
<p dir="auto">I need to thank my PhD students, Yize Mi and Jianan Li, who are also the Teaching Assistants of my offline teaching. They contributed greatly to the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">You are welcome to provide any feedback about the code such as bugs if detected.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Mar 2024) 2K stars</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The book has received 2K stars. I also received many positive evaluations of the book from many readers. Very glad that it can be helpful.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Mar 2024) Minor update</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The third version of the draft of the book is online now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compared to the second version, the third version is improved in the sense that some minor typos have been corrected. Here, I would like to thank the readers who sent me their feedback.</p>

          <p>HP, along with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">other printer brands</a>, is infamous for issuing firmware updates that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/">brick already-purchased printers</a> that have tried to use third-party ink. In a new form of frustration, HP is now being accused of issuing a firmware update that broke customers’ laser printers—even though the devices are loaded with HP-brand toner.</p>
<p>The firmware update in question is version 20250209, which HP issued on March 4 for its LaserJet MFP M232-M237&nbsp;models. Per HP, the update includes “security updates,” a “regulatory requirement update,” “general improvements and bug fixes,” and fixes for <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html">IPP Everywhere</a>. Looking back to older updates’ fixes and changes, which the new update includes, doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary. The older updates mention things like “fixed print quality to ensure borders are not cropped for certain document types,” and “improved firmware update and cartridge rejection experiences.” But there’s no mention of changes to how the printers use or read toner.</p>
<p>However, users have been <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Error-Code-11/td-p/9333546">reporting</a> sudden problems using HP-brand toner in their M232–M237 series printers since their devices updated to 20250209. Users on HP’s support forum say they see Error Code 11 and the hardware’s toner light flashing when trying to print. Some said they’ve cleaned the contacts and reinstalled their toner but still can't print.</p>
<p>“Insanely frustrating because it's my small business printer and just stopped working out of nowhere[,] and I even replaced the tone[r,] which was a $60 expense,” a forum user <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Laserjet-m234DW-Error-11/td-p/9332462">wrote</a> on March 8.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/">https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43323755">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-amp-original-style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--60);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--60)">
<p>Last year I created a fun little experiment where I asked a bunch of LLMs to rank 97 hackernews users using their comment history based on whether they would be good candidates for the role of “software engineer at google”. (yes yes, seems silly I know, you can read <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/10/18/are-llms-any-good-at-ranking-people/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/12/19/how-confident-are-llms-ranking-people-part-ii/">part 2</a> but they are long).</p>



<p>In it, I had a persistent problem of bias. I had arranged the comments in an interleaved fashion like this: </p>



<blockquote>
<pre>Person one: What makes you think that?<br>Person two: When I was a lad I remember stories of when...<br>Person one: Great post! I particularly like the things and stuff<br>...</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>The users aren’t responding to each other, that’s just how I arranged the comments in the prompt. I didn’t give the model the users names for obvious reasons. Then the model says who it prefers, and using many pairwise comparisons we can come up with a ranking (similar to the way chess rankings work). However, I noticed an odd bias. Even though which user was named “Person one” in the prompt was random, the model still preferred whoever got the name “Person one” slightly more often than not (or for some models, preferred “Person Two”). This is dumb. There is no reason to prefer them for being called “Person One”. It should be considering things like, would they be a good colleague etc. In the end, I evaluated all my models across all 8000 games each played, including some dummy models like one that always chooses “Person One” and one that alphabetically ranks the users. I then compared the ratio of “Person One” as it converged across the games played. Here’s what that looks like:</p>



<figure><amp-img width="535" height="683" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png 535w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" data-hero="" i-amphtml-ssr="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><i-amphtml-sizer slot="i-amphtml-svc"></i-amphtml-sizer><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" alt="" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png 535w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></amp-img></figure>



<p>The models <em>should</em> hover around that white dashed line. But they don’t. This isn’t just bad luck. The two tailed p-value is vanishingly small after 8000 games for this sort of result (except for the alphabetical model, understandably). </p>



<p>This was very frustrating and I tried a number things to reduce the bias (messing around with prompt formulation etc), but couldn’t get it much better. No matter. I pressed on and found interesting results anyways and wrote about them. The bias wasn’t that bad and, since the order was randomized, it becomes random error, diluted by a larger and larger number of games.</p>



<p>That bring us to today and as-yet unfinished work where I’m asking people (real ones, I promise) to rank TTS voices based on attractiveness (you can help collect data for the study <a href="https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/">here</a> yay!). </p>



<p>What better way to do ranking than pairwise comparisons, I thought?</p>



<p>Guess what.</p>



<p>Go on. Guess.</p>



<figure><amp-img width="845" height="552" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 845w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-300x196.png 300w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img decoding="async" width="845" height="552" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 845w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-300x196.png 300w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9IjU1MiIgd2lkdGg9Ijg0NSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="></amp-img></figure>



<p>Surprising? Ok, maybe not in retrospect. <em>So what</em> if humans who can’t distinguish two TTS voices have a bias toward the sample presented to them on the right hand side of the screen. Indeed, “preferring stuff on the right hand side” has even been studied [1]. </p>



<p>And, I’ll admit, the TTS voices do sometimes sound pretty similar.</p>



<p>Still, to me, this is a little bit cathartic because a) I was quite frustrated by the LLM bias and b) some commentators also said this invalidates the results, which <em>hurt </em>a little. Of course, this bias is still <em>bad</em>, and highlights the need to have things like large sample sizes and randomization. I won’t go much further and get too abstract here, but if there’s another, broader takeaway you could have, it’s that a lot of the safeguards and policy we have to manage humans own unreliability may serve us well in managing the unreliability of AI systems too. Maybe. We’ll have to see.</p>



<p>Oh, and if you think I’m <em>wrong</em>, humans can’t be worse than AI, go ahead and submit your completely objective, unbiased assessments of TTS voices here: <a href="https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/">https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/</a></p>

<p>Google has gotten its first taste of remedies that Donald Trump’s Department of Justice plans to pursue to break up the tech giant’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">monopoly in search</a>. In the first filing since Trump allies took over the department, government lawyers backed off a key proposal submitted by the Biden DOJ. The government won't ask the court to force Google to sell off its AI investments, and the way it intends to handle Android is changing. However, the most serious penalty is intact—Google's popular Chrome browser is still on the chopping block.</p>
<p>"Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins," the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1184.0_1.pdf">DOJ filing</a> says. To that end, the government maintains that Chrome must go if the playing field is to be made level again.</p>
<p>The DOJ is asking the court to force Google to promptly and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/">fully divest itself of Chrome</a>, along with any data or other assets required for its continued operation. It is essentially aiming to take the Chrome user base—consisting of some 3.4 billion people—away from Google and hand it to a competitor. The government will vet any potential buyers to ensure the sale does not pose a national security threat. During the term of the judgment, Google would not be allowed to release any new browsers. However, it may continue to contribute to the open source Chromium project.</p>

<p>This filing includes some changes from the initial remedy filings of 2024, but more changes could be coming. The case is currently under the purview of Omeed Assefi, who is leading the DOJ's Antitrust Division until Trump nominee Gail Slater gets Senate confirmation. Slater expressed support for increased scrutiny of Big Tech in her confirmation hearings, suggesting she could seek to turn the screws on Google after taking charge.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Google's remedy position is light-years away from the Justice Department's. "DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court’s decision and would harm America’s consumers, economy, and national security," said a Google spokesperson.</p>
<p>As expected, Google did not change its <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/">suggested remedies</a> in the case, handing the court a proposal identical to the one it filed months ago. Google says it's open to changing the way search placement deals work for browsers and Android devices, plus it would accept some additional regulatory oversight to ensure compliance. However, staffing changes at the DOJ and Google's recent meetings have not done much to change the government's desire to carve up the company.</p>

<h2>Government to monitor AI and Android</h2>
<p>There are two notable changes in the government's position regarding Android and AI investment. Neither area will completely escape the government's grasp under the proposed remedies, but Google won't have to sell anything immediately.</p>
<p>This case centered on search and did not initially hinge on artificial intelligence. However, things have changed in the years since this case began. Last year, Judge Mehta allowed the government to seek limits on Google's AI investments on the basis that AI was going to be a core part of web search going forward. Google has unintentionally proven that point just recently when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">debuted its new AI Mode in search</a>, which replaces the list of 10 blue links with an AI-derived answer. However, the DOJ is no longer making this request.</p>
<p>This is a small but important win for Google, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-investment-in-anthropic-by-another-1-billion/">pumping billions into firms like Anthropic</a> as the AI market takes shape. The company claimed that limiting its activities in this area would weaken US leadership in AI. It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-cites-national-security-as-it-urges-doj-to-drop-demand-for-breakup/">made this case</a> to the newly restaffed DOJ in recent weeks, and it apparently had an impact. The DOJ no longer seeks to force Google to divest from competing AI firms. Instead, Google would have to notify the government before making new AI investments.</p>

<p>Previously, the government offered Google the option to sell Android in lieu of making any changes to how the platform operates. However, the divestment option is no longer on the table, not that Google was anxious to rid itself of such a key piece of its business. Now, the Justice Department wants the court to impose a raft of restrictions on how Google can promote its products on Android.</p>
<p>The government proposes that Google should be prohibited from making any of its search or generative AI products mandatory on Android, for example, by limiting access to AI Core or other APIs. Similarly, Google would be prevented from pressuring its partners to use Google search or AI services over the competition. If none of this is effective at breaking up Google's monopoly, or if Google attempts to ignore the remedies, the government could force Google to sell Android. In this instance, the government would have the final say on who buys the operating system.</p>
<p>With this round of filings in the rearview mirror, the next phase of the case is expected to get underway in the coming weeks. After the final ruling, Google will most likely seek to have the remedies delayed while it appeals, as it did in the Play Store trial versus Epic last year. While Google may be relieved that the DOJ is relaxing its stance on AI investments, the company is still not happy with the way the case has gone. It still hopes to have the ruling overturned on appeal, thus rendering the discussion of remedies moot.</p>

<h2>
Ruminations on the Psychology and Aesthetics of Coding
</h2>
<h2>
By Charles Petzold
</h2>
<h2>
A Talk Delivered at the NYC .NET Developer’s Group,<br>October 20, 2005
</h2>

<p>
<b><i>Abstract:</i></b>
Visual Studio can be one of the programmer's best friends, 
but over the years it has become increasingly pushy, domineering, 
and suffering from unsettling control issues. 
Should we just surrender to Visual Studio's insistence on writing our code for us? 
Or is Visual Studio sapping our programming intelligence rather than augmenting it? 
This talk dissects the code generated by Visual Studio; 
analyzes the appalling programming practices it perpetuates; 
rhapsodizes about the joys, frustrations, and satisfactions of unassisted coding; 
and speculates about the radical changes that Avalon will bring. 
</p>

<p>
I don’t speak to user groups or developer groups very often, partially because of a bad experience I had a number of years ago. In 1991, the Boston Computer Society invited me to speak on the subject of Windows programming. Since I had written a book on Windows programming — the 2nd edition of <i>Programming Windows</i> had been published just the previous year — I figured I didn’t really need to talk about that. Anybody who wanted to learn Windows programming could simply buy the book and read it in the privacy of their homes.
</p>
<p>
Instead, I decided to talk about something that people could not read about in my book. This was a subject that interested me at the time, which was how Microsoft first developed Windows, and how Microsoft and IBM then got involved in the development of OS/2, how Microsoft had convinced IBM to go graphical in the windowing environment, and how IBM decided they wanted to develop an entirely new API, and then how the success of Windows led to the eventual split between Microsoft and IBM.
</p>
<p>
Well, people went berserk. I suppose they had been expecting me to tell them everything they needed to know about Windows programming in the space of a few hours, and that’s certainly not what I was interested in doing.
</p>
<p>
That was a very traumatic experience for me, and since that time, I have been reticent about speaking before groups like this. This is a .NET developer’s group. I have written four books on .NET programming — the fourth is due out on November 2nd — and anybody who wants to read them is free to do so. I am now in the process of writing a book on the Windows Presentation Foundation (formerly code-named Avalon) but couldn’t at this time really tell you a whole lot that’s useful.
</p>
So when Bill and Andrew and Stephen asked me to speak here, I was initially reticent until I was told — and I quote from Andrew’s email — “we'd happily go to great lengths to accommodate you and your topic preference, even if your preference is no particular topic at all.” This evening I do have a topic, although it’s a rather odd one, and I hope nobody will go berserk.


<h3>
Computers in the Movies
</h3>
<p>
I recently re-watched what I believe to be the first Hollywood movie to deal with computers in a major way. This is the movie <i>Desk Set</i>.  It’s 1957, and Katherine Hepburn supervises three other women in the research department of the Federal Broadcasting Company. Whenever somebody has a question requiring research, they call up on the phone, and Hepburn and her team get to work on the answer.
</p>
<p>
Enter Spencer Tracy, a self-described Methods Engineer and the inventor of an “electronic brain” called the Electro-Magnetic Memory and Research Arithmetical Calculator or EMERAC—“Emmy” for short.
</p>
<p>
Well, naturally, everybody in the research department assumes they’re going to be fired, just like what happened in payroll when an “electronic brain” was installed there. Although it’s expressed here as a nervous humor, this plot line reflected a real anxiety at the time. Of course, workers didn’t really think that an entire computer was necessary to do their job. No, people instead joked that they were going to be replaced by a single <i>button</i>.
</p>
<p>
Emmy the “electronic brain” turns out to be quite a sophisticated computer. It understands natural language questions typed from a keyboard, and prints the answers on a teletypewriter. Of course, the computer can’t match the cool professionalism of Katherine Hepburn and her staff, and when confronted with a tough question, it reacts in ways we’re all familiar with from subsequent movie computers: It makes funny noises, smoke starts pouring out, and it begins spitting Hollerith cards all over the office. 
</p>
<p>
It must have been funny at the time, even for people who knew that computers don’t break down that way in real life. I have been programming pretty steadily for about 30 years now, and only once have I seen a computer fail in a way I’d classify as “interesting.”<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the “electronic brain” installed in payroll starts printing pink slips for everybody in the company. As we all know, once computers take over, they no longer need humans. But, as you may anticipate, the human staff is then allowed to come to the rescue and display its superiority over the machine.
</p>
<p>
Because <i>Desk Set</i> is a Hollywood romantic comedy, and perhaps because IBM supplied all the hardware for the film, human and machine are reconciled at the end. The computer’s role is clarified. It exists merely to <i>assist</i> the humans in their research needs. 
</p>
<p>
The idea of computers trying to “take over” their human creators has been replayed in dozens of movies ever since. Sometimes the computers take a leap into a level of intelligence and consciousness their designers had not anticipated, or perhaps they suffer the computer version of a “nervous breakdown,” or they’re simply too damn <i>logical</i> for their own good. Sometimes the computer goes so haywire that it does something that no sane human would ever dream of doing — such as starting a war.
</p>
<p>
Just a few examples<sup>2</sup>:  <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> (1968). Good computer; bad choices. <i>Colossus: the Forbin Project</i> (1970). American super-computer demands to be connected to Russian super-computer, with expected consequences. As the movie’s tag line put it, “We built a super computer with a mind of its own and now we must fight it for the world!”<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>
Ira Levin’s novel <i>This Perfect Day</i> from 1970 isn’t a movie of course, but it should be. A computer runs the world and a few brave souls conspire to defeat it, only to discover… well, this is an Ira Levin novel so it’s best that you be a little surprised. <i>This Perfect Day</i>. Check it out.
</p>
<p>
Many of the human vs. computer themes show up in <i>WarGames</i> (1983), and even this past summer, Hollywood squeezed out a little cinematic turd called <i>Stealth</i>, which my favorite newspaper <i>The Onion</i> hailed as “the most chilling look at artificial intelligence run amok since <i>Short Circuit 2</i>.”<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
Of course, it’s easy today to see how ridiculous this stuff is. For example, we have erected a vast network of computers around the world, and it has yet to exhibit the slightest degree of intrinsic intelligence.  It’s fairly easy to imagine the whole thing collapsing, or getting infected with some virus, but not so easy to imagine it deviously turning against us. What the Internet seems to do best is make commonly available enormously vast resources of <i>mis</i>-information that we never knew existed.
</p>
<p>
In thinking about how computers and people interact, I find some older, pre-computer, movies to be more relevant — the ones where people who work with machines and automated processes become subservient to the <i>rhythm</i> of the machine. I’m thinking of Fritz Lang’s <i>Metropolis</i> (1927), where an odd feedback system requires people to run the machines by responding to their commands. The opening scenes of Charlie Chaplin’s <i>Modern Times</i> (1936) are still very funny, and let’s not forget the famous episode of <i>I Love Lucy</i> called “Job Switching” (1952), the one where Lucy gets a job at the candy factory.
</p>
<p>
Although these scenes are often played for laughs, they seem to reflect our fear of being forced into a dehumanizing relationship with a machine that imposes its jerky digital rhythm on our normally analogue souls. These encounters leave an imprint on both minds and our bodies. In <i>I Am a Fugitive from a Slave Gang</i> (1932), a convict who is set free from the chain gang walks away still shuffling his feet as if his ankles are still bound with the chains. Similarly, four years later in <i>Modern Times</i>, Chaplin walks home from work with his arms still twitching in the rhythm of the machine.
</p>
<h3>
Technological Addictions
</h3>
<p>
When using our computers, something a little different happens. Of course, we may get repetitive stress disorders from the keyboard or mouse, but software doesn’t affect our bodies as much as our minds, and even then in subtle ways. 
</p>
<p>
Some observers of our digital lives have noticed the way in which certain applications cause a user to think in very rigid prescribed ways, and these are not good. One of the biggest offenders, of course, is PowerPoint. Start putting what you want to communicate in PowerPoint slides, and everything you want to say is ordered into half a dozen bullet items. 
</p>
<p>
The critiques of technology we see in the movies seem to use metaphors of power or slavery. I think there’s a more proper metaphor for our relationships with much of modern consumer technology, however, and that metaphor is <i>addiction</i>.
</p>
<p>
It is very common for us to say about a piece of consumer technology that “we didn’t know how much we needed it until we had it,” and much of this technology seems targeted not to satisfy a particular need, but to get us hooked on something else we never knew we needed; not to make our lives better, but to tempt us with another designer drug. “I can’t live without my ___________” and you can fill in the blank. This week, I think, it’s the video iPod.
</p>
<p>
Even useful items like cell phones seem to fit this model. Was the cell phone wasn’t invented to fill a particular need? I’m not sure. It probably wasn’t the case of someone sitting on M14 bus thinking “I’m bored. I wish I could call up my friends from this bus.” It was partially invented because it was <i>possible</i> to do it, and there was a trust that people eventually would not be able to live without them. Once we get the taste, we’re hooked.
</p>
<p>
I often wish that email had never been invented, but there’s just no way I can get rid of it. So, day after day, several times a day, I dutifully delete 99% of the emails I receive, and when I’m not able to get at my email for a few days, I’ll leave the machine at home running to pick it up every 10 minutes so I don’t overflow some capacity somewhere, and just the other day I caught myself wondering who will clean out my Inbox after I’m dead. 
</p>
<p>
We see computer technologies going through a life cycle where they turn from beneficial to evil. I recently installed something from a Microsoft site that dutifully gave me instructions about clicking the yellow bar at the top of Internet Explorer — the yellow bar that is now protecting us from popups and other bad stuff coming through — so I could bypass the normal protection against the installation of Active X controls. The instructions go on to tell you to ignore all the warnings Windows will then provide about installing this Active X control, because this particular one, unlike all the others, actually does a good thing.
</p>
<h3>
The Nuisance of Information at Your Fingertips
</h3>
<p>
Sometime in the early 1990s, Microsoft came up with the slogan “Information at your Fingertips.” It sounds pretty good in theory, and today we basically have a whole lot of information at our fingertips, what with Google and Wikipedia and the Internet Movie Database and other useful sites.
</p>
<p>
But information too has become an addiction. I don’t know what it’s like at your house, but we can’t even watch a simple rerun of <i>Friends</i> without one of us saying “Who’s that actress playing Joey’s girlfriend? She looks familiar.” We then click the Info button on the remote to get the title of the particular episode, and then go to tvtome.com or epguides.com to learn the identity of the actress, and then perhaps to Internet Movie Database to see a list of the movies, TV shows, and guest appearances she’s done, and perhaps for one of the movies we’ll say “I always wanted to see that movie” and so we add it to our NetFlix queue. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, we can do all this without actually leaving the couch. Why else would we need WiFi in a 400 square foot studio apartment?
</p>
<p>
Now I know that five or ten years from now we’ll be able to perform this entire operation entirely from the cable remote, which may actually be a computer remote, including pausing the episode of <i>Friends</i> to download the movie in which the actress playing Joey’s girlfriend appears, and watch it on demand, and then go back to the episode of <i>Friends</i> we were watching if we so desire. And I might be more thrilled at this prospect if I thought it would make us better, happier, nicer human beings. But that’s not immediately obvious to me.
</p>
<p>
And I sincerely hope that in five or ten years from now, we’re not still watching reruns of <i>Friends</i>.
</p>
<p>
Although we here in this room are computer users and we are thus stuck with the same annoyances, distractions, and addictions as all computer users, we are also developers and programmers, and for us, the computing experience <i>should</i> be intrinsically different. Programming is the most empowering thing we can do on a computer, and that’s what we do. We write the code that makes the whole world sing.
</p>
<p>
And yet, if all of us in this room are .NET developers, then we are also undoubtedly Visual Studio users. I suspect some of us have been playing around with betas of Visual Studio 2005, and awaiting its official release at DevConnections in Las Vegas in a few weeks. 
</p>
<p>
Life without Visual Studio is unimaginable, and yet, no less than PowerPoint, Visual Studio causes us to do our jobs in various predefined ways, and I, for one, would be much happier if Visual Studio did much less than what it does. Certain features in Visual Studio are supposed to make us more productive, and yet for me, they seem to denigrate and degrade the programming experience.
</p>
<h3>
API Proliferation
</h3>
<p>
Twenty years ago, in November 1985, Windows 1.0 debuted with approximately 400 documented function calls.<sup>5</sup> Ten years later, Windows 95 had well over a thousand.<sup>6</sup> 
</p><p>
Today we are ready for the official release of the .NET Framework 2.0. Tabulating only MSCORLIB.DLL and those assemblies that begin with word System, we have over 5,000 public classes that include over 45,000 public methods and 15,000 public properties, not counting those methods and properties that are inherited and not overridden. A book that simply listed the names, return values, and arguments of these methods and properties, one per line, would be about a thousand pages long.
</p>
<p>
If you wrote each of those 60,000 properties and methods on a 3-by-5 index card with a little description of what it did, you’d have a stack that totaled 40 feet.<sup>7</sup> These 60,000 cards, laid out end to end — the five inch end, not the three inch end — can encircle Central Park (almost), and I hear this will actually be a public art project next summer.
</p>
<p>
Can any one programmer master 60,000 methods and properties? I think not. One solution, of course, is specialization. I myself have specialized. This evening I hope no one will ask me questions about web forms or ASP .NET or SQL Server because those aren’t my specialty. I do Windows Forms, and my language is C#.
</p>
<h3>
IntelliSense
</h3>
<p>
Visual Studio has attempted to alleviate the problem of class, method, and property proliferation with a feature called IntelliSense. IntelliSense indeed puts information at our fingertips, if you think of your fingertips figuratively as that place on the screen where the keyboard caret is.
</p>
<p>
Like other addictive technologies, I have a love/hate relationship with IntelliSense, and the more I despise it, the more I use it, and the more I use it, the more disgusted I am at how addicted I’ve gotten, and the more addicted I get, the more I wish it had never been invented.
</p>
<p>
Just in case you’ve been out of the trenches for awhile, IntelliSense is a culmination of some past attempts at code completion technologies. If you type an object name and a period, for example, you’ll get a little scrollable dropdown menu with a list of all the public methods, properties, and events for that class, and when you choose a method name and type a left parenthesis, you’ll get the various overloads with arguments, and a little tooltip describing what the method does.
</p>
<p>
IntelliSense is considered by some to be the most important programming innovation since caffeine. It works especially well with .NET because Visual Studio can use reflection to obtain all the information it needs from the actual DLLs you’ve specified as references.
</p>
<p>
In fact, IntelliSense has become the first warning sign that you haven’t properly included a DLL reference or a <i>using</i> directive at the top of your code. You start typing and IntelliSense comes up with nothing. You know immediately something is wrong.
</p>
<p>
And yet, IntelliSense is also dictating the way we program.
</p>
<p>
For example, for many years programmers have debated whether it’s best to code in a top-down manner, where you basically start with the overall structure of the program and then eventually code the more detailed routines at the bottom; or, alternatively, the bottom-up approach, where you start with the low-level functions and then proceed upwards. Some languages, such as classical Pascal, basically impose a bottom-up approach, but other languages do not.
</p>
<p>
Well, the debate is now over. In order to get IntelliSense to work correctly, bottom-up programming is best. IntelliSense wants every class, every method, every property, every field, every method parameter, every local variable properly defined before you refer to it. If that’s not the case, then IntelliSense will try to correct what you’re typing by using something that <i>has</i> been defined, and which is probably just plain wrong.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose you’re typing some code and you decide you need a variable named <i>id</i>, and instead of defining it first, you start typing a statement that begins with <i>id</i> and a space. I always type a space between my variable and the equals sign. Because <i>id</i> is not defined anywhere, IntelliSense will find something that begins with those two letters that is syntactically correct in accordance with the references, namespaces, and context of your code. In my particular case, IntelliSense decided that I really wanted to define a variable of interface type <i>IDataGridColumnStyleEditingNotificationService</i>, an interface I’ve never had occasion to use.
</p>
<p>
On the plus side, if you really need to define an object of type <i>IDataGridColumnStyleEditingNotificationService</i>, all you need do is type <i>id</i> and a space.
</p>
<p>
If that’s wrong, you can eliminate IntelliSense’s proposed code and go back to what you originally typed with the Undo key combination Ctrl-Z. I wish I could slap its hand and say “No,” but Ctrl-Z is the only thing that works. Who could ever have guess that Ctrl-Z would become one of the most important keystrokes in using modern Windows applications? Ctrl-Z works in Microsoft Word as well, when Word is overly aggressive about fixing your typing.
</p>
<p>
But the implication here is staggering. To get IntelliSense to work right, not only must you code in a bottom-up structure, but within each method or property, you must also write you code linearly from beginning to end — just as if you were using that old DOS line editor, EDLIN. You must define all variables before you use them. No more skipping around in your code. 
</p>
<p>
It’s not that IntelliSense is teaching us to program like a machine; it’s just that IntelliSense would be much happier if we did.
</p>
<p>
And I think it’s making us dumber. Instead of finding out exactly the method I need, or instead of trying to remember an elusive property name, I find myself scrolling through the possibilities that IntelliSense provides, looking for a familiar name, or at least something that seems like it might do the job. 
</p>
<p>
I don’t need to remember <i>anything</i> any more. IntelliSense will remember it for me. Besides, I justify to myself, I may not want those 60,000 methods and properties cluttering up my mind. My overall mental health will undoubtedly be better without them, but at the same time I’m prevented from ever achieving a fluid coding style because the coding is not coming entirely from my head. My coding has become a constant dialog with IntelliSense.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t think IntelliSense is helping us become better programmers. The real objective is for us to become <i>faster</i> programmers, which also means that it’s cheapening our labor.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I could always just turn it off. 
</p>
<p>
And go cold turkey? I don’t think so!
</p>
<p>
IntelliSense is a technology that is inevitable. If Microsoft hadn’t done it, somebody else would have. Human beings have never been inclined to refrain from pursuing certain technologies because they may have unfortunate repercussions.
</p>
<h3>
Generated Code
</h3>
<p>
Not only does Visual Studio try to complete code we’re typing, but for many years now, Visual Studio has wanted to generate code for us. If we select a new project type of Windows Application, for example, and give it a name and location on a local drive, Visual Studio generates sufficient code so that this project is immediately compilable and runable.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, we have been persuaded that this is the proper way to program. I don’t know why. Personally, I find starting a program with an empty source code file to be very enjoyable. I like typing the preliminaries and then the <i>main</i> function or the <i>Main</i> method. The time when I can really use some help is <i>not</i> when I’m starting a program, but when I’m trying to <i>finish</i> it.  Where is Visual Studio then?
</p>
<p>
Let’s go into Visual Studio 2005 in our imaginations and create a C# Windows Forms program — a project of type Windows Application — and let’s examine the code.
</p>
<p>
First, we see that Visual Studio has hooked up our program to a bunch of dynamic link libraries it thinks we will need. It has created references not only to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies that are required of any non-trivial Windows Forms application, but also System.Data, System.Deployment, and System.Xml, regardless whether your program needs these DLLs or not. These extra references don’t do any real harm except if someone else examines the program — perhaps to make some changes after the original programmer has moved on — and assumes that the application <i>requires</i> these references. Now there’s confusion, because references to DLLs exist that the program really doesn’t need.
</p>
<p>
Among other files, Visual Studio creates a file named Form1.cs that it graciously allows you the programmer to modify. This is the source code file where the event handlers go for controls on the main form. We see a bunch of <i>using</i> directives at the top with the namespaces the program needs. The normal namespaces for Windows Forms programs are <i>System</i>, <i>System.Drawing</i>, and <i>System.Windows.Forms</i>, but Visual Studio also includes <i>System.Collections.Generic</i>, <i>System.ComponentModel</i>, <i>System.Data</i>, and <i>System.Text</i>, some of which are useful to be sure, but if the program doesn’t actually use any of the classes in these namespaces, they’re just distracting noise.
</p>
<p>
Visual Studio also encloses all the code it generates in a namespace that is given the same name as the project name. Of course, I understand entirely the value of having a namespace for DLLs, but why have a namespace for applications? I have given this much thought, and I can’t figure it out.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been talking about code, but when you create a new Windows Forms project, Visual Studio doesn’t put any of the source code files in front of your face. Instead, it puts a design view of a form which you are then expected to start interactively populating with controls. 
</p>
<p>
Visual Studio also creates a file named Form1.Designer.cs, and in some beta versions of Visual Studio 2005, this file wasn’t even listed among the project files by default. This is the file in which Visual Studio inserts generated code when you design your form. Visual Studio really doesn’t want you messing around with this file, and for good reason. Visual Studio is expecting this generated code to be in a certain format, and if you mess with it, it may not be able to read it back in the next time you open the project.
</p>
<h3>
The Origins of the Designer
</h3>
<p>
Of course, the interactive design of forms is one of the major features of Visual Studio. It may help to contrast the Visual Studio designer with the way Windows programming was done 20 years ago when Windows 1.0 was first released — 20 years ago next month, to be precise. 
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to bore everybody with war stories about Windows 1.0 programming, but basically you did most of your programming outside of Windows on the DOS command line. You edited your source code with your favorite editor — mine was a word processor of the era called WordStar — and then you’d compile and link on the command line, and run your application in Windows by typing Win followed by the name of your EXE file. You’d test out your program in Windows and then exit Windows back to DOS and reload the source code in your editor.
</p>
<p>
It was not possible to do much program development inside Windows except to run the Windows-based Icon Editor that helped you make icons, cursors, and small bitmaps.
</p>
<p>
To define the layout of menus and dialog boxes, you created a text resource script. In this file you’d type templates for the menus and dialog boxes in a particular defined format. For dialog boxes, you’d basically list the controls you wanted in the dialog box. The syntax wasn’t too bad, for example, the keyword BUTTON followed by the text that appeared in the button, the button’s location in the dialog box, and its width and height. Because Windows could run under systems of different display resolutions, these sizes and locations were in a special dialog box coordinate system, where horizontal units were equivalent to ¼ the width of the default system font, and vertical units were 1/8 the height of the font.
</p>
<p>
These resource scripts were actually considered an enormous time saver. If you didn’t have the resource script, you’d have to create the menu and dialog boxes in code, and that was a particularly onerous job. And the syntax of the resource script was so clean and simple that it remains to this day the most concise way of defining menus and dialog boxes that I have ever seen.
</p>
<p>
There was only one little problem:  All those controls in your dialog boxes had to be positioned and sized correctly with numbers you had to figure out. Sometimes it would help to start with a piece of graph paper and do a hand mockup of the dialog box. Otherwise, it was pretty much a matter of trial and error, back and forth, load up Windows, invoke the dialog box, see how crappy it looked, exit Windows, reload the resource script, and eventually you’d fine tune those sizes and locations until it looked right. 
</p>
<p>
Sometime in 1986 or so, beta versions of a Dialog Editor emerged from Microsoft. I found out about it by lurking on a bulletin board called the Windows Developers Roundtable on the information service GEnie, the General Electric Network for Information Exchange. The Dialog Editor was a Windows program that let you interactively design your dialog boxes by moving controls around, and would then output the dialog template in the correct format. I eventually wrote an article about it for the very first issue of <i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i> in October 1986. The article had the title “Latest Dialog Editor Speeds Windows Application Development”.
</p>
<p>
But for the Windows programs that I later wrote for <i>MSJ</i>, and for those in the first edition of <i>Programming Windows</i>, I couldn’t use this Dialog Editor. I couldn’t use it for the simple reason that the output of the Dialog Editor was <i>ugly</i>. 
</p>
<p>
Let me explain what I mean by that, and why it’s a problem.
</p>
<p>
People who write code for publication have some extra burdens that most programmers need not worry about. The code we write has to be concise but not to the point where it’s obscure. It should be nicely formatted and easy to read. There should be plenty of white space. It should be airy. It can’t have superfluous variables or unused functions. It has to compile without warning messages.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, code published in books is limited to line lengths of about 80 characters, sometimes a little more, sometimes less. Magazines sometimes impose even more severe limits, depending how much power the art department has in the political structure of the magazine staff. <i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i> was an interesting case. Although <i>M SJ</i> was originally supposed to be strictly a Windows-programming magazine — they later chickened out and made it for DOS programming as well — it was laid out entirely on Macs and the art department ruled. Art people love very narrow text columns, and I remember <i>MSJ</i> going to extra-narrow columns at about the same time that the OS/2 Presentation Manager was introducing function calls like <i>GpiQueryModelTransformMatrix</i>.
</p>
<p>
Under these criteria, the Dialog Editor generated ugly and unusable output. It didn’t even generate BUTTON, LABEL, and LISTBOX statements like a normal human being. Instead, it spit out everything as general-purpose CONTROL statements followed by class names. These lines had lots of superfluous information. All the parameters were included, although many of them were default values. These lines were way over 80 characters. 
</p>
<p>
People have to read this stuff, and the Dialog Editor output was unreadable. Moreover, if somebody is trying to reproduce the dialog box on their own, it doesn’t make any sense to show the output from the Dialog Editor.
</p>
<p>
When I was working on the first edition of <i>Programming Windows</i> in 1987, sometimes I’d use the Dialog Editor and then manually convert the output to something a human being might write. But mostly I just got skilled at designing dialog boxes by hand.
</p>
<p>
Of course, a Dialog Editor is certainly a piece of “inevitable technology.” It’s so obvious that it must be created, and in principle, I can’t summon up any arguments against it. It’s what it evolved into that really bothers me.
</p>
<h3>
Interactive Design
</h3>
<p>
Most of the really innovative interactive design stuff found its first expressions in the Windows-based versions of Visual Basic, and here’s where I started becoming nervous about where Windows programming was headed. Not only could you move a button onto your form, and interactively position and size it just the way you wanted, but if you clicked on the button, Visual Basic would generate an event handler for you and let you type in the code.
</p>
<p>
This bothered me because Visual Basic was treating a program not as a complete coherent document, but as little snippets of code attached to visual objects. That’s not what a program is. That’s not what the compiler sees. How did one then get a sense of the complete program? It baffled me.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the interactive design stuff found its way into development with C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Classes, and there, I truly believe, code generation was used to hide a lot of really hairy MFC support that <i>nobody</i> wanted to talk about. 
</p>
<p>
For an author who writes programming books, all this stuff presents a quandary. How do you write a programming tutorial? Do you focus on using Visual Studio to develop applications? Frankly, I found it very hard to write sentences like “Now drag the button object from the tool box to your dialog box” and still feel like I was teaching programming. I never wrote about C++ and MFC, partially because MFC seemed like a light wrapper on the Windows API and barely object oriented at all. I continued to revise later editions of <i>Programming Windows</i> under the assumption that its readers were programmers like me who preferred to write their own code from scratch.
</p>
<h3>
Bye, Bye, Resource Script
</h3>
<p>
I first started looking at beta .NET 1.0 and Windows Forms in the summer of 2000, and it was clearly more object oriented than MFC could ever be. I liked it. I was also intrigued that the resource script had entirely disappeared. You created and assembled controls on dialog boxes — now subsumed under the more global term of “forms” — right there in your code. Of course, even in Windows 1.0, you could create controls in code, and the first edition of <i>Programming Windows</i> has some examples. But it just wasn’t very pleasant, because every control creation involved a call to the 11-argument <i>CreateWindow</i> function. But creating controls in code in Windows Forms was a snap.
</p>
<p>
What’s nice about creating and manipulating controls in code is that you’re creating and manipulating them in code. Suppose you want a column of ten equally-spaced buttons of the same size displaying <i>Color</i> names. In a program, you can actually store those ten <i>Color</i> values in one place. It’s called an <i>array</i>. There’s also an excellent way to create and position these ten buttons. It’s called a <i>for</i> loop. This is programming.
</p>
<p>
But Visual Studio doesn’t want you to use arrays or loops to create and position these buttons. It wants you to use the designer, and it wants to generate the code for you and hide it away where you can’t see it.
</p>
<p>
Almost twenty years after the first Dialog Editor, Visual Studio is now the culprit that generates ugly code and warns you not to mess with it.
</p>
<p>
If you do try to read this code, it’s not that easy because every class and structure is preceded by a full namespace:
</p>
<pre>System.Windows.Forms.Button button1 = new System.Windows.Forms.Button();
</pre>
<p>
Of course, we know why Visual Studio needs to do this. In theory, it’s possible for you to add to the Visual Studio toolbox another control named <i>Button</i> from another DLL with another namespace, and there must be a way to differentiate them. 
</p>
<p>
As Visual Studio is generating code based on the controls you select, it gives the controls standard names, such as <i>button1</i>, <i>button2</i>, <i>button3</i>, <i>label1</i>, <i>label2</i>, <i>label3</i>, <i>textBox1</i>, <i>textBox2</i>, <i>textBox3</i>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Visual Studio lets you change that variable name. You change the <i>Name</i> property of the control, and that becomes not only the <i>Name</i> property of the button object, but also the button variable name.
</p>
<p>
Do programmers actually do this? I’m sure some do, but I’m also sure many do not. How do I know? Take a look at some of the sample code that comes out of Microsoft. There you’ll see <i>button1</i>, <i>button2</i>, <i>button3</i>, <i>label1</i>, <i>label2</i>, <i>label3</i>, etc. Any yet, everyone agrees that one of the most important elements of writing self-documenting code is giving your variables and objects meaningful names. 
</p>
<p>
If Visual Studio really wanted you to write good code, every time you dragged a control onto your form, an annoying dialog would pop up saying “Type in a meaningful name for this control.” But Visual Studio is not interested in having you write good code. It wants you to write code fast.
</p>
<p>
While I’m on the subject of variable names, I should say something good about Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2005 has a totally splendid variable-renaming facility. You know how sometimes you really want to rename a variable to be more in tune with its actual function in the program but you’re afraid to because of possible side effects of search-and-replace? Well, this new variable-renaming avoids all that, and it will also tell you if you’re renaming something to an existing name. I hope people take advantage of this to rename their controls to something other than the Visual Studio defaults.
</p>
<h3>
Overused Fields
</h3>
<p>
Another problem with Visual Studio’s generated code is that every control is made a field of the class in which it is created. This is a hideous programming practice, and it really bothers me that programmers may be looking at the code generated by Visual Studio to learn proper programming technique, and this is what they see.
</p>
<p>
In the pre-object oriented days of C programming, we had local variables and global variables, variables inside of functions, and variables outside of functions. One objective of good programming in C was in keeping the number of global variables to a minimum. Because any global variable could be modified by any function, it was easier to get the sense of a program if there simply weren’t very many of them — if functions communicated among themselves strictly through arguments and return values.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, however, C programmers got a little, let’s say, <i>sleepy</i>, and made a lot of variables global that didn’t really need to be, because it was just easier that way. Rather than add an extra argument to a function, why not just store it as a global?
</p>
<p>
Global variables are basically gone in object-oriented programming, except that fields are now the <i>new</i> global variables, and they can be abused just as badly. 
</p>
<p>
One basic principle of object-oriented programming is hiding data. This is generally meant to apply between classes. Classes shouldn’t expose everything they have. They should have as small a public interface as possible, and other classes should know only what they need to know. But the principle of data hiding is just as important <i>inside</i> a class. Methods should have limited access to the data that other methods are using. In general, variables should be made local to a method unless there’s a specific reason why they need to be accessed from some other method.
</p>
<p>
When you create an object using the <i>new</i> operator, the amount of storage allocated from the heap for the object must be sufficient to accommodate all the fields defined in the class you’re creating the object from and all the ancestor classes. The fields basically define the size of the object in memory. I know that we’re long past the point of worrying about every byte of storage, but when you look at the fields you’ve defined in your class, you should be asking yourself: Does all this stuff really need to be stored with each object in the heap? Or have I successfully restricted the fields to that information necessary to maintain the object?
</p>
<p>
Someone told me that he likes to store objects as fields because he’s afraid the .NET garbage collector will snag everything that’s not nailed down into a proper field definition. After years of defining very few fields in .NET, I can tell you this is not a problem. The .NET garbage collector will only delete objects that are no longer referenced anywhere in the program. If you can still access an object in some way, it is not eligible for garbage collection.
</p>
<p>
In theory, no child control created as part of a form needs to be stored as a field because the parent — generally a form — stores all its child controls in the collection named <i>Controls</i>, and you can reference each control by indexing the <i>Controls</i> property using and integer or the text <i>Name</i> property you assigned to it when creating the control. And here again you’re in much better shape if your controls have meaningful names and not <i>button1</i>, <i>button2</i>, <i>button3</i>, <i>label1</i>, <i>label2</i>, <i>label3</i>…
</p>
<p>
Whether a particular object is defined as a field or a local variable is something that we as programmers should be thinking about with every object we create. A label that has the same text during the entire duration of the form can easily be local. For a label whose text is set from an event handler of some other control, it’s probably most convenient to store as a field. 
</p>
<p>
It’s as simple as that. But Visual Studio doesn’t want you to think about that. Visual Studio wants everything stored as a field.
</p>
<h3>
Visual Studio Demystified
</h3>
<p>
Even if Visual Studio generated immaculate code, there would still be a problem. As Visual Studio is generating code, it is also erecting walls between that code and the programmer. Visual Studio is implying that this is the only way you can write a modern Windows or web program because there are certain aspects of modern programming that only it knows about. And Visual Studio adds to this impression by including boilerplate code that contains stuff that has never really been adequately discussed in the tutorials or documentation that Microsoft provides.
</p>
<p>
It becomes imperative to me, as a teacher of Windows Forms programming and Avalon programming, to deliberately go in the opposite direction. I feel I need to demystify what Visual Studio is doing and demonstrate how you can develop these applications by writing your own code, and even, if you want, compiling this code on the command line totally outside of Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
In my Windows Forms books, I tell the reader not to choose Windows Application when starting a new Windows Forms project, but to choose the Empty Project option instead. The Empty Project doesn’t create anything except a project file. All references and all code has to be explicitly added.  
</p>
<p>
Am I performing a service by showing programmers how to write code in a way that is diametrically opposed to the features built into the tool that they’re using? I don’t know. Maybe this is wrong, but I can’t see any alternative.
</p>
<h3>
Dynamic Layout
</h3>
<p>
I’ve been talking about the release of Visual Studio 2005 next month. Along with Visual Studio is also the .NET Framework 2.0, with some significant enhancements to Windows Forms, including a very strong commitment to “dynamic layout” (sometimes also known as “automatic layout”). Dynamic layout is also a significant part of the design philosophy of Avalon.
</p>
<p>
Dynamic layout is an example how Web standards have now influenced standalone client Windows programming. We have learned from HTML that it’s not necessary to put every single object on the screen with precise pixel coordinates. We have learned that it’s possible for a layout manager built into our browsers to flow text and graphics down the page, or to organize content in a table or frames. HTML has also provided a good case study in illustrating some ways <i>not</i> to implement these things, so these ways can be avoided.
</p>
<p>
Basically, when using dynamic layout in Windows Forms, the actual location and size of controls isn’t decided until run time. When the form is displayed, the layout manager takes into account the size of the controls, the size of the container, and lays out the controls appropriately.
</p>
Dynamic layout under Windows has come to be seen as necessary for a couple reasons. First, we are getting closer to a time when 200 dpi and 300 dpi displays will become available. It would be very nice if Windows programs written today didn’t crumble into incoherence on these displays.

<p>
Also, as controls have become more complex, they have become more difficult to use in predefined layouts. How big should a particular control be? Perhaps that can only be known at run time. It’s much better if the program does not impose a size on the control, but rather that the control determines its own size at run time, and to have that size taken into account during layout.
</p>
<p>
Now obviously this is more complex, because a layout manager has to interrogate the controls and determine how large they want to be, and then attempt to accommodate them all within an area of screen real estate. 
</p>
<p>
But this is built into the classes of Windows Forms 2.0. The <i>FlowLayoutPanel</i> and the <i>TableLayoutPanel</i> together with the <i>SplitContainer</i> and the <i>Dock</i> property provide a full array of tools for dynamic layout. You can basically design entire forms and dialog boxes largely without using pixel coordinates or sizes. There are some exceptions, to be sure. You’ll probably want to set widths of combo boxes to specific sizes based on average character widths. But for the most part, this stuff works. In my new book I have a whole chapter on dynamic layout that concludes with code that duplicates the standard <i>FontDialog</i> with a <i>TableLayoutPanel</i>, and I come pretty close.
</p>
<p>
We now have the proper tools in the form of classes to render the Visual Studio forms designer obsolete. Unfortunately, nobody has told Visual Studio about this new age. Visual Studio definitely supports layout based on <i>FlowLayoutPanel</i> and <i>TableLayoutPanel</i>, of course, but you have to know about these things and explicitly put them on your form before you start populating the form with controls. Inexplicably, Visual Studio still stores pixel coordinates and sizes in your source code even though they are irrelevant in these cases
</p>
<h3>
Avalon and XAML
</h3>
<p>
Some people have assumed that with the planned introduction of Avalon next year — now properly called the Windows Presentation Foundation — that Windows Forms is already obsolete. But the more I look at Avalon, the less I believe that to be the case. Certainly Avalon has the power and breadth to support large applications, and a graphics system that will bring 3D capability to the average programmer. 
</p>
<p>
But Avalon is currently missing some amenities we take for granted, such as standard File Open, File Close, and Font dialogs, a split panel, and it has nothing approaching the new and totally astonishing <i>DataGridView</i> control in Windows Forms 2.0. Whether these things get into Avalon before it’s released, I don’t know. But Windows Forms may still be the best bet for quickly constructing forms-based applications for in-house corporate use. 
</p>
<p>
Avalon, as I mentioned, also has a strong commitment to dynamic layout. In Windows Forms, doing layout with pixels locations and sizes is basically the default. You need to specifically create a <i>FlowLayoutPanel</i> or <i>TableLayoutPanel</i> to dispense with pixels.
</p>
<p>
In Avalon, working with pixel coordinates is not the default. For each window or page, you have to pick a particular layout model, and the one where you specify pixels — a descendent of <i>Panel</i> named <i>Canvas</i> — is certainly being deemphasized as a choice. And even if you do go with <i>Canvas</i>, you’re not really working in units of pixels. You’re using something oddly called “device-independent pixels,” which is a coordinate system based on units of 1/96th of an inch, which is a one-to-one map with today’s default video display settings, but lets us achieve device independence with non-default settings.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not the half of it. When you put together your windows and dialogs in Avalon, you can do it either in code or in XML. Microsoft has come up with an entire page description language called XAML, the Extensible Application Markup Language, pronounced “zammel.” In a proper Avalon program, the XAML is supposed to contain all the layout stuff, and the programming code ties it all together, mostly with event handlers.
</p>
<p>
I was at first skeptical of this invention called XAML. I had liked the Windows Forms approach of doing everything in code, and now something like a resource script — but obviously much more sophisticated — was being reintroduced into Windows programming. I gradually became persuaded, however, and now I like it.
</p>
<p>
One thing that the Avalon architects are trying to do is let programmers and designers work around common files. Not every software project requires people who design the screens and dialog boxes, but large ones do, and in the past the designers did mockups with graphical tools and used bitmaps to show the programmers what they wanted. With Avalon they can use design tools that create and edit XAML, and the programmers can use this same XAML as source code in creating the executables.
</p>
<p>
Another reason I was persuaded in this: As we get more into dynamic layout, a form becomes a hierarchy of different types of panels and controls. You might start with a <i>DockPanel</i> and put menus and toolbars at the top of a window and a status bar at the bottom, and then inside you put a <i>Grid</i> panel, and then perhaps within some of the cells of the grid you have a <i>StackPanel</i>, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
This hierarchy of panels and controls has an analogue in the XAML as a nesting of elements. If the XAML is indented in a standard way, you can see the hierarchy right there in the file.
</p>
<p>
I also have much less of a problem with a visual designer generating XAML than generating C# code. As we’ve seen, Visual Studio doesn’t even want you to look at the C# code it generates, and for good reason. But XML is different. It was a design point of XML that it can be created and edited by either human or machine, and it shouldn’t matter at all which is which. As long as the XML is left in a syntactically and semantically correct state — and there is no middle ground — it shouldn’t matter who edits it and in what order. If I’m going to be putting XAML in a book, it doesn’t matter if I wrote it or Visual Studio wrote it, because it should basically be the same. And, for someone who wants to recreate the layout of panels and controls in Visual Studio, the XAML serves as a clear guide in illustrating the hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Will there be a designer built into Visual Studio that works entirely with XAML and lets me write my own C# code? I don’t know yet. It certainly makes sense.
</p>
<p>
I am also hoping that developers eventually achieve a good balance between XAML and code. The Avalon architects are so proud of XAML — and rightfully so — that they tend to use it for everything. I saw an Avalon clock application that somebody at Microsoft wrote. It actually set the time once in code and used Avalon animation entirely implemented in XAML to keep the clock going. It was very, very cool, except that the 12 tick marks of the clock were implemented in 12 virtually identical chunks of XAML. The only thing that would have appalled me more was seeing 60 tick marks implemented 60 identical chunks of XAML. 
</p>
<p>
I don’t know what rule you go by, but for me it’s always been simple:  “Three or more: Use a <i>for</i>.”  This is why we have loops. This is why we are programmers. 
</p>
<h3>
The Pure Pleasures of Pure Coding
</h3>
<p>
A couple months ago — perhaps as an antidote to all this highfalutin Windows Forms and Avalon programming I’ve been doing — I started coding in C again. Just a little bit. A magazine I read — the British weekly <i>New Scientist</i> — runs a tiny regular feature called “Enigma,” which presents a little math puzzle. Here’s a particularly short one from this past June: “What is the largest integer whose digits are all different (and do not include 0) that is divisible by each of its individual digits?”<sup>8</sup> If you solve one of the Enigma problems, you can send in your solution, and one is chosen at random on a particular date, and if yours is picked you get 15 pounds and a mention in the magazine.
</p>
<p>
These Enigma problems have actually annoyed me for years because they always seemed solvable by writing a short program and testing out the possibilities, and for some reason that seemed absurd to me.
</p>
<p>
A few months ago I decided it might actually be interesting solving the problems with code, and then posting the programs and solutions on my web site the day after the deadline, but about a week before the answer appears in print. 
</p>
<p>
I decided to use plain old ANSI C, and to edit the source code in Notepad — which has no IntelliSense and no sense of any other kind — and to compile on the command line using both the Microsoft C compiler and the Gnu C compiler.
</p>
<p>
What’s appealing about this project is that I don’t have to look anything up. I’ve been coding in C for 20 years. It was my favorite language before C# came along. This stuff is just pure algorithmic coding with simple text output. It’s all content.
</p>
<p>
I also discovered is that the problems <i>do</i> require some thought before you code them up. Very often, the total number of combinations is prohibitive. You really have to whittle them down. You don’t want to write a program that runs for a week before getting to the <i>printf</i> statement. For example, take the problem I quoted: “What is the largest integer whose digits are all different (and do not include 0) that is divisible by each of its individual digits?” It really helps to realize that this integer cannot contain the digit 5 if it also contains any even digit, because then the number would be divisible by 10, and the last digit would be 0, which isn’t allowed. So, the number we’re looking for probably doesn’t include 5. That immediately reduces the possibilities by an order of magnitude.

Even after this preliminary process, there’s still coding to do, but there’s no APIs, there’s no classes, there’s no properties, there’s no forms, there’s no controls, there’s no event handlers, and there’s definitely no Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
It’s just me and the code, and for awhile, I feel like a real programmer again.

      <sup>1</sup>It was the late 70s. 
      I was working for New York Life Insurance Company at 51 Madison Avenue,
      programming in PL/I on an IBM 370 via TSO (Time Sharing Option) and an 
      <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/ibm.html">IBM 3278 terminal</a>.
      I was using a new-fangled "full-screen editor" called FSE to edit my source code.
      At one point I pressed the Backspace key and instead of the cursor moving backwards as is normal,
      the entire screen moved left one character, including the frame of the editor,
      with the beginning of each line wrapping to the end of the preceding line. 
      It was as if the entire frame buffer shifted.
      I pressed the Backspace key a couple more times, and it did the same thing.
      Then it started going by itself, with the lines circling around the screen and right up
      through the top until the screen was entirely clear.
      Then we called the IBM repair guy.
      I was very eager to tell him what happened and hear his diagnosis, 
      but that's not how they repaired 3278s.
      Instead, the repair guy had a box full of spare circuit boards. 
      He swapped them in and out of the machine until the terminal worked again.

<p>But David Seubert, who manages sound collections at the University of California, Santa Barbara library, told Ars that he frequently used the project as an archive and not just to listen to the recordings.</p>
<p>For Seubert, the videos that IA records of the 78 RPM albums capture more than audio of a certain era. Researchers like him want to look at the label, check out the copyright information, and note the catalogue numbers, he said.</p>
<p>"It has all this information there," Seubert said. "I don't even necessarily need to hear it," he continued, adding, "just seeing the physicality of it, it's like, 'Okay, now I know more about this record.'"</p>
<p>Music publishers suing IA argue that all the songs included in their dispute—and likely many more, since the Great 78 Project spans 400,000 recordings—"are already available for streaming or downloading from numerous services."</p>
<p>"These recordings face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed," their filing claimed.</p>
<p>But Nathan Georgitis, the executive director of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC), told Ars that you just don't see 78 RPM records out in the world anymore. Even in record stores selling used vinyl, these recordings will be hidden "in a few boxes under the table behind the tablecloth," Georgitis suggested. And in "many" cases, "the problem for libraries and archives is that those recordings aren't necessarily commercially available for re-release."</p>
<p>That "means that those recordings, those artists, the repertoire, the recorded sound history in itself—meaning the labels, the producers, the printings—all of that history kind of gets obscured from view," Georgitis said.</p>
<p>Currently, libraries trying to preserve this history must control access to audio collections, Georgitis said. He sees IA's work with the Great 78 Project as a legitimate archive in that, unlike a streaming service, where content may be inconsistently available, IA's "mission is to preserve and provide access to content over time."</p>

			<h2>Making New Games</h2>
			<h2>What is this?</h2>
						<p>
			You can edit/change the games in the list below. You can upload your own images, and even re-program the game play using
			<a href="https://canvaslanguage.com/showcase" target="_blank">SCL</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you've made your new game, you can have it activated to run on a domain of your choice by visiting the
			<a href="https://playscl.com/publish" target="_blank">Publishing</a> page. For example, if you have an account a itch.io, you
			can activate your game for your itch page.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			This is a demo of how editable and customizing games work using <a href="https://canvaslanguage.com/" target="_blank">Canvas Language</a>. If you choose a game below, you'll be taken to a dev studio where you can edit your game
			and download a project file, for re-upload later.
