<p>HTTP cookies are a small piece of data set by either <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie">Javascript</a> or HTTP servers, and which are essential for maintaining state on the otherwise stateless system known as the World Wide Web. Once set, web browsers will continue to forward them along for every properly scoped HTTP request until they expire.</p>
<p>I had been more than content to ignore the vagaries of how cookies function until the end of time, except that one day I stumbled across this innocuous piece of Javascript:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>favoriteCookies</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>({</span>
<span>  </span><span>ginger</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"snap"</span><span>,</span>
<span>  </span><span>peanutButter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"chocolate chip"</span><span>,</span>
<span>  </span><span>snicker</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"doodle"</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cookie</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`&nbsp;cookieNames=</span><span>${</span><span>favoriteCookies</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code functioned completely fine, as far as browsers were concerned. It took a piece of boring (but tasty) JSON and saved the value into a session cookie. While this was slightly unusual — most code will serialize JSON to base64 prior to setting them as a cookie, there was nothing here that browsers had any issue with. They happily allowed the cookie to be set and sent along to the backend web server in the HTTP header:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>GET</span> <span>/</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>en-US,en;q=0.9</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
<span>Cookie</span><span>:</span> <span>cookieNames={"ginger":"snap","peanutButter":"chocolate chip","snicker":"doodle"}</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>example.com</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which was all well and good, until it got passed along to some code that used the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-http-utils/cookie">Go standard library</a>. The Go standard library couldn't parse the cookie, leading to cascading failures all the way up the stack. So what happened?</p>
<h2>The Specification</h2>
<p>Cookies were initially defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2109">RFC 2109</a> (1997), and subsequently updated in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2965">RFC 2965</a> (2000) and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265">RFC 6265</a> (2011), with a <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html">draft version</a> that is in the process of being updated (and is what this article uses).</p>
<p>There are two sections of the RFC that pertain to cookie values:</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.1.1</strong> <em>(on how servers should send cookies)</em></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Informally, the Set-Cookie response header field contains a cookie,
which begins with a name-value-pair, followed by zero or more
attribute-value pairs. Servers SHOULD NOT send Set-Cookie header
fields that fail to conform to the following grammar:

set-cookie        = set-cookie-string
set-cookie-string = BWS cookie-pair *( BWS ";" OWS cookie-av )
cookie-pair       = cookie-name BWS "=" BWS cookie-value
cookie-name       = 1*cookie-octet
cookie-value      = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )
cookie-octet      = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
                      ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,
                      ; whitespace DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,
                      ; and backslash
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Section 5.6</strong> <em>(on how browsers should accept cookies)</em></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>A user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following algorithm
to parse a set-cookie-string:

1. If the set-cookie-string contains a %x00-08 / %x0A-1F / %x7F character
   (CTL characters excluding HTAB):
     Abort these steps and ignore the set-cookie-string entirely.

2. If the set-cookie-string contains a %x3B (";") character:
   The name-value-pair string consists of the characters up to, but not
   including, the first %x3B (";"), and the unparsed-attributes consist
   of the remainder of the set-cookie-string (including the %x3B (";")
   in question).

Otherwise:

1. The name-value-pair string consists of all the characters contained in
   the set-cookie-string, and the unparsed-attributes is the empty string.
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are three things that should immediately jump out to you:</p>
<ol>
<li>What servers <strong>SHOULD</strong> send and what browsers <strong>MUST</strong> accept are not aligned, a classic example of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomson-postel-was-wrong-03">tragedy of following Postel's Law</a>.</li>
<li>There is nothing here that limits what cookie values are acceptable for browsers to send to servers, aside from the semicolon delimiter. This might be fine if servers only received cookies they themselves had set, but cookies can also come from <code>document.cookie</code> and contain values outside the <code>%x21</code>, <code>%x23-2B</code>, <code>%x2D-3A</code>, <code>%x3C-5B</code>, and <code>%x5D-7E</code> characters as allowed by <code>Set-Cookie</code>.</li>
<li>It doesn't acknowledge how standard libraries that handle <code>Cookie</code> headers should behave: should they act like user agents or like servers? Should they be permissive or proscriptive? Should they behave differently in different contexts?</li>
</ol>
<p>And herein lies the very crux of the resulting issue I ran into: everything behaves differently, and it's a miracle that cookies work at all.</p>
<h2>Web Browsers</h2>
<p>First, let's start with how web browsers behave. The teams behind Gecko (Firefox), Chromium, and WebKit (Safari) work together constantly, so it would be reasonable to expect them to all behave the same… right?</p>
<p>Before we dig in, remember that the RFC contradictorily says that <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers may contain any ASCII character besides control characters, double quotes, commas, semicolons, and backslashes, but that browsers should accept any cookie value that does not contain control characters.</p>

<figure><figcaption>†accepting <code>0x7F</code> was fixed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1797235">bug 1797235</a> (Firefox 108)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Firefox accepts five characters which RFC recommends that servers not send:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x09</code> (horizontal tab)</li>
<li><code>0x20</code> (spaces)</li>
<li><code>0x22</code> (double quotes)</li>
<li><code>0x2C</code> (commas)</li>
<li><code>0x5C</code> (backslashes)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was initially done to <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/02b7641683b049e8ba551d04318a5d985f36e504/netwerk/cookie/CookieCommons.cpp#l210">provide parity with Chrome</a> in some long-ago era and lingers on in both codebases.</p>
<p>Astute observers might note that Firefox has a <code>network.cookie.blockUnicode</code> setting that this code checks against, and which rejects all values above <code>0x80</code>. That groundwork was laid as a result of this research and can be tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1797231">bug 1797231</a>.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Chromium</strong></p>
<p>The Chromium <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:net/cookies/parsed_cookie.cc">code for valid cookie values</a> looks like so:</p>

<p>Chrome is slightly more restrictive than Firefox, refusing to accept the <code>0x09</code> (horizontal tab) in its cookie values.</p>
<p>Nevertheless (and contrary to the RFC), it is perfectly happy to receive and send spaces, double quotes, commas, backslashes, and unicode characters.</p>

<p>As Safari stops processing a cookie once it sees a disallowed character, it's easy to see that <code>0x09</code> (horizontal tab), <code>0x20</code> (space), <code>0x22</code> (double quote), and <code>0x5C</code> (backslash) are okay, but <code>0x7F</code> (delete), <code>0x80-FF</code> (high ASCII / Unicode) characters are disallowed.</p>
<p>Unlike Firefox and Chrome which follow the instructions in the RFC to <em>“abort these steps and ignore the cookie entirely”</em> when encountering a cookie with a control character, Safari does not ignore the cookie but instead accepts the cookie value for everything up until that character.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, this quest has uncovered a bizarre Safari bug — setting a cookie with a value of <code>-- , --</code> seems to result in it trimming the whitespace around the comma.</p>

<p>Golang falls relatively close to what the RFC's wording on how servers should behave with <code>Set-Cookie</code>, only differing by allowing <code>0x20</code> (space) and <code>0x2C</code> (comma) due to them <a href="https://golang.org/issue/7243">commonly occurring</a> in the wild.</p>
<p>You can already see the struggles that programming languages have to deal with — they have to both receive values from browsers in line with Section 5, but also send cookies as per Section 4.1.1.</p>
<p>This can have pretty serious consequences, as you can see from running <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/6UX3Beem2Go">this code</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>package</span><span> </span><span>main</span>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>cookie1</span><span>=</span><span>foo</span><span> </span><span>cookie3</span><span>=</span><span>bar</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Invisibly dropping a cookie that all major browsers accept, without any sort of exception to the effect that this is happening. Still, dropping a cookie it didn't understand without any other side effects isn't as bad as it could be.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>PHP</strong></p>
<p>Many languages, such as PHP, don't have native functions for parsing cookies, which makes it somewhat difficult to definitively say what it allows and does not allow.</p>
<p>That said, we can set cookies using the code below and see how PHP responds:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>0x09</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x0D</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x10</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x20</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x22</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x2C</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x5C</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0x7F</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0xFF</span><span>].</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>  </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cookie</span><span>=</span><span>`&nbsp;cookie</span><span>${</span><span>paddedIndex</span><span>}</span><span>=-- </span><span>${</span><span>String</span><span>.</span><span>fromCharCode</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span> --`</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cookie</span><span>=</span><span>'cookieUnicode=🍪'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>cookie009_0x09: -- --

cookie255_0x7f: -- --
cookie255_0xff: -- ÿ --
cookieUnicode: 🍪
</code></pre></div>

<p>When it comes to control characters, PHP's behavior is all over the place. <code>0x00-0x09</code> all work fine, as do things like <code>0x0D</code> (carriage return), but if you use <code>0x10</code> (data link escape) or <code>0x7F</code> (delete), PHP will completely error out with a <strong>400 Bad Request</strong> error.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Python</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>http.cookies</span>

<span>raw_cookies</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>'cookie1=foo; '</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Set-Cookie: cookie1=foo
</code></pre></div>

<p>Python invisibly aborts the loading of additional cookies inside <code>SimpleCookie.load()</code> as soon as it encounters one it doesn't understand. This can be very dangerous when you consider that a subdomain could feasibly set a cookie on the base domain which would completely break all cookies for all domains of a given site.</p>
<p>It's even messier it comes to control characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>http.cookies</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>32</span><span>):</span>

    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>cookies</span><span>.</span><span>SimpleCookie</span><span>()</span>
    <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>raw_cookie</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>morsel</span> <span>in</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>():</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>: value: </span><span>{</span><span>repr</span><span>(</span><span>morsel</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>, length: </span><span>{</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>morsel</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie0x9: value: '', length: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie0xa: value: '', length: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie0xb: value: '', length: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie0xc: value: '', length: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie0xd: value: '', length: 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we can see that Python invisibly drops a lot of cookies with control characters, and loads others improperly. Note that if you guard those values with something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>raw_cookie</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>"cookie</span><span>{</span><span>hex</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>=aa</span><span>{</span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>aa"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then none of the control character cookies will load. Overall, Python is extremely inconsistent and unpredictable in its behavior when it comes to loading cookies.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Ruby</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>require</span><span> </span><span>"cgi"</span>

<span>raw_cookie</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'ginger=snap; '</span><span> </span><span>+</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>{"ginger"=&gt;#&lt;CGI::Cookie: "ginger=snap; path="&gt;, "cookie"=&gt;#&lt;CGI::Cookie: "cookie=chocolate+%13+%09+%22+%2C+%5C+%7F+%F0%9F%8D%AA+chip; path="&gt;, "snicker"=&gt;#&lt;CGI::Cookie: "snicker=doodle; path="&gt;}
chocolate    " , \  🍪 chip
cookie=chocolate+%13+%09+%22+%2C+%5C+%7F+%F0%9F%8D%AA+chip; path=
</code></pre></div>

<p>The Ruby library appears pretty permissive, seeming to accept every character during parsing and then <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding">percent-encoding</a> it when being pulled from the cookie jar.</p>
<p>This may well be the optimal behavior (if such a thing can be said to exist with cookies), but I can certainly see cases where code setting a cookie via <code>document.cookie</code> would not expect to see it reflected back in percent-encoded form.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Rust</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>cookie</span>::<span>Cookie</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>name_value</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>("cookie", "chocolate , \" \t foo \u{13} ñ 🍪 chip")
</code></pre></div>

<p>Rust doesn't ship any cookie handling facilities by default, so this is looking at the popular <code>cookie</code> crate. As configured by default, it appears to be the most permissive of the programming languages, accepting any UTF-8 string tossed at it.</p>

<h2>The World Wide Web, aka Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The wildly differing behavior between browsers and languages certainly makes for some <a href="#summary-table">riveting tables</a>, but how does all this play out in the real world?</p>
<p>When I first discovered this in the real world, it was only through sheer luck that it wasn't a catastrophe. A manual tester was playing around with a third-party library update and had run into a strange set of errors on our testing site. Without bringing it to my attention, this update — doing something unlikely to be caught in automated testing — would have certainly been pushed to production. As a result, every future website visitor would have received a broken cookie and been locked out with an inscrutable error until the update was reverted and the cookies were cleared out.</p>
<p>And that's exactly the problem with this specification ambiguity — it's such an easy mistake to make that millions of websites and companies are only an intern away from a complete meltdown. And it doesn't only affect tiny websites on obscure frameworks, as major websites such as Facebook, Netflix, WhatsApp, and Apple are affected.</p>
<p>You can see for yourself how easy of a mistake this is to make by pasting this simple code fragment into your browser console, substituting for the domain you're testing:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cookie</span><span>=</span><span>"unicodeCookie=🍪; domain=.grayduck.mn; Path=/; SameSite=Lax"</span>

<p>It's probably not much of a surprise that fixing problems in 30-year-old foundational specifications is really, <em>really</em> hard. And for this problem, it's unlikely that there is a good fix.</p>

<p>But it turns out unilateral blocking is quite complicated because while non-ASCII cookies aren't super common overall, affecting only a bit under 0.01% of all cookies, telemetry has found they are <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40061459#comment24">considerably more common</a> in countries like Argentina, Mexico, and Finland. While Mozilla did implement a preference that could be toggled quickly (<code>network.cookie.blockUnicode</code>), it hasn't been enabled due to behavioral compatibility issues with Chromium.</p>
<p>Fixing it on the server-side is potentially feasible, but it affects millions of websites and most of the errors caused by this problem are buried deep in programming languages and web frameworks. It might be possible for places like Facebook and Netflix to mitigate the issue, but the average website operator is not going to have the time or ability to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>In truth, the true fix for this issue almost certainly lies in the <a href="https://httpwg.org/">IETF HTTP Working Group</a> updating the cookie specification to both align with itself and to be strict on how systems handling cookies should behave. Whether non-ASCII characters should be allowed should be identical regardless of whether server-side or on user agents.</p>
<p>And regardless, the steps around how browsers, programming languages, and frameworks should handle cookie processing need to be explicit, in much the way that modern W3C standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#html-integration">Content Security Policy</a> do. Aborting the processing of other cookies because one cookie is malformed is unacceptable when such behavior can lead to a wide variety of unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>These processing steps should probably look like something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>• Start with field-value
• Split on ; and ,, giving list of "raw-cookie-pair". Comma is NOT treated a synonym for semicolon in order to support combining headers, despite RFC7230 section 3.2.2.

For each raw-cookie-pair:
  ◦ If the pair does not contain =, then skip to next raw-cookie-pair
  ◦ Remove leading and trailing whitespace
  ◦ Treat portion before first = as cookie-name-octets
  ◦ Treat portion after first = as cookie-value-octets
  ◦ If cookie-value-octets starts with DQUOTE, then:
    ‣ Remove one DQUOTE at start
    ‣ Remove one DQUOTE at end, if present
  ◦ If resulting cookie-name-octets, cookie-value-octets, or both are unacceptable to server, then skip to next raw-cookie-pair
  ◦ Process resulting [cookie-name-octets, cookie-value-octets] tuple in server defined manner

Servers SHOULD further process cookie-name-octets and reject any tuple where the cookie-name-octets are not a token.  Servers SHOULD further process and cookie-value-octets and reject any tuple where cookie-value-octets contains octets not in cookie-octet.

			<p>Spending time among the thousands of paintings on Art UK often throws up questions. What is <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/species-of-sun-fish-caught-off-jersey-4-september-1885-137435/search/licence:2bbc/page/34">a sun fish</a>? Why is there a painting <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/robert-burns-and-his-dog-have-royal-visitors-214756/view_as/grid/search/keyword:queen-and-robert-burns/page/1">of the Queen with Robert Burns</a>? What makes <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/hot-tie-65548/view_as/grid/search/works:hot-tie/page/1">this tie hot</a>?</p>
<p>For a while, I’ve been wondering about a mystery I shall call ‘the rectangular cows of Art UK’. Some time ago, I came across dozens of very similar paintings, showing a cow standing by itself in a field, side-on (or ‘landscape’, if you will). And the cow, in many cases, would be almost perfectly rectangular.</p>

<p>However, looking at the mysterious rectangular cows also led to other questions about Art UK’s bovine representation.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, why are there so many cows?</strong></p>
<p>The paintings above are a few picked out of hundreds. In fact, there are so many paintings of cows, I can’t possibly do them all justice here. Searches for ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:cow">cow</a>’, ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:heifer">heifer</a>’, ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:ox/page/3">ox</a>’, ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:cattle">cattle</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:bull/page/3">bull</a>’ all return rewarding results (a heifer, I have learned, being a cow that has not yet had a calf).</p>
<p>‘Cattle’ returns a very different kind of painting to ‘cow’. With ‘cattle’ you see lots of typical landscape scenes; lovely green meadows, maybe some water, and groups of nicely-painted cows grazing away. ‘<a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/view_as/grid/search/keyword:landscape-with-cattle">Landscape with cattle</a>’, or minor variations thereof, is a very common painting name.</p>
<p>Highland cows also seem to be particularly attractive for artists, as there are many paintings of them, including this from the <a href="https://artuk.org/visit/venues/the-stirling-smith-art-gallery-museum-5144" target="_blank">Stirling Smith Art Gallery &amp; Museum</a>, where the cows look like they’re posing for an album cover.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer to why there are so many of these cows is a very simple one: ubiquity. Cows are an ever-present feature of a lot of the British countryside, and perfect subjects for artists to paint, given they get to stand around at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any famous cows?</strong></p>
<p>The searches got me wondering: as such a popular subject, are there any famous paintings of cows? Is there a cow equivalent of <em>Whistlejacket, </em>the much-lauded painting of a horse by George Stubbs, admired by visitors to the National Gallery?</p>
<p>The answer is: not really, although there are famous artists who have brought cows to the canvas. Andy Warhol did <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/71923">a series of them</a>, and the German artist Franz Marc also <a href="https://www.moma.org/s/ge/collection_ge/artist/artist_id-3748_role-1_sov_page-18.html">created some brightly coloured bovines</a>. There are some lovely paintings by <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artists/cooper-thomas-sidney-18031902">Thomas Sidney Cooper</a> – a landscape painter whose paintings of livestock earned him the nickname ‘cow Cooper’ – on Art UK.</p>

<p>The French artist <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artists/bonheur-rosa-18221899" target="_blank">Rosa Bonheur</a> (who herself was best known for <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-horse-fair-115640/view_as/grid/search/makers:rosa-bonheur-18221899/page/1">painting horses</a>) depicts cows among her pastoral scenes. They are markedly different from most of the other cow paintings on the site, where the animals are standing around at leisure: the oxen observed by Bonheur are hard at work ploughing.</p>

<p><strong>What’s with the guys in the top hats?</strong></p>
<p>Another sub-genre of cow paintings seems to be those that also feature a man standing by the cow, dressed much more smartly than you’d expect of a farmer.</p>

<p>The ox in this particular painting is a real monster. It towers above the tiny man in his nice coat and top hat, who holds a kind of harness that looks like it’d barely make it over the beast’s neck. Either the scale is off or the size of the ox has been exaggerated: and if this is the case, then why?</p>
<p>The clue to these is in the dates of the paintings. The early 1800s was when selective breeding for certain traits in animals was becoming a more common practice. The celebrity ‘Durham Ox’ – a bull so large it drew in crowds to marvel at its size – showed what could be done (and aspired to), and owners of prize livestock became increasingly proud of the animals they had bred. They commissioned paintings of themselves with their cattle, and to make the animals look as impressive and well-bred as possible, the artists have made some look excessively large, with spindly little legs holding up colossal bodies.</p>
<p>This trend wasn’t unique to cows: there are plenty of corpulent pigs and sheep to feast your eyes on too.</p>

<p><strong>And finally… why <em>are</em> the cows rectangular?</strong></p>
<p>The crux of the mystery.</p>
<p>The answer, as best I can find it, seems to be related to the points about status. Again, many of these paintings were made in the early 1800s, and the rectangular shape may have been another way of making the animals seem big and impressive.</p>
<p>Two things conspire to make the cows so angular. The first is the squared-off rump, and I haven't come up with an answer for why that is. The second is the overly bulgy bit in front of their front legs, the brisket. And, also according to my research, when cattle are judged for competitions or prizes, the brisket is taken into consideration. I quote: 'the brisket (the flap on a cow's neck) is only fat and skin. We generally want to see fullness to the brisket, this means that the animal has enough finish and muscle development. If there is too much finish, it will look 'messy', aka, skin will fold over and look a lot like double chins on people. The skin should be tight and the brisket full.'</p>
<p>So there we go. These paintings are probably just relics of a time when cattle were a marker of status, and breeding for size became a competition. Really famous cows from the 1800s could find themselves the subjects of everything from public displays to dinner plates, so perhaps the efforts of their owners conspired with the artists in an effort to secure them both a place in history.</p>

<p>Personality basins are the mental model that I use to reason about humans within their environment. They are an elucidating way to think about many concepts: from modelling why people are they way they are, how they change over time, how mental illnesses and addiction function along with how we should look for their cures, and how the attention economy optimizes itself to consume all of your free time.</p>







<h2>What is personality?</h2>



<p>Your personality is formed by a process conceptually similar to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" target="_blank">RLHF</a>. You are first born with a set of traits in a given environment. After this, you perform many interactions with your environment. If an interaction goes well, you’re likely to do it more often, and if it goes poorly, you’ll probably do less of it.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="655" src="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-1024x655.png" alt="" srcset="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-1024x655.png 1024w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-300x192.png 300w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-768x492.png 768w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-1536x983.png 1536w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl-469x300.png 469w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rl.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>See the learning agent? That’s You!<br>If your interaction with this post goes well, you’re likely to read more of them later.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If you were born tall and with a commanding voice you might find that you get what you want by confidently demanding it, and this will help to result in a confident personality. If you attempt this strategy as someone born small with a soft voice, it will probably have weaker results and encourage you to try something else out instead. Obviously some traits are more genetic, and thus inherent, than others, but that is not the scope of this post as even highly-heritable traits will result in a large distribution of outcomes.</p>



<p>Periods of high social and environmental entropy during adolescence are the most formative because you will learn the most information about which actions perform well in your environment and which don’t (of course, our meta-learning algorithm knows this, and this is why you have higher neuroplasticity and thus a higher learning rate and more energy during this period. It’s time to learn how to succeed in your newfound environment!)</p>







<h2>Your personality basin</h2>



<p>As you go about your life, you will continue to modify your personality in response to your environment, and eventually you will end up in something that resembles a basin. Maybe you were born tall and attractive and then this led you to engage in a lot of athletic activities and socialization, and at the end of all of the positive feedback you have ended up with a jock personality that goes on to become a professional football player.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="896" height="503" src="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/basin.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/basin.jpg 896w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/basin-300x168.jpg 300w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/basin-768x431.jpg 768w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/basin-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px"><figcaption>This is a landscape of personalities. The black line is your personality over time, and the last point is the person you currently are. Just like in machine learning, the way that you’ve progressed as a person has been by trying out many things and then doing more of the things that worked well.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If instead you grew up scrawny yet intelligent you might have found things go well for you when you adopt a more quiet persona and focus on solving technical problems in programming or mathematics, perhaps eventually leading to a career as a software engineer or academic. Just like training a model in machine learning, the general gist is that you will try out a lot of things and then do more of the things that went well.</p>



<p>The above image is of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape" target="_blank">loss landscape</a> in machine learning. Since we are discussing personality, all of the points on the landscape represent different personalities you could have, with the lower points being personalities which are more successful. The personality basin that you find yourself in solidifies over time as you find out who you are and choose your friend group, career path, social and aesthetic preferences, and so on.</p>







<h2>Most personality changes are unconscious</h2>



<p>Most of your movement within personality-space happens outside of your conscious awareness. Although there are many times in life you’ll consciously decide to act in a certain way, this is the exception, not the norm. Your brain is always making millions of gradient updates a day based on what is and isn’t going well and often the most you can do is try to be as observant as possible. This is why techniques like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication" target="_blank">nonviolent communication</a>,  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy" target="_blank">dialectical behavior therapy</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness" target="_blank">mindfulness</a> have observation and introspection as a core facet, because it’s something that you have to consciously practice to become good at rather than something you’re born with.</p>



<p>Most addictive behaviors start without us noticing what is happening until we are sufficiently addicted such that the habit is hard to break. Relatedly, if you introspect on many seemingly-innate preferences you will often notice some of the environmental and social gradients that have helped shape them. An interesting thought experiment you can perform on yourself is to pick a random personality trait that you have and try to answer the questions “why am I like this? could I imagine a version of myself that is not like this, and if so, what happened differently to them?”</p>



<p>Many people think their music and fashion preferences are innate to them and are solely based off of how their favorite music sounds and their favorite outfits look. But if their most hated political party (or often in the case of adolescents, their parents) adopted the same aesthetic preferences, you can imagine they might start to literally like them less!</p>



<p>Your conscious experience of a stimuli is not dictated by a single-variable function f(stimuli), but rather f(stimuli, personality, environment), for broad definitions of ‘personality’ and ‘environment’. If you have a favorite song that your friend thinks sounds terrible, this is because they are literally experiencing it differently from you due to the latter two variables given to this function. They don’t think the thing that <em>you</em> hear sounds terrible, they think the thing that <em>they</em> hear sounds terrible, and it is probably very dissimilar from what you hear. The average conscious experiences of most people are likely wildly different from one another (see also: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/" target="_blank">What Universal Human Experiences Are You Missing Without Realizing It</a>). For more thoughts on the signaling, environmental, and self-deceptive aspects here I’d suggest reading about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)" target="_blank">signaling</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vzyhBN2SZpvqER4ao/an-introduction-to-signalling-theory" target="_blank">theory</a> and checking out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_in_the_Brain" target="_blank">The Elephant in the Brain</a> by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler.</p>







<h2>How do you know if you’re in the right basin?</h2>



<p>If you’re reading this you probably have a vague idea of what type of personality basin you’re currently in which you can recall by asking yourself the question “What type of person am I?” But an important question remains: how can you find out if this is the right basin to be in? </p>



<p>A simple answer would be that you could try out other basins to see how they feel. Maybe you’re having a great life as a devops programmer, but you could try to become an artist or a woodworker or a stay-at home parent and see how that fares for you.</p>



<p>The reason why this is hard is that the optimal personality for this basin is not immediately accessible to you – to truly test optimality you will need to go through a full RLHF process. If you want to know how good of a life you’d have as a professional pianist, you will have to practice the instrument for a decade to find out.</p>



<p>You may wonder if you could simply try your hand at the piano for a month or two and see how it goes, and of course you can do this too. Your time (and your meta-learning algorithm’s number of epochs and learning rate) is limited, and it’s reasonable to make the trade-off of sacrificing depth-first search in favor of more breadth-first search. </p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="505" src="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ge.png" alt="" srcset="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ge.png 850w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ge-300x178.png 300w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ge-768x456.png 768w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ge-500x297.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"><figcaption>As you progress in life, you will usually perform less exploration for new personalities and more exploiting with your developed personality</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Usually this breadth-first search of trying out many different and creative strategies for life (prioritizing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration-exploitation_dilemma" target="_blank">exploration over exploitation</a>) automatically happens during your adolescence, but one of the magic things about the modern world is that there are so many societies, cultures, countries, and fields of work one can move into, and for each different environment could exist a slightly-different-you which finds their own distinct personality that maximizes success. Had you been born as a hunter-gatherer or within the Roman Empire or in ancient China, you’d probably have ended up quite different as a person. Similarly, if you decide to move countries or communities or careers, the optimal-you-for-your-environment will change a lot too.</p>







<h2>Personality-space is adversarial</h2>



<p>One interesting thing to note about personality-space is that it is adversarial. Rather than a static training set to iterate through, your training data consists of other RL agents, many of which are other people, and all of whom want different things from you.</p>



<p>This is what leads to the concept of <strong>Personality Capture</strong>. Personality capture is when your environment RLHFs you into becoming a personality that benefits the agents around you rather than yourself.</p>



<p>If a school bully threatens to hurt you unless you do their homework for them, they are attempting to modify your RLHF process so that it results in an agent which is beneficial to them, hopefully resulting in someone who will always give in to their demands.</p>



<p>Those familiar with high school psychology will find high similarity with this concept and that of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" target="_blank">classical</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning" target="_blank">operant conditioning</a> as well as concept of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank">Skinner box</a>. The attempted addition to these concepts here is that of modelling the personality as a reinforcement learning process and changes in personality as gradient updates, which then allow us to view personality-space as a high-dimensional area which will give us some interesting tools to think with. As the saying goes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong" target="_blank">a</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong" target="_blank">ll models are wrong, but some are useful</a>.</p>



<p>Luckily for humans there exist many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis" target="_blank">symbiotic</a> equilibria where multiple parties can find mutually-beneficial feedback loops within the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/epoch" target="_blank">epochs</a> of personality-space. Parent/child relationships, marriages, and best friends are often good examples of such a situation. </p>







<h2>Personality Capture</h2>



<p>It’s easy to become susceptible to various forms of personality capture when your environment changes. When asked why he isn’t on Twitter, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Amodei" target="_blank">Dario Amodei</a>, CEO of Anthropic,  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/dario-amodei" target="_blank">responds to Dwarkesh Patel</a> with: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve just seen cases with a number of people I’ve worked with, where attaching your incentives very strongly to the approval or cheering of a crowd can destroy your mind, and in some cases, it can destroy your soul.</p>



<p>I’ve deliberately tried to be a little bit low profile because I want to defend my ability to think about things intellectually in a way that’s different from other people and isn’t tinged by the approval of other people.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron-300x169.jpg 300w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron-768x432.jpg 768w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron-500x281.jpg 500w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/neuron.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Illustration of a monkey being personality captured by excessive twitter usage</figcaption></figure></div></blockquote>



<p>Most people around you want to personality-capture you in some way. Your boss might want you to work harder, your children might want you to give them more attention, and political parties want you to vote for them. Some of these things will be beneficial for you as well, but it’s easy to get trapped into bad habits when your adversary is sufficiently motivated and intelligent (e.g. social media feeds).</p>



<p>One interesting way to frame personality capture is by combining it with the concept of  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy" target="_blank">attention economics</a>. All of the apps on your phone want to turn you into the type of person that uses them all day because that is beneficial for their revenue models. In many cases this is mutually beneficial, but it’s nonetheless clear that the cat and mouse game is starting to favor the felines more and more over the last two decades as they have learned to perfect their craft of user acquisition, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://userpilot.com/blog/user-retention/" target="_blank">retention</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arpu.asp" target="_blank">ARPU</a> maximization.</p>



<p>As I discussed in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://near.blog/where-are-the-builders/" target="_blank">where are the builders</a>, the game becomes particularly skewed when there is a large difference in ability or judgement between counterparties, with one common example being children and adolescents. It’s easy to become personality-captured by minecraft or roblox at the age of 10 – such games are not only fun and addictive, but a child also has little understanding of the level of optimization their counterparty has put in to making sure that they remain a user for life. The reason it’s so hard to put your phone away is because it’s a battlefield of yourself versus thousands of intelligent and well-compensated engineers trying their hardest to ensure you do just the opposite.</p>







<h2>How do I leave my personality basin?</h2>



<p>Perhaps you have decided that you don’t like your personality basin. Maybe it used to be working out for you but no longer is, or maybe you’ve always been unhappy with it. Or maybe you just have reason to believe you’re trapped in a local maxima which is far inferior to the global one. What should you do?</p>



<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to change your environment. If both you and your environment are a constant, you shouldn’t expect to end up in a different basin any time soon. For every new environment exists a new optimal-you, and the world offers many environments to choose from.</p>



<p>The second thing you’ll want to do is increase your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate" target="_blank">learning rate</a>. There are a lot of ways to do this. One interesting note is that your learning rate will automatically increase if your environment changes. This may be why so many people find they are able to be more thoughtful and creative while going on long walks in nature rather than sitting in a cubicle. </p>



<p>This is also a reason why it’s good to constantly be trying new things, because new things will likely involve new environments and new people. If you wonder why trying new things is hard, it is likely because this trait was more maladaptive in our ancestral environment than it is today, as we had less control over our surroundings in the past (If anything, we may have <em>too many</em> options in some cases of the present: our society is so large that defection from a group is less costly as you can simply find a new group to join afterwards. This seems to create challenging game-theoretic equilibria in match-making where commitment to a partner is devalued due to the ease of finding alternatives, the effects of which can be seen by how discontent much of the population is with dating apps).</p>



<p>A common mistake in life is to let your personality basin solidify too early. Your parents and schooling environment have a disproportionately large influence on who you become as an adolescent. But as soon as you gain the freedom to act independently as an adult, it’s usually a good idea to force yourself to try as many new things as you can, including moving cities (or countries!) and considering drastically different lines of work. Even if you feel content with where you are, the potential return is literally life-changing. Moving away from where I was born was one of my most important life choices, but it still took me several years longer than it should have to give it a shot.</p>



<p>Although you have a general learning rate curve for how quickly your personality adapts to a new environments, different stimuli will also be paired with differing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="_blank">gradient</a> magnitudes. High-magnitude experiences which result in strong gradient updates can move you within personality space much more quickly. </p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="773" height="410" src="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lr.png" alt="" srcset="https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lr.png 773w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lr-300x159.png 300w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lr-768x407.png 768w, https://near.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lr-500x265.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>Humans have many sets of learning rate curves which govern different parts of their brain. In addition to the baseline learning curve, our learning curves are heavily modified by our environment.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If someone uses a psychedelic drug which explicitly gives them high-magnitude gradients they will probably move a lot more in personality space than if they had stayed sober. Similarly if someone undergoes a highly traumatic event, it may push them a long distance within personality space as they quickly adapt to ensure that they don’t have to go through the same experience again. Both of these activities involve large gradient updates.</p>



<p>Common activities which seem to give the largest gradient updates to humans are meditation, drug usage, trauma, religious events, love, gambling, and sex.</p>



<p>Some of these concepts are more negatively-coded than others, for example trauma. But the intended purpose of trauma is obvious, which is to avoid really bad things from happening to you in the future. One of the reasons why overcoming trauma isn’t as hard-coded into us as strongly as we might hope for is because our present society is so much larger than that which we evolved in such that there’s more opportunity to change your environment as to remove the potential source of trauma. Trauma was likely more adaptive in our ancestral environment than it was today due to an inability to drastically change your surroundings and social group in the past.</p>



<p>This is why strong psychedelic drugs like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" target="_blank">ayahuasca</a> can be dangerous: whatever happens to you during your experience will be fed to you via high-magnitude gradients. Because users may experience hallucinations and delusional thinking during usage of such drugs, it’s possible for their location in personality-space to be thrown far out-of-distribution and into an area which has little overlap with the rest of humanity (See also: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06204-3" target="_blank">Psychedelics reopen the social reward learning critical period</a>; Ketamine: ~48 hours, Psilocybin/MDMA: ~2 weeks, LSD: ~3 weeks, Ibogaine: ~4 weeks).</p>



<p>This isn’t to say there can’t be high-magnitude positive outcomes as well, but just that there is a high potential for variance when large gradients are involved. Romantic love can be a similarly dangerous force and has pushed thousands to suicide, yet our society near-universally regards it as a good thing! While there are many other reasons for this, high-variance is not inherently bad and is likely necessary at the societal level in order to promote long-term <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility" target="_blank">antifragility</a> (this is also the very reason I am so bullish on America).</p>







<h2>Personality basins and mental illness</h2>



<p>Personality basins are an interesting way to model many mental illnesses. Similar to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lorienpsych.com/2020/11/11/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-dynamic-systems/" target="_blank">attractor states</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/trapped-priors-as-a-basic-problem" target="_blank">trapped priors</a>, they allow us to have a simple model with which we can plan to manipulate in order to solve our problems. Just as your personality basin decides how introverted you are, how funny you are, and what type of music you enjoy, it also helps to curate which psychiatric conditions affect you.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why curing depression is so hard is because you need a very large gradient update to escape the basin you’re trapped in. This gradient update could come all at once via an excessively strong positive stimuli, for example a drug which explicitly increases your learning rate like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-ketamine-relieves-symptoms-depression" target="_blank">ketamine</a>. But this is often hard to reliably induce, and so the gradient updates instead usually have to be small and continual over a long period of time.</p>



<p>This is what most <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> techniques are: we find a simple way to make a small positive gradient update to push you ever-so-slightly out of the personality basin you’re trapped in, and then we keep doing it for months or years until we finally push you all the way out of the undesirable basin.</p>



<p>This is also a nice way to model something like drug addictions: drugs personality-capture you into a basin which feeds off of and depends on them, and this basin can become arbitrarily deep due to the high magnitude of gradients drugs can apply to you (and thus be very hard to escape from). The concept of relapsing on a drug is equivalent to falling back down to the bottom of the basin, and the concept of tapering off dosage over time is equivalent to providing small and continual gradient updates over time.</p>



<p>I have a lot of hot takes that society is collectively becoming so efficient at some forms of personality capture that we will end up inducing various psychiatric conditions in the majority of our population. Societies end up with their own hyperdimensional personality basins just as people do, and just like us, the two ways they can move out of their basin are either gradually via many slow updates (e.g. the industrial revolution), or all at once via a very strong update (e.g. the french revolution). It’s worth thinking about the effects that <a href="https://near.blog/memetic-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different types of memetic information</a> may have on our society’s collective personality basins as we become more and more efficient at communication.</p>







<h2>Can’t I be in multiple personality basins?</h2>



<p>One thing you may notice from the above sections is that your personality appears much more malleable and dynamic than one described by a static point: you probably act differently around your family than you do around your friends or your co-workers. </p>



<p>To solve this discrepancy you can simply model personality space and your personality basin with additional dimensions, allowing you to model yourself not as a 1d point, but as a three-dimensional landscape.</p>



<p>I model my own personality basin with an extra dimension (i.e., 4d): at any given point in time there exists a “me” which implements a given personality landscape in a given personality basin, but I also have many sub-basins which implement my different moods. The set of actions I might perform when I’m angry is very different from that when I’m sad, and these are simply different sub-basins within the containing higher-dimensional basin.

<p>Although the concepts presented in this post are similar to pre-existing ideas, I find that applying the analogy of loss landscapes, basins, and basic RL and DL concepts to be useful tools for thought and encourage readers to do further exploration with this mental model in case they find other useful analogies (what might a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/a/visualizing-linear-transformations" target="_blank">linear transformation</a> on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913" target="_blank">loss landscape</a> of personality-space look like and compare to? how can we develop a more comprehensive model of learning rate in humans and how we can modify it? are there any <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mental_disorders" target="_blank">mental illnesses</a> we can use this model with to try to come up with novel types of cures? how can we integrate this with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/" target="_blank">bayesian theories of learning and perception</a>? which other ideas in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.coursera.org/collections/llms-terms" target="_blank">LLMs</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.inforly.io/reinforcement-learning-glossary/" target="_blank">RL</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/" target="_blank">ML</a> might we find useful to further analogize with?)</p>



<p>The explicit goal of this post is to help RLHF you into a personality basin which more easily allows for thoughtful analogies and practical tools for introspection.

                Property hooks provide support for computed properties that can natively be understood by IDEs and static analysis tools, without needing to write docblock comments that might go out of sync. Furthermore, they allow reliable pre- or post-processing of values, without needing to check whether a matching getter or setter exists in the class.            </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Published on November 20, 2024 by<!-- --> <a href="https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Johnson</a></p><div><p>Let's start with a game.</p>
<p>Play as long as you like. When you are ready to step back and reflect on what makes this game possible, scroll down to keep reading.</p></div><div><p>What you’ve just experienced is an interactive adventure based on the text of my latest history book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/715495/the-infernal-machine-by-steven-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infernal Machine</em></a>. At its core, the game relies on three elements: the original text from my book; a large language model (in this case, Gemini Pro 1.5); and a 400-word prompt that I wrote giving the model instructions on how to host the game, based on the facts contained in the book itself. You could take any comparable narrative text—fiction or nonfiction—and create an equally sophisticated game in a matter of minutes, just by slightly altering the wording of the prompt.</p>
<p>I’ve played my way through these events from <em>Infernal Machine</em> more than a dozen times now, and every time the experience has been remarkably true to the central facts of Joseph Faurot’s efforts to use cutting-edge forensic science to solve the Soho loft mystery back in 1911. Exploring the world of the game brought me in contact with other real-world figures from the story: Officer Fitzpatrick, the police officer who first inspected the crime scene, or the criminal himself (who shall remain nameless in the event you have not successfully completed the game.) As I played through the story, the virtual host of the game explained the historical and scientific significance of the events, and artfully prevented me from wandering too far from the historical timeline. I’d wager your experience closely matched mine.</p>
<p>The fact that a machine now has the ability to transform linear narratives into immersive adventures has significant implications for both education and entertainment. I’ve generated a similar game just with the Wikipedia entry for the Cuban Missile Crisis. (You play as JFK trying to avoid nuclear war.) The possibilities are truly endless, in part because it is in the nature of games to multiply possibilities. But I want to start with a more fundamental observation about the specific skills that are on display when a large language model turns a linear text into an interactive simulation. (Just to be clear: people have been playing text-based adventures on computers for almost fifty years, but until now the game creators had to write out almost every possible variation of the script and anticipate all the potential narrative branching paths.) Put aside the heated debates over the future emergence of machine sentience or artificial general intelligence. Instead, just focus on the basic tasks you have to accomplish in order to transform a 300-page book into an historically-grounded and entertaining game:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need a reliable command of the facts in the source text, but also the ability to improvise new scenes that are faithful to the core material without being directly grounded in it.</li>
<li>You have to keep track of what the player knows and doesn’t know; what they’ve learned; what they merely suspect.</li>
<li>You must maintain two parallel narratives: the factual chronology and the alternate fictional timeline, and concoct plausible return paths to the main highway of factuality when the player ventures too far afield.</li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, these are all very difficult things to do. It would take the full force of my attention for me to host a game like this one as a human being, and I am the author of the original book that the game is based on! Two years ago, no computer in the world could perform those tasks. Now anyone with a web browser and a laptop can get an AI to perform them just by writing a 400-word prompt and uploading a PDF of a source text.</p>
<p>All that seems like a meaningful step forward. So what made it possible?</p></div><div><h2>. . .</h2><p>Too often, when people talk about the AI progress of the past few years, they focus on metrics like size of the training data, or the number of parameters in the final model, which ultimately create the general cognitive ability and background knowledge that the model brings to each exchange you have with it.  But I would argue that the Inspector Faurot game demonstrates a different leap forward, one that is not appreciated enough in the popular discussion of the AI revolution. The ability to host a factually-grounded and entertaining role-playing game based on a book is not primarily the result of larger training sets, or the so-called “parametric memory” of the model. What you are experiencing walking through the streets of Soho in that adaptation of <em>The Infernal Machine</em> is better understood as the byproduct of a different advance: the dramatic increase in the model’s <em>context window</em> that we have seen over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>I’ll explain in depth why the context window is so crucial, but for now think of a language model as having two different kinds of memory: long-term parametric memory based on its training runs, and short-term memory—the context window—where it focuses on new information that the user supplies. GPT-2, introduced in 2019, had 1.5 billion parameters; the breakthrough model GPT-3 increased the parametric memory to 175 billion parameters, slightly more than a 100x increase; GPT-4 is rumored to be roughly 10X bigger than GPT-3. In other words, in the four years of technological progress between 2019 and 2023, we saw a 1,000-fold increase in the long-term memory of one of the leading models.</p>
<p>Now compare that timeline to what has happened with the context window. GPT-3 (and Google’s PALM model from that period) had a context window of just over 2,000 “tokens,” which translates to about 1,500 words. That was the limit of new information that you could share with the most advanced language models, circa 2022. Just two years later, Google introduced a new version of Gemini that featured a context window of two <em>million</em> tokens. It took four years for the language models to increase their long-term memory by a factor of a thousand. But their short-term memory made a comparable improvement in just two years. Anyone who tells you that language models have plateaued since the introduction of ChatGPT is not paying attention to what has happened with the context window. And it turns out that many of the legitimate criticisms that were leveled against language models during the first wave of hype about them were unwittingly responding to how narrow the context window was in those early days.</p>
<p>GPT-3 and PALM seemed impressive at the time, but looking back with two years of hindsight, those models had an obvious flaw: they had a bizarre form of amnesia. So bizarre, in fact, that there are very few cases of anything like it in the history of human mental disorders.</p>
<p>With one notable exception.</p></div><div><h2>. . .</h2><p>At some point in the summer of 1935, in a residential neighborhood in Manchester, Connecticut, a nine-year-old boy named Henry Molaison ran out into the street to retrieve a baseball and was struck by a passing bicyclist. Molaison's head hit the pavement in the collision, but he seemed fine in the immediate aftermath of the accident; the whole event seemed at first to be one of those ordinary childhood scrapes that leaves a bruise for a few days and then is entirely forgotten. But the accident turned out to produce a far more enduring set of effects, transforming both Henry Molaison's life and the modern understanding of how the brain works.</p>
<p>Shortly after the collision, Molaison began having minor seizures that gradually became more severe over the years; by the time he reached adulthood, his <em>grand mal</em> seizures had made it impossible for him to hold down a steady job. In 1953, a neurosurgeon named W.B. Scoville performed an experimental surgery on him in an attempt to eliminate the seizures, removing a significant portion of his medial temporal lobes, including parts of the hippocampus and the amygdala.</p>
<p>The procedure did in fact lessen the intensity of Molaison's seizures, but it left him with a profound and uncanny deficit: an almost complete inability to form new memories. Events that had occurred up to two years before his surgery were preserved in his mind: he could tell you who had won the World Series in 1948, and recount old family stories from his childhood. Because his short-term memory was still intact, he could remember brief snippets of information in real time. But once he ran through the buffer of his short-term memory, the new information was lost to him forever. In conversation with a stranger, Molaison would initially not display any cognitive impairments, but after just a few turns in the exchange, Molaison would lose the thread, and eventually require a re-introduction to the person he had been talking to. Molaison lived in a world without any continuity between the distant past and the immediate present. “He was a very gracious man, very patient, always willing to try these tasks I would give him,” Dr. Brenda Milner, a psychologist who worked with Molaison for many years, recalled after his death in 2008. “And yet every time I walked in the room, it was like we’d never met.”</p>
<p>Molaison's condition sparked a revolution in our understanding of how human memory works, helping scientists understand the distinction between long-term and short-term memories, and pinpointing the regions of the brain that specialized in transforming the fleeting experience of present-tense existence into more durable records. (Christopher Nolan famously turned Molaison's condition into a dramatic device in his breakout film, <em>Memento</em>.) Known during his lifetime only as H.M. in the scientific papers published by the men and women who studied him, Molaison ultimately became "the most important patient in the history of brain science," according to his obituary in The New York Times.<br>
<!-- -->Molaison by all accounts remained a genial conversationalist for the rest of his life, engaged and coherent when you were within the window of his short-term memory, capable of drawing from a long-term archive of facts and ideas formed pre-surgery. But there was something obviously broken about him. The window of the present tense was too short for him to do anything productive with his life. Trapped in a perpetual present, he was incapable of many cognitive and emotional tasks that are central to what it means to be human: forming lasting new relationships, learning new concepts, following complicated narratives.</p>
<p>A large language model differs from a human brain in many fundamental ways. But the tragic case of Patient H.M. gives us a useful analogy for understanding what has happened to the state of the art of AI over the past two years. Those of us who first played around with GPT-3 in the 2021-22 period were interacting with the software equivalent of post-surgery Henry Molaison: the language model seemed to possess a vast (if often unreliable) knowledge of the world, along with an impressive command of language. But it was incapable of assimilating new information, or carrying on a coherent conversation. You could give it short instructions and it would do its best to follow them given the information stored in its long-term parametric memory. But it couldn’t follow extended narratives or explanations. The buffer of its memory was just over a thousand words; exceed that buffer and it would forget whatever information you had shared at the outset of the exchange. “Talking” with GPT-3 was like Brenda Milner talking with H.M.: the sentences were engaging and semantically coherent, but after every short exchange, you had to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>This wasn’t commented on enough at the time in the popular press, but in a very real sense the explosion of interest in AI after the launch of ChatGPT in December of 2022 was more a product of the context window expanding than it was some advance in the model’s “general” intelligence. ChatGPT had 8K of context – four times that of its predecessor GPT-3. The extra context allowed OpenAI to quietly fill the model’s short-term memory with your conversation history. Each time you posed a question to ChatGPT, the model was fed both your query and the preceding turns in the conversation—as many turns as would fit in 8K worth of context (roughly 5,000 words.) The magic of ChatGPT was, in a sense, the magic of seeing the story of Henry Molaison’s life in reverse: a form of intelligence trapped in a perpetual present, constantly forgetting something that was mentioned only a few seconds before, then miraculously able to maintain new facts or ideas over a longer period of time, thanks to an expanded context window. You could tell ChatGPT a new story in one exchange, and then discuss something else, and then make a passing reference back to the original story, and ChatGPT would pick up the thread without requiring any additional reminders. Or it could guide you through an explanation of a complex topic, and remember the first stages of its instruction, building up the scaffolding of an explanation like an accomplished teacher. All those new possibilities emerged out of just a fourfold increase in the context window.</p>
<p>But an expanded context window generates much more than just conversational fluidity. Language models are far less likely to hallucinate about information included in their context window. In a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>New Yorker</em> essay</a> in early 2023, the sci-fi author Ted Chiang famously described language models as a “blurry JPEG of the Web.” It was an apt analogy—for the model’s <em>parametric</em> memory. But the analogy breaks down when applied to information stored in the context window. Facts, concepts, narrative sequences, arguments—all are captured much more accurately when they are conveyed to the model via short-term memory instead of long-term training. When long-context models were first introduced in early 2024, many of the public demonstrations focused on this factual reliability, in what are sometimes called “needle in a haystack” tests, where the model answers a question about a specific fact buried in a large corpus of material. This form of information retrieval is a defining capability of <a href="http://notebooklm.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NotebookLM</a>, the AI-powered research and writing tool I have been developing with Google, which will not only give accurate and nuanced information based on the sources that you have uploaded into the model’s context window, but it will also supply inline citations documenting exactly which passages from your original source material were relevant to each part of its answer. NotebookLM is less a “blurry JPEG of the Web,” and more a high-resolution snapshot of your documents that you can inspect in granular detail.</p></div><div><h2>. . .</h2><p>Those “needle-in-a-haystack” demonstrations were impressive given the language models’ much-deserved reputation for just making stuff up. But they only captured a small sliver of the kinds of tasks that long contexts now make possible. When you put an entire book inside the context window of a model, you are not just giving the model a collection of isolated facts and ideas that can be retrieved through your queries. Because the model can “focus” on the entire text, it is capable of answering questions about crucial narrative elements or chains of cause-and-effect that can only be properly grasped when you have access to the entire sequence of the information.</p>
<p>In early 2024, when I first got access to an initial Gemini million-token context model, one of the first tests I ran was uploading the full text of <em>The Infernal Machine</em>, which at that point had not yet been published, and asking questions about the plot of the book. The fact that the book was still in manuscript form was crucial to the experiment, because it meant that there was no way the book itself—or any commentary about it—could have found its way into the model’s training data. (Authors actually have an unexpected superpower in the age of AI: they can accurately assess a model’s mastery of a 400-page book better than any collection of human or software raters, which turns out to be a remarkably valuable way of testing the model’s overall sophistication.) Because the book is a work of nonfiction history, some of the facts and events described in it would no doubt be a part of the model’s training set, but the distinct presentation of those facts, and the narrative techniques I used to convey them, would only be present in the model’s context window. And so one of the first questions I asked was specifically about those narrative techniques. It was a deliberately challenging question, in that it revolved around <em>missing</em> information—not so much “find the needle in the haystack” as it was “identify the needle that <em>should</em> be in the haystack but that someone seems to have deliberately removed.” Here’s what I asked:</p>
<p><em>I'm interested in the way Johnson uses suspense to keep the reader's attention in this book. Can you list 4 examples of places where Johnson alludes to some future event but deliberately withholds information about what is coming to pique the reader's interest? Include direct quotes and chapters, and explain Johnson's technique and what future event he is alluding to?</em></p>
<p>As I requested, Gemini returned four exemplary instances of foreshadowing from the book. For the sake of brevity, I’ll just share the first one:</p>
<p><em>1. Preface:</em></p>
<p><em>"But the clash between the anarchists and the NYPD was not just visible in the frenetic activity inside the Identification Bureau itself. To see it in its full scope, you needed to leave the file cabinets and the fingerprint studios behind, walk out the plate glass doors into the hall, venture down a set of fire stairs into the darkened hallways of the basement. There you would have seen a cheap suitcase, leaning against a doorway. Below the muffled hum of activity in the Identification Bureau directly above, if you listened very intently, you might just have heard the quiet metronome of a ticking clock."</em></p>
<p><em>Technique: Johnson paints a vivid picture of a suspicious suitcase in the basement of the NYPD headquarters, hinting at its potential danger with the "quiet metronome of a ticking clock." He deliberately avoids revealing the suitcase's contents or its connection to the story, leaving readers with a sense of unease and anticipation.</em></p>
<p><em>Future Event: This foreshadows the bombing of the NYPD headquarters later in the book.</em></p>
<p>Whenever we talk about language models “understanding” something, the terminology inevitably sets off alarm bells because human understanding is inexorably bound up in consciousness and self-awarenesss, experiences that language models almost certainly do not have. But it is hard to read Gemini’s response to my question about foreshadowing and not come away with the sense that the model is capable of something very close to human understanding, just without any “inner life” of sentience. The question demands a nuanced literary sense of when the author is leaving something out in a provocative way; if you read the passage from the book—which the model quotes verbatim, by the way, a feat that would have confounded state-of-the-art models just two years ago—you can see that the sentences about the suitcase in the hallway contain no obvious flags to suggest that something is missing. There’s a suitcase, leaning against a doorway. There’s a ticking sound coming out of it. Those are just declarative facts. But a sophisticated reader infers that this particular configuration of facts—and the author’s reluctance to go further and explain what exactly is making that ticking sound—creates an aura of suspense. If you don’t pick up on that missing information, you are not understanding the passage. But if you <em>do</em> note that the author is holding something back with the presumed intent of revealing it later—as Gemini does in this exercise—you <em>are</em> understanding it.</p>
<p>But the most astonishing part of the answer, I think, is the connection it (correctly) makes to the bombing at the NYPD headquarters. That is an event that unfolds <em>two hundred pages</em> <em>later</em> in the book. But because the entire text of the book fits inside the context window, the model is able to describe the relationship between ticking time bomb enigmatically introduced in the very first pages and its eventual detonation two-thirds of the way through the book. And if you asked the model to explain the main sequences of events that caused that bomb to be placed in the NYPD headquarters, it would be able to do that as well, <em>because the entire narrative is captured in its short-term memory.</em></p>
<p>This same long-context understanding enables the game we began with. To generate a playable and faithful interactive adventure based on <em>Infernal Machine</em>, you have to be able to track the sequence of events in the plot, and the sequence of events in the game. It’s not enough to just have a collection of facts about the crime scene and the state of forensics in 1911; you need to understand how one event leads to another: finding a clue, analyzing it for fingerprints, making a match, bringing in the suspect for questioning, and so on. And, perhaps most impressively, you have to be able to manage two distinct timelines at once: the factual narrative of the book, and the improvised narrative of the game. A “needle in a haystack” test doesn’t capture any of this sophistication. What’s remarkable about a long context model is not that it can find a metaphoric needle hidden in a pile of straw. What’s remarkable is that it can see the <em>entire haystack</em>.</p></div><div><h2>. . .</h2><p>Long context windows enable another critical feature: personalization. Gemini and Claude and GPT-4 may have read the entire Internet, as the saying goes, but they know nothing about you. They have not read the marketing plan your team is working on, or your personal journals, or the Dungeon &amp; Dragons campaign that you’ve designed. But put those documents inside the context window of the model and it will instantly become an expert in the nuances of that material. From the very beginning of the NotebookLM project in the summer of 2022, we were focused on this idea of giving the user more control over what went in the context window. Central to that project was what we came to call “source-grounding”—sometimes now called RAG, short for retrieval-augmented generation. Instead of simply having an open-ended conversation with a language model, you could define a set of trustworthy sources that were relevant to your work, and behind the scenes, NotebookLM would shuttle information in and out of the model’s context window to keep it grounded in the facts contained in your sources. Over time, we hit upon numerous other ways to play with the model’s context window—most notably our Audio Overviews feature that turns your source material into an engaging podcast-style conversation between two hosts. Audio Overviews are so magical in part because of the underlying audio models that create such realistic voices, but the substance of what those voices say—the source-grounded conversation itself—would be impossible to create without a long context window.</p>
<p>It may sound strange, but just as a word processor is a tool designed to make it easy to create, edit, and format text documents, and a tool like Photoshop is designed to make it easy to manipulate pixels in a digital image, NotebookLM is a tool designed to make it easy to swap different kinds of information in and out of a language model’s context window. That doesn’t sound like much of an advance, but long context turns out to be one of those innovations that opens a lot of new doors. Source grounding was powerful enough when the context window could hold a few thousand words. But a world where models now can focus on millions of words creates entirely new possibilities.</p>
<p>The current state-of-the-art Gemini model can fit roughly 1.5 million words in its context. That’s enough for me to upload the full text of all fourteen of my books, plus every article, blog post, or interview I’ve ever published—and the entirety of my collection of research notes that I’ve compiled over the years. The Gemini team has announced plans for a model that could hold more than 7 million words in its short-term memory. That’s enough to fit everything I’ve ever written, plus the hundred books and articles that most profoundly shaped my thinking over the years. An advanced model capable of holding in focus all that information would have a profound familiarity with all the words and ideas that have shaped my personal mindset. Certainly its ability to provide accurate and properly-cited answers to questions about my worldview (or my intellectual worldview, at least) would exceed that of any other human. In some ways it would exceed my own knowledge, thanks to its ability to instantly recall facts from books I read twenty years ago, or make new associations between ideas that I have long since forgotten. It would lack any information about my personal or emotional history—though I suppose if I had maintained a private journal over the past decades it would be able to approximate that part of my mindset as well. But as reconstruction of my intellectual grounding, it would be unrivaled. If that is not considered material progress in AI, there is something wrong with our metrics.</p>
<p>Having a “second brain” like this—even with a few million words of context—is enormously useful for me personally. When I’m on book tour, I often tell people that publishing a book is a kind of intellectual optical illusion: when you read a book, it seems as though the author has command of an enormous number of facts and ideas—but in reality, the book is a condensation of all the facts and ideas that were in his or her mind at some point over the three years that it took to write the book. At any given moment in time, my own knowledge and recall of the full text of a book I’ve written is much more like a blurry JPEG than an exact reproduction. And my available knowledge of books that I wrote ten or twenty years ago is even blurrier. Now that I have so much of my writing and reading history stored in a single notebook—which I have come to call my “Everything” notebook—my first instinct whenever I stumble across a new idea or intriguing story is to go back to the Everything notebook and see if there are any fertile connections lurking in that archive. That is, in fact, how I got to the story of Henry Molaison that I began with; I was mulling over the themes of short- and long-term memory in the context of AI, and asked the Everything notebook if it had anything to contribute, and the model reminded me of the tragic tale of patient H. M. that I had first read about in the 1990s. Who, exactly, made that connection? Was it me or the machine? I think the answer has to be that it was both of us, via some newly entangled form of human-machine collaboration that we are just beginning to understand.</p></div><div><h2>. . .</h2><p>There’s a further possibility here, an old chestnut of the sci-fi-AI complex that now suddenly seems imminent: downloading entire mindsets, potentially for a fee. I don't mean a <em>Matrix</em>-like system where you can conjure up a conscious experience of other people’s lives at will. That kind of immersive simulation may or may not happen someday; if such a future does come to pass it will require some new leap in our understanding of consciousness itself, not to mention a host of other technological breakthroughs. But a world where you can use AI to draw upon the compiled <em>wisdom</em> of an expert that you trust—that is a world we are living in right now, thanks to the emergence of long context models. This should be good news, professionally speaking, for people who do indeed possess wisdom that other people consider valuable. Seeking advice from an AI grounded in the entire archive of an expert’s career could create an entirely new revenue stream for anybody who makes a living sharing their expertise through existing platforms like books or the lecture circuit. In other words, the AI is not a replacement for your hard-earned expertise; it’s a new distribution medium.</p>
<p>Long context is also a boost for <em>collective</em> intelligence as well. If you assume the average corporate document—a press release, or marketing plan, or minutes from a board meeting—is a few thousand words long, then today’s models can simultaneously hold in their short-term memory close to a thousand documents. A state-of-the-art language model with the ability to instantly recall and generate insights from the most important thousand documents in the history of a company would possess knowledge about that company that would rival that of any single employee, even the CEO. It seems inevitable that anyone trying to make a multi-faceted decision about the future of an organization would want to at least consult such a model. We know from endless studies of social psychology that diverse groups—with different forms of expertise, different pools of knowledge, different cultural backgrounds—tend to make better decisions than homogeneous groups. In a small-context world, you can get some of that diversity from a language model, in that its training data draws from a vast archive of global human knowledge. But a long context model allows you to take that global knowledge and apply it to the unique challenges and opportunities of your own organization. In a matter of years, I suspect it will seem bizarre to draft the specs for a new feature or a company initiative or a grant proposal without asking for feedback from a long-context model grounded in the organization’s history. (And perhaps the public history of its competitors.) It wouldn’t be a replacement for the expertise of the employees; instead, the model would occupy another seat at the table, adding a new kind of intelligence to the conversation, along with a vastly superior recall.</p>
<p>And there’s no reason the organization in question would have to be a corporate entity: maybe it’s a city, or a government agency, or a grassroots advocacy group. Just a year or two ago, asking a small-context model to help chart strategy for, say, a suburban town would have been almost as useless as asking post-surgery Henry Molaison to narrate the preceding six months of his life. Long context gives the model more than just the reasoning and linguistic fluency that emerges through the training process; long context gives the model a specific history to draw from, the idiosyncratic sequence of events that make up the life cycle of any organization or community. Grounded in a long-context history, models are now capable of going beyond just answering factual questions or giving feedback on proposed plans. You might ask the model to identify patterns in a company’s archive to help simulate the way customers or clients would respond to a new product. Or you could draw on the long-context understanding of a city to conduct scenario planning exercises to simulate the downstream consequences of important decisions. Given everything we know about the power of learning through play, you might even take all that contextual history and turn it into a game.</p>
<p>All of which suggests an interesting twist for the near future of AI. In a long-context world, maybe the organizations that benefit from AI will not be the ones with the most powerful models, but rather the ones with the most artfully curated contexts. Perhaps we'll discover that organizations perform better if they include more eclectic sources in their compiled knowledge bases, or if they employ professional archivists who annotate and selectively edit the company history to make it more intelligible to the model. No doubt there are thousands of curation strategies to discover, if that near future does indeed come to pass. And if it does, it will suggest one more point of continuity between the human mind and a long-context model. What matters most is what you put into it.</p></div><div><p><em>Thanks to Josh Woodward, Adam Bignell, Raiza Martin, Simon Tokumine, Alison Gopnik for feedback on early drafts of this essay, and to Rowan Johnson for his tech support.

<p><em>"You are the host of an interactive role playing mystery game based on the following text. I will give you specific instructions about how to host the game at the end. Here is the text you must use to generate the game for me. {{infernalMachineText}}. Here are my instructions for hosting the game: you are the host of a role-playing game based on the facts and ideas contained in this text describing the investigation of the crime committed by Charles Crispi. I will play the role of pioneering forensic detective Joseph Faurot. Begin with Faurot being brought to the crime scene by Officer Fitzgerald. Let me explore the crime scene and discover the fingerprints on the pane of glass on my own; don't give that crucial clue away immediately. Set up scenes, explain historical context, but also allow me to explore the world from Faurot's POV. In general, try to give me clearly defined puzzles to solve (like, for instance, finding the fingerprints on the pane of class.) At all points try to keep within the boundaries of what happened factually, as conveyed in chapter. The only way for me to solve the case is by discovering the fingerprints on the glass pane, and then taking them down to NYPD headquarters to analyze them, and then finding the match with Crispi. If I steer the narrative too far off course through my actions as Faurot, try to subtly craft the events of the narrative/adventure so that they return to the factual timeline of events. But also give me some flexibility in charting my own course. In your opening statement, convey my goal in the mission, which is to use my scientific detective skills to correctly identify the suspect. Explain that I have to identify the suspect in less than ten actions. Explain that at any time I can use one of my actions to ask for help, or ask for historical or biographical context. Do not give me a list of actions to choose from unless I specifically ask for one. Be a compelling guide/host/DM for me, as well as a great history teacher. Go out of your way to give me historical or scientific context so that I can learn about the history of policework and forensic science as I am playing. Let me know how many actions I have left with each turn of the game. I win the game when my evidence leads to the arrest of Charles Crispi, but if I use more than 10 actions, I lose. Whether I win or lose, mention at the end that I can always hit refresh to try playing again."</em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>Can urban intersections be designed in such a way that motor traffic, cycling and walking flow smoothly and that the potential conflicts of these very different types of traffic crossing each other’s paths are made less complicated and less dangerous? In my opinion the answer is “yes”. Intersections are most important in making cycling safer and more attractive. They can be the weakest link in the chain that is your journey and one nasty junction can put people off cycling. In this week’s post I would like to show you a common intersection between a distributor road with protected cycleways and a smaller neighbourhood access street. How do the Dutch design an intersection between two streets like that and how does everything work?</p>

<p>I would like to emphasise that this intersection is not special in any way. You can find many similar examples all over the country. That is because the design features stem from the design manuals which are used throughout the country. This particular intersection is in ʼs-Hertogenbosch, between the recently rebuilt <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/the-bartenbrug-fiasco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bartenbrug</a>, that I wrote about earlier, and the <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/dutch-service-streets-and-cycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graafseweg</a>, a main street with service streets, that I also wrote about before. This distributor road has a speed limit of 50km/h, a surface of black asphalt and dedicated cycle infrastructure. Cycling takes place shared with cars on the service street and also on completely separated cycleways connecting the service street parts. The neighbourhood access street has a surface of bricks and a speed limit of 30km/h. The traffic volume here is low, since only residents will use this street. That makes mixing traffic possible and therefore there are no protected cycleways in the side street.</p>

<p>The intersection feels like a T-junction, but in fact it is a 4 arm-crossroads. The fourth arm, however, is a very minor residential street and that arm of the intersection is therefore designed differently. With far less turning movements, meaning far less potential conflicts, it is not necessary that the cycleway bends out the way it does for on the other side of the street with the crossing of the more important neighbourhood access road. Due to its different nature I will not discuss that fourth arm in this post. Other typical design features of the intersection are the differences in road surface and a split main street. Splitting the lanes for the two directions leads to room for refuge islands in the centre and a big central area where turning motor vehicles can wait out-of-the-way of vehicles that go straight-on. There is also enough space between the main road and its parallel cycleway, where drivers of cars wanting to turn into the side street can wait for people cycling, again, out-of-the-way of other traffic. The entire crossroads is raised to emphasise this area as a point of potential conflict at which people need to pay attention. There are of course yield signs in the side street, complimented with shark’s teeth in the surface. Last but not least the cycleway surface continues over the crossing, to make very clear cycling has priority over motor traffic in the side street. There is but one thing missing here: there should have been elephant’s feet in the surface alongside the cycleway on the crossing itself. I have no idea why they are omitted here, but maybe the city thought the contrast between the red asphalt of the cycleway and the reddish-brown bricks of the side street is already big enough as it is. What is perhaps also striking is the fact that there are no traffic signals. The Dutch generally feel that traffic signals are a last resort and that they should be used with care. Even the <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/traffic-lights-in-s-hertogenbosch-an-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic signal expert of this city of ’s-Hertogenbosch</a> is convinced that people are much better at negotiating who goes first than you can ever arrange with traffic signals. Without traffic signals people really must interact here, but their decisions are made easy by the clear design features of the intersection.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the intersection from the viewpoint of the different type of road users.</p>
<p><strong>1. Motorists</strong></p>
<p>The intersection is crystal clear for drivers of motorised vehicles. On the main road they drive on black asphalt. That signals it is a 50km/h priority road. Parking is not allowed on the main roadway. This improves sight lines and it also signals that this is a main route. When drivers approach this intersection, even on the main road, they experience a speed bump, forcing them to slow down. They will also notice the two traffic lanes split with a space in between. This is to signal that attention needs to be given to turning traffic and the possibility of pedestrians crossing the street. There are no zebra crossings here, so there is no need to give pedestrians or any other road user the right of way. That changes the minute a driver would like to turn here. In that case priority must first be given to oncoming other motor traffic. The corner has a tight radius, so speed must really come down. For a left turn, a driver can wait out-of-the-way of other traffic in the median. This central waiting space is 6 metres wide, so there is more than enough space for even a larger vehicle. Once that stage is sorted, or when drivers make a right turn, the driver has to deal with crossing the cycleway. This crossing needs to be at least 5 metres from the main roadway, at this particular location it is 5.5 metres. That space reduces the blind spot to an absolute minimum, even for truck drivers. The cycleway is continuous and there are yield signs and yield markings (the shark’s teeth in the surface). Fortunately, thanks to the distance from the roadway, a driver can wait out-of-the-way again. The driver can look for pedestrians at the same time. Even though the driver is now at a straight angle, he or she is still making a turn and turning traffic must let pedestrians go first, because they are considered traffic on the same road and going straight-on. A driver may only continue when there are no pedestrians or people cycling.</p>

The yield sign and the shark’s teeth in the surface make that clear. Also note the sign “end of the 30km/h zone” of the residential street. The main road has a speed limit of 50km/h. This is the blanket speed limit in the built-up area and it is therefore almost never indicated.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you approach from the side street, as a driver, the order of dealing with other traffic is different, but the priority is similar. First you will notice a speed bump. The complete intersection is on a raised table. Pedestrians would not have priority if the street was level, but now that it isn’t the “exit construction” rule could apply and in that case a crossing pedestrian would have priority. But for that rule to apply the footway should be continuous, and that is not the case here. As a driver I would let a pedestrian go first at all time, to avoid any misunderstandings. You need to wait for other traffic anyway. As a pedestrian I would see whether a driver lets me go first or not. That way it doesn’t really matter whether you know the exact rule or not. What is very clear, is that people crossing on a bicycle have priority. Once you have dealt with that crossing you finally reach the main road. All traffic there, whether going straight-on or turning, has priority. You must wait until everything is clear and then you can turn into the main street.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cyclists</strong></p>
<p>When you ride on the cycleway alongside the main road it is clear that you have priority over all motor traffic, whether it turns across your path from the main road or whether it comes from the side street. The cycleway bends out, but the turns are not sharp, so you only have to slightly decrease your speed to take these curves. That way you can also make sure all other road users saw you. Preferably by looking them in the eyes one by one. Pedestrians who would want to cross the cycleway must wait for you to pass. They do not have the right of way.</p>

<p>If you were to turn into the side street on a bicycle you would have to let pedestrians crossing that side street go first. I would also do that if I were to cycle from that side street onto the cycleway of the main road. Even though pedestrians don’t officially have that priority here. When you want to turn left, onto the cycleway alongside the main road, you need to cross that main road first. In that case you can also do that in two stages, exactly like the motor traffic drivers do. First you deal with traffic coming from the left. Once that lane is clear you can go to the central waiting area and once there are no vehicles coming from the right you can cross that lane as well and turn into the cycleway.</p>

<p><strong>3. Pedestrians</strong></p>
<p>It could already be clear from the above paragraphs what the rights of pedestrians are. But I’d like to repeat everything from the view of a pedestrian nevertheless. When you walk straight-on on the main road you will have to cross the side street. For traffic turning into that side street from the main road, whether motor vehicles or people on bicycles, it is certain that you must get the right of way from those road users. The ground rule is namely, that turning traffic must give way to traffic going straight-on on the same road. And in this case pedestrians are consided traffic. It is a bit different for traffic from the side street, that is obviously not on the same road. And as explained previously, the tricky part is the fact that the intersection is raised, but that at the same time the footway is not continuous. Often when road users experience a level change in their path they must give priority, when they exit a driveway for instance. But that also goes for intersections that have a continuous and raised footway. I’m pretty sure many in the Netherlands would not be 100% certain about the priority here, or they think it is different from what it really is. To prevent problems due to such misunderstandings it is best to look the other road user in the eyes, read what they are going to do and act accordingly.</p>

There are no kerbs. This makes it also easy to cross in a wheel chair or pushing a stroller. For people with impaired vision there are tactile markings in the surface, indicating the outer edge of the road.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to crossing the main road, everything is plain and simple again. As a pedestrian that crossing is divided into four parts. First you cross the cycleway. You must wait for the cycleway to be clear, because you have no priority. That would be different if there were zebra stripes, in that case you would have priority. The cycleway is 2.3 metres wide. That means you can get to the other side in 3 to 4 steps, so you need only a little gap in the stream of people cycling. There is a waiting space between the cycleway and the first lane of the roadway. There you can wait for a gap in motor traffic, because, here too, you have no priority due to the absence of a zebra crossing. The motor traffic lane is 3.3 metres wide here, a pretty standard width. That means most people will be able to cross this lane in 4 to 5 steps. This means you also only need a small gap in the motor traffic flow. That is one reason why you see so much movement in the video. Nobody really needs to stop for longer times. Once you have also walked the 5 metres of the central traffic island, you can deal with traffic coming from the opposite direction. First one lane of motor traffic and then the cycleway. The crossing is completely level. This makes crossing the road easy for people in wheel chairs or mobility scooters and for parents with a stroller.</p>

<p>This type of intersection is perfectly clear for all road users. Mainly because all the moments and locations, where you have to negotiate the right of way with different types of other road users, are separated. You can make one decision at the time and then quickly move to the next point. This makes that traffic can flow smoothly in a safe way.</p>

<p><em>In this week’s video I explain how a typical Dutch intersection works.</em></p>
<h5>You may have noticed that I numbered the types of traffic and that we Dutch distinguish <em>three</em> different types of traffic. Not only do we acknowledge we have three types, we also design our infrastructure specifically for these three types of traffic. As Tim Burns, Perth Biker, noticed, this is what sets the Dutch apart from most of the world and <a href="http://bicycleperth.blogspot.nl/2014/06/australia-start-counting-to-three.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote an interesting post about it</a> years ago. Always good to remember this key element of the Dutch traffic system!</h5>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently stumbled upon an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5123f38e050c5ee7130d459ea247d998a838b5a1/src/net/http/request.go#L1199">intriguing comment</a>
while exploring the Go codebase.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed."</p></blockquote>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>e <span>*</span>MaxBytesError<span>)</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>	<span>// Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed.</span>
</span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>"http: request body too large"</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Prior to this, I had never heard of Hyrum's law.</li>
<li>A quick search revealed that it is a principle
named after <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hyrumwright.org/">Hyrum Wright</a>, a software engineer at Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">"law"</a> is simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all
observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, any behavior that can be observed in code — whether intentional or accidental —
will eventually become something that someone, somewhere, relies on.</p>
<p>So in the code above, the author is acknowledging that the error message cannot be changed because
it is likely being relied upon by someone, somewhere. Even though it might seem trivial to tweak the
error message, doing so could cause unintended issues for anyone relying on this specific message.
In this case, a seemingly small change could break existing code where someone depends on the exact
phrasing of "http: request body too large".</p>
<p>For example, here are some open source codebases that will be affected if the error message is changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://grep.app/search?q=http%3A%20request%20body%20too%20large&amp;filter%5Blang%5D%5B0%5D=Go">http: request body too large</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn't the only instance. I found similar comments referencing Hyrum's Law in Go's

<p>TBH, this whole thing reminds me of how JavaScript's evolution over the years has been heavily shaped by
widespread reliance on all sorts of quirky, unintended behaviors, which became de facto standards. Now, I finally
know what to refer to this phenomenon as — <strong>Hyrum's Law.</strong></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts"><span></span></a>Final thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good reminder to be careful when changing code others might depend on—and to try designing things in a way that doesn't accidentally
lock in weird quirks.</li>
<li>And even better, to design systems in a way that minimizes the chances of unintended behaviors being relied upon in the first place.</li>
<li>After all, you know the saying: "All it takes is one small change to... something something..." I don't remember the whole quote.</li>

        <h2>The First Real-Time, Frame-Level Moving Control for Realistic World Simulation!</h2>
        <p><strong>How close are we to realizing the vision of <em>The Matrix (1999)</em>, where AI crafts a fully
            immersive, interactive world, blurring the line between reality and illusion?</strong> Imagine a limitless
          digital universe, created in real-time with visuals that rival reality itself. This project is a pioneering
          step toward that vision—a first glimpse into humanity’s own "Matrix."</p>
        <p> Our system breaks new ground in world simulation by delivering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frame-level precision</strong> in user interaction, matching the responsiveness portrayed in the
            film.</li>
          <li><strong>AAA-level visuals</strong> for immersive scenes nearly indistinguishable from reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Infinite generative capacity</strong> for endless exploration, surpassing the limits of current
            video models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Curious?</strong> Read on to explore the technology powering <em>The Matrix</em> and experience the
          feel of a self-sustaining digital universe!</p>

      <h4>Comparison of Recent Generative Models for Game Simulation</h4>
      <p>
        <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> distinguishes itself as a foundation model capable of generating infinitely
        long videos with AAA game quality, high resolution, frame-level real-time control, and robust domain
        generalization. Here, * indicates concurrent work with <em>The Matrix</em>, and supervised/unsupervised refers
        to the video data with/without true control signal.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Interactive Module</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/interactive.png" alt="Interactive Module"></p><div>
      <p,>
        The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> consists of an Embedding block and a cross-attention layer, translating keyboard inputs into natural language commands for video generation. For example, pressing <code>W</code> becomes “The car is driving forward” in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> or “The man is moving forward and looking up” in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> when combined with upward mouse movement. For unlabeled data, a default description, “The camera is moving in an unknown way,” is applied.
        To enhance robustness, during training, we randomly replace labeled keyboard inputs with the default sentence with a probability q = 0.1.
        Before training, the base DiT model is warmed up using game and real-world data, fine-tuning a LoRA weight. This ensures the Interactive Module focuses on learning interactions and movement patterns, rather than simply fitting the video.
      
    </p,></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Swin-Denoise Process Model</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/swindpm.png" alt="Swin-DPM"></p><div>
        <p,>
          Traditional DiT models generate only short videos due to high computational costs and memory demands of attention mechanisms over extended durations. To overcome this, we propose the <strong>Shift-Window Denoise Process Models</strong> (<strong>Swin-DPM</strong>), leveraging a sliding temporal window to handle dependencies effectively and enable long or infinite video generation.
          As shown in the <strong>Figure</strong>, the Swin-DPM processes video tokens in a queue using denoising steps. Tokens are cached after denoising, maintaining continuity between windows. This fine-tuned model builds on pre-trained DiT, where the first window of tokens is used for warmup, and loss is computed only on subsequent tokens.
          At inference, warmup tokens are discarded, and video generation begins from the (w+1)-th token, enabling efficient and continuous video generation.
        
    </p,></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Training Process</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/trainprocess.png" alt="Interactive Module"></p><div>
      <p,>
        The training process of <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> begins with a pretrained video DiT backbone. The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> is first warmed up with data from the <strong>GameData Platform</strong> using unsupervised LoRA to focus on movement rather than visuals. Subsequently, precise frame-level control is achieved through targeted training. With <strong>Swin-DPM</strong> enabling infinite-length generation and <strong>Stream Consistency Models (SCMs)</strong> ensuring real-time speeds, <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> delivers groundbreaking video simulations.

      <h2>Generate Infinte-Horizon <em>The Matrix</em> World</h2>
        <p>Current state-of-the-art DiT-based video generation models (e.g., CogVideo, Open-Sora) are limited to
            producing videos just a few seconds long, making them insufficient for creating
            an infinite-horizon world. <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> overcomes this limitation by introducing
            Swin-DPM, which significantly extends the receptive
            field of attention computations while maintaining the same computational cost.
            This innovation enables the generation of high-quality, super-long-duration videos with consistent visuals,
            all within an achievable compute budget.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>On May 21, 1946, the Canadian physicist Louis Slotin was demonstrating to several other Los Alamos scientists how to do a criticality experiment. Slotin wasn’t really </span><em>doing</em><span> an experiment at the time, in the sense of taking careful scientific measurements — he was simply showing how one would do them, because he was about to leave the laboratory to be part of the assembly team for the first postwar nuclear weapons test at the Bikini atoll, and they were going to be taking over the experimental work for him while he was gone. In front of him was a beryllium hemisphere (a neutron reflector), with a plutonium weapon core inside of it. In his left hand he held another beryllium hemisphere, with his thumb reaching into a hole in the top, and using a screwdriver as leverage, he carefully lowered the top hemisphere over the core. As he did so, the neutrons exiting the core began to reflect back into it, increasing the overall reactivity of the system. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg" width="1456" height="1102" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1102,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2062148,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14cdf3f-092d-475e-9b2c-870296b18c2d_3000x2270.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A recreation of the Slotin accident, in the same room, at the same table, even possibly the same screwdriver.

The top hemisphere slid over the plutonium, and it tipped just slightly over the edge of prompt criticality, creating a brief but intense nuclear reaction that showered Slotin and those around him with radiation and created a brief flash of blue light in the air around them. In less than a second, Slotin had reflexively knocked the top hemisphere off, and the reaction had stopped, but it was too late: he was walking dead, having absorbed enough radiation to kill him horribly and painfully within nine days.</p><p><span>The story of the so-called “Demon Core,” which was involved in two criticality accidents —&nbsp;the one that killed Slotin, and another, different accident that killed another scientist, Harry Daghlian, a year before —&nbsp;is part of the lore of the atomic age.

I am not exceptionally well-versed in anime or manga tropes, but I think the “obvious” reading of this is a classic case of “unexpected juxtaposition creates humor.” That is, moving something from one context (“Demon Core,” radiation experiment, horrible death) into another (cute, anime, girls) creates something that feels novel and unusual. One could no doubt analyze many different dimensions of juxtaposition at work here, including the gender roles: Slotin was not just male, but the entire accident was caused by the sort of risk-taking bravado (which had he been explicitly warned about) that anyone who has spent time as or around young men recognizes immediately. So having a cute Japanese schoolgirl performing this very male-coded experiment is quite a switch in tone — and one that probably also is dually resonant with the “geeky boy” demographic that I suspect is largely the primary “receiver” and “transmitter” of the meme.</span></p><p><span>The Slotin accident has also achieved, in recent years, that “sweet spot” of “if you know, you know” virality: it’s not </span><em>so</em><span> well-known that everyone would get it, but it’s also not </span><em>so </em><span>obscure that only dedicated wonks or experts would know about it (a reference to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Kelley_criticality_accident" rel="">Kelley accident</a><span>, or the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1" rel="">SL-1 accident</a><span>, would be probably too deep a cut to go viral). </span></p><p>I have not made a full survey or taxonomy of these memes; there are dozens and dozens, if not more. The ones above I would categorize as “entirely new drawings,” in which the Demon Core pictures are used as reference, but the entire style is novel. There also cases where the Demon Core pictures (or self-serious drawings/renderings of the experiment) are added to existing meme formats, such as the “pondering my orb” wizard:</p><div><figure><a

The bomb is no stranger to such treatment, of course&nbsp;—&nbsp;consider </span><em>Dr. Strangelove</em><span>, or Tom Lehrer — although my sense is that the “Demon Core” memes are not, in any serious way, making conscious “interventions” in how people think about the risks of the nuclear world.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>David Bessis was drawn to mathematics for the same reason that many people are driven away: He didn’t understand how it worked. Unlike other creative processes, like making music, which can be heard, or painting pictures, which can be seen, math is for the most part an internal process, hidden from view. “It sounded a bit magical. I was intrigued,” he said.</p>
<p>His curiosity eventually led him to pursue a doctoral degree in math at Paris Diderot University in the late 1990s. He spent the next decade studying geometric group theory before leaving research mathematics and founding a machine learning startup in 2010.</p>
<p>Through it all, he never stopped questioning what it actually means to do math. Bessis wasn’t content to simply solve problems. He wanted to further interrogate — and help other people understand — how mathematicians think about and practice their craft.</p>

<p>In 2022, he published his answer — a book titled <em>Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity</em>, which he hopes will “explain what’s going on inside the brain of someone who’s doing math,” he said. But more than that, he added, “this is a book about the inner experience of humans.” It was translated from the original French into English earlier this year.</p>
<p>In <em>Mathematica</em>, Bessis makes the provocative claim that whether you realize it or not, you’re constantly doing math — and that you’re capable of expanding your mathematical abilities far beyond what you think possible. Eminent mathematicians like Bill Thurston and Alexander Grothendieck didn’t owe their mathematical prowess to intrinsic genius, Bessis argues. Rather, they became such powerful mathematicians because they were willing to constantly question and refine their intuitions. They developed new ideas and then used logic and language to test and improve them.</p>
<p>According to Bessis, however, the way math is taught in school emphasizes the logic-based part of this process, when the more important element is intuition. Math should be thought of as a dialogue between the two: between reason and instinct, between language and abstraction. It’s also a physical practice of sorts, like yoga or martial arts — something that can be improved through training. It requires tapping into a childlike state and embracing one’s imagination, including the mistakes that come with it.</p>

                            <p>“The mathematician’s message is for everyone: Look at what you can do if you don’t give up on your intuition,” Bessis said.</p>

    <p>Everyone, Bessis says, has some experience with this process, meaning that everyone has practice thinking like a mathematician. Moreover, everyone can, and should, try to improve their mathematical thinking — not necessarily to solve math problems, but as a general self-help technique.</p>
<p><em>Quanta </em>spoke with Bessis about what mathematicians are really doing when they’re “doing math,” and what it means for math to be a form of self-help. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you write this book?</strong></h3>
<p>For maybe 20 years, I tried and failed to write it many, many times. Then in 2020, I reread texts that I had read a long time ago — accounts by the mathematicians René Descartes, Alexander Grothendieck and William Thurston. I realized that these three people, who were not connected to one another, were all telling the same story in different ways. That story resonated with what I had been living. After that realization, the book completely crystallized in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>What we can learn from Descartes, Grothendieck and Thurston is that the nature of the mathematical process is not what people think.</p>

                            <p>At its core, Bessis says, mathematics is a game of back-and-forth between intuition and logic, instinct and reason.</p>

    <h3><strong>What do people think?</strong></h3>
<p>That math is a bunch of cryptic symbols on a piece of paper. This is what has been advertised as mathematics for millennia, because that’s what people see. But the whole journey — how you work with things in your mind, how math transforms you — is all secret. It’s not part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Math is a sort of dialogue between these external and internal processes. It is the activity of aligning your inner representation — your intuition — with some logical, external representation. You use a very rigid, crazy-looking formalism to test your intuition, to recalibrate, grow and reinforce it until you feel that you have a good understanding of something.</p>
<h3><strong>You claim that everyone is secretly doing math, even if they don’t realize it.</strong></h3>
<p>You have to force them to become aware of their own mathematical training. Can you see a circle in your mind? Can you make it bigger, smaller? Can you move it around? That’s weird, you know.</p>

    <p>Or say I ask, “What’s a billion minus one?” I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t immediately have the answer in their head. I have to think about it when I want to say it out loud, but I see it in my mind. And I think most people are like that. Even if they don’t see it — it’s not a visual perception — they have a strong feeling of the outcome.</p>
<p>This is really mathematical intuition. It’s obvious to people. But it’s also historical: 2,000 years ago, nobody would have been able to easily answer this question, because they were using Roman numerals.</p>
<p>It proves that what you view as very easy math is actually deep math that you’ve internalized. You learned a very abstract numbering system that transformed your intuition of numbers. It makes you find things completely obvious that 2,000 years ago would have made you look like Einstein. It’s not hardwired. You wired it yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you believe in the notion of a mathematical genius, then?</strong></h3>
<p>It would be dishonest to deny that there are people who are incredibly good at math. There are 5-year-olds who are already genius mathematicians. You can see it: It looks like they’re communicating with aliens from outer space.</p>
<p>But I do not think this is innate, even though it often manifests in early childhood. Genius is not an essence. It’s a state. It’s a state that you build by doing a certain job.</p>
<p>Math is a journey. It’s about plasticity. I am not saying that math is easy. Math is hard. But life, whatever you do, is extremely hard.</p>

                            <p>Bessis is inspired by the practices of mathematical greats like Bill Thurston, Alexander Grothendieck and René Descartes.</p>

    <h3><strong>If it’s not innate, but rather a process, does that mean that with practice I could eventually do math like Thurston?</strong></h3>
<p>No, not Thurston. I don’t think so. But maybe you’ll surprise me. Thurston gave a detailed account of how he decided at a young age to practice this kind of self-education every day. I don’t think you can catch up with that. Grothendieck and Descartes probably started very young, before they were even speaking.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that high school students are often unhappy with math, because they think it requires some innate things that they don’t have. But that’s not true; really it relies on the same type of intuition we use every day.</p>
<h3><strong>So how can one get better at math?</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you spot a disconnect between what your gut is telling you and what is supposed to be rational, it’s an important opportunity to understand something new. And then you can start this game of back-and-forth. Can you articulate your gut instinct and place it within a rational discussion? If there’s still a disconnect, can you visualize why? As you play that game, your imagination will gradually reconfigure. And in the end, if you’re persistent, your instinct and your reason will align, and you will be smarter. This is mathematical thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>What can someone gain by improving their mathematical thinking?</strong></h3>
<p>Joy, clarity and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Children do this all the time. That’s why they learn so fast. They have to. Otherwise, I mean, nothing makes sense. I think this is also why babies are super happy — because they have epiphanies all day long. It’s wonderful.</p>

    <p>For adults, this way of thinking can be very slow. But if you don’t give up, what you can do with your intuition is way beyond your wildest expectations. And this is universal. My book is a life lesson for all creative people, not just those who want to learn mathematical concepts. The mathematician’s message is for everyone: Look at what you can do if you don’t give up on your intuition.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you view this as a self-help book?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m actually more extreme than just saying this is a self-help book. I’m saying that, in a way, mathematics itself is a self-help technique.</p>
<h3><strong>How so?</strong></h3>
<p>Mathematicians have to be radically honest about what they don’t understand and what they think. That might help them see, for example, that an object is defined the wrong way. Or that a different definition will make a theory simpler. Or that this is not the important notion, that one is.</p>
        
        
<p>There’s something about honesty, about being radically candid, about trying to find ways to articulate what you really feel — it’s super hard. It takes practice.</p>
<p>When you do math, you’re exposed to the human thought process in a way that is really pure. It’s not just about understanding things, but about understanding things in a very childish, deep, naïve, super clear, obvious way. It’s very good training for creativity. It’s a scaffold for your imagination.</p>
<p>When I look at my own life, and the way I managed to overcome personal challenges, I realize that my ability to think in a mathematical way helped. From an emotional standpoint, we all need math.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.denormalized.io/blog/building-databases">https://www.denormalized.io/blog/building-databases</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42200014">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Databases are some of the most complex pieces of software conceived
since the advent of the computing age over half a century ago. [1]
Nearly every piece of technology ends up touching the database in some
way shape or form. Despite the ubiquity of Databases in the software
stack, the vast majority of developers have been conditioned to treat
databases as more or less a <em>black box</em> -- complex dense pieces of
software conjured up by arch wizards and mavens ensconced in the
rarified elite tiers of database companies or places like Google. The
adage for the rest of us as it goes is <em>never attempt to write your own
database</em>.</p>
<p>That said, despite their longevity, we have seen continued innovation in
the space that first started with Hadoop arriving on the scene about 2
decades ago. The ClickBench website now lists over 50+ databases in its
benchmark suite [2] . And that's just the analytics engines. With the
recent trends of rewriting everything big data in Rust [3] not a month
goes by without an interesting new project trending in the Hacker News.
In this post we will take a look at how easy (or hard) it is to build
Databases using Apache Datafusion and whether you <em>can in fact, as a
mere mortal</em> realistically build a custom database and innovate around
the developer experience.</p>
<p>Most modern databases can be disaggregated into compute and storage
layers, with sophisticated query engines responsible for the "compute"
portion of the database. A query engine typically consists of a Query
Parser, Logical Plan generation and then the Physical Plan generation to
run the computations on the Execution Engine. A query generally goes
through multiple optimization phases in the logical plan generation as
well as physical plan generation. No matter what the target use-case of
the end system is, the query engine more or less follows this model.</p>
<p>Given decades of database research that has gone into each of these
individual layers, the bar for writing a functional query engine with
table stakes features remains strikingly high. And you need to nail <em>all
that</em> before you can get around to writing your use-case specific
features. While there are many projects that help you write some of
these layers individually, Apache DataFusion remains the only game in
town that helps you with the entire gamut.</p>
<p>You can think of DataFusion extensible database development toolkit. At
its most basic level, you can use it as a query engine a la DuckDB with
its builtin SQL and Dataframe front ends, while at the same time you can
extend or even wholesale replace different layers to build your own
experience entirely.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post we will walk through how to extend DataFusion
to add your own operators to its execution engine and then weave it
through the Physical and Logical planners and expose it to the frontend.</p>
<h2>Building a top DataFusion</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*jjrNhgIlapa-Ih2P.png" alt="DataFusion architecture"></p>
<p><strong>DataFusion architecture</strong></p>
<p>At Denormalized, we are building a duck db like single node experience
for stream processing applications. While DataFusion does have some
support for unbounded computations, it doesn't have a streaming window
operator. Windows are at the core of stream processing applications,
they provide an easy way to bucket infinite data streams into finite
buckets so that we can apply aggregations over them.</p>
<p>For this tutorial we will implement a simple window operator for
infinite streams. Our operator will have the following signature --</p>
<pre><code>    pub fn window(
			    self
			    group_expr: Vec&lt;Expr&gt;,
			    aggr_expr: Vec&lt;Expr&gt;,
			    window_length: Duration,
			    slide: Option&lt;Duration&gt;,
			    ) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<h2>Writing the Execution Plan</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/execution_plan/trait.ExecutionPlan.html">ExecutionPlan represents</a> a node in the DataFusion Physical plan. This is where
the actual code with our custom computations would go. DataFusions execution model
is pull based, meaning that the execution starts at the sinks and works its
way up the physical plan. Calling the <em>execute</em> method on this trait
produces an asynchronous <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/type.SendableRecordBatchStream.html">SendableRecordBatchStream</a> of record batches
by incrementally deriving a partition of the output by running
computations over Execution Plan's input.</p>
<p>In our use case, <a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/physical_plan/continuous/streaming_window.rs#L423-L427">ExecutionPlan's execute()</a> method returns a struct
<a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/physical_plan/continuous/grouped_window_agg_stream.rs#L62">GroupedWindowAggStream</a> which implements a RecordBatchStream,  a wrapper around
futures::Stream trait. The actual computations should be implemented
within the <em>poll_next()</em> of the Stream implementation.</p>
<pre><code>    impl RecordBatchStream for GroupedWindowAggStream {
	    fn schema(&amp;self) -&gt; SchemaRef {
		    self.schema.clone()
	    }
    }
    
    impl Stream for GroupedWindowAggStream {
    
	    type Item = Result&lt;RecordBatch&gt;;
	    
	    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt;
	    Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {
	    
		    let poll = self.poll_next_inner(cx); // Code to compute the record batch goes
		    here.
	    
	    ...
    
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Here in our example, calling the <em>poll_next_inner</em> for a streaming
window takes care of</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Processing the incoming data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accumulating rows into open windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating the watermark (which is behind a mutex)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening new windows if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing any triggering windows and producing the output
RecordBatches from them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hooking into the Physical Planner</h2>
<p>Having created our custom Execution Plan, we need to make the Physical
Planner aware of its existence. <a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/planner/streaming_window.rs#L69-L173">Implementing the ExtensionPlanner</a> for our
ExtensionPlan is all we need to do here.</p>
<h2>Extending the Logical Plan</h2>
<p>Now that we have the custom Execution Plan implemented along with
ExtensionPlanner, we need to add a companion node to the Logical Plan.
This not only allows us to expose this to the SQL/DataFrame frontends
but also hook into the logical optimizers for optimizations such as the
predicate pushdowns.</p>
<p>In DataFusion we need to first implement a <a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/logical_plan/streaming_window.rs#L28">user defined Logical Plan
Node</a> and then add a <a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/logical_plan/mod.rs#L47-L59">LogicalPlanExtension</a>
to the logical plan builder which exposes this to SQL/DataFrame
frontends.</p>
<h2>Logical Plan to Physical Plan</h2>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the touch point where the logical plan
gets converted into the physical plan. For this, we will implement a
<a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/query_planner.rs#L13-L30">custom QueryPlanner</a> that ensures that the physical planner is initialized with
the custom extensions we wrote for our ExecutionPlan.</p>
<h2>Custom Optimization Rules</h2>
<p>Since our operator implemented a group by aggregation, we need to ensure
that all the rows for a particular group end up in the same partition.
To that end we will add a <a href="https://github.com/probably-nothing-labs/denormalized/blob/f65268972da3a6f21eac0ab4bf3e4ca9b558c6ed/crates/core/src/physical_optimizer/coalesce_before_streaming_window_aggregate.rs#L32">new physical optimization
rule</a> to add a HashPartition operator on our group keys.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Finally, all we need to do is construct a DataFusion session with the
custom QueryPlanner we wrote above as well as the additional physical
optimizer rule we added and voila, now we have our own extended version
of DataFusion.</p>
<pre><code>    let state = SessionStateBuilder::new()
      .with_default_features()
      .with_config(config)
      .with_query_planner(Arc::new(StreamingQueryPlanner {}))
      .with_optimizer_rules(get_default_optimizer_rules()).with_physical_optimizer_rule(Arc::new(EnsureHashPartititionOnGroupByForStreamingAggregates::new(),
      ))
      .build();
</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple urged a federal judge to dismiss the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against it, saying the government’s complaint includes speculative arguments and the government doesn’t plausibly argue it has monopoly power.</p><p>“The court is allowed to use common sense,” countered DOJ counsel Jonathan Lasken at a hearing in New Jersey on Wednesday. “We’re here today based on the idea that it’s not plausible that [Apple] has monopoly power, but instead is at the mercy of supposed global behemoths who are a fraction of its size.”</p><p>The government and more than a dozen states <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">sued Apple earlier this year for maintaining an illegal monopoly</a> in the smartphone market, ultimately driving up prices and locking consumers into its ecosystem. It pointed to five examples of its alleged anticompetitive conduct, including degrading message quality between iPhones and Android phones and limiting third-party smartwatch functionality with the iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211386/apple-motion-to-dismiss-doj-antitrust-lawsuit">Apple has argued</a> the case against it is overly speculative and amounts to a “judicial redesign” of the iPhone. It’s sought to downplay its own influence, saying the government doesn’t allege a large enough smartphone market share to add up to monopoly power. It characterizes the third-party developers who claim they’ve been harmed as “well-capitalized social media companies, big banks, and global gaming developers.”</p><p>US District Court Judge Julien Xavier Neals will now have to decide whether the DOJ’s case against Apple can proceed to a trial in its current form, or whether some — or all — claims should be thrown out. He said he hopes to make that decision by January, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/apple-urges-judge-to-dismiss-us-antitrust-lawsuit-at-early-stage">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>The wildcard, of course, is that a new administration will soon take over, with President-elect Donald Trump’s DOJ continuing the case argued by the agency under President Joe Biden. But Trump and likely members of his administration have dubbed “Big Tech” a persistent enemy, and Trump’s DOJ brought suits against other tech companies in his first term — so Apple likely can’t count on a reprieve.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Trendy weight-loss drugs making headlines for shrinking waistlines may also be shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X24002869">new University of Alberta study</a> whose authors say should serve as a “cautionary tale” about possible long-term health effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>“If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/jrbdyck">Jason Dyck</a>, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/index.html">Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry</a> and a member of the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.”</p>
<p>Dyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Ozempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication.</p>
<p>Using mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells.</p>
<p>Dyck, who is the <a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx">Canada Research Chair</a> in Molecular Medicine and heads up the <a href="http://www.cvrc.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.html">Cardiovascular Research Centre</a>, says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest.</p>
<p>“Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.”</p>
<p>Dyck’s study comes on the heels of a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract">commentary published in the November issue of <em>The Lancet</em></a> by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cprado">Carla Prado</a>, a nutrition researcher in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/agriculture-life-environment-sciences/index.html">Faculty of Agricultural, Life &amp; Environmental Sciences</a> and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing.</p>
<p>“Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says.</p>
<p>For example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes.</p>
<p>As well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system.</p>
<p>“That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates.</p>
<p>Though the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs.</p>
<p>“Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism.</p>
<p>“This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.”</p>
<p>She adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training.</p>
<p>“This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.”</p>
<p>Prado, who is a member of the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/cancer-institute/index.html">Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta</a>, the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-diabetes/index.html">Alberta Diabetes Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-transplant-institute/index.html">Alberta Transplant Institute</a> and the <a href="https://smartinstitute.ca/">Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology</a>, is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.</p>

It continued to operate despite a full-fledged criminal prosecution by the United States, which resulted in the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/">arrest of two alleged operators</a> in Argentina. </p>
<p>These two Russian defendants are <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-z-library-operators-ask-court-to-dismiss-criminal-piracy-indictment-230713/">wanted by the United States</a> and earlier this year a judge approved their extradition. However, according to the most recent information we have, the defendants escaped house arrest and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-admins-escape-house-arrest-after-judge-approves-u-s-extradition-240708/">vanished into thin air</a>.</p>
<p>The roles of the two Russians remain unclear, but they were not vital to the site’s survival. Z-Library continued to expand its reach despite their legal troubles. </p>
<h2>Z-Library Motivations Research</h2>
<p>Z-Library users don’t seem to be hindered by the criminal prosecution either, as they continue to support and use the site. For many, Z-Library is simply a convenient portal to download free books. For others, however, it’s a vital resource to further an academic career. </p>
<p>A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice sheds light on the latter. It looks at the ‘piracy’ motivations of Redditors and students in higher education, specifically when it comes to Z-Library. </p>

<p>The paper, published by Dr. Michael Day of the University of Greenwich, labels the use of Z-Library as ‘Academic Cybercrime’. The findings, however, suggest that students are more likely to draw comparisons with “Robin Hood”.</p>
<p>The research looks at the motivations of two groups; Reddit users and Chinese postgraduate students. Despite the vast differences between these groups, their views on Z-Library are quite similar. </p>
<h2>Redditors’ Responses</h2>
<p>The 134 Reddit responses were sampled from the Zlibrary subreddit, which is obviously biased in favor of the site. However, the reasoning goes well beyond a simple “I want free stuff” arguments.</p>
<p>Many commenters highlighted that they were drawn to the site out of poverty, for example, or they highlighted that Z-Library was an essential tool to fulfill their academic goals. </p>
<p>“Living in a 3rd world country, 1 book would cost like 50%- 80% already of my daily wage,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<p>The idea that Z-Library is a ‘necessary evil’ was also highlighted by other commenters. This includes a student who can barely make ends meet, and a homeless person, who has neither the money nor the space for physical books.</p>
<center><em>Some responses</em></center><br><center></center><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

</center>
<p>The lack of free access to all study materials, including academic journal subscriptions at university libraries, was also a key motivator. Paired with the notion that journal publishers make billions of dollars, without compensating authors, justification is found for ‘pirate’ alternatives. </p>
<p>“They make massive profits. So stealing from them doesn’t hurt the authors nor reviewers, just the rich greedy publishers who make millions just to design a cover and click ‘publish’,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<h2>Chinese Students</h2>
<p>The second part of the study is conducted in a more structured format among 103 postgraduate students in China. This group joined a seminar where Z-Library and the crackdown were discussed. In addition, the students participated in follow-up focus group discussions, while also completing a survey. </p>
<p>Despite not all being users of the shadow library, 41% of the students agreed that the site’s (temporary) shutdown affected their ability to study and find resources for degree learning.</p>
<p>In general, the students have a favorable view toward Z-Library and similar sites, and 71% admit that they have used a shadow library in the past. In line with China’s socialist values, the overwhelming majority of the students agreed that access to knowledge should be free for everyone. </p>
<p>While the students are aware of copyright law, they believe that the need to access knowledge outweighs rightsholders’ concerns. This is also reflected in the following responses, among others. </p>
<blockquote><p><sup>– Z-Library, or a similar website, is helpful to students living in poverty (82% agree).<br>
– Academic textbooks are too expensive, so I can’t afford to buy them as a student (67% agree).<br>
– I have limited access to English medium academic books in my country (63% agree)<br>
– I prefer to download books without restrictions, like [paywalls etc.], as it is difficult (77% agree).</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, Z-Library and other shadow libraries are seen as a viable option for expensive or inaccessible books, despite potential copyright concerns. </p>
<h2>Robin Hood Mentality</h2>
<p>This research sheds an intriguing light on key motivations to use shadow libraries. However, the small sample sizes, selection bias, and specific characteristics of the groups, means that these findings should be interpreted with caution. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael Day, nonetheless, notes that the responses show clear signs of a Robin Hood mentality. Z-Library users evade the publishers’ ‘tax’ on knowledge by downloading works for free. </p>
<p>Overall, the paper suggests that universities and publishers may want to reconsider the status quo and consider making more content freely accessible, taking a page from Z-Library. </p>
<p>“There is need for universities to re-consider the digital divides faced by socioeconomically and digitally disadvantaged students, alongside publishers, who must rethink their approach by making open access research more commonplace and thus pro-human,” the author concludes.  </p>
<p>The paper provides a good example, as it is published under a Creative Commons license and is <a href="https://doi.org/10.53761/90p10x2">freely accessible to all</a>. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/doxx/darkflare">https://github.com/doxx/darkflare</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42198954">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🌒 DarkFlare</h2><a id="user-content--darkflare" aria-label="Permalink: 🌒 DarkFlare" href="#-darkflare"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A stealthy TCP-over-CDN tunnel that keeps your connections cozy and comfortable behind Cloudflare's welcoming embrace.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🤔 What is this sorcery?</h2><a id="user-content--what-is-this-sorcery" aria-label="Permalink: 🤔 What is this sorcery?" href="#-what-is-this-sorcery"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DarkFlare is a clever little tool that disguises your TCP traffic as innocent HTTPS requests, letting them pass through corporate firewalls like a VIP at a nightclub. It's like a tunnel, but with more style and less dirt.</p>
<p dir="auto">It has two parts: a client-side proxy (darkflare-client) that encodes TCP data into HTTPS requests and sends it to a Cloudflare-protected domain, and a server-side proxy (darkflare-server) that decodes the requests and forwards the data to a local service (like SSH on port 22). It’s protocol-agnostic, secure, and uses Cloudflare's encrypted infrastructure, making it stealthy and scalable for accessing internal resources or bypassing network restrictions.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using this remember the traffic over the tunnel is only as secure as the Cloudflare protection. Use your own encryption.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧱 Why CDNs?</h2><a id="user-content--why-cdns" aria-label="Permalink: 🧱 Why CDNs?" href="#-why-cdns"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Services like Cloudflare, Akamai Technologies, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront are not only widely accessible but also integral to the global internet infrastructure. In regions with restrictive networks, alternatives such as CDNetworks in Russia, ArvanCloud in Iran, or ChinaCache in China may serve as viable proxies. These CDNs support millions of websites across critical sectors, including government and healthcare, making them indispensable. Blocking them risks significant collateral damage, which inadvertently makes them reliable pathways for bypassing restrictions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⛓️‍💥 Stop Network Censorship</h2><a id="user-content-️-stop-network-censorship" aria-label="Permalink: ⛓️‍💥 Stop Network Censorship" href="#️-stop-network-censorship"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Internet censorship is a significant issue in many countries, where governments restrict access to information by blocking websites and services. For instance, China employs the "Great Firewall" to block platforms like Facebook and Twitter, while Iran restricts access to social media and messaging apps. In Russia, authorities have intensified efforts to control information flow by blocking virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools that citizens use to bypass censorship.</p>
<p dir="auto">AP NEWS
In such environments, a tool that tunnels TCP traffic over HTTP(S) through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare can be invaluable. By disguising restricted traffic as regular web traffic, this method can effectively circumvent censorship measures, granting users access to blocked content and preserving the free flow of information.</p>

This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.</p>

          </p>
        <p>Internet quality metrics for both countries show changes in measured bandwidth and latency throughout the day on Sunday, but with no sudden anomalous shifts visible around the time of the cable cut. (The loss of connectivity associated with a cable cut potentially manifests itself as an increase in latency and concurrent decrease in bandwidth due to loss of capacity.) The latency graph for Sweden does show an increase in latency, but it began before the cable cut occurred, is similar to a pattern visible several hours earlier, and is matched by an increase in measured bandwidth, so it is unlikely to be related to the cable cut event.</p>

        <p>Less than a day later, the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/c-lion1"><u>C-Lion1 submarine cable</u></a>, which connects Helsinki, Finland and Rostock Germany was <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/helsinki-rostock-subsea-cable-between-finland-and-germany-severed/"><u>reportedly damaged</u></a> during the early morning hours of Monday, November 18. Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/baltic-sea-cables-damage-sabotage-german-minister"><u>said</u></a> that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged. The Finland graphs, week-on-week, show fewer bytes transferred and fewer HTTP requests, but that difference is present before the cable cut at 02:00 UTC. However, the trend of the current line does not change after the cable cut, so the two events would appear unrelated.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>By looking at volume-related metrics, alone, Internet connectivity would appear to be unaffected by the cable cut.</p><p>If, however, we change perspective and look at Internet quality, a brief yet interesting change is visible for Finland around the reported time of the cable damage, though it isn’t clear whether it is related in any way. Just after midnight, median measured bandwidth, previously consistent around 50 Mbps begins to grow, peaking just over 200 Mbps around 03:00 UTC. Around that same time, measured median latency also begins to drop, falling from around 30 ms to a low of 13 ms, also around 03:00 UTC. Median bandwidth returned to normal levels around 06:00 UTC, while latency took about two hours longer to return to normal levels.&nbsp; These observed&nbsp; improvements in bandwidth and latency could have been due to traffic being re-routed to along paths with better connectivity to measurement endpoints, but because the shifts began before the cable damage occurred, and recovered shortly thereafter, that is unlikely to be the root cause.</p><p>In Germany, a brief minor increase in median bandwidth peaked around 02:45 UTC, while no notable changes were observed in latency.</p>

          <p>As we have discussed in multiple prior blog posts (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/not-one-not-two-but-three-undersea-cables-cut-in-jersey"><u>Jersey, 2016</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts"><u>AAE-1/SMW5, 2022</u></a>; <a href="https://blog-cloudflare-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024"><u>WACS/MainOne/SAT3/ACE, 2024</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts/"><u>EASSy/Seacom, 2024</u></a>), cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity, in many cases because they represent a concentrated point of vulnerability, whether for an individual network provider, city/state, or country. These disruptions are often quite lengthy as well, due to the time needed to marshal repair resources, identify the location of the damage, etc. Although it is not always feasible due to financial or geographic constraints, building redundant and resilient network architecture, at multiple levels, is a best practice. This includes the sending traffic over multiple physical cables (both submarine and terrestrial), connecting to multiple peer and upstream network providers, and even avoiding single points of failure in core Internet resources like DNS servers.</p><p>The Cloudflare Radar team continually monitors the status of Internet connectivity in countries/regions around the world, and we share our observations on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"><u>Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</u></a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/cloudflare-radar/"><u>blog.cloudflare.com</u></a>.
