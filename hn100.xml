    <p>TL;DR: 2026 is going to be The Year of The Linux Desktop for me. I haven't booted into Windows in over 3 months on my tower and I'm starting to realize that it's not worth wasting the space for. I plan to unify my three SSDs and turn them all into btrfs drives on Fedora.</p>
<p>I've been merely tolerating Windows 11 for a while but recently it's gotten to the point where it's just absolutely intolerable. Somehow Linux on the desktop has gotten so much better by not even doing anything differently. Microsoft has managed to actively sabotage the desktop experience through years of active disregard and spite against their users. They've managed to take some of their most revolutionary technological innovations (the NT kernel's hybrid design allowing it to restart drivers, NTFS, ReFS, WSL, Hyper-V, etc.) then just shat all over them with start menus made with React Native, control-alt-delete menus that are actually just webviews, and forcing Copilot down everyone's throats to the point that I've accidentally gotten stuck in Copilot in a handheld gaming PC and had to hard reboot the device to get out of it. It's as if the internal teams at Microsoft have had decades of lead time in shooting each other in the head with predictable results.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've had enough. I'm going to go with Fedora on my tower and <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> (or SteamOS) on my handhelds.</p>
<p>I think that Linux on the desktop is ready for the masses now, not because it's advanced in a huge leap/bound. It's ready for the masses to use because Windows has gotten so much actively worse that continuing to use it is an active detriment to user experience and stability. Not to mention with the price of ram lately, you need every gigabyte you can get and desktop Linux lets you waste less of it on superfluous bullshit that very few people actually want.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p></div>
<p>At the very least, when something goes wrong on Linux you have log messages that can let you know what went wrong so you can search for it.</p>

          <p>Tesla published its final production and delivery numbers this morning, and they make for brutal reading. Sales were down almost 16 percent during the final three months of last year, meaning the company sold 77,343 fewer electric vehicles than it did during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/">the same period in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For the entire year, the decline looks slightly better with a drop of 8.6 percent year over year. That means Tesla sold 1,636,129 cars in 2025, 153,097 fewer than it managed in 2024. Which in turn is more than it managed to shift in 2023.</p>
<h2>Sales issues</h2>
<p>Contributing factors to the poor sales are legion. The brand still relies on the Models 3 and Y to an overwhelming extent, and other than a mild cosmetic refresh, neither feels fresh or modern compared with competitors from Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>And Elon Musk’s much-hyped Cybertruck—which was supposed to cost less than $40,000 and go into production in 2021, lest anyone forget—has been a disaster, eclipsing the Edsel. Its failure has taken down another company initiative, Tesla’s “in-house battery cell.” It was initially designed specifically for the Cybertruck, although the CEO later claimed it would be used for static storage as well as EVs. But apparently, it has become the victim of a lack of demand. <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/">Last week</a>, Electrek reported that Tesla’s South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F wrote down its $2.9 billion contract with Tesla to just $7,386. A drop of more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>Musk has not dialed back his embrace of the far right, cratering sales in markets like California and Europe, where EV buyers often use their consciences to guide their wallets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/robots.jpg" alt="Robots illustration">

        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=harder+better+faster+stronger+bpm">Google "harder better faster stronger bpm"</a> and Google’s “AI Overview” will tell you:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Spotify’s metadata database, <a href="https://songbpm.com/@daft-punk/harder-better-faster-stronger">SongBPM</a>, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.</p>

        <p>But I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.</p>

        <p>How do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called <a href="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/">Tempi</a> that shows the music BPM in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.</p>

        <p>Most tempo detection software works basically the same way:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.</li>
            <li>Those levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.</li>
            <li>Another algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately <em>periodicity</em>, in those peaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.</p>

        <p>When I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.</p>
        
        <p>Almost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.</p>

        <p>And that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”</p>

        <p>To get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.</p>
        
        <h3>And that’s actually pretty easy to do…</h3>

        <p>Here’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/venn.png" alt="Venn diagram showing overlap between human and computer capabilities">

        <p>Computers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the <em>exact</em> value with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.</p>

        <p>Here’s how:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.</li>
            <li>Zoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.</li>
            <li>Find the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.</li>
            <li>Measure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.</li>
            <li>Play the song and <em>count</em> all the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then to get the <em>exact</em> tempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / duration</code></pre>

        <p>Computers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that <em>can</em> find the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.</p>

        <p>For the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-first-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the first bookend beat">
            <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-final-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the final bookend beat">
        </p>

        <p>That gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.</p>

        <p>I tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.276, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4499403556</code></pre>

        <p>The “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.282, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4533651445</code></pre>

        <p>The original Discovery CD version has obviously undergone less processing over time than the YouTube version so I tend to think it’s more representative, and it’s <em>very</em> close to 123.45 – only a 0.00005964 difference! But even the more modern YouTube version closely rounds to 123.45.</p>

        <p>So hopefully I’ve put this fact to rest:</p>
        
        <p><b>The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is 123.45.</b></p>
        
        <h2>But…was it intentional?</h2>
        
        <p>The year is 1999 or 2000. Would the gear Daft Punk uses even <em>support</em> fractional BPMs? And if so out to how many decimal places?</p>

        <p>From their 2001 interview with Remix Magazine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503064751/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/">archive.org</a>) we know that Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Our sequencing is done either on an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC, or a PC with Logic Audio software. We do not work on things in just one way.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And from later interviews we know the Akai MPC was specifically an MPC-3000. (Oh, and that’s <em>Emagic</em>’s Logic, <em>not</em> Apple’s. Apple didn’t acquire Emagic until 2002.)</p>

        <p>Did the E-mu support fractional BPMs? Yes, but only to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/e-mu-display.jpg" alt="E-mu SP-1200 display showing tempo">

        <p>The Akai MPC-3000? Yep, also to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/akai-display.jpg" alt="Akai MPC-3000 display showing tempo">

        <p>What about Emagic’s Logic?</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/logic-tempo.jpg" alt="Emagic Logic tempo display showing 4 decimal places">

        <p>Oooh, look at that. Logic supported BPMs to <em>*4*</em> decimal places.</p>

        <p>But while we know those three sequencers were used on the Discovery album, I’m not sure anyone else knows which one was specifically used on HBFS. I’ve searched and searched and it seems this detail has just never been revealed.</p>

        <p>And to confuse matters more, in a <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2013/05/21/robocall-a-conversation-with-daft-punk/">2013 interview with Time Magazine</a>, Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>So we’ve never actually made music with computers! [laughs] Neither Homework nor Discovery nor even Human After All were made with computers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Was he contradicting himself from 12 years before? Or did he forget? Or maybe it’s a terminology thing?</p>

        <p>That the CD version is <em>so</em> close to exactly 123.45 makes me think this was intentional. And if it was? Well played, robots. You managed to leave a little Easter egg hiding in plain sight for 25 years.</p>

<li><b>Better search.</b> Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on <a href="https://indieweb.org/silos" title="silos">silos</a> exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> still has very poor search results).</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" title="backfeed">backfeed</a> can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services</li>
<li>allows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site</li>
<li>...</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Why_Link_To_Your_Original">Why Link To Your Original</span></h3>
<p>Common <a>POSSE</a> practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortlink" title="permashortlink">permashortlink</a>. Here are a few reasons why:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Discovery of your original content.</b> <a href="https://indieweb.org/discovery" title="discovery">discovery</a> of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services</li>
<li><b>Subvert spammers who copy your posts.</b> When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "<a href="http://tantek.com/2011/009/t3/value-searching-finding-past-tweets-self-hosting">2011-01-09 internet aikido</a>" of a sort.</li>
<li><b>Better ranking for your original posts.</b> If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="How_to">How to</span></h2>
<h3><span id="How_to_implement">How to implement</span></h3>
<p>This section is for web developers implementing POSSE.
</p>
<h4><span id="In_General">In General</span></h4>
<p>In general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a> destinations of your choice, with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/original_post_link" title="original post link">original post link</a> (e.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortlink" title="permashortlink">permashortlink</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortcitation" title="permashortcitation">permashortcitation</a>) back to your original.
</p><p>The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.
</p><p>Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:
</p>
<ul><li>link to the syndicated copy from the original in a <b><a href="https://indieweb.org/posts-elsewhere" title="posts-elsewhere">posts-elsewhere</a></b> section on your post.</li></ul>
<h4><span id="User_Interface">User Interface</span></h4>
<p>The best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.
</p>
<h5><span id="Preview">Preview</span></h5>
<p>One way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing
</p><p>(needs screenshot)
</p>
<h4><span id="Twitter">Twitter</span></h4>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.
</p><p>If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter, <em>instead of</em> posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.
</p><p>Details:
</p>

<p>See <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter" title="Twitter">POSSE to Twitter</a> for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.
</p>
<h4><span id="Facebook">Facebook</span></h4>

<p>There are two options for POSSEing to Facebook currently:
</p>
<ul><li>Manually crosspost</li>
<li>Semi-automatically with the <a href="https://snarfed.org/2021-02-18_bridgy-browser-extension-for-facebook">Bridgy browser extension for Facebook</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Medium">Medium</span></h4>


<h4><span id="WordPress">WordPress</span></h4>

<ul><li>How does veganstraightedge.com do it? (all his articles are manually POSSEd to WordPress.com)</li>
<li><span><img src="https://www.boffosocko.com/logo.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Boffosocko.com" title="User:Boffosocko.com">Chris Aldrich</a></span> uses a WordPress plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/">WordPress Crosspost</a> to POSSE from a self-hosted WordPress install to WordPress.com.</li></ul>
<h4><span id="Plain_Text_Notes">Plain Text Notes</span></h4>
<p>Some destinations (e.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/SMS" title="SMS">SMS</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/push_notification" title="push notification">push notifications</a>) may require a pure plain text representation.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry_to_text" title="h-entry to text">h-entry_to_text</a> is a method of generating a plain text representation from an arbitrary <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry" title="h-entry">h-entry</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Software">Software</span></h4>
<p>Software and libraries to implement POSSE:
</p>
<ul><li>PHP
<ul><li>The POSSE namespace in <a href="https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers">php-helpers</a> (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML =&gt; plaintext µblog syntax converter</li></ul></li>
<li>Python
<ul><li><a href="https://bolt80.com/silorider/">SiloRider</a> is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot">Feed2Toot</a> is another command-line python tool that parses any number of RSS feeds and posts their content on ActivityPub based services (tested with: Mastodon, Pleroma). Contains some neat bells and whistles like advanced post filtering, numerous options for feed parsing and toot formatting.</li></ul></li>
<li>Docker
<ul><li><dfn id="posseparty"><a href="https://posseparty.com/">POSSE Party</a></dfn>: self-hosted software for POSSE</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Services">Services</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Bridgy" title="Bridgy">Bridgy</a> <a href="https://www.brid.gy/about#publish">Publish</a> is POSSE-as-a-service. It supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/GitHub" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>. You can use it interactively or programmatically via <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention" title="webmention">webmention</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://muggedtweets.com/">Mugged Tweets</a> - will POSSE a note to a mug (may require first POSSEing to Twitter)</li>
<li><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> allows automatically reposting content with an RSS or Atom feed to a number of silos incuding Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/EchoFeed" title="EchoFeed">EchoFeed</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Publishing_Flows">Publishing Flows</span></h4>
<p>There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:
</p>
<h5><span id="Client_to_site_to_silo">Client to site to silo</span></h5>
<ul><li>The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client
<ul><li>Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per service</li></ul></li>
<li>Having finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof)
<ul><li>Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalink</li></ul></li>
<li>The server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessary</li>
<li>The server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Advantages:
</p>
<ul><li>User only has to interact with one site over the internet, their own</li>
<li>Syndication can be done fully automatically by the server</li></ul>
<p>Disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li>any?</li></ul>
<h5><span id="Client_to_site_and_silo">Client to site and silo</span></h5>
<ul><li>The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client</li>
<li>Having finished the content, the user publishes it to their server</li>
<li>The client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushed</li>
<li>The publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting:
<ul><li>Which 3rd party services to publish to</li>
<li>The exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced content</li></ul></li>
<li>The user selects the services and submits the form</li>
<li>The publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Advantages:
</p>
<ul><li>More user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li>Syndication requires a manual step each time</li>
<li>Dependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).</li></ul>

I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.

<h3><span id="COPE">COPE</span></h3>
<p><abbr>COPE</abbr> is short for Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE), which explicitly lacks a first "Publish Once" step, and thus is more about duplicating the content across various destinations.
</p><p>Without a first "Publish Once" step on a site you "Own", and thus lacking <a href="https://indieweb.org/original_post_permalink" title="original post permalink">original post permalinks</a>, the COPE strategy fails to actually draw people to any one canonical place to read/view your stuff, and thus all it does is grow (likely) disjoint audiences across other people’s sites.

<h3><span id="POSE">POSE</span></h3>
<p>Main article: <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSE" title="POSE">POSE</a></p>
<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSE" title="POSE">POSE</a>, Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere, was a broader predecessor of POSSE that also included publishing once on one particular <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a>, and then syndicating out to other silos.
</p>
<h3><span id="PESOS">PESOS</span></h3>

<p>A similar but opposite approach is <a href="https://indieweb.org/PESOS" title="PESOS">PESOS</a> where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site. 
</p><p>If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.
</p>
<h3><span id="PESETAS">PESETAS</span></h3>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/PESETAS" title="PESETAS">PESETAS</a> is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).
</p><p>For example, most silos support cross-posting to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy. 
</p><p>E.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Tumblr" title="Tumblr">Tumblr</a> has a UI for cross-posting to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. See <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15315/customize-the-message-tumblr-sends-to-twitter">Webapps StackExchange post</a> for documentation and screenshots of UI.
</p><p>Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.
</p>
<h2><span id="Brainstorming">Brainstorming</span></h2>
<h3><span id="CRUD">CRUD</span></h3>
<p>All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the <b>C</b>reation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.
</p><p>However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.
</p>
<h3><span id="Create">Create</span></h3>
<p>Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a> pages.
</p>
<h3><span id="Read">Read</span></h3>
<p>Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.
</p><p>At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.
</p><p>See: 
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication" title="u-syndication">u-syndication</a> for how to markup links to syndicated copies of your content</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/syndication-link-use-cases" title="syndication-link-use-cases">syndication-link-use-cases</a> for why to do so</li></ul>
<p>Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:
</p>
<ul><li>reverse-syndication / <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" title="backfeed">backfeed</a> of activity around the POSSE copy onto your original:
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/comments" title="comments">comments</a>/replies</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/favorites" title="favorites">favorites</a>/likes</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/reposts" title="reposts">reposts</a> (retweets)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>In addition, keeping a <a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication" title="u-syndication">u-syndication</a> link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.
</p>
<h3><span id="Update">Update</span></h3>
<p>If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.
</p>
<ul><li>E.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo post</li></ul>
<p>If the destination disallows updates/edits, like <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:
</p><p>Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:
</p>
<ul><li>if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)</li>
<li>if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).</li>
<li>within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.</li></ul>
<p>All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.
</p><p>For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:

<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Bridgy" title="Bridgy">Bridgy</a> Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)</li>

<li>...</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Delete">Delete</span></h3>
<p>Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.
</p><p>E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.
</p><p>Similar to updates, consider:
</p>
<ul><li>if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets).</li></ul>
<p>However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so. 
</p><p>Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.

<h2><span id="FAQ">FAQ</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Worry_about_search_engines_and_duplicates">Worry about search engines and duplicates</span></h3>
<p>Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?
</p><p>A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use <a href="https://indieweb.org/rel-canonical" title="rel-canonical">rel-canonical</a> to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.
</p><p>This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.
</p>
<h3><span id="POSSE-post-discovery_and_backlinks">POSSE-post-discovery and backlinks</span></h3>
<p>Q: Brid.gy can use <a href="https://indieweb.org/posse-post-discovery" title="posse-post-discovery">posse-post-discovery</a> to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding <a href="https://indieweb.org/backlink" title="backlink">backlinks</a> to syndicated copies?
</p><p>A: POSSEing without a <a href="https://indieweb.org/backlink" title="backlink">backlink</a> is considered a last resort, and has some costs associated with it. See <a href="https://indieweb.org/posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs" title="posse-post-discovery">posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs</a> for more details.

Or rather, everywhere you want to reach your readers. Facebook Instant Article? Sure, hook up the RSS feed. Apple News? Send the feed over there, too. AMP? Sure, generate an AMP page. No need to stop there—tap the new Medium API and half a dozen others as well.</p><p>Reading is a fragmented experience. Some people will love reading on the Web, some via RSS in their favorite reader, some in Facebook Instant Articles, some via AMP pages on Twitter, some via Lynx in their terminal running on a restored TRS-80 (seriously, it can be done. See below). The beauty of the POSSE approach is that you can reach them all from a single, canonical source.</p><p>[…]</p><p>For the Web's sake, let's hope Google sticks with AMP long enough to convince publishers that the real future is speeding up their own pages and embracing a POSSE-style approach.</p></blockquote></li>

<p dir="auto">Most simply, jank is a <a href="https://clojure.org/" rel="nofollow">Clojure</a> dialect on LLVM with C++ interop.
Less simply, jank is a general-purpose programming language which embraces the interactive,
functional, value-oriented nature of Clojure and the desire for the native
runtime and performance of C++. jank aims to be strongly compatible with
Clojure. While Clojure's default host is the JVM and its interop is with Java,
jank's host is LLVM and its interop is with C++.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3754572994329279659" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>It all started with cold calling.</p>

<p>In our new "AI/ML Product Management" class, the "pre-case" submissions (short assignments meant to prepare students for class discussion) were looking suspiciously good. Not "strong student" good. More like "this reads like a McKinsey memo that went through three rounds of editing," good.</p>

<p>So we started cold calling students randomly during class.</p>

<p>The result was... illuminating. Many students who had submitted thoughtful, well-structured work could not explain basic choices in their own submission after two follow-up questions. Some could not participate at all. This gap was too consistent to blame on nerves or bad luck. <strong>If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://brianjabarian.org/">Brian Jabarian</a> has been doing <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5395709">interesting work on this problem</a>, and his results both inspired us and gave us the confidence to try something that would have sounded absurd two years ago: running the final exam with a Voice AI agent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why oral exams? And why now?</h2>

<p>The core problem is simple: students have immediate access to LLMs that can handle most exam questions we traditionally use for assessment. The old equilibrium, where take-home work could reliably measure understanding, is dead. Gone. Kaput.</p>

<p>Oral exams are a natural response. They force real-time reasoning, application to novel prompts, and defense of actual decisions. The problem? Oral exams are a logistical nightmare. You cannot run them for a large class without turning the final exam period into a month-long hostage situation.</p>

<p>Unless you cheat.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Enter the Voice Agent</h2>

<p>We used <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai">ElevenLabs Conversational AI</a> to build the examiner. The platform bundles the messy parts (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-taking, interruption handling, …) into something usable. And here is the thing that surprised me: a basic version for a low-stakes setting (e.g., an assignment) can be up and running in literally minutes. Minutes. Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done.</p>

<p>Two features mattered a lot for our setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic variables:</strong> pass the student's name, project details, and other per-student context into the conversation as parameters</li>
<li><strong>Workflows:</strong> build a structured flow with sub-agents instead of a single "chatty" agent trying to do everything</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What the exam looked like</h2>

<p>We ran a two-part oral exam.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: "Talk me through your project."</strong> The agent asks about the student's capstone project: goals, data, modeling choices, evaluation, failure modes. This is where the "LLM did my homework" strategy dies. You can paste an assignment into ChatGPT. It is much harder to improvise consistent answers about specific decisions when someone is drilling into details.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: "Now do a case."</strong> The agent picks one of the cases we discussed in class and asks questions spanning the topics we covered: basically testing whether students absorbed the material or just showed up.</p>

<p>To handle this structure, we split the exam into sub-agents in a workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication agent:</strong> Asks for the student's ID and refuses to proceed without a valid one. (In a more productized version, we would integrate with NYU SSO instead of checking against a list.)</li>
<li><strong>Project discussion agent:</strong> Gets project context injected via parameters. The prompt includes details of each project so the agent can ask informed questions. The next step is obvious: connect retrieval over the student's submitted slides and reports so the agent can quote and probe precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Case discussion agent:</strong> Selects a case and runs structured questioning. Again, RAG would help with richer case details.</li>
</ol>

<p>This "many small agents" approach is not just aesthetic. It prevents the system from drifting into unbounded conversation, and it makes debugging possible.</p>

<hr>

<h2>By the Numbers</h2>

<ul>
<li>36 students examined over 9 days</li>
<li>25 minutes average (range: 9–64)</li>
<li>65 messages per conversation on average</li>
<li>0.42 USD per student (15 USD total)</li>
<li>89% of LLM grades within 1 point</li>
<li>Shortest exam (9 min) → highest score (19/20)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The economics</h2>

<p>Let's talk money.</p>

<p>Total cost for 36 students: <strong>15 USD</strong>.</p>

<p>That's 8 USD for Claude (the chair and heaviest grader), 2 USD for Gemini, 0.30 USD for OpenAI, and roughly 5 USD for ElevenLabs voice minutes. Forty-two cents per student.</p>

<p>The alternative? 36 students × 25-minute exam × 2 graders = 30 hours of human time. At TA rates (~25/hour), that's 750. At faculty rates, it's "we don't do oral exams because they don't scale."</p>

<p>For 15 dollars, we got: real-time oral examination, a three-model grading council with deliberation, structured feedback with verbatim quotes, a complete audit trail, and—as you'll see—a diagnosis of our own teaching gaps.</p>

<p>The unit economics in terms of cost work. We will see next that the real benefit is in the value that is delivered, not in the 50x cost savings.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What broke (and how we fixed it)</h2>

<p>The first version had problems. Here is what we learned.</p>

<h3>1) The voice was intimidating</h3>

<p>A few students complained that the agent sounded severe. We had cloned Foster Provost's voice because, frankly, his clone was much more accurate than the clones of our own voices. But the students found it... intense. Here is an email from a student:</p>

<blockquote>I had prepared thoroughly and felt confident in my understanding of the material, but the intensity of the interviewer's voice during the exam unexpectedly heightened my anxiety and affected my performance. The experience was more triggering than I anticipated, which made it difficult to fully demonstrate my knowledge. Throughout the course, I have actively participated and engaged with the material, and I had hoped to better demonstrate my knowledge in this interview.</blockquote>

<p>And here is another:</p>

<blockquote>Just got done with my oral exam. [...] I honestly didn't feel comfortable with it at all. The voice you picked was so condescending that it actually dropped my confidence. [...] I don't know why but the agent was shouting at me.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> We are split on that. We love FakeFoster. But next time we will A/B test, and we will try to test other voices. At the end of the day, we want to optimize for comprehension, not charisma. <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/guides/elevenlabs-docs-agent">ElevenLabs has guidance on voice and personality tuning: they treat this as a product design problem</a>, and probably a good idea.</p>

<h3>2) The agent stacked questions</h3>

<p>This was the biggest real issue. The agent would ask something like: "Explain your metric choice, and also tell me what baselines you tried, and why you did not use X, and what you would do next."</p>

<p>That is not one question. That is four questions wearing a trench coat. The cognitive load for an oral exam is already high. Stacking questions makes it brutal.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Hard rule in the prompt: <em>one question at a time</em>. If you want multi-part probing, chain it across turns. For grading the exam, we included an "interference protocol": students received full credit if they had questions stacked like that and answered only some of them.</p>

<h3>3) Clarifications became moving targets</h3>

<p>Student: "Can you repeat the question?"<br>
Agent: <em>paraphrases the question in a subtly different way</em></p>

<p>Now the student is solving a different problem than the one they were asked. Very frustrating.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Explicit instruction in the prompt: <em>repeat verbatim when asked to repeat</em>. No paraphrasing. Same words.</p>

<h3>4) The agent did not let students think</h3>

<p>Humans rush to fill silence. Agents do too. Students would pause to think, and the agent would jump in with follow-up probes or worse: interpret the silence as confusion and move on.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Tell the agent to allow think-time without probing aggressively. It made the exam feel less like an interrogation. We also increased the time-out before the agent asks "Are you there?" from 5 to 10 seconds.</p>

<h3>5) Lack of randomization</h3>

<p>We asked the agent to "randomly select" a case study. It did not.</p>

<p>From December 12–18, when Zillow was in the case list, the agent picked Zillow <strong>88% of the time</strong>. After we removed Zillow from the prompt on December 18, the agent immediately latched onto Predictive Policing—picking it for <strong>16 out of 21 exams</strong> on December 19 alone.</p>

<p>LLMs are not random. They have implicit preferences and ordering biases. Asking an LLM to "pick randomly" is like asking a human to "think of a number between 1 and 10"—you're going to get a lot of 7s.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Pass an explicit random number as a parameter and map it to cases deterministically. Do the randomization in code, not in the prompt.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Grading: the council deliberation actually worked</h2>

<p>OK, so here is where things got interesting.</p>

<p>We graded using a "<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council" target="_blank">council of LLMs</a>" approach, an idea we borrowed from Andrej Karpathy. Three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) assessed each transcript independently. Then they saw each other's assessments and revised. Finally, the chair (Claude) synthesized the final grade with evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Round 1 was a mess</strong>. When the models graded independently, agreement was poor: 0% of grades matched exactly, and only 23% were within 2 points. The average maximum disagreement was nearly 4 points on a 20-point scale.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker: Gemini was a softie: It averaged 17/20. Claude averaged 13.4/20. That's a 3.6-point gap—the difference between a B+ and a B-.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Claude and OpenAI were already aligned: 70% of their grades were within 1 point of each other in Round 1.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Model</th>
<th>Round 1 Mean</th>
<th>Round 2 Mean</th>
<th>Change</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claude</td>
<td>13.4/20</td>
<td>13.9/20</td>
<td>+0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpenAI</td>
<td>14.0/20</td>
<td>14.0/20</td>
<td>+0.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gemini</td>
<td>17.0/20</td>
<td>15.0/20</td>
<td>-2.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Then came consultation. After each model saw the others' assessments and evidence, agreement improved dramatically:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Metric</th>
<th>Round 1</th>
<th>Round 2</th>
<th>Improvement</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perfect agreement</td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>21%</td>
<td>+21 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within 1 point</td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>62%</td>
<td>+62 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within 2 points</td>
<td>23%</td>
<td>85%</td>
<td>+62 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mean max difference</td>
<td>3.93 pts</td>
<td>1.41 pts</td>
<td>-2.52 pts</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Gemini lowered its grades by an average of 2 points after seeing Claude's and OpenAI's more rigorous assessments. It couldn't justify giving 17s when Claude was pointing to specific gaps in the experimentation discussion.</p>

<p><img alt="Grade convergence chart" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg5fX5d3GQ2cOHfJpbT5os_5WBQSnb5iLSULS76cNn0LGOFq3RxpjyAu4sGJ2DEFMpo8_mWe9Vum1yzpLbfI82qK-m2yXDFQApP_X01G_fO0xFz-utUW3dHelb8XsqEHP3sgHNjxKAEKnZoCJDZkpJVneeF_ej0T8sq_HGm9YtWeE42I_hWkpfDDB1jbd8" width="624"></p>

<p>But here's what's interesting: the disagreement wasn't random. Problem Framing and Metrics had <strong>100% agreement</strong> within 1 point. Experimentation? Only <strong>57%</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? When students give clear, specific answers, graders agree. When students give vague hand-wavy answers, graders (human or AI) disagree on how much partial credit to give. The low agreement on experimentation reflects genuine ambiguity in student responses, not grader noise.</p>

<p><strong>The grading was stricter than my own default.</strong> That's not a bug. Students will be evaluated outside the university, and the world is not known for grade inflation.</p>

<p><strong>The feedback was better than any human would produce.</strong> The system generated structured "strengths / weaknesses / actions" summaries with verbatim quotes from the transcript. Sample feedback from the highest scorer:</p>

<blockquote>"Your understanding of metric trade-offs and Goodhart's Law risks was exceptional—the hot tub example perfectly illustrated how optimizing for one metric can corrupt another."</blockquote>

<p>Sample from a B- student:</p>

<blockquote>"Practice articulating complete A/B testing designs: state a hypothesis, define randomization unit, specify guardrail metrics, and establish decision criteria for shipping or rolling back."</blockquote>

<p>Specific. Actionable. Tied to evidence. No human grader has the time to generate that for every student.</p>

<hr>

<h2>It diagnosed our teaching gaps</h2>

<p>Ha! This one stung.</p>

<p><img alt="Topic performance chart" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh-ISSQRlDyrhz1aF2SKnjX-NTTBv5nbkq4TyhFkKOc1FcZ80wHMrZ9YU7X62-9j-SfTpHT2VQDxuiE1bkKaOVIJ8zSRvLTi0hSAkvdC6h2-E-YA-MokZMoeVat-CGW1XD6lkhof8BpYY2bCymGz_A5x0lSvPBvlpX5DiTtqSzaZafdAJ8rkv_lv-Tu2sg" width="624"></p>

<p>When we analyzed performance by topic, one bar stuck out like a sore thumb: <strong>Experimentation</strong>. Mean score: 1.94 out of 4. Compare that to Problem Framing at 3.39.</p>

<p>The breakdown was brutal:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 students (8%) scored <strong>0</strong>—couldn't discuss it at all</li>
<li>7 students (19%) scored <strong>1</strong>—superficial understanding</li>
<li>15 students (42%) scored <strong>2</strong>—basic understanding</li>
<li>0 students scored <strong>4</strong>—no one demonstrated mastery</li>
</ul>

<p>We had rushed through A/B testing methodology in class. The external grader made it impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>The grading output became a mirror reflecting our own weaknesses as instructors. Ooof.</p>

<h3>Duration ≠ Quality</h3>

<p>One finding I found strangely fascinating: exam duration had <strong>zero correlation</strong> with score (r = -0.03). The shortest exam—9 minutes—got the highest score (19/20). The longest—64 minutes—scored 12/20.</p>

<p>Taking longer doesn't mean you know more. If anything, it signals struggling to articulate. Confidence is efficient.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Anti-cheating (or: trust but verify)</h2>

<p>We asked students to <strong>record themselves</strong> while taking the exam (webcam + audio). This discourages blatantly outsourcing the conversation, having multiple people in the room, or having an LLM in voice mode whispering answers. It also gives us a backup record in case something goes really badly.</p>

<p>And here is an underrated benefit of this whole setup: <strong>the exam is powered by guidelines, not by secret questions</strong>. We can publish exactly how the exam works—the structure, the skills being tested, the types of questions. No surprises. The LLM will pick the specific questions live, and the student will have to handle them.</p>

<p>This reduces anxiety and pushes students toward actual preparation instead of guessing what the instructor "wants." And it eliminates the leaked-exam problem entirely. Practice all you want—it will only make you better prepared.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What the students said</h2>

<p>We surveyed students before releasing grades to capture their experience. Some of the results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only 13% preferred the AI oral format. 57% wanted traditional written exams. 83% found it more stressful.</li>
<li>But here's the thing: 70% agreed it tested their actual understanding: the highest-rated item. They accepted the assessment but not the delivery.</li>
<li>At the same time, they almost universally liked the flexibility of taking the exam at their own place and time. Yes, many of them would have also preferred a take-home exam instead of the oral exam, but this format is dead now.</li>
<li>83% of students found the oral exam framework more stressful than a written exam.</li>
<li>The fix is clear: one question at a time, slower pacing, calmer tone. The concept works. The execution needs iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Student survey results" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEioSGC7USjzXprYZmvEnHsw7YX4xupGXSpKcWxwW1q61PXBHOZyxWr6pO8yEZrjZ0oJQyu6YlidYODZIvg0gQcMkJWPtwwJxCHMJfTejXod4mmo1lDGeol3Wsk-OfhVpmYIOXNB48R-kfahm5MQw9upxYYTdJR7aZS2jIHBPb9Zea9Cbl9KQyOO9jvUKaA" width="624"></p>

<hr>

<h2>Try it yourself</h2>

<p>If you want to experiment with this approach, here are some resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ipeirotis/0d9d5747e6270cf6d65a6bf9d162e421">Prompt for the voice agent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ipeirotis/99418caa6afae72fb7eec63855632c68">Prompt for the grading council</a></li>
<li><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=agent_8101k9d1pq41f3rs8d9g9143dvvr&amp;vars=eyJzdHVkZW50IjoiS29uc3RhbnRpbm9zIFJpemFrb3MiLCAibmV0aWQiOiJrcjg4OCIsICJwcm9qZWN0aWQiOiJCIn0=">Link to try the voice agent</a> <em>(use Konstantinos as the name and kr888 as the net id to authenticate; the project was a "LinkedIn Recruiter, a</em><i>n agent that scans profiles and automatically sends personalized DMs to candidates on behalf of a recruiter. It engages in the first 3 turns of chat to answer basic questions (salary, location) before handing off to a human."</i><em>)</em></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What I would change next time</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Slower pacing and a calmer voice:</strong> We love you FakeFoster, but GenZ is not ready for you. Perhaps we will deploy FakePanos next time. Too bad ElevenLabs hasn't perfected thick accents yet to deliver a real Panos experience.</li>
<li><strong>RAG over student artifacts</strong> (slides, reports, notebooks). ElevenLabs supports this directly. If the agent can quote the student's own submission, the exam becomes much harder to game and much more diagnostically useful.</li>
<li><strong>Better case randomization</strong> with explicit seeding and tracking. Randomness that "feels random" is not enough. Pass explicit parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Audit triggers in grading.</strong> If the LLM committee disagrees beyond a threshold, flag for human review. The point of a committee is not to pretend the result is always certain; it is to surface uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility defaults.</strong> Offer practice runs, allow extra time, and provide alternatives when voice interaction creates unnecessary barriers.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>The bigger point</h2>

<p>Take-home exams are dead. Reverting to pen-and-paper exams in the classroom feels like a regression.</p><p>We need assessments that evolve towards formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning. Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale. Now, AI is making them scalable again.</p>

<p>And here is the delicious part: you can give the whole setup to the students and let them prepare for the exam by practicing it multiple times. Unlike traditional exams, where leaked questions are a disaster, here the questions are generated fresh each time. The more you practice, the better you get. That is... actually how learning is supposed to work.</p>

<p>Fight fire with fire.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Thanks to Brian Jabarian for the inspiration and for giving us confidence that these interviews will work, Foster Provost for lending his voice to create the FakeFoster agent (sorry, students found you intimidating!), and Andrej Karpathy for the council-of-LLMs idea.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03">https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46466364">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><img alt="Black smartphone with clock app on screen and 'Punkt' branding on back" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0906/3147/1490/files/punkt_mc03_smartphone_main_image_ec4174e6-52bc-4a63-b97c-59fe5974d345.webp?v=1767194285"></h2>
<p><em><b>Made in Europe</b>, the MC03 has an updated and more sustainable design and evolved features, with security and privacy at its heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 January 2026, Lugano, Switzerland / CES, Las Vegas.</strong> <strong> <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/"> Punkt.</a> </strong>, the Swiss-based pioneer of beautifully designed, minimalist smartphones that give users privacy without friction, will be present at CES with its latest model, the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/products/mc03-premium-secure-smartphone">MC03</a>. This unique device, powered by AphyOS and housed within a German-built precision handset, follows through on Punkt.’s well known commitment to intentional tech use and data ownership.</p>
<p>Like its forerunner, the MC02, the new model is a subscription-based smartphone that offers users the tools and apps that are most important to them in an environment where they control access to their data and usage.</p>
<p>Using the Punkt. MC03, users can put privacy first with two defined repositories for depositing data. The first is named <b>Vault</b>, a protected enclave containing only trusted, Punkt.-approved apps and offering maximum privacy by default with a calm, design-focused user interface. The second, termed <b>Wild Web</b>, provides the freedom to install any app, but with strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls and can prevent data triangulation and unauthorized data flows.</p>
<p><i>“Privacy is being sought by people more than ever before, particularly as we enter the age of AI,”</i> said <b>Petter Neby, Founder and CEO at Punkt</b>. <i>“They are stressed and overwhelmed by the determination of Big Tech to track and monetise their every online movement. Punkt. offers them a solution – a modern, premium device without the need to compromise on their privacy.”</i></p>
<p>The MC03 features a new look and feel to its operating system allowing users to stay laser-focused on getting the best experience. AphyOS cuts out tracking and profiling technology, bloatware, hidden apps and unwieldy background services. It eliminates spying and runs hardened code to block attacks, assisted by a bank-grade Secure Element.</p>
<p>With the MC03, Punkt. is building a secure smartphone ecosystem where privacy is not an add-on, but the default. Supported by trusted partners such as <a href="https://threema.com/en"><b>Threema</b></a> and, new for MC03, <a href="https://proton.me/"><b>Proton</b></a>, these services feature in the device’s Vault space.</p>
<p>Trusted services including <b>Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN</b> and <b>Proton Pass</b> are available in an environment designed to minimize data exposure and tracking.</p>
<p>Punkt. and Proton are ideal partners, both leading within the <b>Swiss Tech movement</b> (<i>with Swiss Tech you pay to retain your data, with Big Tech you pay with your data</i>), operating independently and built around the principle that users, not platforms, control their own data.</p>
<p><b><i>Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton</i></b> said, <i>“People deserve choice. Choice over the phone they use, the software they rely on and who they share their data with. By working with likeminded companies like Punkt., we can give users more ways to regain control of their privacy.”</i></p>
<h3>Among other features of the MC03:</h3>
<p><b>The App Hub</b></p>
<p>Two app stores are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>A curated privacy-friendly store vetted by AphyOS and Punkt.</li>
<li>Access to all widely available apps, activated only when chosen by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Premium Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Manufactured at the Gigaset facility in Germany, the device delivers cutting-edge engineering for quality, security, repairability and sustainability, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>120Hz OLED HDR display</li>
<li>Removable 5200mAh battery</li>
<li>IP68 water and dust resistance</li>
<li>64MP main camera</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Digital Nomad</b></p>
<p>The MC03 retains its built-in VPN, Digital Nomad, protecting connectivity and privacy wherever users are.</p>
<p><b>Ledger</b></p>
<p>Users control app-specific privacy, from full access to full restriction. Ledger also includes a Carbon Reduction feature, giving insights into the energy impact of installed apps and control over background activity.</p>
<p><i>“The MC03 builds on the success of the MC02 in privacy, control and security,”</i> continued Petter Neby. <i>“It delivers modern features with simplicity and minimal distraction.”</i></p>
<p>The Punkt. MC03 is priced at CHF / $ / €699.</p>
<p>If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product. With MC03, you pay to retain your data rather than paying with it.</p>
<p>A 12-month subscription to AphyOS from Apostrophy is included. After that, continuation requires a paid subscription:</p>
<p>Monthly at CHF / $ / €9.99</p>
<p>Subscription bundles are available, including a <b>3-year subscription at 45% discount</b> and a <b>5-year subscription at 60% discount</b>.</p>
<p>The MC03 is available to pre-order now, with deliveries in Europe at the end of January and North America from Spring 2026.</p>

We're backed by Open Core Ventures.</p><p>HQ is San Francisco, but much of the team is in the DC area. East Coast timezone preferred, DC area even better—but we're fully remote.</p><p>What we're building: The orchestration layer for browser-use and AI agents. Systems that navigate, reason, and execute on the real web.</p><p>Who we're looking for: You've built agentic systems that shipped to production. You have opinions about tool use, context management, and why most "agents" are just glorified prompt chains. You strongly prefer working in the open—a significant part of this role is contributing to OSS repos. We strongly prefer candidates with existing open source contributions.</p><p>Why now: We have strong traction and are expanding the team. You'd be early—with real influence over product, architecture, and how we work. High autonomy, high trust, small team of people who know what they're doing.</p><p>Comp: Cash + healthcare + modest 401k match + options.

The bottleneck has shifted downstream - to merge conflicts, flaky tests, inconsistent code quality, and dozens of other frictions that drain productivity and morale.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Feature</span> In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.</p>
<p>A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1883">RFC 1883</a>, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.</p>
<p>The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.</p>

    

<p>As billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.</p>

        


        

<p>Yet according to data from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption">Google</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6/XA">the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC)</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage">Cloudflare</a>, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.</p>
<p>To understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.</p>

        

<p>"IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible," APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told <em>The Register</em>. "It was a classic case of mis-design by committee."</p>
<p>And that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.</p>
<p>For many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements.</p>

        

<p>"One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space," said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sigcomm.org/awards/sigcomm-award-recipients">lifetime achievement award</a> by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for "fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems."</p>
<p>Davie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. "Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle," he said.</p>
<p>Another innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.</p>
<p>"These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes," said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Because NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol.</p>
<p>"Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low," Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told <em>The Register</em>. "Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier," he added.</p>
<h3>A misunderstood protocol</h3>
<p>While IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed.</p>
<p>"IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking," said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).</p>
<p>"In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments," he added. "In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success."</p>
<p>RIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. "What IPv6 got right was its long-term design," he told <em>The Register</em>. "It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6."</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/23/apnic_half_ipv6_capable/">Asia reaches 50 percent IPv6 capability and leads the world in user numbers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Gartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.</p>
<p>"Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6," he advised. "Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6."</p>
<p>APNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.</p>
<p>"I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way," he told <em>The Register</em>. "NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way."</p>
<p>That new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.</p>
<p>"We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable," he said.</p>
<p>Huston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.</p>
<p>"These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address," Huston told <em>The Register</em>. "The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses."</p>
<p>"So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay."</p>
<p>But there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/apnic_huawei_ipv6/">Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses</a> and Starlink appears to have acquired<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/nded/">150 sextillion</a>, which is helping to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/ipv6_adoption_statistics/">push more countries</a> past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The USA is demanding from all 43 countries in the "Visa Waiver Programme" (VWP), which enables visa-free travel, to conclude an "Enhanced Border Security Partnership" (EBSP). This is intended to grant US authorities direct access to police databases in these - mostly European - countries containing fingerprints, facial images and other personal data. Anyone who refuses this forced "border partnership" faces exclusion from the visa-free travel programme.</p>

<p>The US demand is unprecedented: even EU member states do not grant each other such extensive direct database access – normally the exchange takes place via the "hit/no-hit principle" with a subsequent request for further data. This is how it works, for example, in the Prüm Treaty among all Schengen states, which has so far covered fingerprints and DNA data and is now also being extended to facial images.</p>

<p>The EBSP could practically affect anyone who falls under the jurisdiction of border authorities: from passport controls to deportation proceedings. Under the US autocrat Donald Trump, this is a particular problem, as his militia-like immigration authority ICE is already using data from various sources to brutally persecute migrants – direct access to police data from VWP partners could massively strengthen this surveillance apparatus. Germany alone might give access to facial images of 5.5 million people and fingerprints of a similar dimension.</p>

<p>The USA has already tightened the Visa Waiver Programme several times, for instance in 2006 through the introduction of biometric passports and in 2008 through the ESTA pre-registration requirement. In addition, there were bilateral agreements for the exchange of fingerprints and DNA profiles – however, these may only be transmitted in individual cases involving serious crime.</p>

<p>Existing treaties such as the EU-US Police Framework Agreement are not applicable to the "Enhanced Border Security Partnership", as it applies exclusively to law enforcement purposes. It is also questionable how the planned data transfer is supposed to be compatible with the strict data protection rules of the GDPR. The EU Commission therefore wants to negotiate a framework agreement on the EBSP that would apply to all member states. Time is running short: the US government has set VWP states a deadline of 31 December 2026. Some already agreed on a bilateral level.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old 
      son on his "kid-safe" Gabb phone. The man got my son's number through a 
      children's book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I 
      discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but 
      still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our 
      family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting 
      my son: "What did you get? Send pictures."
    </p>

    <p>
      How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait . . . hadn't we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the 
      "kid-safe" phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/app-guide/">Gabb "approved apps" list</a>, which, 
      as I understand it, offers "no social media or high-risk options." We 
      did the safe things, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe not. Turns out Gabb's own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/blog/dangerous-chat-features/">seven apps with 
        dangerous chat features</a>, describing it as an app that "opens the 
        door to potential dangers." We were apparently supposed to find that 
        warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb's 572 blog posts:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE 'https://gabb\.com/blog/[^&lt;]+' \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo "{} blog posts as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      But if GroupMe "opens the door" to danger, why did Gabb put it on their "approved 
      apps" list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath 
      GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with 
      my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: "Allows contact and communication with 
      people the child may not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      So it allows communication with strangers, but it's not "high-risk?" The 
      approved list isn't looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a 
      catalog of risks I'm supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps 
      and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s "https://gabb.com/app-guide/" \
    | grep -o "${cat} = \[.*\]" \
    | head -1 \
    | sed "s/${cat} = \[//" \
    | sed "s/\]//" \
    | tr ',' '\n' \
    | sed "s/'//g" \
    | sed 's/^ *//' \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d ' ')
  echo "$count $cat"
done &amp;&amp; echo "...as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

586 existing_apps
60 unapproved_apps
170 unmet_criteria_apps
22 music_apps
...as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don't feel in control.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Gabb isn't alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies 
      selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver 
      complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.
    </p>


    <p>
      Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To 
      set it up, I had to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Connect the console to the internet</li>
      <li>Download the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app to my phone</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for myself</li>
      <li>Link my credit card and be charged $0.50 to verify parental consent</li>
      <li>Set up parental controls from the app on my phone</li>
      <li>Sync the parental controls app to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Set up a security PIN on the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for my son</li>
      <li>Sync my son's Nintendo Account to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Discover that half the controls live in the phone app and the other 
        half live on Nintendo's website, because of course they do</li>
      <li>Log into Nintendo's website to finish the job . . . </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Only to discover that there's no clear option to block internet access, 
      no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy 
      way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a 
      kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that's just nostalgia talking. 
      Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler 
      on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:
    </p>

    <ol start="12">
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for myself</li>
      <li>Create an email address for my son</li>
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for my son</li>
      <li>Set up a gamertag for my son on account.xbox.com</li>
      <li>Configure parental controls in Microsoft Family Safety</li>
      <li>Configure more parental controls on xbox.com</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone
      includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, 
      friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I finally—<em>finally</em>—tried to test online play, Minecraft 
      told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say 
      which) <em>and</em> create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a 
      <em>membership</em>) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to 
      the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit 
      to zero, sure. But I can't block free downloads. So to let my son play 
      online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content 
      I can't possibly evaluate. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a 
      conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and 
      cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a "customer 
      journey." And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You're 
      supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just 
      cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental 
      controls you don't really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. 
      You become the ideal customer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I didn't cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, 
      I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite 
      vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down
      over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED
      display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering
      across the floor. My son's face. My wife's face. The stunned silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not break the Switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I did was announce, in a voice louder than 
      necessary, that <em>nobody</em> was to ask me about anything 
      Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My 
      son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, 
      developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn't appear to 
      involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says "this 
      child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or 
      download anything without my explicit permission." Instead I get a 
      maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I'm at fault for a
      tooltip I didn't hover over, a blog post I didn't read, a submenu I didn't 
      find. Maybe that's by design. Maybe it's neglect. I don't know.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his
      friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those 
      two things, I'm supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental 
      control schemes of Gabb, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Xbox, while a stranger's 
      Christmas morning texts sit in my son's phone history.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Parental controls shouldn't be this hard.
    </p>

<p>FracturedJson is a family of utilities that format <a href="https://json.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON data</a> in a way that's easy for humans to read, but fairly compact.  Arrays and objects are written on single lines, as long as they're neither too long nor too complex.  When several such lines are similar in structure, they're written with fields aligned like a table.  Long arrays are written with multiple items per line across multiple lines.</p>
<p>There are lots of settings available to control the output, but usually you can ignore most of them.  FracturedJson produces nice-looking output from any set of JSON data automatically.</p>
<p>You can try it out with the <a href="https://j-brooke.github.io/FracturedJson/" rel="nofollow">browser formatter page</a>.  It's also available as a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/.NET-Library">.NET library</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonJs">JavaScript/Typescript package</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonVSC">Visual Studio Code extension</a>.

<p>Optionally, comments can be preserved.  Comments aren't allowed by the official JSON standard, but they're ubiquitous, so it's nice to have the option.  FracturedJson tries to keep the comments together with whatever elements they seem to relate to.</p>

<p><h2>How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p>FracturedJson uses four types of formatting: <strong>inlined</strong>, <strong>compact multiline array</strong>, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>expanded</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/refs/heads/main/src-assets/fj-layout-types.png" alt="Layout Types"></p>
<p><h3>Inlined</h3><a id="user-content-inlined" aria-label="Permalink: Inlined" href="#inlined"></a></p>
<p>When possible, sections of the document are written inlined, as long as that doesn't make them too long or too complex (as determined by the settings).  "Complexity" refers to how deeply nested an array or object's contents are.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{ &quot;UnitType&quot;: &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;: [41, 7] }"><pre>{ <span>"UnitType"</span>: <span><span>"</span>Archer<span>"</span></span>, <span>"Position"</span>: [<span>41</span>, <span>7</span>] }</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxinlinecomplexity">MaxInlineComplexity</a> to control how much nesting is allowed on one line.</p>
<p><h3>Compact Multiline Array</h3><a id="user-content-compact-multiline-array" aria-label="Permalink: Compact Multiline Array" href="#compact-multiline-array"></a></p>
<p>The next option, for arrays, is to write them with multiple items per line, across multiple lines.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    [19,  2], [ 3,  8], [14,  0], [ 9,  9], [ 9,  9], [ 0,  3], [10,  1],
    [ 9,  1], [ 9,  2], [ 6, 13], [18,  5], [ 4, 11], [12,  2]
]"><pre>[
    [<span>19</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>3</span>,  <span>8</span>], [<span>14</span>,  <span>0</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>0</span>,  <span>3</span>], [<span>10</span>,  <span>1</span>],
    [ <span>9</span>,  <span>1</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>6</span>, <span>13</span>], [<span>18</span>,  <span>5</span>], [ <span>4</span>, <span>11</span>], [<span>12</span>,  <span>2</span>]
]</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxcompactarraycomplexity">MaxCompactArrayComplexity</a> to control how deeply nested items can be when arranged this way, or use <code>-1</code> to disable this feature.</p>
<p><h3>Table</h3><a id="user-content-table" aria-label="Permalink: Table" href="#table"></a></p>
<p>If an array or object contains inlineable items of the same type, they can be formatted in a tabular format.  With enough room, all fields at any depth are lined up (and reordered if necessary).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
    &quot;Rect&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: -44, &quot;y&quot;:  3.4         }, &quot;color&quot;: [0, 255, 255] },
    &quot;Point&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: {          &quot;y&quot;: 22   , &quot;z&quot;: 3}                         },
    &quot;Oval&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: 140, &quot;y&quot;:  0.04        }, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;#7f3e96&quot;     },
    &quot;Plane&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: null,                           &quot;color&quot;: [0, 64, 64]   }
}"><pre>{

    <span>"Point"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: {          <span>"y"</span>: <span>22</span>   , <span>"z"</span>: <span>3</span>}                         },
    <span>"Oval"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>140</span>, <span>"y"</span>:  <span>0.04</span>        }, <span>"color"</span>: <span><span>"</span>#7f3e96<span>"</span></span>     },

}</pre></div>
<p>If the table wouldn't fit with all of the elements and subelements aligned, the inner-most containers are collapsed while keeping the outer ones still aligned.</p>

<p><h3>Expanded</h3><a id="user-content-expanded" aria-label="Permalink: Expanded" href="#expanded"></a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/">https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464120">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <p>
In
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1oteeaj/whats_the_most_useful_commandline_trick_you/no5xkx4/">a
recent discussion on Reddit</a>
I shared a number of tips
about the common utility
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/less.1"><code>less(1)</code></a>
that others found helpful
so I figured I'd aggregate some of those tips here.
</p>

<h3 id="multiple-files">Operating on multiple files</h3>

<p>
While most folks invoke
<code>less</code>
at the tail of a pipeline like
</p><figure><pre><label>$ </label> <var>command</var> | less
</pre>
<figcaption>Invoking <code>less</code> in a pipeline</figcaption></figure><p>

you can directly provide one or more files to open

</p><figure><pre><label>$ </label> less <var>README.txt file.c *.md</var>
</pre>
<figcaption>Invoking <code>less</code> directly</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="adding-files">Adding files after starting</h3>

<p>
When reading a document,
sometimes you want to view another file,
adding it to the file list.
Perhaps while reading some C source code
you want to also look over the corresponding header-file.
You can add that header-file to the argument list with
<code>:e file.h</code>
</p>

<h3 id="navigating-multiple">Navigating multiple files</h3>

<p>
You can navigate between multiple files using
<code>:n</code>
to go to the next file in the argument-list, and
<code>:p</code>
for the previous file.
You can also use
<code>:x</code>
to rewind to the first file in the argument-list
similar to how
<code>:rewind</code>
behaves in
<code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="removing-files">Removing files after starting</h3>

<p>
While I rarely feel the need to,
if you have finished with a file
and want to keep your argument list clean,
you can use
<code>:d</code>
to delete the current file from the argument-list.
</p>

<h2 id="navigating-within">Navigating</h2>

<h3 id="jump-to-line">Jumping to a particular line-number</h3>

<p>
Use
<code><var>«count»</var>G</code>
to jump to a particular line-number.
So using
<code><var>3141</var>G</code>
will jump to line <var>3141</var>.
It helps to display
<a href="#option-N">line numbers</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="jump-to-percent">Jumping to a particular percentage-offset</h3>

<p>
Similarly, using
<code><var>«count»</var>%</code>
jumps to that percentage-offset of the file.
So if you want to go to ¾
of the way through the file, you can type
<code>75%</code>
to jump right there.
</p>

<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>

<p>
While many folks know you can search forward with
<code>/<var>«pattern»</var></code>
and some people know you can use
<code>?<var>«pattern»</var></code>
to search backwards,
or use
<code>n</code>/<code>N</code>
to search again for the next/previous match,
<code>less</code>
provides modifiers you can specify
before the pattern to modify its behavior:
</p>

<dl id="search-modifier">
<dt><code>!</code></dt>
 <dd>
  Find the next line that
  <strong>doesn't</strong>
  match the pattern
 </dd>
 <dt><code>*</code></dt>
 <dd>
 search across multiple files,
 starting from the current location
 in the current file
 </dd>
 <dt><code>@</code></dt>
 <dd>
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 </dd>
 <dt><code>@*</code></dt>
 <dd>
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 across multiple files
 </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Thus you would use
<code>/@*<var>«pattern»</var></code>
to search for "pattern"
starting with the first file.
</p>

<h2 id="filtering">Filtering lines</h2>

<p>
Using
<code>&amp;</code>
lets you specify a pattern
and filter the displayed lines
to only those matching the pattern,
much like an internal
<code>grep</code>
command.
If you modify it with
<code>!</code>,
so it will display only those lines that do
<em>not match</em>
the pattern, like
<code>&amp;!<var>«pattern»</var></code>.
I find this particularly helpful for browsing log-files.
</p>

<h2 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h2>
<p>
You can bookmark points in a file with
<code>m</code>
followed by a letter,
then jump back to that bookmark with
<code>'</code>
followed by the same letter.
These apply globally across all open files,
so if you
<code>ma</code>
in the third file,
then navigate away to other files,
using
<code>'a</code>
will take you back to the marked location
in that third file.
I use marks most when reading man-pages,
dropping one mark at the
<tt>OPTIONS</tt>
section such as
<code>mo</code>,
and another at the
<tt>EXAMPLES</tt>
section,
such as
<code>me</code>,
then bounce back and forth between them with
<code>'o</code>
and
<code>'e</code>.
While you can use any of
the 26 lowercase or uppercase letters
(for a total of 52 marks),
I rarely use more than two or three
either in alphabetical order
("a", "b", "c"),
or assigning mnemonics like in the
<code>man</code>-page example above.
</p>

<h3 id="bracket-matching">Bracket matching</h3>

<p>
If the first line on the screen contains a
<code>(</code>,
<code>[</code>,
or
<code>{</code>,
typing that character
will jump to the matching/closing character,
putting it on the bottom line of the screen.
Similarly, if a closing
<code>)</code>,
<code>]</code>,
or
<code>}</code>,
character appears on the last line,
typing that closing character
will jump to the matching/opening character,
putting it at the top of the screen.
I find it a little disorienting
if they fall <code>less</code> than a screen-height apart
because what feels like a forward motion
to find the next matching close-bracket
might actually result in shifting the screen
<em>down</em>
rather than
<em>up</em>
which feels backwards.
</p>

<p>
While I don't use it much,
you can also specify match-pairs using
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+f</kbd></code>
or
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+b</kbd></code>
followed by the opening/closing pair of characters
such as
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+f&lt;&gt;</kbd></code>
to define a "&lt;"…"&gt;" pair
and jump between them
in a manner similar to the
<code>(</code>/<code>)</code>,
<code>[</code>/<code>]</code>,
and
<code>{</code>/<code>)</code>
motions.
</p>

<h2 id="toggling-options">Toggling options without restarting</h2>

<p>
While the
<code>man</code>-page
documents many flags you can pass
on the command-line,
you can also toggle boolean options from inside
<code>less</code>.
I find this particularly helpful
when I've fed the output of a long-running process to
<code>less</code>
and don't want to re-run it
because it will take a long time.
Instead of quitting,
you can type a literal
<code>-</code>
followed by the option you want to change.
I most commonly want to toggle word-wrap for long lines,
so instead of quitting and adding
<code>-S</code>
at the end of my pipeline,
I can type
<code>-S</code>
directly in
<code>less</code>.
Options I commonly toggle:
</p>
<dl id="options">
<dt id="option-S"><code>-S</code></dt>
 <dd>word-wrap (mnemonic "splitting long lines")</dd>
 <dt id="option-G"><code>-G</code></dt>
 <dd>search-highlighting</dd>
 <dt id="option-I">
<code>-i</code>/<code>-I</code>
</dt>
 <dd>smart-case/case-sensitivity for searches</dd>
 <dt id="option-R"><code>-R</code></dt>
 <dd>ANSI-color escaping</dd>
 <dt id="option-N">
<code>-N</code>/<code>-n</code>
</dt>
 <dd>show/hide line-numbers</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="external-commands">Running external commands</h2>

<p>
The
<code>!</code>
lets you invoke an external command.
I don't do this often,
but occasionally I want some simple reference
like the current date
(<code>!date</code>)
or to do some simple math
(<code>!bc</code>).
</p>

<h2 id="env-vars">Default options with <code>$LESS</code>
</h2>

<p>
You might find yourself regularly setting
a common group of
<a href="#options">options</a>
so you can put those in your environment
(usually in your shell startup file like
<code>~/.bashrc</code>)
like
<code>LESS="-RNe"</code>
if you want to
<a href="#option-R">show ANSI colors</a>,
<a href="#option-N">show line-numbers</a>,
and exit automatically when you reach the end of the file.
</p>

<h2 id="other-misc">Other misc</h2>

<p>
<code>less</code>
has a few other corners that I've never really used,
but figured I'd document here:
</p>

<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>

<p>
While I've used tags in
<code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>
to easily jump between definitions.
However, even though
<code>less</code>
provides support for tags generated by
<code>ctags</code>.
I've never found cause to use them.
</p>

<h3 id="external-editor">Editing the current document</h3>

<p>
The
<code>v</code>
command will open your
<code>$VISUAL</code>
editor on the current document.
</p>

<h3 id="log-output">"Log" output</h3>

<p>
<code>less</code>
lets you redirect the output
it has gathered from
<abbr title="standard input">stdin</abbr>
to a file using the
<code>o</code>
command
(or the
<code>O</code>
command to overwrite an existing file).
This might come in handy because
<code>less</code>
won't let you
<a href="#external-editor">edit stdin
in an external editor</a>
but you can write it directly to a file.

<article>
    <p>January 2026 will mark 10 years since I started storing my personal finances in plain
text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I've taken out about 30-45 minutes every
single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount
ledger.</p>
<p>There's a lot to talk about here, but let's start with some fun numbers!</p>
<h2 id="the-10-year-old-beancount-ledger">The 10 year old Beancount ledger</h2>
<p>10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over
45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored
in a <code>finances</code> directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here's a snapshot:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find . -name </span><span>"*.beancount" </span><span>| </span><span>xargs wc -l
</span><span>    4037 ./includes/2020.beancount
</span><span>    3887 ./includes/2018.beancount
</span><span>      27 ./includes/cash.beancount
</span><span>    4398 ./includes/2021.beancount
</span><span>    5531 ./includes/2019.beancount
</span><span>    5267 ./includes/2022.beancount
</span><span>    3287 ./includes/2017.beancount
</span><span>    5506 ./includes/2024.beancount
</span><span>    5606 ./includes/2023.beancount
</span><span>    1454 ./includes/2016.beancount
</span><span>    1089 ./includes/open/04-expenses.beancount
</span><span>      66 ./includes/open/03-income.beancount
</span><span>      11 ./includes/open/05-liabilities.beancount
</span><span>      37 ./includes/open/02-assets.beancount
</span><span>       1 ./includes/open/01-equity.beancount
</span><span>    4807 ./main.beancount
</span><span>   45011 total
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running <code>bean-query</code> on <code>main.beancount</code> tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ uv run bean-query main.beancount
</span><span>Input file: </span><span>"Goel"
</span><span>Ready with 12466 directives (19743 postings in 9895 transactions)</span><span>.
</span><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are 1086 accounts in total.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select count(</span><span>*</span><span>) from (select distinct(account))</span><span>;
</span><span>coun
</span><span>----
</span><span>1086
</span></code></pre>
<p>... which does not mean that there are 1086 <strong>bank</strong> accounts. Accounts in Beancount are
virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing
supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription,
and so on.</p>
<p>Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find documents/ -name </span><span>"*.pdf" </span><span>| </span><span>wc -l
</span><span>     507
</span></code></pre>
<p>Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that
makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax
returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right
there next to the relevant transaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023
was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select year(date), count(</span><span>*</span><span>) where year(date) </span><span>&lt; </span><span>2025 </span><span>group by year(date)</span><span>;
</span><span>year  coun
</span><span>----  ----
</span><span>2016   715
</span><span>2017  1422
</span><span>2018  1605
</span><span>2019  2437
</span><span>2020  1582
</span><span>2021  2022
</span><span>2022  2435
</span><span>2023  2651
</span><span>2024  2602
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-monthly-ritual">The Monthly Ritual</h2>
<p>I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial
transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much
more detailed <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/how-you-can-track-your-personal-finances-using-python/">blog post</a> about it a few years ago, but here's a gist.</p>
<p>It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s)
in CSV (CSV because it's much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run
these CSV files through what's called an "importer", that converts this CSV data into
data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries
into my current <code>.beancount</code> file (which is the main file containing <strong>all</strong> my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it's balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction's description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.</p>
<p>Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a
<code>&lt;year&gt;.beancount</code> file and add an <code>include &lt;year.beancount&gt;</code> in the active
<code>main.beancount</code>file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.</p>
<p>With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are
contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.</p>
<h2 id="building-beancount-importers-for-german-banks">Building Beancount Importers for German Banks</h2>
<p>Beancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge
of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes
in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV
export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work
with.</p>
<p>I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few
importers for a few different banks, specifically <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-dkb">beancount-dkb</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-ing">beancount-ing</a>,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-n26">beancount-n26</a>, and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-commerzbank">beancount-commerzbank</a>. I closed out my Commerzbank account a
while ago, so I don't maintain that integration anymore, but the first three
libraries are actively maintained (and used)!</p>

<p>My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but
as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some
trial and error to figure things out and have that "aha" moment.</p>
<p>I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it's tricky for others as well. So I wrote
a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you're
interested, here's a link: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/">https://personalfinancespython.com</a>.</p>
<p>The feedback on the book has been super positive. It got mentioned on Beancount's
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/external_contributions.html">external contributions</a> page, and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/#testimonials">reader reviews</a> have all been very encouraging!</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels
invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on <strong>my own
machine</strong>, not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that
I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem
gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext
accounting is so powerful.</p>

Twenty minutes of work every week.</p><p>One net worth number I actually trust.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/01-payoff-net-worth.png" alt="Net Worth Chart growing over 2+ years" title="One net worth number to trust"></p><p><em>The payoff: A single, trustworthy net worth number growing over time.</em></p><p>No app did exactly what I needed, so I built my own personal finance system using <strong>plain-text accounting</strong> principles and a powerful Python library called <strong>Beancount</strong>. This post shows you how I handle imports, investments, multi-currency, and a two-person view.</p><h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h2><p>It all started during the 2021 tax season. I had blocked out an entire weekend and was juggling statements, trying to compute capital gains, stressing about getting the numbers mixed up. “This is chaos”, I thought. “There must be a way to simplify this with automation”. Being a software engineer, I did what felt natural and hacked together a bunch of scripts on top of a database.</p><p>Though it worked and I kept using it day-to-day, by the next tax season the cracks became obvious. The code was hard to debug, random transactions went missing, and worst of all, the balances the scripts computed didn’t match the balances on my statements. I tried to fix it but the more I tried, the more I felt lost about what the system was really doing. Eventually I just gave up.</p><p>Why did I fail so spectacularly? My entire approach was flawed from the start! I’d ignored centuries of accounting wisdom and repeated fundamental mistakes humanity solved long ago. So I learned from my mistakes and did the research. And over time I incrementally discovered <strong>double-entry bookkeeping</strong>, <strong>plain-text accounting</strong> and <strong>Beancount</strong>.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and I have a flexible, powerful, and private system, fully customized to how my brain works. Most transactions import automatically from PDF statements (counterintuitively, it’s often more reliable than CSV!). Tax time is a simple matter of checking always-fresh reports and copying numbers over. The weekly ritual is simple: download statements, categorize transactions in a web UI, run a bunch of scripts to regenerate, commit (I walk through this in more detail later).</p><p>However, I want to be realistic: building a system like this takes time and effort.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You will need to learn some basic accounting concepts, be comfortable with Python, and consistently spend time every week keeping things up-to-date. If your finances are simple or you just want day-to-day budgeting, this is almost certainly overkill. Apps like YNAB or even the humble spreadsheet work great.</p><p>But if you want uncompromising control over how you look at your finances, read on.</p><h2 id="chapter-1-the-concepts">Chapter 1: The Concepts</h2><h4 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-entry bookkeeping</h4><p>Suppose on a Saturday, I transfer money from my checking account to a savings account. The money leaves on the same day but doesn’t show up on the other side until Monday. So where was it for those two days?</p><p>In a “normal”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> personal finance system, the answer would be that it was just gone. That is, for those two days, there would be a drop in the total money in two accounts. But this is weird because in reality my “net worth” did not change, yet there’s no good way to represent this.</p><p>Or suppose I pay $90 for a dinner for me and two friends. They pay me back a week later. Again, in this case the money is “gone” for that week. And even worse, the full $90 would be categorized as a “restaurant expense” while each $30 my friends paid would be “income”. But this is wrong. My expense is just $30 and the money they give me should be matched against the $60 they owe me.</p><p>Both of these are fundamental problems with how so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-entry_bookkeeping">single-entry bookkeeping</a>” works: each account’s transactions and balance are tracked individually but without the context of the “whole”. In the case of the transfer, because we’re looking at each account in isolation, we lose the fact that even though the money has left one account, it’s really still part of the “pool of money” that belongs to us. Similarly, when our friends pay us back, we’re not tracking the fact that our friends owe us money when the original transaction happened and their payment later neutralizes the debt.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">Double-entry bookkeeping</a> is the solution to both these problems. Businesses have been using it for hundreds of years<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to run their accounts, and it has powerful yet elegant ways to solve these problems and many others too.</p><p>Let’s consider again the transfer. In double-entry bookkeeping, we would represent the initial move of money as:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking              -1000
</span></span><span><span>Transfer-In-Flight         +1000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And when it arrives:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Transfer-In-Flight         -1000
</span></span><span><span>Savings-Account            +1000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In both cases, we see the “golden rules” of double-entry bookkeeping:</p><ol><li><em>Every transaction has at least two sides and the sum of all the sides is zero</em>. -1000 + 1000 = 0. That is, transactions always “balance”.</li><li><em>Every side of a transaction is an account</em>, whether it exists in the real world or not.</li></ol><p>It should be clear that “Bank-Checking” and “Savings-Account” are labels for your checking and savings accounts, respectively. But what is “Transfer-In-Flight”?</p><p>Well, it’s also an account! It’s not an account you’ll find on your bank’s website, but within the double-entry system, it’s <em>just as real</em>. Concretely, accounts in double-entry are just labels for a “bucket of money”. So there’s no “category to put this transaction under”, no “expense tracking”, no special “transfer tag”. Everything is an account.</p><p>In this specific case, <code>Bank-Checking</code>, <code>Savings-Account</code>, and <code>Transfer-In-Flight</code> are all a specific type of account: they are <strong>Asset</strong> accounts. Assets are stuff you own; these can be real accounts (bank account, savings, stocks, bonds) or conceptual accounts (money in transit between accounts).</p><p>Now let’s consider the dinner example. There are 4 sides to the transaction:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Credit-Card                  -90
</span></span><span><span>Restaurant-Expense           +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Alice                +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Bob                  +30
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, -90 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 0. It balances. All of <code>Credit-Card</code>, <code>Restaurant-Expense</code>, <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code>, and <code>Owes-Me:Bob</code> are just accounts.</p><p><code>Credit-Card</code> is a different type of account though: it’s a <strong>Liability</strong>. Liabilities are the opposite of assets: instead of stuff you own, they’re stuff you <strong>owe</strong> to someone else. So for example, loans, credit cards, and mortgages are all liabilities.</p><p>Why <strong>negative</strong> 90? The rule is always: negative means money flowed <em>from</em> this account and positive means it flowed <em>into</em> this account. The credit card company fronted you $90, so that money flowed from your credit card to fund the purchase.</p><p><code>Restaurant-Expense</code> is yet another type of account, an <strong>Expense</strong> account. Expense accounts are money “leaving your world”. So any time you spend some money and you no longer have access to it, that’s an expense.</p><p>Finally, <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code> and <code>Owes-Me:Bob</code> are also <strong>Assets</strong>. Alice and Bob have promised to pay you back, and that promise has value, $30 each. It’s not cash in your pocket, but it’s money you have a claim on. In double-entry, anything with economic value you control is an asset, whether it’s a bank balance or an IOU.</p><p>Later, when Alice pays you back:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking               +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Alice               -30
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is just money moving from the “virtual” <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code> to the “real” <code>Bank-Checking</code> account. Both of these are still assets; it’s just the <em>type</em> of asset that’s changing. So no money has “entered the system” at this point. You’re just settling the debt Alice owed you.</p><p>Let’s take one last example: a paycheck.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking              +3000
</span></span><span><span>Salary                     -3000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>Bank-Checking</code> is an <strong>Asset</strong> as we’ve learned. But <code>Salary</code> is a new account type, an <strong>Income</strong> account. Just like <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong> are opposites, so are <strong>Income</strong> and <strong>Expenses</strong>. Where <strong>Expenses</strong> are money leaving your world, <strong>Income</strong> is money entering it.</p><p>Money flowed from Salary (source, negative) to Bank-Checking (destination, positive). The sign feels backwards: “I <em>received</em> money, so why is Income <em>negative</em>?” Because the sign shows direction of flow: income is where the money <em>came from</em>, and your bank is where it <em>went to</em>.</p><p>This is the one part of double-entry that takes repetition.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Don’t try to make it intuitive; just trust the invariant: <strong>if your transaction sums to zero, you’ve got the signs right.</strong> After a dozen transactions, the pattern becomes automatic.</p><p>These four types of accounts cover 99% of what you’ll do:</p><ul><li><strong>Assets</strong>: stuff you own (bank accounts, cash, investments, money owed to you)</li><li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: stuff you owe (credit cards, loans)</li><li><strong>Income</strong>: money entering your world (salary, interest, dividends)</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: money leaving your world (groceries, rent, restaurants)</li></ul><p>There’s a fifth type, <strong>Equity</strong>, which is a catch-all “this money doesn’t fit elsewhere” bucket.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Suppose you start tracking an account that already has $1000 in it; that money came from <strong>somewhere</strong> but you don’t have a record of that. It can’t be income because you already had it, and the other types don’t fit. That’s a good sign it belongs in equity. The good news is that you rarely interact with Equity directly. Generally, the software handles it for you, but there are some exceptions that we’ll cover in Chapter 2.</p><p>There’s so much more that could be said about double-entry bookkeeping. For further reading, I particularly like the <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method.html">double entry explainer</a> in the Beancount docs. It goes through some more examples and expands into a bunch of related topics.</p><p>But we now have the foundation which ensures that every transaction balances, every dollar is accounted for, and nothing slips through the cracks. But we still need a way to actually record and store these transactions.</p><h4 id="plain-text-accounting">Plain text accounting</h4><p>One of the things I learned from writing my own finance system is that auditability is king. You need the ability to eyeball a transaction, ask yourself “does this look right,” and fix it if it doesn’t. And nothing beats being able to see and edit any transaction you’ve ever made in a text editor.</p><p>That’s one of the main things that drew me to the philosophy of <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">Plain Text Accounting</a>. This is a set of principles on using plain text files as the “immutable source of truth” of your finances and then building scripts and tools on top of them to process, analyze, and visualize them.</p><p>There are many other advantages to this I’ve come to appreciate over the years:</p><p><strong>Everything is version controlled.</strong> You can store these transaction files in a git repo, which has powerful effects. You can look at diffs to see what changed on any day. You can <code>git blame</code> any transaction to see when and why it was added. You can <code>git tag</code> important states of the repo (e.g. when taxes were filed, when a new job was started, when a big refactoring happened). You can <code>git checkout</code> any previous state to see e.g. “how did my repo look last year”.</p><p><strong>It’s private</strong> so you never have to trust any third party with all your financial details. Everything can be stored in locations that you fully control.</p><p><strong>There’s no lock-in.</strong> Because everything is just a plain text file, it’s trivially easy to change how you want things to be represented: you don’t have to deal with apps with broken or messy CSV exports making it difficult to take your data elsewhere.</p><p><strong>It’s scriptable</strong>. If you want to refactor something, compute a new breakdown or even rewrite your system entirely, all you need is to write a script. Whether you write it yourself or prompt an LLM to do it for you, the text-based format makes automation trivial.</p><p>Plain text gives you the abstract idea of “storing transactions in text” but there’s still a bunch of questions. What’s the transaction syntax? How do you parse your files? How do you validate that everything balances, compute totals, and let you query the results? That’s where <strong>Beancount</strong> comes in.</p><h4 id="introducing-beancount">Introducing Beancount!</h4><p>Over the years, people have written many plain-text accounting tools which answer all the questions above. The main ones you’ll find which have gained a lot of popularity are <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>hledger</strong>, and <strong>Beancount</strong>. I’ve used each of them at some point in my plain text journey and all are solid choices. But I ended up on Beancount for a few reasons.</p><p><strong>It’s a Python library</strong>, not just a command-line tool. I can write importers that parse my bank’s PDF statements, generate transactions programmatically, and build custom reports, all in a language I already know.</p><p><strong>Strictness by default</strong>. Accounts must be declared before use, so typos get caught immediately. Transactions must balance and there are immediate error messages if they don’t. The tool catches mistakes early rather than letting them propagate.</p><p><strong>Plugin and tool ecosystem</strong>. Beancount has a very rich set of libraries and tools which build on top of and integrate with it. Along with the core project, you get access to any and all of these projects you want to use. We’ll discuss this much more later.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/beancount/fava">Fava</a></strong>. The web UI which sits on top of the Beancount engine. It’s so good that people convert from other formats (using tools like <a href="https://github.com/beancount/ledger2beancount">ledger2beancount</a> or <a href="https://github.com/shivanshu7/gnucash2beancount">gnucash2beancount</a>) just to use it. Where Beancount gives you the reliable engine, Fava gives you the pretty yet powerful frontend:</p><ul><li><strong>Reports</strong>: balance sheet, income statement, transaction journal</li><li><strong>Query editor</strong>: SQL-like queries, exportable to CSV</li><li><strong>Charts</strong>: spending breakdowns, net worth over time, holdings by currency</li><li><strong>Error highlighting</strong>: problems highlighted immediately</li><li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: plugins like <a href="https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-dashboards">fava-dashboards</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-portfolio-returns">fava-portfolio-returns</a></li></ul><p>With this, we now understand enough of the basic concepts for us to get started trying out Beancount!</p><h2 id="chapter-2-getting-started">Chapter 2: Getting Started</h2><p>The best way to learn plain-text accounting is to roll up your sleeves and try it out. So let’s pause the theory for a moment and get a real ledger running on your machine.</p><p>I’ve built a companion repository, <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples">LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples</a>, which contains a cut-down version of the system I use day-to-day. The repo is organized into folders that match the chapters of this post (<code>chapter-2/</code>, <code>chapter-3/</code>, etc.), each building on the previous. It also includes a <code>demo/</code> folder with 2+ years of synthetic history if you want to see the end result immediately.</p><p><strong>To get started, clone the repository:</strong></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>git clone https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples.git
</span></span><span><span>cd beancount-blog-examples
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Run the demo to see the end result</span>
</span></span><span><span>./scripts/quickstart.sh demo
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Or start Chapter 2 to follow the guide</span>
</span></span><span><span>./scripts/quickstart.sh chapter-2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will set up a Python environment, install dependencies, and open Fava at http://localhost:5000. Here’s what you should see.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/02-first-look-trial-balance.png" alt="Fava Trial Balance showing Assets, Income, and Expenses" title="First look at Fava"></p><p><em>Fava's Trial Balance view shows assets, income, and expenses in one place.</em></p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/03-sunburst-expenses.png" alt="Sunburst chart breaking down expenses" title="Visualizing expenses"></p><p><em>Sunburst charts make it easy to spot your biggest expense categories instantly.</em></p><p>Click around the different tabs. You’ll find that Fava gives you the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance sheet</strong>: the state of your accounts at the current point in time. Basically think of it as an aggregate view of all your finances. You can answer questions like “what’s my net worth now?”, “how much money do I owe across my credit cards?” or “how much have I gained from investments?”</li><li><strong>Income statement</strong>: the sum of all the money flows into/out of your accounts. Think of it as a sum of all the income and expenses across time. You can answer questions like “how much did I earn from my job?”, “how much did I spend on Amazon?” or “did I spend more or less than last year?”</li><li><strong>Transaction history</strong>: a flat list of all transactions you have in your journal. A way to see and search any transaction you’ve made across any accounts in your system.</li></ul><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/04-query-console.png" alt="Fava Query Console running a SQL query" title="SQL for your finances"></p><p><em>The Query Console lets you run SQL-like queries against your financial data.</em></p><p>There’s much more to Fava’s features (queries, multi-currency, plugins) as we’ll see later on in the post.</p><p>You can also explore the text journal itself using a text editor. For example, here’s a grocery run and a payslip in the Beancount transaction format:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Go through the transactions and get a feel for the format. It might seem alien at first but trust me when I say soon it’ll feel like the most natural thing in the world!</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/05-ide-experience.png" alt="VS Code with Beancount extension showing syntax highlighting" title="The IDE Experience"></p><p><em>With a VS Code extension, you get syntax highlighting and auto-completion for your accounts.</em></p><p>Now that you have a working system, I want to share the hard-won insights that aren’t in the official docs. This post isn’t going to be a full Beancount tutorial. The <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/getting_started_with_beancount.html">official docs</a> are excellent for that (Fava even has a <a href="https://fava.pythonanywhere.com/example-beancount-file/income_statement/">demo</a> that you can try without downloading anything!).</p><p>Instead, I want to focus on the <em>architecture</em>: the decisions I wish I’d made correctly from day one. I’m writing this as if I’m speaking to my past self.</p><h4 id="start-with-one-account">Start with one account</h4><p>You don’t need to track everything on day one. Pick one account. Your main checking account is a good start. Get comfortable with the flow. Import statements, categorize transactions, check that balances match. Once that feels solid, add another account. Then another.</p><p>I started with my HSBC current account. Now, I have my whole financial life inside the system and I trust it wholeheartedly. But this happened one account at a time. If I tried to do everything in one go, I would certainly have been overwhelmed and given up on the whole thing.</p><h4 id="opening-balances">Opening balances</h4><p>Once you’ve picked your first account, you face an immediate problem: you may have opened that account years ago and there might already be thousands of transactions over that time. Trying to import them all in one go is another sure path to being overwhelmed and giving up.</p><p>Instead, a better idea is to pick a “starting date” at which you say “I will import everything from this day onwards”. But that poses its own problem: you already had money in that account, how do you tell Beancount it exists?</p><p>Well, Beancount has a <code>pad</code> directive that creates the balancing entry automatically:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/balance.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Equity:Opening-Balances
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 pad Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP Equity:Opening-Balances
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-02 balance Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP  1500.00 GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>pad</code> directive tells Beancount: “whatever amount is needed to make the balance assertion true, take it from <code>Equity:Opening-Balances</code> and put it in this account”. This is one of the rare cases you actually have to think about equity accounts (though not much beyond blindly using <code>Equity:Opening-Balances</code>!).</p><h3 id="structure-that-scales">Structure That Scales</h3><p>Adding a first account is easy and the second is straightforward, but adding a third, fourth, fifth… and you can easily find that things start becoming jumbled and messy. Just like code, putting a little bit of thought into the organization upfront goes a long way. This part covers the architectural decisions you’ll thank yourself later for.</p><h4 id="naming-asset-and-liability-accounts">Naming Asset and Liability accounts</h4><p>The structure of asset and liability account names is very important, much more than I initially gave them credit for. It’s a good idea to keep as much information in them as possible. Here’s what I’ve settled on:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/accounts.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP          GBP
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP      GBP
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Liabilities:Lalit:UK:AMEX:GBP             GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The pattern is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Type:Person:Region:Institution:Account:Currency
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why this structure? Because it’s a lot easier to <em>remove detail</em> than add it in later! I initially started by not having the country, the currency or my name in the account. But over time, I wanted to understand:</p><ul><li>How much money I have in the UK vs the US?</li><li>How much cash (i.e. not investments) is in a certain currency?</li><li>How much of our household wealth was in my wife’s accounts vs my own (discussed in more detail in Chapter 6)?</li></ul><p>Having this information in the account name is great because Beancount’s SQL syntax makes it very easy to filter on account names. Want “all UK assets”? Filter on <code>:UK:</code>. Want “all HSBC accounts”? Filter on <code>:HSBC:</code>. Want “all GBP cash”? Filter on <code>:GBP</code>.</p><h4 id="powering-up-with-plugins">Powering up with Plugins</h4><p>Once you have a structure, you want to ensure it stays clean. This is where Beancount’s <strong>Plugins</strong> come in.</p><p>Plugins are Python scripts that run when your ledger loads. They can validate data, modify entries, or even generate new transactions automatically. You load them in your journal file like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>plugin "beancount.plugins.check_commodity"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remember the transfer-in-flight pattern from Chapter 1? Here’s how it looks in Beancount:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>; Money leaves on Saturday
</span></span><span><span>2024-03-16 * "Transfer to Barclays"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP      -1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal        1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>; Money arrives on Monday
</span></span><span><span>2024-03-18 * "Transfer from HSBC"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal       -1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP   1000.00 GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once both transactions are recorded, the transit account balance returns to zero, confirming the transfer is complete. If you record one leg of a transfer but forget the other, the transit account will simply show a non-zero balance.</p><p>Understanding where a non-zero balance in transfers is coming from is handled by my absolute favorite plugin, <strong><a href="https://github.com/redstreet/beancount_reds_plugins">beancount_reds_plugins.zerosum</a></strong>. It’s responsible for matching both sides of a transaction and moving it to a separate account, meaning my <code>Transfers:Internal</code> account only contains the actual “pending” transactions. Making this account empty is a surprisingly satisfying little “minigame” during my weekly imports (though it never lasts for long!).</p><p>There are also a couple more plugins that make handling closed accounts better:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/master/beancount/plugins/close_tree.py">beancount.plugins.close_tree</a></strong> - When you close an account, automatically closes all child accounts too. Useful as you move your banking between institutions.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/daniel-wells/beancount_checkclosed">beancount_checkclosed.check_closed</a></strong> - Validates that closed accounts have zero balance and no transactions after the close date.</li></ul><h4 id="the-boundary-of-your-system">The boundary of your system</h4><p>As you add accounts one by one, you’ll inevitably see money flowing to places you haven’t set up yet. Say you transfer £500 to a Natwest savings account you haven’t added to the system.

Putting it in an equity account means it doesn’t pollute your balance sheet with incomplete information <em>or</em> your income statement with false expenses.</p><p>Note also the best practice of using a <em>named</em> equity account per untracked destination, not a generic bucket; this was a mistake I made when I did this initially.

If you stop here, you have a robust, auditable system for manual bookkeeping. You could continue adding transactions by hand indefinitely, and you’d still be miles ahead of any spreadsheet in terms of correctness and visibility.</p><p>But manual entry is a chore, and as your financial life grows, it becomes a bottleneck. In the next chapter, we’ll see how to automate the tedious part: getting transactions from your bank statements into your ledger without losing the control that plain-text accounting gives you.</p><h2 id="chapter-3-automated-import">Chapter 3: Automated Import</h2><h4 id="automation-is-king-but-harder-than-it-looks">Automation is king, but harder than it looks</h4><p>Inputting transactions by hand works for some people, but I don’t have the patience for it. Ever since I was young, I’ve always wanted to automate everything: it’s the reason why I became a software engineer in the first place!</p><p>But full automation is a dead end. Most banks don’t offer APIs, and scraping breaks constantly. 2FA flows change <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, websites get redesigned, sessions expire. I tried this route, and it wasn’t worth it. Even in the US where aggregators like Plaid exist, coverage is patchy.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> In the UK, it’s impossible.</p><h4 id="the-hierarchy-of-data-sources">The hierarchy of data sources</h4><p>So what actually works? Well ideally your financial institution gives you something you can write a script against. But what that might be is non-obvious and counter-intuitive. Here’s the hierarchy I’ve landed on over time:</p><ul><li><strong>OFX is the gold standard.</strong> If your bank offers it, use it. The format is standardized, transactions have unique IDs, and deduplication is straightforward. Life is easy if you have good OFX.</li><li><strong>CSV is the deceptive runner-up.</strong> It seems like the logical choice. Structured data, right? But in practice, bank CSVs are often afterthoughts. I’ve seen column formats change without notice, “CSVs” that are actually weird custom formats spread over multiple lines, and rows coalesced in ways that lose critical information (like cost basis).</li></ul><p>So what do you do when OFX isn’t available and CSV isn’t trustworthy? You turn to an unlikely hero.</p><h4 id="why-pdfs-beat-csvs">Why PDFs beat CSVs</h4><p>It sounds backwards, but PDFs are often the most reliable data source available.</p><p>Banks have a strong incentive to get PDFs right. Customers actually read them. They’re legal documents that get printed and filed. If a bank messes up a PDF statement, they hear about it immediately. If they break a CSV export, it might go months without anyone noticing.</p><p>The key insight is that bank statement PDFs are almost always columnar. Of course, this relies on the PDF having a proper text layer; if your bank sends you scanned images, you’re out of luck (though I’ve yet to encounter one that does). When you convert them to text while preserving the layout, you get something that looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Date      Details                      Paid out     Paid in     Balance

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The columns are aligned by spaces, which means you can parse them as fixed-width data. The approach works in three steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Convert PDF to text</strong>: Run <code>pdftotext -layout statement.pdf statement.txt</code>. The <code>-layout</code> flag preserves the original column alignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find the table boundaries</strong>: Bank statements have predictable markers. HSBC uses “BALANCE BROUGHT FORWARD” at the start and “BALANCE CARRIED FORWARD” at the end. You extract just the transaction rows between these markers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parse with fixed-width columns</strong>: Pandas’ <code>read_fwf</code> function is designed exactly for this. You put this logic inside the <code>extract()</code> method of your <code>beangulp</code> importer class, where it converts the text into a DataFrame:</p></li></ol><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span># Inside your Importer class</span>

</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The column positions come from inspecting the header row. In practice, I detect them dynamically by finding keywords like “Paid out” and “Paid in” in the header and using their character positions.</p><p>Once you have a DataFrame, generating Beancount transactions is straightforward. You write a small class that iterates through this DataFrame and maps each row to a Beancount <code>Transaction</code> object, filling in the date, amount, and payee. See my <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/importers/hsbc.py">HSBC importer</a> for a working example.</p><p>For 95% of my banks, this approach works great. However, there is one bank where the text spacing becomes very strange and so I need to use something else. That’s when I turn to <a href="https://tabula.technology/">Tabula</a>, a Java CLI that extracts data tables from PDFs, even very complex ones.</p><p>The main reason I don’t use it all the time is that it’s much slower. But it also succeeds in the cases where <code>pdftotext</code> fails. I run it to get a structured JSON output, from which I create transactions (see my <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/importers/hsbc_us_cc.py">HSBC US credit card importer</a>).</p><p>I’m sure some readers will have worries about the fragility of what I’ve described here. I can tell you from experience that in three years, neither my UK nor my US HSBC PDF importer has ever broken. Neither has my Schwab one, and my Aviva one has only needed a single change. So I can personally vouch that this approach works and works <strong>well</strong>.</p><h4 id="from-raw-data-to-transactions">From raw data to transactions</h4><p>OK, so now you have statements. What do you do then? There are two pieces to the puzzle: parsing statements into transactions, and categorizing those transactions.</p><p>For parsing, Beancount has an official importer framework called <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/beangulp.html">beangulp</a>. You write a Python class that knows how to read a particular file format (the <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/blob/main/chapter-3/importers/hsbc.py">skeleton importer</a> in <code>chapter-3/</code> already uses this API). Beangulp handles the mechanics: identifying which importer handles which file, extracting transactions, and deduplicating against existing entries.</p><p>But beangulp just extracts transactions without making any judgment on which account the transaction should be booked against. It doesn’t know that Tesco is groceries or that British Airways is an airline. I go to a new restaurant. How does the system know that <em>is</em> a restaurant?</p><p>This leads to a very important conclusion: we <strong>cannot</strong> fully automate importing transactions for bank accounts and credit cards. However, that doesn’t mean we have to enter things manually either. There’s a middle ground.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import">beancount-import</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> (Note: this is a standalone tool, distinct from Fava’s built-in import features). It’s a web UI that uses your beangulp importers and adds a categorization layer on top. You run it, it opens in your browser, and it presents pending transactions one by one for review. Think of it as a staging area where you approve or tweak before anything hits your ledger.</p><p>For each transaction, it shows the raw data from your statement alongside a suggested categorization. You can accept the suggestion, override it with a different account, or skip it entirely. Once you decide, it moves to the next one. The interface is simple, mostly keyboard-driven and optimized for speed.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/06-import-ui.png" alt="Beancount Import Web UI" title="Visual Categorization"></p><p><em>The import UI allows you to manually categorize transactions, like this Tesco grocery run, while the system learns your preferences.</em></p><p>The categorization uses machine learning (old-school decision trees, running locally, no LLMs, no cloud). It learns from your previous choices: the first time you see “Tesco”, you pick “Expenses:Groceries”, and the second time it auto-suggests and you just hit Enter. After a few weeks, the system should know 90% of the types of transactions you make and it’s easy to correct the ones which it doesn’t.</p><p>Once you’re proficient, a month’s worth of transactions takes 5-10 minutes. Most are repeats and you’re just hitting Enter. You only pause on genuinely new merchants. This is the core of my weekly ritual, and why I’ve found categorization has not become a chore, even after doing it for years.</p><h4 id="exit-ramp-1">Exit ramp</h4><p>With automated imports and semi-automated categorization, the “hard work” of bookkeeping is mostly solved. For many, this is the endgame: a perfect record of where every penny went, updated in minutes each week.</p><p>But your net worth isn’t just cash in a bank account. It’s also the stocks, bonds, and funds that grow (or shrink) over time. Tracking these requires a few more tools to handle cost basis, dividends, and market prices. We’ll tackle those in Chapter 4.</p><h2 id="chapter-4-investments">Chapter 4: Investments</h2><p>Now for investments. It’s where things get more interesting, and I think there’s less material out there covering the nitty-gritty. Here are some lessons I’ve learned over the years.</p><h4 id="the-unified-mental-model">The Unified Mental Model</h4><p>The most important thing to realize is that Beancount treats <strong>everything</strong> as a commodity.</p><p>A share of Apple (<code>AAPL</code>) is a commodity. A US Dollar (<code>USD</code>) is a commodity. A British Pound (<code>GBP</code>) is a commodity. While Beancount <em>can</em> infer these on the fly, you’ll typically declare them explicitly in your journal (e.g., <code>2024-01-01 commodity AAPL</code>).<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p><p>This explicit declaration is a small but critical architectural win: it prevents a simple typo from creating a phantom currency, and it provides the metadata that advanced reporting plugins (like those used to calculate your portfolio performance) rely on to work correctly.</p><p>This means you don’t “buy stocks with money”. You simply exchange one commodity for another. The syntax for buying shares is identical to the syntax for exchanging currency.</p><h4 id="the-account-structure">The Account Structure</h4><p>Just like with bank accounts, I break investments down by institution and security.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-4/src/accounts.beancount

I create specific accounts for each security:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>2024-01-01 open Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Dividends        USD

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why so granular?</strong> It’s the same reason I name assets fully: aggregation up the tree is trivial; disaggregation after the fact is impossible. If you track all your dividends in a single <code>Income:Dividends</code> account, it’s easy to know “how much dividends did I earn total?”. But if you want to know “what was my AAPL dividend yield this year?”, you’re out of luck. Track at the leaf (<code>Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends</code>), and you can answer both questions.</p><h4 id="the-notation">The Notation</h4><p>With our accounts defined, we can now record the actual movement of assets. We use <code>{}</code> to denote cost (what we paid per unit) and <code>@</code> to denote price (what the unit is worth now).</p><p><strong>Example 1: Buying Stock</strong>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we specify the lot we’re selling (<code>{185.00 USD}</code>) and the price we’re selling it at (<code>@ 190.00 USD</code>). The difference is the capital gain (or loss).</p><p>But the principle is identical: <code>Assets:Wise:INR</code> and <code>Assets:Brokerage:AAPL</code> are just accounts holding commodities.</p><h4 id="automation">Automation</h4><p>Investments are very different from normal accounts in that they can be <strong>fully automated</strong>. No categorization needed: a buy is a buy, a dividend is a dividend. You don’t have new merchants to worry about.</p><p>This means you can skip beancount-import’s web UI and run your beangulp importers directly with output going straight to the ledger. To help inspire you, I’ve open-sourced my personal collection of importers (IB, Vanguard, Schwab, and more) in the <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/tree/main/src/beancount_tools/importers">beancount-lalitm</a> repo.</p><h4 id="handling-account-sprawl">Handling Account Sprawl</h4><p>However, one annoyance is that creating those granular accounts for every single stock (<code>...:AAPL:Dividends</code>, <code>...:AAPL:Commissions</code>, etc.) is tedious.

Instead of manual account creation, you just add metadata to the main holding account:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>2023-02-01 open Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:BAC    BAC

For most people, this is a complete solution.</p><p>However, as you collect more data, you’ll find you want to look at it in different ways. Maybe you want a simplified view for daily use and a detailed one for tax season. Or maybe you’re not the only person in your household. In the final chapters, we’ll see how to scale this system to handle multiple views and multiple people.</p><h2 id="chapter-5-multiple-views">Chapter 5: Multiple Views</h2><p>Day-to-day, I want a simple view of my finances. Take-home pay as a single number, investments without tax calculations cluttering the screen. But at tax time, I need detail. Every payslip line item and capital gains calculated the way HMRC wants them. Recording the same transaction twice would be maintenance hell. So instead, I extract multiple views from a single journal.</p><p>I think of these as “lenses” on the data. Some lenses <strong>aggregate</strong>: rolling up transactions into balances, summaries, or dashboards. Others <strong>transform</strong>: collapsing detail you don’t need day-to-day, or expanding it when you do. Both read from the same source files; nothing is duplicated.</p><h4 id="aggregated-views">Aggregated views</h4><p>Fava is great for interactive exploration, but I also want textual snapshots I can version control. I have a script that generates daily summaries showing account balances, and a CI workflow that commits them automatically. In my setup this runs on a self-hosted Gitea instance on hardware I control, so the raw ledger never leaves machines I own. If you prefer, you can keep everything local-only or push to an encrypted remote; GitHub Actions works the same way if you’re comfortable with that trade-off. This gives me:</p><ul><li>A record of how balances changed day to day</li><li>An immutable snapshot at tax time of what the system showed</li><li>Git as audit trail: “What was my net worth on March 15th 2023?” is answerable with <code>git checkout</code></li></ul><p>The key script is <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/blob/main/chapter-5/scripts/archive.py">archive.py</a>.

This is a more advanced technique: while Aggregated views <em>read</em> data, Transformed views temporarily <em>rewrite</em> it in memory to simplify reality.</p><p>I have three transformed views, each for a different purpose:</p><ul><li><strong>Net</strong> - my daily driver. Collapses payslip details into a single take-home number.</li><li><strong>Gross</strong> - breaks down payslip line items for tax time analysis.</li><li><strong>CGT</strong> - a view that includes a “virtual currency” tracking capital gains the way my tax authority calculates them.</li></ul><p>The linchpin is the <code>rename_accounts</code> plugin. It lets me keep one copy of all transactions and rename accounts on the fly to show or hide detail.</p><p><strong>Gross vs net payslip</strong></p><p>Let me start with the simpler example. In gross view, my payslip shows every line item:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>2024-01-25 * "Google" "January salary"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP           3500.00 GBP  ; Take-home pay

</span></span><span><span>  Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:National-Insurance 400.00 GBP  ; NI contribution
</span></span><span><span>  Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Pension            100.00 GBP  ; Pension contribution
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Useful for analyzing my tax situation. But day-to-day, I don’t care about the breakdown. In net view, the same transaction collapses:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-5/journal-net.beancount
</span></span><span><span>include "journal.beancount"
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{

</span></span><span><span>  'Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Pension': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
</span></span><span><span>}"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because Income is stored as a negative number and Expenses as positive numbers, merging them into one account mathematically subtracts the tax from the gross pay, leaving just the net amount. The difference should be obvious if I compare the Income Statements on Fava:</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/10-gross-view.png" alt="Gross Income Statement view showing all tax line items" title="Gross View"></p><p><em>The Gross view is essential for tax season, but the detailed line items for taxes and insurance often dwarf your actual spending data.</em></p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/11-net-view.png" alt="Net Income Statement view showing take-home pay" title="Net View"></p><p><em>The Net view collapses those details into a single take-home number, making your everyday expenses much easier to analyze.</em></p><h4 id="tracking-capital-gains-for-tax">Tracking capital gains for tax</h4><p>We can use this same renaming technique to handle a much more complex beast: <strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>.</p><p>Your broker reports one gain number, but your tax authority may calculate another. In the UK, where I live, we have specific rules like “Section 104 pooling” (averaging cost basis) and “bed-and-breakfasting” (wash sale rules).</p><p>To handle this, I use a virtual currency called <code>CGT-GBP</code> that represents “pounds of gain HMRC cares about”. My plugin, <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/plugins/uk_cgt_lots.py"><code>uk_cgt_lots</code></a>, calculates this number and automatically appends a <strong>self-balancing pair of Equity postings</strong> to the original sale transaction:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>2024-06-15 * "SELL AAPL"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL           -10 AAPL {150.00 USD} @ 175.00 USD
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:USD            1750.00 USD
</span></span><span><span>  Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Capital-Gains  -250.00 USD
</span></span><span><span>  ; The following postings are generated by the uk_cgt_lots plugin:
</span></span><span><span>  Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains              195.00 CGT-GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder -195.00 CGT-GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since both legs are in <code>Equity</code>, they remain invisible on my Income Statement in my daily “Net” view. In fact, I use <code>rename_accounts</code> to collapse them into a single account so they net to zero:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; journal-net.beancount
</span></span><span><span>plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
</span></span><span><span>  'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder' : 'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains',
</span></span><span><span>}"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But when I want to see my tax liability, I switch to the <strong>CGT View</strong>. This view renames the “Placeholder” to a visible Revenue account:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; journal-cgt.beancount
</span></span><span><span>plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
</span></span><span><span>  'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder' : 'Revenues:Taxable-Capital-Gains',
</span></span><span><span>}"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, the -195.00 becomes Revenue, which shows up as profit on my tax report. The matching +195.00 remains in Equity. This allows me to have “Schrödinger’s Capital Gains”: they exist for the taxman, but not for my daily budget, all controlled by which view I load.</p><p>I don’t calculate the tax owed since that’s too complicated with allowances, rates, and bands; the system just tracks the gains. At tax time, I sum up the CGT-GBP balance and do the actual calculation on the tax form.</p><h4 id="exit-ramp-3">Exit ramp</h4><p>By separating your “source of truth” from your “lenses,” you get a system that grows with you. You can add new plugins or virtual currencies to solve specific problems (like taxes) without ever touching the raw transactions you’ve already imported.</p><p>In the final chapter, we’ll see the ultimate application of this: combining two people’s financial lives into one unified view.</p><h2 id="chapter-6-two-people-one-number">Chapter 6: Two People, One Number</h2><p>I got married at the start of the year, which brought a fundamental change to how I manage my finances. While many couples use joint accounts, we prefer to keep our individual accounts and perform occasional “normalization” transfers. However, we view our combined resources as shared household wealth.</p><p>This created a reporting paradox that I had to solve in Beancount.</p><h4 id="the-paradox">The Paradox</h4><p>When I transfer £500 to my wife for my share of the bills, two things are true simultaneously:</p><ol><li><strong>The Individual Truth:</strong> From my perspective, £500 is “gone” (an expense). From her perspective, £500 has “arrived” (income).</li><li><strong>The Household Truth:</strong> For the household, the net worth hasn’t changed. Money just moved from the left pocket to the right pocket.</li></ol><p>In a traditional system, you usually have to pick one truth. In Beancount, we can have both.</p><h4 id="the-composable-architecture">The Composable Architecture</h4><p>To solve this, I treat the household as a composable system of three distinct entities: <strong>Me</strong>, <strong>Her</strong>, and <strong>Shared Definitions</strong>. We use Beancount’s <code>include</code> feature to build the specific “lens” we need at any given moment:</p><ul><li><strong>Lalit’s View</strong> = Shared Definitions + Lalit’s Transactions</li><li><strong>Wife’s View</strong> = Shared Definitions + Wife’s Transactions</li><li><strong>Household View</strong> = Shared Definitions + Lalit’s Transactions + Wife’s Transactions + <em>Translation Logic</em></li></ul><p>For example, the household view literally just includes the other files (alongside the translation logic we’ll see in a moment):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/total/journal-net.beancount

</span></span><span><span>include "../wife/src/journal.beancount"
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>; ... Translation Logic follows
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="implementation-the-directory-structure">Implementation: The Directory Structure</h4><p>This architecture is reflected directly in the repository structure:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>chapter-6/

</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="the-rules-of-engagement">The Rules of Engagement</h4><p>For this to work without constant manual adjustment, we follow two simple rules:</p><p><strong>Rule 1: Assets and Liabilities are Private.</strong>
Bank accounts always include the person’s name in the path (e.g., <code>Assets:Lalit:HSBC</code> or <code>Assets:Wife:HSBC</code>). We never use a generic <code>Assets:Checking</code> account. Legal ownership of the cash always matters.</p><p><strong>Rule 2: Expenses are Public.</strong>
Shared expenses like groceries or electricity use a generic name without a person prefix.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/common/src/accounts.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Expenses:Groceries                   GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I buy groceries, I record it in my ledger using the shared account. We don’t track “who owes what” for individual grocery runs; we just track that the household spent the money. We accept that we lose the ability to split shared expenses by person, but the gain in simplicity is worth it.</p><h4 id="the-magic-solving-the-transfer-paradox">The “Magic”: Solving the Transfer Paradox</h4><p>Finally, we use the <code>rename_accounts</code> plugin in the <code>total/</code> folder to resolve the transfer paradox.</p><p>In my ledger, a transfer looks like a simple expense:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/lalit/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-20 * "Transfer to Wife"
</span></span><span><span>  Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife       500.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In her ledger, it looks like income:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/wife/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-20 * "Transfer from Lalit"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Wife:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP     500.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The “Translation Logic” in the combined view renames these into a shared transit account:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/total/journal-net.beancount
</span></span><span><span>plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
</span></span><span><span>  'Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
</span></span><span><span>  'Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
</span></span><span><span>}"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, when Fava loads the combined view, it sees £500 leave my account and enter <code>Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal</code>, and then £500 leave that same account and enter her bank account. The transit account nets to zero, and our household net worth remains unchanged.</p><h4 id="the-result">The Result</h4><p>This setup gives us the best of both worlds. I can maintain my own financial autonomy and see my personal “runway,” while we can simultaneously monitor our combined progress toward shared goals.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/12-household-balance-sheet.png" alt="Combined Household Balance Sheet" title="Two people, one number"></p><p><em>The final result: a unified household view that tracks legal ownership without sacrificing the "One Number" net worth total.</em></p><p>That’s the full system (see <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/tree/main/chapter-6">chapter-6</a> for the complete multi-person structure). But how do I actually use it week to week?</p><h2 id="the-weekly-ritual">The weekly ritual</h2><p>Now here’s how I keep it current: the “20 minutes a week” I mentioned at the start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Getting statements</strong>: During the week, banks email me saying a statement is available. Some attach PDFs directly; others require a login. Either way, I snooze the emails (I use inbox zero) until the weekend. For my wife’s accounts, I nudge her once a month and she drops stuff in a shared Drive folder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running imports</strong>: On the weekend, I work through my snoozed emails. Note that I’m not updating every single account every week. I only download statements for the 3-4 accounts that saw activity; long-term investments often just get a monthly or quarterly check-in. I move each file to the correct <code>data/</code> subfolder for that institution (e.g., <code>data/hsbc-uk-current/</code>). My importer pipeline automatically runs <code>pdftotext</code> to extract text so the parsers can read it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Categorizing</strong>: I launch beancount-import, which opens a web UI in my browser:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>python -m beancount_import.webserver --journal lalit/journal-net.beancount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As I mentioned before, most transactions auto-categorize and I’m just hitting Enter: I buy groceries from the same place, pay my hosting costs to the same provider etc. New merchants do need some manual work, but it’s a matter of typing a few characters and again pressing Enter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formatting and checking</strong>: I run <code>bean-format</code> (a Beancount utility that normalizes indentation and aligns amounts) to keep my transactions file tidy. This makes git diffs cleaner. Then I open Fava for a quick sanity check:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>fava lalit/journal-net.beancount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Are transfer accounts zeroed out? Do expenses look legit? How are investments doing? If it all checks out, commit and push.</p></li></ul><p>That’s it. I try to stick to doing this <em>every week</em>, but sometimes I’m on holiday or just have other commitments. In that case, it’s 40 minutes every two weeks. The system is forgiving; I’m never behind for too long.</p><p>I also have some automation helping me out: during the week, I have a CI workflow that runs daily, regenerates summaries, and commits them. Whenever I want, I can check the repo and see what the numbers look like. I particularly like this because I can easily see the before/after numbers in a single file, so I can spot check “does this make sense”. And of course at any time, I can also open Fava if I want to go a bit deeper.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That 2021 tax disaster feels like a lifetime ago. What started as “there must be a better way” became a system I actually trust. One number, always current, completely under my control.</p><p>The specifics will evolve as life changes and tools improve, but three principles have held for years now. I expect them to hold for decades:</p><p><strong>Double-entry everywhere.</strong> Every transaction balances. Money never appears from nowhere or vanishes into nothing. When something doesn’t add up, you know immediately.</p><p><strong>Plain text as the source of truth.</strong> Your financial history lives in files you can read, diff, grep, and version control. No vendor lock-in, no opaque databases, no trusting a third party with your data.</p><p><strong>Track at the leaf.</strong> Record transactions at the most granular level that makes sense. You can always aggregate up (<code>Income:Dividends</code> from <code>Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends</code>), but you can never disaggregate down. Capture the detail; collapse it later with views.</p><p>Finance systems are deeply personal. This post isn’t meant to say this is <em>the</em> system everyone should use, just what’s worked for me over several years.</p><p>Each chapter here could be its own post, so if you want me to go deeper on imports, investments, or the multi-person setup, let me know!</p></section><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, you can <a href="https://lalitm.com/page/about/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to my weekly roundup of recent posts, or follow via <a href="https://lalitm.com/index.xml">RSS</a>.</em></p></div>]]></description>

<p><span>BACKGROUND</span></p><p>Danish women vaccinated with the 4-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV types: 6/11/16/18) at age 14 in 2008 reached screening age in 2017, allowing assessment of long-term effects on prevalence, persistence and incidence of HPV infections.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>AIM</span></p><p>To examine the HPV status of cervical samples over time among women vaccinated as girls.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>METHODS</span></p><p>Between February 2017 and February 2024, residual material from cytology-analysed samples collected through the ‘Trial23’ study, part of the national screening programme, was tested for HPV16/18 and non-vaccine high-risk (HR) HPV types. Prevalence in first, second and third samples, and persistence and incidence between samples were calculated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>RESULTS</span></p><p>Over 7 years, 8,659 women provided at least one sample, 5,835 at least two and 2,461 at least three. In 7,800 vaccinated women, HPV16/18 prevalence was 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2–0.5), 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1–0.4) and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0–0.4) in three consecutive samples. Prevalence of non-vaccine HR HPV was 32% (95% CI: 31–33), 28% (95% CI: 27–29) and 31% (95% CI: 29–33). Persistence of HPV16/18 and non-vaccine HPV among vaccinated women was 40% and 53%. In adjusted analyses comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated women, incidence was significantly lower for HPV16/18 (adjusted relative risk (aRR) &lt; 0.10) while incidence of non-vaccine HR HPV types was higher (aRR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.12–2.45). No significant difference was observed for persistence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>CONCLUSION</span></p><p>Our study provides real-world evidence of stable protection against HPV16/18 infections in women vaccinated as girls. Less intensive screening seems reasonable until women vaccinated with the 9-valent vaccine reach screening age, when screening should be reconsidered.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://carette.xyz/posts/going_immutable_macos/">https://carette.xyz/posts/going_immutable_macos/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46462719">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>With no surprise the end of one year marks the start of the next.<br>
And the beginning of a year is always synonymous with… a fresh macOS system!</p>
<p>But managing a good working environment on macOS has long been a game of “hope for the best.” We’ve all been there: a <code>curl | sh</code> here, a manual <code>brew install</code> there, and six months later, you’re staring at a broken <code>PATH</code> and a Python environment that seems to have developed its own consciousness.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time recently moving my entire workflow into a declarative system using nix. From my zsh setup to my odin toolchain, here is why the transition from the imperative world of <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to the immutable world of <a href="https://nix-darwin.org/">nix-darwin</a> has been both a revelation and a fight.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-to-solve-imperative-rot">
  The problem to solve: imperative rot
  <a href="#the-problem-to-solve-imperative-rot">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Homebrew is great.<br>
From the Linux world, it was the perfect missing package manager for macOS at first, promoted by a lot of developers, and it (mostly) works.
But Homebrew has a problem: it is imperative.</p>
<p>When you run <code>brew install</code> <strong>you are changing the state of your machine</strong> in a way that is difficult to reverse or replicate exactly.<br>
As an example, if I set up a new Mac today, <code>brew install neovim</code> might give me version 0.10. However, if I do it six months from now, the version might changed and I had to reconfigure some components because of that change. The consequence is me, spending a few hours debugging my environment instead of writing code.</p>
<p>A solution to that is postfix every brew package by its version, but this is not possible for every package.</p>
<p>Another solution is system immutability and the Nix store.</p>
<h2 id="system-immutablility-and-the-nix-store">
  System immutablility, and the Nix store
  <a href="#system-immutablility-and-the-nix-store">#</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> approaches the problem from a functional programming perspective.<br>
Your system is not a collection of side effects, but a <strong>pure function</strong> of your configuration.</p>
<p>This allows different strong points like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>reproducibility</strong>: Every package lives in <code>/nix/store</code> with a unique hash. This means I can have three different versions of the Odin compiler side-by-side, and they will never see each other, or even mess up with the different versions.</li>
<li><strong>rollbacks</strong>: If a system update breaks my shell, I don’t panic. I just boot into a previous generation. The previous state of my system is still sitting in the store, untouched.</li>
<li><strong>flakes</strong>: Using <code>flake.lock</code>, I pin my setup to specific git commits. If it works on my laptop then <strong>it will work</strong> on yours. Period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rollbacks on macOS exist, and are great to go back to a previous version “that works”.<br>
As an example, to list all my previous generations, I can do:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>&gt; sudo nix-env --list-generations -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
</span></span><span><span>   1   2025-12-28 01:21:38
</span></span><span><span>   2   2025-12-28 01:33:47
</span></span><span><span>   3   2025-12-28 09:34:27
</span></span><span><span>   4   2025-12-28 09:43:15
</span></span><span><span>   5   2025-12-28 11:00:49
</span></span><span><span>   6   2025-12-28 11:10:12
</span></span><span><span>   7   2025-12-28 11:19:03
</span></span><span><span>   ...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Each generation is also stored in a read-only specific volume on your system, which prevents accidental mutability of your packages.</p>
<p>On macOS <code>nix-darwin</code> allows me to modify everything, from Finder settings to the Dock, or the Trackpad.</p>
<p>As an example, this is a part of my setup:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="nix"><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>configuration = { pkgs, ... }: {
</span></span><span><span>    <span># Firewall settings</span>

</span></span><span><span>        enable = <span>true</span>;

</span></span><span><span>        allowSigned = <span>true</span>;
</span></span><span><span>        allowSignedApp = <span>true</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    };
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    system.defaults = {
</span></span><span><span>        CustomUserPreferences = {
</span></span><span><span>          <span># Disable siri</span>
</span></span><span><span>          <span>"com.apple.Siri"</span> = {

</span></span><span><span>            <span>"siriEnabled"</span> = 0;
</span></span><span><span>          };
</span></span><span><span>          <span># Disable personalized ads </span>
</span></span><span><span>          <span>"com.apple.AdLib"</span> = {
</span></span><span><span>            allowApplePersonalizedAdvertising = <span>false</span>;
</span></span><span><span>          };
</span></span><span><span>        };
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span># Show battery percentage in the menu bar</span>
</span></span><span><span>        controlcenter.BatteryShowPercentage = <span>true</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span># Allow touch to click</span>
</span></span><span><span>        trackpad.Clicking = <span>true</span>;

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        ...
</span></span><span><span>    };
</span></span><span><span>}

<h3 id="the-nix-flake">
  The Nix flake
  <a href="#the-nix-flake">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Before diving into the pros and cons of Nix, we need to address the engine under the hood: <strong>The Nix Flake</strong>.</p>
<p>In the traditional Nix world, things were a bit loose.<br>
You had “channels”, but “channels” that could change behind your back… and we don’t want to get back to mutable systems.<br>
Nix flakes fixed this by introducing a strictly defined structure.</p>
<p>Every Flake has a <code>flake.nix</code> (the blueprint) and a <code>flake.lock</code> (the time capsule).</p>
<p>The lockfile is actually the secret sauce.<br>
It records the exact git commit of every dependency. When I build my system, I’m not just asking for “the latest version of the Odin programming language”, but for the exact version of Odin that existed at a specific moment in history.</p>
<p>So, when you run <code>darwin-rebuild switch --flake .</code> to update your system (depending on configuration changes), Nix will look first at the lockfile.
If the lockfile says you are using <code>nixpkgs</code> from October 12th at 10:45 PM, that is exactly what it fetches.
Nix doesn’t matter if you are on a new MacBook or an old iMac. If the lockfile is the same, then the resulting environment will be identical to your previous setup.</p>
<p>This turns system administration into a pure function: <strong>the same inputs always produce the same result</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-get-and-forget-workflow">
  The “get and forget” workflow
  <a href="#the-get-and-forget-workflow">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most liberating features is the “ephemeral shell” provided by Nix.<br>
Imagine you need to test a script against <code>Python 3.15</code>, but you don’t want to install a pre-release version globally and risk breaking your system tools…</p>
<p>With Nix, you run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>nix shell nixpkgs#python314
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Suddenly, <code>python --version</code> returns 3.14.
You run your tests, you exit the shell, <strong>and it’s gone</strong>.</p>
<p>No leftovers, no site-packages conflicts, no trace.
It is the ultimate “get and forget” utility, without messing up your system.</p>
<p>However be careful as <strong>“ephemeral” does not mean “sandboxed” or “isolated”</strong> in this context!
A common misconception is that <code>nix shell</code> is like a Docker container or a VM, but it is not as <code>nix shell</code> only isolated the environment variables, and is still running directly on the darwin kernel.</p>
<h2 id="the-learning-curve-cliff">
  The learning <del>curve</del> cliff
  <a href="#the-learning-curve-cliff">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Is this configuration exempt from defaults? Absolutely not.<br>
In fact, its biggest “default” is one of the most significant pain points in modern software: it arrives wrapped in complicated concepts and dense foundations.</p>
<p>The learning curve for Nix is actually not a curve, but a vertical cliff face.</p>
<p>Unlike Homebrew, where you just type a command and forget it, Nix requires you to learn a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language.html">domain-specific language called… <code>Nix</code> (I know, it is confusing)</a>. You have to understand how symbolic links work on macOS, how the Nix daemon interacts with Apple’s read-only system volume, and why your applications don’t magically appear in Spotlight.</p>
<p>For instance, getting GUI apps to show up in the Applications folder requires “trampoline” binaries or custom activation scripts using <code>mkalias</code>.<br>
After a few minutes debugging and scrolling forums it works great, but many users will simply stop there and walking away with the mistaken impression that <code>nix-darwin</code> is an immature project, rather than a deeply powerful one.</p>
<p>The documentation is great, but maybe not well arranged.<br>
As an example, this is the manual to write your own <code>flake.nix</code>: <a href="https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/">https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/</a>.
You can be lost very easily in the manual if you do not know what you are looking for…</p>
<h2 id="the-hybrid-reality">
  The hybrid reality
  <a href="#the-hybrid-reality">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Despite my love for Nix, it isn’t perfect for everything.
macOS GUI applications like Thunderbird, Firefox, or CrossOver, often fight against the read-only nature of the Nix store.<br>
Those software <strong>expect</strong> to self-update and live in <code>/Applications</code> on your system.</p>
<p>I found the sane path to be an hybrid approach: I use <code>nix-darwin</code> to manage my critical state (compilers, LSPs, shell aliases), and use the homebrew module inside my Nix config to handle the big GUI pieces. It looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="Nix"><span><span>// file: brew.nix
</span></span><span><span>homebrew = {
</span></span><span><span>  enable = <span>true</span>;
</span></span><span><span>  casks = [ 
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"firefox"</span> 
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"thunderbird"</span> 
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"crossover"</span> 
</span></span><span><span>  ];
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That’s it!
And using this, I am sure Nix will use <code>brew</code> to install those software on my system, as I did manually with my <code>brew install</code> scripts.</p>
<p>This gives me the best of both worlds: Homebrew handles the macOS-specific integration, but Nix still “records” that they should exist in my declarative blueprint.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start">
  How to start
  <a href="#how-to-start">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you want to move away from “hope-based” configuration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>install the <a href="https://docs.determinate.systems/">Determinate Nix Installer</a>: it handles the messy macOS multi-user setup for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>initialize a Flake and <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/"><code>home-manager</code></a>: Create a <code>flake.nix</code> and a <code>home.nix</code> for your home-manager instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>think <strong>“modularity”</strong>, like keeping your system settings in <code>system.nix</code>, your dev tools in <code>dev.nix</code>, and your GUI apps in <code>brew.nix</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>version <strong>everything</strong> and commit your <code>flake.lock</code>! It is the source of truth for your system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are curious I’ve documented my current setup, including my security hardening (firewall, stealth mode, etc.) here: <a href="https://github.com/k0pernicus/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nix-darwin-config">k0pernicus/dotfiles/nix-darwin-config</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this configuration is personal, and might not be interesting (and certainly not useful) for everyone.</p>
<p>A few links that helped me to make a first setup version for my mac:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nixcademy.com/posts/nix-on-macos/">https://nixcademy.com/posts/nix-on-macos/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dreamsofcode.io/blog/nix-darwin-my-favorite-package-manager-for-macos">https://dreamsofcode.io/blog/nix-darwin-my-favorite-package-manager-for-macos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/torgeir/nix-darwin">https://github.com/torgeir/nix-darwin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s more work upfront, certainly.
But there is a profound peace of mind in knowing that your system is defined by code, not by a history of forgotten terminal commands.</p>

		<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
		<p>Around the world, people celebrate Public Domain Day on January 1, the day in which copyright expires on some older works and they enter the public domain in many different countries.</p>
		<p>In the U.S. Constitution, copyright terms were meant to be very limited in order to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” The first copyright act, written in 1790 by the founding fathers themselves, set the term to be up to twenty-eight years.</p>
		<p>But since then, powerful corporations have repeatedly extended the length of copyright to promote not the progress of society, but their profit. The result is that today in the U.S., work only enters the public domain ninety-five years after publication—locking our culture away for <em>nearly a century</em>.</p>
		<p>2019 was the year in which new works were finally scheduled to enter the public domain, ending this long, corporate-dictated cultural winter. And as that year drew closer, it became clear that these corporations <em>wouldn’t</em> try to extend copyright yet again—making it the first year in almost a hundred years in which a significant amount of art and literature once again entered the U.S. public domain, free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, share, remix, build upon, and enjoy.</p>
		<p>Ever since then, January 1 has been celebrated as Public Domain Day, the day in which the next year’s crop of books, movies, music, and artwork graduates into the public domain. At Standard Ebooks, we’ve prepared some of the year’s biggest literary hits for you to read this January 1.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>On January 1, 2026, books published in 1930 enter the U.S. public domain.</strong></p>
		<p>This includes legendary books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/franz-kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/langston-hughes">Langston Hughes</a>. In addition, <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/the-maltese-falcon">The Maltese Falcon</a></i>, perhaps the best-known noir book—and film—of all time, and books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/evelyn-waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-l-sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>, and more, enter the U.S. public domain, becoming free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, and re-use.</p>
		<p>Our friends at the Public Domain Review have written about some <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/">other things that enter the public domain this year, too</a>.</p>
		<p>These past few months at Standard Ebooks, our volunteers have been working hard to prepare a selection of the books published in 1930 in advance of Public Domain Day. We’re excited to finally be able to share these <strong>20 new free ebooks</strong> with you!</p>

														<p><i>Years of Grace</i> follows the life of Jane Ward, a rather unsophisticated young girl who comes of age in 1890s Chicago. Her family is upper middle class, and Jane finds her traditional, homebody nature being pulled by the various forces of ambition, culture, and progress that swirl around her during the effervescent decades at the turn of the century. We see her into late middle age, where the world has been ripped apart by war, and with change accelerating faster and faster as another war looms on the horizon.</p>							<p>

														<p>Miss Mole is a middle-age housekeeper who has recently left the employ of a wealthy matron to work for the young family of a minister. The mother has recently passed, leaving the family struggling to manage the household—but luckily for them, Miss Mole is exactly the kind of capable, witty, and assertive leader they need.</p><p>As they work on ordering the household, a shadowy figure from Miss Mole’s past weaves in and out of the narrative. But whatever happened in Miss Mole’s history can’t seem to put a damper on her bright, clever, and funny outlook.</p>							<p>

							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/stella-benson">Stella Benson</a></p>
															
														<p><i>The Faraway Bride</i> concerns the Malinin family, shopowners in 1920s Manchuria who are struck by misfortune when their store is raided by Red Army thugs. Their father recalls that a friend owes him a debt of money that could save the family’s finances—but the friend lives in Seoul, which lies at a grueling three week’s walk across the Korean mountains. The difficulty of the journey doesn’t faze the two Malinin children, who excitedly embark on a quest to save the family.</p><p>The novel is based on the story of Tobit from the Apocrypha, but its setting, and the resulting mish-mash of languages and cultures, make for a decidedly unique read.</p>							<p>

														<p>How will humankind, and the world, end? <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/geoffrey-dennis">Geoffrey Dennis</a> aims to answer that question in this singular work of semi-fiction. He explores how prophecies and predictions can twist the fate of humankind, and how the progress of science and technology can simultaneously lift humans up, while making them susceptible to control by societal and political interests. Dennis’s conclusions blend religion, science, and history to create a unique book that straddles the line between fact and fiction.</p>							<p>

														<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-ransome">Arthur Ransome</a>, a journalist in Manchester, was inspired to write this children’s story of gentle adventure while spending a summer teaching a friend’s children to sail in the Lake District.</p><p>In it, the children of two families on rural vacations meet in the wilderness; one side sails the dinghy named the <i>Swallow</i>, and the other the dinghy <i>Amazon</i>. They soon join forces against the dastardly “Captain Flint,” who in reality is just a cranky old man trying to quietly write his memoirs in his houseboat. Their adventures are a charming tale that, by staying firmly grounded in reality, completely eschews the tropes typical of today’s children’s books.</p>							<p>

														<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-s-eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> wrote “Ash Wednesday” during his conversion to Anglicanism. It explores themes of searching for the divine. His previous poetry, like “<a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-s-eliot/poetry/text/poetry#the-waste-land">The Waste Land</a>,” suggests that meaning could only be found in high art; in this poem, the speaker, weary of the search for meaning in the secular world, turns to God. Like most of Eliot’s poetry, “Ash Wednesday” is in a modernist style dense with allusion.</p>							<p>

This year, four of her short stories enter the U.S. public domain: “The Lover,” “The Supreme Artist,” “Frustration,” and “Indiscretion.” In her time, Du Maurier was often categorized as a romantic novelist, a label that frustrated her to no end, because her stories have more in common with the works of writers like <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins">Wilkie Collins</a> in that they explore dark and sinister themes, often tinged with a paranormal flavor.

														<p><i>Cimarron</i> was the best-selling novel of 1930. Set in the lands of Oklahoma during the land rushes of 1889 and 1893, it follows a young family trying to make a life for themselves in a land beset by scrabbling settlers and outraged natives. The family’s trajectory rises as the charismatic patriarch founds a newspaper and settles local disputes, while the matriarch transforms from a faint-hearted Southern belle into a hard-eyed frontierswoman and politician.</p><p>Though later seen as a paean to feminism, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edna-ferber">Ferber</a> originally intended the story to be a satire of American womanhood. Its popularity led it to being published as an Armed Services Edition and sent to soldiers on the front—the same fortuitous fate that graced <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/the-great-gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i>—cementing its fame in the minds of a generation.</p>							<p>

														<p><i>Giant’s Bread</i> is the first novel <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie">Agatha Christie</a> wrote under a pen name, because it differed so much from her usual mystery fare that she wanted it to stand up to public scrutiny under its own merits and not on her reputation. And stand up it did, as reviewers received it with glowing praise.</p><p>The book follows Vernon Deyre, a young Englishman and brilliant musician, from infancy to adulthood before and during the Great War. It explores themes of love, sacrifice, art, and ultimately, redemption.</p>							<p>

<p>For this purpose, I bought a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ccA4a5gRbU&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lenovo ThinkCentre M720s SFF</a> – it’s quiet, compact, and offers the possibility to install 2 SATA III SSDs plus a separate M.2 slot for an NVMe SSD.</p>
<p>What is planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>on NVMe SSD: UFS and FreeBSD</li>
<li>on SATA SSDs: ZFS with RAID1</li>
</ul>
<p>While waiting for the drives to arrive, let’s test how it all works on a virtual machine.</p>
<p>We will be installing FreeBSD 14.3, although <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/15.0R/relnotes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">version 15 is already out</a>, but it has some interesting changes that I’ll play with separately.</p>
<p>Of course, I could have gone with <a href="https://www.truenas.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TrueNAS</a>, which is based on FreeBSD – but I want “vanilla” FreeBSD to do everything manually.</p>

<p>We will perform the installation over SSH using <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?bsdinstall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>bsdinstall</code></a> – boot the system in LiveCD mode, enable SSH, and then proceed with the installation from a workstation laptop.</p>
<p>The virtual machine has three disks – mirroring the future ThinkCentre setup:</p>

<h2><span id="Configuring_SSH_on_FreeBSD_LiveCD"></span><span>Configuring SSH on FreeBSD LiveCD</span><span></span></h2>
<p>For SSH, we need to set a <code>root</code> password and make changes to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, but currently, this doesn’t work because the system is mounted as read-only:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120139.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" title="FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 - configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)" src="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120139.png" alt="" width="716" height="111" srcset="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120139.png 716w, https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120139-300x47.png 300w, https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120139-660x102.png 660w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px"></a></p>
<p>Check the current partitions:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120624.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" title="FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 - configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)" src="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120624.png" alt="" width="716" height="100" srcset="https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120624.png 716w, https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120624-300x42.png 300w, https://rtfm.co.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_120624-660x92.png 660w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px"></a></p>
<p>And apply a “dirty hack”:</p>
<ul>
<li>mount a new <code>tmpfs</code> file system in RAM at <code>/mnt</code></li>
<li>copy the contents of <code>/etc</code> from the LiveCD there</li>
<li>mount <code>tmpfs</code> over <code>/etc</code> (overlaying the read-only directory from the ISO)</li>
<li>copy the prepared files from <code>/mnt</code> back into the new <code>/etc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Execute:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false"># mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt
# cp -a /etc/* /mnt/
# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /etc
# cp -a /mnt/* /etc/</pre>
<p>The <code>mount</code> syntax for <code>tmpfs</code> is <code>mount -t &lt;fstype&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt;</code>. Since the <code>source</code> value is required, we specify <code>tmpfs</code> again.</p>
<p>Now, set the password with <code>passwd</code> and start <code>sshd</code> using <code>onestart</code>:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false"># passwd
# service sshd onestart</pre>
<p>However, SSH will still deny access because <code>root</code> login is disabled by default:</p>

<p>System Hardening – considering this will be a home NAS, but I might open external access (even behind a firewall), it makes sense to tune the security a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>read_msgbuf</code>: allow <code>dmesg</code> access for root only</li>
<li><code>proc_debug</code>: allow <code>ptrace</code> for root only</li>
<li><code>random_pid</code>: randomize PID numbers</li>
<li><code>clear_tmp</code>: clear <code>/tmp</code> on reboot</li>
<li><code>secure_console</code>: require <code>root</code> password for login from the physical console</li>

<p>Disks <code>ada1</code> and <code>ada2</code> will be used for ZFS and its mirror (RAID1).</p>
<p>If there was anything on them – wipe it:</p>

<p>Since this is a VM and the disks are empty, “Invalid argument” is expected and fine.</p>
<p>Create GPT partition tables on <code>ada1</code> and <code>ada2</code>:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # gpart create -s gpt ada1

<h2><span id="Creating_a_ZFS_mirror_with_zpool"></span><span>Creating a ZFS mirror with <code>zpool</code></span><span></span></h2>
<p>The “magic” of ZFS is that everything works “out of the box” – you don’t need a separate LVM and its groups, and you don’t need <code>mdadm</code> for RAID.</p>
<p>For managing disks in ZFS, the main utility is <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?zpool" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>zpool</code></a>, and for managing data (datasets, file systems, snapshots), it’s <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zfs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>zfs</code></a>.</p>
<p>To combine one or more disks into a single logical storage, ZFS uses a <em>pool</em> – the equivalent of a volume group in Linux LVM.</p>
<p>Create the pool:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # zpool create tank mirror ada1p1 ada2p1</pre>
<p>Here, <em>tank</em> is the pool name, <code>mirror</code> specifies that it will be RAID1, and we provide the list of partitions included in this pool.</p>
<p>Check:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # zpool status
  pool: tank
 state: ONLINE
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        tank        ONLINE       0     0     0

            ada1p1  ONLINE       0     0     0
            ada2p1  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors</pre>
<p>ZFS immediately mounts this pool at <code>/tank</code>:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # mount
/dev/ada0p3 on / (ufs, local, soft-updates, journaled soft-updates)
devfs on /dev (devfs)
tank on /tank (zfs, local, nfsv4acls)</pre>
<p>Check partitions now:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # gpart show
=&gt;      40  33554352  ada0  GPT  (16G)
        40      1024     1  freebsd-boot  (512K)
      1064   4194304     2  freebsd-swap  (2.0G)
   4195368  29359024     3  freebsd-ufs  (14G)

        40  33554352     1  freebsd-zfs  (16G)</pre>
<p>If we want to change the mountpoint – execute <code>zfs set mountpoint</code>:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # zfs set mountpoint=/data tank</pre>
<p>And it immediately mounts to the new directory:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # mount
/dev/ada0p3 on / (ufs, local, soft-updates, journaled soft-updates)
devfs on /dev (devfs)
tank on /data (zfs, local, nfsv4acls)
</pre>
<p>Enable data compression – useful for a NAS, see <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-compression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Compression</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/solaris/oracle-solaris/11.4/manage-zfs/compressing-zfs-file-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Compressing ZFS File Systems</a>.</p>
<p><code>lz4</code> is the current default option, let’s enable it:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # zfs set compression=lz4 tank</pre>
<p>Since we installed the system on UFS, we need to add a few parameters to autostart for ZFS to work.</p>
<p>Configure the boot loader in <code>/boot/loader.conf</code> to load kernel modules:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">zfs_load="YES"</pre>
<p>Or, to avoid manual editing, use <code>sysrc</code> with the <code>-f</code> flag:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # sysrc -f /boot/loader.conf zfs_load="YES"</pre>
<p>And add to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to start the <code>zfsd</code> daemon and mount the file systems:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # sysrc zfs_enable="YES"
zfs_enable: NO -&gt; YES
</pre>
<p>Reboot and check:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="beyond" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">root@test-nas-1:/home/setevoy # zpool status
  pool: tank
 state: ONLINE
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        tank        ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            ada1p1  ONLINE       0     0     0
            ada2p1  ONLINE       0     0     0
</pre>
<p>Everything is in place.</p>
<p>Now you can proceed with further tuning – configuring separate <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-create" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">datasets</a>, <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-snapshot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">snapshots</a>, etc.</p>

      I’m posting this from a library Wi-Fi on a burner laptop because I am technically under a massive NDA. I don’t care anymore. I put in my two weeks yesterday and honestly, I hope they sue me. I’ve been sitting on this for about eight months, just watching the code getting pushed to production, and I can’t sleep at night knowing I helped build this machine.
    </p><p>
      You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories. I’m a backend engineer. I sit in the weekly sprint planning meetings where Product Managers (PMs) discuss how to squeeze another 0.4% margin out of "human assets" (that’s literally what they call drivers in the database schemas). They talk about these people like they are resource nodes in a video game, not fathers and mothers trying to pay rent.
    </p><p>
      First off, the "Priority Delivery" is a total scam. It was pitched to us as a "psychological value add." Like I said in the title, when you pay that extra $2.99, it changes a boolean flag in the order JSON, but the dispatch logic literally ignores it. It does nothing to speed you up.
    </p><p>
      We actually ran an A/B test last year where we didn't speed up the priority orders, we just purposefully delayed non-priority orders by 5 to 10 minutes to make the Priority ones "feel" faster by comparison. Management loved the results. We generated millions in pure profit just by making the standard service worse, not by making the premium service better.
    </p><p>
      But the thing that actually makes me sick—and the main reason I’m quitting—is the "Desperation Score." We have a hidden metric for drivers that tracks how desperate they are for cash based on their acceptance behavior.
    </p><p>
      If a driver usually logs on at 10 PM and accepts every garbage $3 order instantly without hesitation, the algo tags them as "High Desperation." Once they are tagged, the system then deliberately stops showing them high-paying orders. The logic is: "Why pay this guy $15 for a run when we know he’s desperate enough to do it for $6?" We save the good tips for the "casual" drivers to hook them in and gamify their experience, while the full-timers get grinded into dust.
    </p><p>
      Then there is the "Benefit Fee." You’ve probably seen that $1.50 "Regulatory Response Fee" or "Driver Benefits Fee" that appeared on your bill after the recent labor laws passed. The wording is designed to make you feel like you're helping the worker.
    </p><p>
      In reality, that money goes straight to a corporate slush fund used to lobby against driver unions. We have a specific internal cost center for "Policy Defense," and that fee feeds directly into it. You are literally paying for the high-end lawyers that are fighting to keep your delivery guy homeless.
    </p><p>
      And regarding tips, we're essentially doing Tip Theft 2.0. We don't "steal" them legally anymore because we got sued for that. Instead, we use predictive modeling to dynamically lower the base pay.
    </p><p>
      If the algo predicts you are a "high tipper" and you’ll likely drop $10, it offers the driver a measly $2 base pay. If you tip $0, it offers them $8 base pay just to get the food moved. The result is that your generosity isn't rewarding the driver; it’s subsidizing us. You’re paying their wage so we don't have to.

      I'm drunk and I'm angry. Ask me anything before this gets taken down.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m posting this from a library Wi-Fi on a burner laptop because I am technically under a massive NDA. I don’t care anymore. I put in my two weeks yesterday and honestly, I hope they sue me. I’ve been sitting on this for about eight months, just watching the code getting pushed to production, and I can’t sleep at night knowing I helped build this machine.</p>

<p>You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories. I’m a backend engineer. I sit in the weekly sprint planning meetings where Product Managers (PMs) discuss how to squeeze another 0.4% margin out of "human assets" (that’s literally what they call drivers in the database schemas). They talk about these people like they are resource nodes in a video game, not fathers and mothers trying to pay rent.</p>

<p>First off, the "Priority Delivery" is a total scam. It was pitched to us as a "psychological value add." Like I said in the title, when you pay that extra $2.99, it changes a boolean flag in the order JSON, but the dispatch logic literally ignores it. It does nothing to speed you up.</p>

<p>We actually ran an A/B test last year where we didn't speed up the priority orders, we just purposefully delayed non-priority orders by 5 to 10 minutes to make the Priority ones "feel" faster by comparison. Management loved the results. We generated millions in pure profit just by making the standard service worse, not by making the premium service better.</p>
