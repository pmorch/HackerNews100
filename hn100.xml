    </div><p>Ever wonder what happens when you fall into a black hole? Now, thanks to a new, immersive visualization produced on a NASA supercomputer, viewers can plunge into the event horizon, a black hole's point of no return.</p>


										      
																																	<p>"People often ask about this, and simulating these difficult-to-imagine processes helps me connect the mathematics of relativity to actual consequences in the real universe," said Jeremy Schnittman, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who created the visualizations. "So I simulated two different scenarios, one where a camera—a stand-in for a daring astronaut—just misses the event horizon and slingshots back out, and one where it crosses the boundary, sealing its fate."</p>
<p>The visualizations are available in multiple forms. Explainer videos act as sightseeing guides, illuminating the bizarre effects of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Versions rendered as 360-degree videos let viewers look all around during the trip, while others play as flat all-sky maps.</p>
<p>To create the visualizations, Schnittman teamed up with fellow Goddard scientist Brian Powell and used the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation. The project generated about 10 terabytes of data—equivalent to roughly half of the estimated text content in the Library of Congress—and took about 5 days running on just 0.3% of Discover's 129,000 processors. The same feat would take more than a decade on a typical laptop.</p>
<p>The destination is a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/supermassive+black+hole/" rel="tag">supermassive black hole</a> with 4.3 million times the mass of our sun, equivalent to the monster located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.</p>

</figure><p>"If you have the choice, you want to fall into a supermassive black hole," Schnittman explained. "Stellar-mass black holes, which contain up to about 30 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+masses/" rel="tag">solar masses</a>, possess much smaller event horizons and stronger tidal forces, which can rip apart approaching objects before they get to the horizon."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>This occurs because the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+pull/" rel="tag">gravitational pull</a> on the end of an object nearer the black hole is much stronger than that on the other end. Infalling objects stretch out like noodles, a process astrophysicists call spaghettification.</p>
<p>The simulated black hole's event horizon spans about 16 million miles (25 million kilometers), or about 17% of the distance from Earth to the sun. A flat, swirling cloud of hot, glowing gas called an accretion disk surrounds it and serves as a visual reference during the fall. So do glowing structures called photon rings, which form closer to the black hole from light that has orbited it one or more times. A backdrop of the starry sky as seen from Earth completes the scene.</p>
<p>As the camera approaches the black hole, reaching speeds ever closer to that of light itself, the glow from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/accretion+disk/" rel="tag">accretion disk</a> and background stars becomes amplified in much the same way as the sound of an oncoming race car rises in pitch. Their light appears brighter and whiter when looking into the direction of travel.</p>
<p>The movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million kilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way, the black hole's disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly distorted—and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped <a href="https://phys.org/tags/space-time/" rel="tag">space-time</a>.</p>

</figure><p>In real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon, executing almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone observing from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally referred to black holes as "frozen stars."</p>

																																			<p>At the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-time in which it's moving rush toward the black hole's center—a one-dimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.</p>
<p>"Once the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is just 12.8 seconds away," Schnittman said. From there, it's only 79,500 miles (128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In the alternative scenario, the camera orbits close to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/event+horizon/" rel="tag">event horizon</a> but it never crosses over and escapes to safety. If an astronaut flew a spacecraft on this 6-hour round trip while her colleagues on a mothership remained far from the black hole, she'd return 36 minutes younger than her colleagues. That's because time passes more slowly near a strong gravitational source and when moving near the speed of light.</p>
<p>"This situation can be even more extreme," Schnittman noted. "If the black hole were rapidly rotating, like the one shown in the 2014 movie 'Interstellar,' she would return many years younger than her shipmates."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="dataContent">
                                    <p>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — About a year ago, veterinarian Melissa Ezell started noticing subtle changes at the midsized animal clinic in Huntsville, Alabama, where she works.</p>
	
	
<p>She said she and other vets were feeling pressure from management to make a certain amount of money from every appointment. If a pet owner wasn’t going to spend enough, the message from management was to offer more services. She was urged to pack in more patients outside of normal business hours.</p>
<p>“Before, I never felt any pressure to be making a certain amount of money in a day,” Ezell, who started working at the clinic in 2021, told Stateline. “It was just, ‘Fill your schedule, practice good medicine, everything else will come.’”</p>
<p>The clinic is owned by National Veterinary Associates, one of the largest veterinary chains in the nation. In 2020 the company was acquired by JAB Consumer Partners, a global private equity firm based in Luxembourg. By early 2023, Ezell said, she felt a shift in atmosphere at the clinic and a greater focus on increasing profits.</p>
<p>Private equity’s foray into the human health care industry in recent years has <a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/">drawn public outrage and legislative scrutiny</a> as firms have been blamed for increasing prices, slashing services and shuttering hospitals to maximize shareholder profits.</p>
<p>Now, some veterinarians and advocates are sounding the alarm that private equity’s entry into the pet health care industry could lead to similar results.</p>
<p>Some states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, and some consumer advocates want states to review large-scale acquisitions in the industry.</p>
<p>“A large number of these funds are seeing veterinary medicine as a good profit center,” said Dr. Grant Jacobson, an Iowa veterinarian who serves on the board of the Independent Veterinary Practitioners Association. He said he’s seen corporate-owned chains in his region drive up prices for consumers, suppress market competition and skirt state laws that ostensibly prohibit veterinary practices from being owned by non-veterinarians.</p>
<p>Private equity firms such as Shore Capital Partners, KKR, TSG Consumer and JAB Consumer Partners have spent billions over the past few years on veterinary practices, specialty animal hospitals, pet insurance services and pet food companies. Among the companies owned by private equity are PetSmart, PetVet Care Centers, FIGO, Thrive Pet Healthcare and ASPCA Pet Health Insurance.</p>
<p>Private equity firms say those investments are giving clinics and other providers the capital they need to buy better technology, and that they are improving efficiency. And in many cases, corporate chains can offer their employees better workplace benefits, such as health insurance.</p>
<p>In a statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates said its corporate philosophy is “grounded in vets making medical decisions and not a corporate office,” and that its program of shared ownership by veterinarians is “the industry’s largest such program and unique among our peers.”</p>
<p>“Our vision is to build a community of hospitals that pet owners trust, are easy to access, and provide the best possible care,” National Veterinary Associates said in the statement.</p>
<p>JAB Consumer Partners did not respond to Stateline’s request for comment.</p>
    <h4>More pets, more money</h4>

	
<p>Private equity uses pooled investment money from pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies. The firms typically look for a quick return on their investment before selling it within a few years. They have been gobbling up small businesses in myriad industries in recent years — from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/24/nursing-homes-private-equity-fraud-00132001">nursing homes</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-wants-to-wash-your-car-11660968031">car washes</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="lzVYrrJo9E"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/">‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/reports-statistics/us-pet-ownership-statistics">pet ownership soared</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic, private equity followed close behind. The pandemic years of 2020-2022 were “the peak years for private equity acquisitions of veterinary services and practices,” said Michael Fenne, senior coordinator for health care at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group that advocates for communities affected by private equity ownership.</p>
<p>Americans spent a record $147 billion on pet products and services last year. From 2017 to 2022, <a target="_blank" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-deals-veterinary-clinics-pet-care">private equity spent $45 billion</a> on deals in the veterinary sector, according to PitchBook, which tracks investment data.</p>
<p>The vet industry is attractive because it’s mostly made up of small, privately owned businesses that corporations can buy and consolidate into larger chains. And it’s mainly a cash-based business: Unlike in human health care, veterinary customers typically pay out of pocket, rather than rely on third-party payers such as insurance companies.</p>
<p>In some cases, private equity firms and other corporations buy community clinics from the veterinarians who own them for two, five or even 10 times their value. Then the firms roll them up into a larger chain of clinics that can corner a regional market.</p>
<p>It’s a strategy that can push other private owners out of the business, said Jacobson, the Iowa veterinarian. He spent nearly 20 years working at a privately owned practice in Iowa and had hoped to buy it when the original founder retired.</p>
<p>But the founder sold the practice to a large veterinary chain owned by Mars Inc. — the private company best known for owning candy brands that include M&amp;Ms — for more than $1 million above his offer, Jacobson said. Mars, while not a private equity firm, is the biggest consolidator of pet care companies in the United States, owning pet food companies, pet pharmacies and veterinary care clinic chains such as Banfield Pet Hospitals and BluePearl.</p>

	<p>You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick.</p>
		<p><b>– Melissa Ezell, veterinarian</b></p>
	</div>

	
<p>About a quarter of general veterinary practices and about three-quarters of specialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are now owned by large corporations, according to John Volk of Brakke Consulting, a veterinary management consulting firm.</p>
<p>Some private equity-backed chains, such as National Veterinary Associates, buy community-based veterinary practices like Ezell’s without rebranding them under the chain’s name. As a result, clients might not be aware of the ownership change.</p>
<p>“It can appear you’re getting community-oriented care when there’s actually this set of big-box incentives underlying [the clinic] that comes from their private equity owners,” Fenne said.</p>
    <h4>Where vets want to work</h4>

	
<p>Lori Kogan, a clinical sciences professor at Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, surveyed nearly 900 veterinarians in 2022 about their experiences and perceptions of <a target="_blank" href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/261/12/javma.23.06.0326.xml">corporate vs. privately owned veterinary clinics</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="0DBBSnGFD1"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/31/private-equitys-growing-footprint-in-home-health-care-draws-scrutiny/">Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even though most of the veterinarians surveyed reported working for corporate-owned clinics, Kogan found more than half said they would prefer to work in privately owned clinics. The benefits offered by corporate chains, such as health insurance, didn’t seem strong enough to override other preferences, Kogan told Stateline.</p>
<p>“Feeling like they have a voice in decision-making, feeling like they’re recognized as an individual, those are things that are really important to people,” she said. “I think corporate ownership could accomplish those things, but it will take paying attention.”</p>
<p>Ezell, the veterinarian who left National Veterinary Associates, said the pressure has an impact on patients and their humans as well.</p>
<p>“Either you’re getting talked into additional services that may or may not actually be necessary, or your feel like you’re being rushed,” Ezell said. “You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick.”</p>
<p>In its statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates noted that it has made “continued investment in technology and infrastructure, pioneering clinical research, industry-leading continuing education programs and wellbeing initiatives.”</p>
    <h4>Could states step in?</h4>

	
<p>Last August, Thrive Pet Healthcare announced it would be closing the only 24-hour emergency veterinary clinic in the Rochester, New York, metro area. Thrive is a chain of&nbsp;more than 380 veterinary hospitals&nbsp;based in Austin, Texas, that is owned by private equity firm TSG Consumer.</p>
<p>“The thought of having the only 24-hour emergency pet care center in our entire metro area close was really scary,” said Rachel Barnhart, a Democratic member of the Monroe County Legislature in New York who has taken her dogs to the clinic. “We are a community of more than a million people. The idea that we can’t support a 24-hour pet facility is outrageous.”</p>
<p>Barnhart wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, asking it to look into Thrive, which operates more than a dozen clinics in Rochester. She said she’d seen the FTC act against anticompetitive practices in the veterinary industry elsewhere, and she felt Thrive deserved similar scrutiny.</p>
<p>Thrive leadership&nbsp;said in a letter to Barnhart and in media reports that a shortage of ER veterinarians made it impossible to hire enough workers to keep the 24-hour clinic open. But Barnhart suspected the company wanted to shutter the clinic because its staff&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.whec.com/archive/vses-first-veterinary-practice-on-east-coast-to-unionize/">recently voted to unionize.</a> CEO Tad Stahel said in the letter to Barnhart that the closure was unrelated to the staff unionization.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="3HcbVh4fzw"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2022/09/02/should-you-insure-your-pet-without-state-oversight-its-hard-to-say/">Should You Insure Your Pet? Without State Oversight, It’s Hard to Say.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 2022, the FTC took action against JAB Consumer Partners, which recently acquired an array of veterinary and pet service companies. The FTC required the firm to divest some of its vet clinics in California, Colorado, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., as a condition of approving its multibillion-dollar purchases of two other multistate veterinary care chains.</p>
<p>If states were to authorize officials or agencies to review similar large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the veterinary industry, that “would be a good first step” toward protecting consumers, said Fenne, of the advocacy group.</p>
<p>Many states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, including Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina. The idea is to prevent corporate interests from guiding veterinarians’ medical judgment.</p>
<p>Experts and advocates expect to see further corporatization in veterinary care as more companies acquire not just vet clinics, but also other businesses across the pet care spectrum.</p>
<p>In February, asset management behemoth Blackstone Inc. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-completes-acquisition-of-rover/">acquired Rover</a>, the nation’s largest online platform for pet sitting, dog walking and other services. In the past two years, JAB has acquired several of the largest pet insurance companies in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Ezell, the Alabama veterinarian, eventually decided to take a job at another clinic in town that’s privately owned. She will start there in a few weeks.</p>
<p>“Not all corporate medicine is horrible, and you can find amazing veterinarians and caring support staff anywhere,” she told Stateline.</p>
<p>“But it’s easy to lose sight of your values. The whole reason we’re doing this is we want to make a difference in animals’ and people’s lives. If we’re unable to do that, shouldn’t we try to fix that?”</p>

				<p>Boeing’s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1787531120852312388">Starliner</a> launch tonight has been postponed “out of an abundance of caution” scarcely two hours before the historic liftoff. The scrub is reportedly due to an issue with the oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket’s upper stage.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">There are backup launch opportunities on May 7, 10 and 11. After years of delays and over $1 billion in cost overruns, the mission is set to be Boeing’s first attempt to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Once the issue is resolved with the upper stage, the United Launch Alliance Atlas V will carry the CST-100 Starliner capsule to orbit along with the two onboard astronauts — Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams — from Florida’s Cape Canaveral at 10:34 PM local time Monday evening. The mission also marks the first time ULA’s Atlas will carry crew. The rocket boasts a success rate of 100% across 99 missions. (ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.)</p>
<p>The astronauts would now dock at the station at the earliest on Thursday, where they would remain for at least eight days. The two astronauts will return to Earth in the capsule no earlier than May 16.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, Boeing will be able to finally certify its Starliner for human transportation and begin fulfilling the terms of its $4.2 billion NASA astronaut taxi contract. That contract, under the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, was awarded in 2014. Elon Musk’s SpaceX was also granted a contract under that program, for its Crew Dragon capsule, and has been transporting astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020.</p>
<p>While SpaceX has soared in its human transportation services, flying over a dozen crewed missions and also racking up private flights with Axiom Space and billionaire Jared Isaacman, Boeing has fallen sharply behind. The aerospace giant originally attempted an uncrewed mission to the ISS in 2019, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">that failed due to technical issues</a>; further problems delayed the next attempt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/25/starliner-returns-to-earth-after-a-successful-first-trip-to-iss/">until it was finally accomplished in 2022.</a></p>
<p>As of last year, Boeing had rung up $1.5 billion in charges due to the long-delayed Starliner program.</p>
<p>But despite the technical snags, both NASA and Boeing have stressed their commitment to the mission, and to the safety of the two astronauts.</p>
<p>“The lives of our crew members,&nbsp;Suni Williams&nbsp;and&nbsp;Butch Wilmore, are at stake,” NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said in a press conference late last month. “We don’t take that lightly at all.”</p>
<p>Indeed, for NASA a successful mission bring the agency one step closer to having two operational transportation providers, bringing critical redundancy to the Commercial Crew program. Per Boeing’s contract, it is on the line for six astronaut missions.</p>
<p>Musk took to X, the social media platform he also owns, to comment on the mission, noting that “although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner.”</p>

<!-- 🌟 START OF MAIN CONTENT 🌟 -->
<p>Right now, asyncio is one of the trendier topics in Python, and rightfully so – It’s a great way to handle I/O-bound programs! When I was learning about asyncio, It took me a while to understand how it actually worked. But later, I came to find out that it’s basically just a really nice layer on top of Python Generators. In this article, I’m going to create a simplified version of asyncio using just Python generators. Then, I’m going to refactor the example to use the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords with the help of the <code>__await__</code> dunder method before coming full circle and swapping out my version for the real asyncio. By building a simple version of asyncio, hopefully, by the end of this article, you’ll be able to get a better grasp of how it does its magic!</p>

<h2 id="generators-review">Generators Review</h2>

    <p>If you're already familiar with generators skip this part, but if you aren't, it's what asyncio is built off of, so it's very important to understand how they work.</p>
    <p>First of all, the reason why generators are a thing is because they allow you to make your code more memory efficient. Imagine if you had the following loop:</p>

    <pre><code>for i in range(100_000_000):
&nbsp; &nbsp; print(i)</code></pre>

    <p>If <code>range</code> wasn't a generator, but rather was a function that returned a list for you to then loop over, code like the example above would be very memory inefficient since you would be creating a list with 100 million elements… However, because <code>range</code> is a generator, at least in Python 3+, you only generate the numbers as they are needed, one by one, without ever storing the entire sequence in memory.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways to create generators, but we're going to focus on generator functions. These generators are defined like any other function but use the <code>yield</code> statement to return data. This statement turns a regular function into a generator that, instead of executing all at once, can pause and resume its state when calling <code>next(iterator)</code>.</p>
    <p>Take the following generator function, for example:</p>

    <pre><code>def generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'hello'
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'world'

iterator = generator()</code></pre>

    <p>When you call the generator, instead of running the code inside of the function like Python normally would, it sees the <code>yield</code> keyword and, therefore, returns a generator object. Once we have the generator object, we can then call <code>next(iterator)</code>, which will run the function’s code up until the first/next <code>yield</code> statement:</p>

    <pre><code>print(next(iterator)) &nbsp;# Output: hello
print(next(iterator)) &nbsp;# Output: world</code></pre>

    <p>If we try calling <code>next(iterator)</code> again, the generator will raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception because there are no more yield statements in the generator function.</p>
    <p>Another cool feature of Python generators is <code>yield from</code>, which lets a generator call a sub-generator or an iterable object, enabling you to create a chain of generators!</p>

    <pre><code>def generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'hello'

def another_generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield from generator()

iterable = another_generator()
print(next(iterable)) &nbsp;# Output: hello</code></pre>

    <p>There’s a bit more to generators than I’m talking about, such as generator comprehensions, which are like list comprehensions but created with parentheses instead of brackets, and the ability to send data to generators with <code>iterator.send(value)</code>. However, for this article, the important thing to remember about generators is that they allow a function to be started and stopped while maintaining its state!</p>

<h2 id="the-event-loop">The Event Loop</h2>

    <p>The event loop, which is in charge of running and managing all of the current tasks, is the core of asyncio and is the first thing we’ll recreate with generators. While the asyncio event loop is written in C, an easy way to think about it is as a list that holds all of the current tasks. For now, think of these tasks as just generator objects. The event loop manager will loop through each task in the list and use the <code>next(task)</code> function to run each of them. That task will then run, and when it's doing I/O-bound work like sleeping, it’ll use the <code>yield</code> keyword to pause its execution and give control back to this event loop, which will then go on to the next task in the loop.</p>
    <p>Here’s an example of that — we have two tasks that both print their task number and then yield, which stops their execution. Since the event loop manager is the one that calls <code>next()</code>, after the task yields, it gets back control and then goes to run the next task in the loop.</p>

    <pre><code>def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

event_loop = [task1(), task2()]

while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp;for task in event_loop:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;next(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Subsequently, the output of this code is going to look like the following and will go on forever since both of the generator functions never finish due to the <code>while True</code> loops.</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
Task 2
…</code></pre>


<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

    <p>If we take the same code from above, we can add sub-generators to our tasks via the use of <code>yield from</code>. Below, I added a sleeping generator which will pause the execution of the tasks until the specified time is up. This works because <code>sleep</code> will keep yielding until a certain amount of seconds has passed, at which point it will leave the <code>while</code> loop. Since there are no more <code>yield</code> statements in <code>sleep</code>, a <code>StopIteration</code> exception is raised which signals to the <code>yield from</code> in the task functions to continue to the next line of code.</p>

    <pre><code>import time

def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp;start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp;while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield from sleep(1)

def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield from sleep(5)

event_loop = [task1(), task2()]

while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp;for task in event_loop:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;next(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Output:</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
Task 1
Task 1
Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
…</code></pre>


<h2 id="yield-to-await">Yield to Await</h2>

    <p>We can now take the above code, and transition from using <code>yield</code> to <code>await</code> by using the <code>__await__</code> dunder method and the <code>async</code> keyword. When a class has the <code>__await__</code> method, we can use the <code>await</code> keyword in front of an instance of the class to call it. In asyncio, you are generally working with <code>Task</code> objects via a function like <code>asyncio.create_task</code>. These <code>Task</code> objects inherit from the asyncio <code>Future</code> object, which has the <code>__await__</code>  method. We can also use <code>await</code> in front of a coroutine, which is an object created when calling a function with the <code>async</code> keyword in front of it. Coroutines are similar to generator functions in the sense that a coroutine’s execution can also be paused and resumed.</p>
    <p>You can think of the <code>await</code> keyword as just a synonym for <code>yield from</code> with some extra validation rules. So, when writing the code <code>await object</code>, you are basically saying to either yield from the <code>__await__</code> method in the “object” class instance OR “object” could be another coroutine (like a sub-generator).</p>
    <p>You can actually look in the Asyncio <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/asyncio/futures.py" target="_blank">source code</a> and see that the <code>__await__</code> method inside of the <code>Future</code> object basically just calls <code>yield</code> if the future (or task) is not done completing:</p>

    
    <p><img src="https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/blog_posts/recreating-asyncio/static/images/yield-to-await-193740693.png" alt="Asyncio source code. The __await__ method in the Future object"></p><p>To move the code that we wrote in the above section to using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, we first need to make our own <code>Task</code> class since a function can’t have the <code>__await__</code> dunder method. Below is a simple version that I came up with:</p>

    <pre><code>from queue import Queue


event_loop = Queue()

class Task():
&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.iter = generator
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.finished = False

&nbsp; &nbsp; def done(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.finished

&nbsp; &nbsp; def __await__(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while not self.finished:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield self


def create_task(generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = Task(generator)
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)

&nbsp; &nbsp; return task</code></pre>

    <p>This time, instead of using a Python list to create the event loop, we’re using a queue, which makes a bit more sense since we want to be able to add and delete tasks from the loop in constant time.</p>
    <p>For our <code>Task</code> class, we store the generator object in <code>self.iter</code> and also set <code>self.finished</code> to <code>False</code>, which will keep track of if the generator is done running (It’s done running when it raises <code>StopIteration</code>). Our <code>Task</code> object also has an <code>__await__</code> dunder method, which will just keep yielding control back to the event loop until the task is finished. Lastly, after creating the <code>Task</code> object with the <code>create_task</code> helper function, we add it to the event loop, which schedules it to be run.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s build the event loop manager, which will run the tasks:</p>

    <pre><code>def run(main):
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(Task(main))

&nbsp; &nbsp; while not event_loop.empty():
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task = event_loop.get()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.iter.send(None)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except StopIteration:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.finished = True
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)</code></pre>

    <p>You may notice that this is starting to mimic the actual asyncio API since to start the event loop, we need to call <code>run</code> with an initial function. The function first wraps the main function in a <code>Task</code> object and adds it to the event loop. The <code>while</code> loop will then run, and for each cycle, will get the next task to run via the queue. Instead of using <code>next(task.iter)</code>, we now need to use <code>task.iter.send(None)</code>, which is just a weird quirk of working with the async/await keywords, but it does the same thing. We also want to wrap this call in a try-except block since if a <code>StopIteration</code> exception is thrown, we can set <code>task.finished</code> to <code>True</code>, but if no exceptions are raised, the code will go to the <code>else</code> statement which adds the task back to the event loop to be run again.</p>
    <p>Next, we need to make the sleep function async-compliant. Before, we were using a generator function with a while-loop and one <code>yield</code> to handle the sleeping. I like this approach, but you can’t use the <code>await</code> keyword in combination with a generator function - it needs to be an object with the <code>__await__</code> dunder method or a coroutine function. So, to solve this, I moved the code to another function, and now the actual <code>sleep</code> function creates a task object and then awaits it. This <code>await</code> will call the <code>__await__</code> method inside of the Task object, which will then yield, letting the event loop move to another task. When the event loop gets to the new <code>_sleep</code> task, it will check the time, and if not enough has passed, will also call <code>yield</code> to give control back to the event loop. If the task that is sleeping is called via the event loop again, like how a generator stores its state, the coroutine would still be waiting for <code>sleep</code> to return, and since <code>sleep</code> would still be awaiting the <code>_sleep</code> task to finish, the <code>__await__</code> dunder method of the task will be called again and since the task isn't finished, the yield in the dunder method will be called.</p>

    <pre><code>import time

def _sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp; while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield


async def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = create_task(_sleep(seconds))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return await task</code></pre>

    <p>Here’s all of the code put together:</p>

    <pre><code>from queue import Queue
import time


event_loop = Queue()


def _sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp; while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield


async def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = create_task(_sleep(seconds))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return await task


class Task():
&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.iter = generator
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.finished = False

&nbsp; &nbsp; def done(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.finished

&nbsp; &nbsp; def __await__(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while not self.finished:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield self


def create_task(generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = Task(generator)
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)

&nbsp; &nbsp; return task


def run(main):
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(Task(main))

&nbsp; &nbsp; while not event_loop.empty():
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task = event_loop.get()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.iter.send(None)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except StopIteration:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.finished = True
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Now that we’ve built the event loop, a way to create tasks, and a sleep function, we can import the file (called “jacobio.py”) and take the code from back when we were using yields and replace all of the <code>yield from</code> statements with <code>await</code>, add <code>async</code> to the functions with the <code>await</code> keyword to signify that those functions can be awaited, and then create a main function, like you would in asyncio, to add the tasks to the event loop:</p>

    <pre><code>import jacobio

async def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(2):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await jacobio.sleep(1)

async def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(3):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await jacobio.sleep(0)

async def main():
&nbsp; &nbsp; one = jacobio.create_task(task1())
&nbsp; &nbsp; two = jacobio.create_task(task2())

&nbsp; &nbsp; await one
&nbsp; &nbsp; await two
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; print('done')


if __name__ == '__main__':
&nbsp; &nbsp; jacobio.run(main())</code></pre>

    <p>Output:</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 2
Task 2
Task 1
done</code></pre>


<h2 id="await-with-asyncio">Await with AsyncIO</h2>

    <p>We can now take our code from above and replace all occurrences of “jacobio” with “asyncio” and we’re now fully using the asyncio package!</p>

    <pre><code>import asyncio

async def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(2):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(3):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await asyncio.sleep(0)

async def main():
&nbsp; &nbsp; one = asyncio.create_task(task1())
&nbsp; &nbsp; two = asyncio.create_task(task2())

&nbsp; &nbsp; await one
&nbsp; &nbsp; await two
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; print('done')


if __name__ == '__main__':
&nbsp; &nbsp; asyncio.run(main())</code></pre>

    <p>Asyncio does a lot more behind the scenes, but we were able to go from basic generators to recreating the core parts of asyncio from scratch! I tried to make the event loop manager as simple as possible, and while this is the basic idea behind asyncio, given the scale and complexity of the actual package, my implementation is slightly different from the flow of the actual source code. Also, now that we have the full power of the real asyncio package, we don’t need to create two tasks just to await both; instead, we can use a function such as <code>asyncio.gather()</code>to handle multiple tasks.

<p>Proton Mail has come under scrutiny for its role in a legal request involving the Spanish authorities and a member of the Catalan independence organization, Democratic Tsunami.</p>



<p>Proton Mail is a <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure email</a> service based in Switzerland, renowned for its commitment to privacy through end-to-end encryption and a strict no-logs policy. In 2021, Proton Mail <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-logs-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced controversy</a> when it complied with a legal request that led to the arrest of a French climate activist. Under Swiss law, Proton Mail was compelled to collect and provide information on the individual’s IP address to Swiss authorities, who then shared it with French police.</p>



<p>The recent case involving the Spanish police this time, highlights privacy concerns and the limits of encrypted communication services under national security pretexts, and brings a long-debated subject to the forefront once again.</p>



<p>The core of the controversy stems from Proton Mail <a href="https://www.elnacional.cat/en/politics/judge-garcia-castellon-accuse-mossos-police-officer-tsunami_1202609_102.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">providing the Spanish police</a> with the recovery email address associated with the Proton Mail account of an individual using the pseudonym ‘Xuxo Rondinaire.’ This individual is suspected of being a member of the Mossos d’Esquadra (Catalonia’s police force) and of using their internal knowledge to assist the Democratic Tsunami movement. </p>



<p>Upon receiving the recovery email from Proton Mail, Spanish authorities <a href="https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/tsunami-democratic-xuxo-rondinaire-mossos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further requested Apple</a> to provide additional details linked to that email, leading to the identification of the individual.</p>



<p>This case is particularly noteworthy because it involves a series of requests across different jurisdictions and companies, highlighting the complex interplay between technology firms, user privacy, and law enforcement. The requests were made under the guise of anti-terrorism laws, despite the primary activities of the Democratic Tsunami involving protests and roadblocks, which raises questions about the proportionality and justification of such measures.</p>



<p>Like before, Proton Mail’s compliance with these requests is bound by Swiss law, which mandates cooperation with international legal demands that are formalized through proper channels (Swiss court system). </p>



<p>Last year, when we noted that <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-data-requests-user-logs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton Mail complied with nearly 6,000 data requests</a> in 2022, Proton provided us with an explanation that inbox contents remain secure.</p>



<blockquote>

<cite>Proton <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-data-requests-user-logs/">statement to RestorePrivacy last year</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Looking at Proton’s <a href="https://proton.me/legal/transparency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparency report</a>, we find that Proton Mail complied with 5,971 data requests last year alone, up slightly from the year before.</p>

<p>With so many data requests going on in the background, it is all the more important to safeguard the data you share with various services. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-importance-of-good-opsec">The importance of good OPSEC</h3>



<p>This situation serves as a critical reminder of the importance of maintaining stringent OPSEC (operational security). One should always be aware of the potential vulnerabilities that come with linking recovery information or secondary services (like Apple accounts) that may not have the same privacy safeguards as a primary encrypted email service. </p>



<p>For users concerned about privacy, particularly those involved in sensitive or political activities, OPSEC should be a top concern when using <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/privacy-tools/">privacy tools</a>. It’s advisable to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avoid linking recovery emails or phone numbers that can directly tie back to personal identities or primary business activities.</li>



<li>Consider using secondary, <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/temporary-disposable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disposable emails</a> or virtual phone numbers that offer an additional layer of anonymity.</li>



<li>Use a <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good VPN service</a> to hide your IP address whenever possible. (Failure to do this is what <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-logs-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compromised a Proton Mail user in France</a> who was arrested after after police obtained IP logs.)</li>



<li>Consider purchasing services using an <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/private-anonymous-payment-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anonymous payment method</a>.</li>



<li>Stay informed about the legal obligations and policies of communication service providers, especially regarding their compliance with international law enforcement requests.</li>
</ul>



<p>While Proton Mail and similar services offer substantial protections and end-to-end encryption on their email platform, they are not immune to legal and governmental pressures. Users must navigate these waters carefully, balancing the need for security with the potential legal obligations of their service providers.</p>



<p>RestorePrivacy has reached out to Proton Mail for a comment on the case and their exact involvement, but a statement wasn’t immediately available. We will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-89b404859ec5dd2d13df">
  <p>Recently, we identified a novel network technique that bypasses VPN encapsulation. An attacker can use this technique to force a target user’s traffic off their VPN tunnel using built-in features of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). The result of this is the user transmits packets that are never encrypted by a VPN, and an attacker can snoop their traffic. We are using the term <strong>decloaking</strong> to refer to this effect. Importantly, the VPN control channel is maintained so features such as kill switches are never tripped, and users continue to show as connected to a VPN in all the cases we’ve observed. </p><p>We’ve spent extensive time exploring this capability and attempting to notify as many affected parties as possible. We also know it is our responsibility as security researchers to inform the security and privacy community, as well as the general public, about this threat. We also believe this technique may have been possible as far back as 2002 and could have already been discovered<strong>*</strong> and potentially used in the wild. For that reason, we believe it is critical for us to disclose publicly because notifying every VPN provider, operating system maintainer, self-hosted VPN admin, and VPN user is far beyond the capacity of our small research team.</p><p>We've seen one mitigation for this technique, as well as identified a fix that exists on Linux-based operating systems. However, the mitigation offers a side channel that could be used for targeted denial-of-service censorship, as well as to de-anonymize the destination of traffic via traffic analysis. In some places in the world, the side-channel alone could lead to imprisonment or death for those who rely on VPNs for safety such as journalists or whistleblowers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/19/1017774097/private-spyware-was-used-to-hack-cellphones-of-journalists-activists-worldwide" target="_blank">who are common targets of surveillance or spyware.</a> </p><p>It is not feasible to fix the issue by simply removing support for the DHCP feature because this could break Internet connectivity in some legitimate cases. The strongest recommendation we have is for VPN providers to implement network namespaces on operating systems that support them, similar to the method described in <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution" target="_blank">WireGuard’s documentation</a>. Network namespaces are a Linux feature that can segment interfaces and routing tables away from the local network’s control, and other operating system maintainers should consider whether namespaces are feasible to implement.</p><p>To help make this work accessible to as many people as possible, we are structuring this blog post to walk through the fundamentals of networking, VPN technology, and DHCP to fully explain the decloaking behavior. <strong>Advanced readers are welcome to jump straight to the proof-of-concept section.</strong></p><p> <strong>*</strong> After publication we’ve received notice that there are references to this decloaking behavior on <a href="https://mstdn.io/@jomo/98981403329690455" target="_blank">social media</a>. This further showcases the important of informing audiences outside of the technology sector of the existence of our technique.</p><h2>Decloaking Primer: Low-level Networking</h2><h3>What is a network?</h3><p>A computer network is a group of computer devices that are connected to each other and can send and receive data to and from one another. </p><p>A basic example of this is to connect two laptops with an Ethernet cable to network them together. However, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to low-level networking that’s hidden from the average user. The laptops are using a system of rules to talk to each other, which we call <strong>protocols</strong>. Each protocol has its own purpose and operates at what we call a <strong>layer</strong>.</p><p>These layers are intended to solve different types of problems and are built such that they do not need to know what’s happening at a higher or lower layer. This is called <strong>encapsulation</strong>. For example, a user can trust that the layers lower than their browser (HTTP) are determining how to send electricity over a cable (Coax), knows who to talk to (Ethernet, IP), and ensure correct data delivery to the recipient server (TCP). This is like how someone writing a letter needs only to think about what they want to write or what the other person wrote. They do not need to care about how it got there.</p><p>When we’re referring to layers in this blogpost, we are talking about the practical <strong>TCP/IP model</strong>, which is implemented on almost every device and network. We also decided to use the 5-layer variant of the model because it doesn’t combine the lower layers together; this is why there might be a discrepancy when viewing other TCP/IP model diagrams. When we’re referring to data that’s been packaged by all these layers, we generally refer to it as a <strong>packet</strong>.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_31260">
  <h3>What is a network interface?</h3><p>The most basic example of a network interface is a physical device such as a wireless or network card attached to a computer's motherboard. These devices allow the computer to transmit bits of data over a physical medium (e.g., a copper wire, fiber optic cable, or radio frequency). They are a fundamental part of networking as they are what allows computers to talk to each other over a distance.</p><p>There are two types of network interfaces:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Physical Network Interfaces</p></li><li><p>Virtual Network Interfaces</p></li></ul><p>Importantly, both types of interfaces are designed for encapsulation so they can be interacted with by higher layers in the same way. </p><p>This is where Virtual Network Interfaces, a critical component of VPN clients and server, come in. Instead of using physical hardware, Virtual Network Interfaces create a <strong>file</strong> <strong>descriptor</strong> that can be read from or written to via software applications. Because file descriptors exist only in the memory of a host, Virtual Network Interfaces are especially useful for virtualized environments where traffic might never need to be transmitted over a physical medium.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_4403">

<p>However, there are use cases in which a user might want a virtual interface to be able to send traffic over a physical medium. For those cases, the virtual interface can also be backed by a physical network interface. Behind the scenes, the virtual interface forwards outbound traffic to a physical network interface.</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_15603">
  <h3>What is a VPN?</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to create a <strong>tunnel</strong> for network traffic between their host device and a server on a different network. The resulting <strong>virtual network</strong> is not confined by geographic location while behaving identically to a physical network. </p><p>To achieve this, VPN clients create a virtual network interface and use the underlying file descriptor to encrypt/decrypt traffic at a higher layer before sending it to a physical network interface.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_18104">
  <p>VPN use is designed to be as simple as possible for a user. Often, they do not need to do much besides log in and click a button to connect to their server.</p><p>What a user does:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Select the settings they want on the VPN Client</p></li><li><p>Click a button to connect</p></li><li><p>Log in (optional in some cases, depending on the client)</p></li><li><p>Read the confirmation from the VPN they are connected</p></li><li><p>Use remote resources from the VPN</p></li></ol><p>Importantly, VPNs actually <em>increase </em>the host’s attack surface because traffic from lower networking layers is send over the Internet. VPNs work by encapsulating lower layers inside of higher layers to create local area networks (LAN) over the Internet. LAN traffic is considered to be more privileged than traffic that is intended to be sent over the Internet. Attackers with LAN access have many more passive and active attack options than an attacker outside of the LAN. By creating a LAN over the Internet, VPNs extend the LAN attack surface to external attackers. Commonly, VPNs mitigate this attack surface by using compensating controls such as packet encryption.</p><p>This is an often-misunderstood fact about VPNs. The reason for encryption is not to increase the security of using the physical LAN, but rather to mitigate the added risk that VPNs introduce when they create a virtualized LAN over the Internet. <strong><em>VPNs do not secure you from local network attacks on the physical LAN</em> <em>despite common VPN marketing material and widely given advice.</em></strong></p><h3>How do VPNs use virtual network interfaces?</h3><p>The VPN client process creates an encrypted version of the packet it originally received from the file descriptor associated with its virtual network interface. It places this encrypted <strong>payload</strong> in the layer for its underlying VPN protocol, then uses that protocol to talk to the VPN server.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_32168">
  <p>There’s quite a long process for how a VPN sends that packet to the VPN Server. We are including a more exhaustive list of steps in the Appendix for security researchers or developers who might need even more granular details.</p><p>A simplified version of that process:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A VPN client establishes a “control channel” connection to a VPN server. If the VPN features a kill switch, then losing connection to this channel will result in a lockdown</p></li><li><p>The VPN client creates a virtual network interface</p></li><li><p>The VPN client optionally runs a startup script to configure the host. It may configure routing rules, the DNS server to use, host-based firewall rules, or other settings</p></li><li><p>A process on the host attempts to send network traffic to a destination (i.e., Internet browsing)</p></li><li><p>Routing rules select the VPN’s interface to send the traffic through</p></li><li><p>The VPN client receives and encrypts that traffic</p></li><li><p>The VPN client sends the encrypted traffic over a physically backed network interface to the VPN server</p></li><li><p>The VPN server receives and decrypts that traffic from the VPN client</p></li><li><p>The VPN server forwards that traffic to the destination. If the destination is outbound, the VPN will send your traffic as though it is its own. This behavior is what VPN providers describe as “IP cloaking” or “IP hiding”</p></li><li><p>The VPN server receives a reply from the destination, encrypts the response, and sends it to the VPN client</p></li><li><p>The VPN client decrypts the response, and the originating process finally receives the traffic</p></li></ol><p>It can be quite hard to understand fully since there are many steps involved. For that reason, we’ve made our own detailed diagram of a mental model we use for how a VPN client sends and receives information (Figure 4).</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_41563">
  <h3>How do routing based VPNs configure a host?</h3><p>Once a user connects to a VPN server, their VPN client process will configure the host’s settings to route traffic through the tunnel that it established. If all traffic* is routed through the VPN, we refer to it as a “full-tunnel VPN”. &nbsp;If there are user-defined exceptions for traffic, such as local network traffic, we refer to it as a “split-tunnel VPN”. The VPN client can also configure other settings on the host, such as the host’s firewall. Later, we’ll discuss a mitigation we observed using the host-based firewall.</p><p>Commonly, these configuration changes are made by “up scripts” and “down scripts” when a connection is established or disconnected. The runtime process for a VPN client may also perform configuration changes, but this varies from vendor to vendor.</p><p>*Note: When we say, “all traffic”, we really mean “all traffic except the traffic necessary to keep the VPN in a working state.” For example, VPNs create an exception to their own previously configured routing rules. All traffic sent to the VPN servers IP address must be sent over a hardware backed interface instead of its own tunnel. Otherwise, it would break the hosts connection to the VPN server and the VPN client would be unable to send encrypted packets. In addition, there are other configuration exceptions made for DHCP traffic since the VPN must maintain its hosts IP address lease. </p><h3>What are routes and routing tables?</h3><p><strong>Routes</strong> are how we describe where to send traffic based on the destination. <strong>Routing tables</strong> are a collection of routes that are used by the <strong>network stack</strong>. Consider a network stack to just be all the code on an operating system that deals with sending and receiving data from a network.</p><p>A common route is sending all traffic (<code>0.0.0.0/0</code> in <strong>Classless</strong> Inter-Domain Routing [CIDR] notation) to your router (<code>192.168.1.1</code>) over the physical network interface (<code>eth0</code>).</p><p>An example of that rule in the table would be:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_74810">
  <p>Another behavior of routing tables is that by default (in most network stacks) the most specific <strong>prefix length</strong> for the CIDR range has the highest priority. The prefix length for the range <code>192.168.1.1/32</code> is <code>32</code> and the prefix length for the range <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> is <code>0</code>. The highest numerical value of a prefix length will take priority for routing selection (unless configured otherwise).</p><p>For example:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_76210">
  <p>In this situation, if we sent traffic to <code>10.10.10.2</code>, the most specific rule is the <code>/32</code> rule and it would therefore be the rule the network stack uses despite matching the other two rules above it.</p><p>Most full-tunnel VPNs use the least specific rule possible to capture all traffic. Note that the following example includes an exception route for the hypothetical VPN server address (<code>12.34.56.78</code>) as well.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_77388">

<p>Alternatively, providers may use two <code>/1</code> rules to gain priority over the default route. It's common in even non-adversarial environments for DHCP to set a default route to the physical gateway.</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_80151">
  <h3>What is DHCP?</h3><p>DHCP was originally developed as a robust way to dynamically issue IP addresses to devices on a local network as opposed to manually addressing each device. All modern operating systems have their own DHCP client that will automatically request an IP address. </p><p>The main concept to understand is that DHCP provides a time-based <strong>lease</strong> for IP addresses, and it contains many additional features called <strong>options</strong> that allow you to adjust the configuration of devices remotely and dynamically. Some notable options include setting the <strong>default</strong> <strong>gateway</strong> that acts as the primary route to the Internet or DNS (Domain Name System) servers, which resolve domain names like “google.com” to an IP address.</p><p>A client who wants an IP address uses a <strong>broadcast</strong> to send a <strong>DHCPDISCOVER</strong> packet to the entire local subnet. Other hosts will ignore this, except for the server who will respond with a <strong>DHCPOFFER </strong>unicasted directly to the client to offer it a time-bound lease.</p><p>Alternatively, if a client knows who the DHCP server is, it has the option to unicast the DHCPDISCOVER to a DHCP server instead of broadcasting. Usually, this is used for renewing its lease.</p>

  <p>As seen in the above diagram, once a DHCP server makes an offer, the client can choose to accept or decline the offer. For example, if it receives multiple offers, it will choose the best one. The selection most often implemented by DHCP clients is “first come, first serve.” The servers that aren’t selected will be sent a <strong>DHCPDECLINE</strong> message from the client. Notably, the DHCPOFFER will include the options.</p><h3>What is DHCP option 121?</h3><p>In 1997, the DHCP <strong>RFC</strong> had option 33, which allowed network administrators to specify a static route to install into a client’s routing table. However, this used <em>classful</em> static routes, which fell out of favor over time as public IP space became limited. In 2002, RFC 3442 introduced option 121 classless static routes and obsoleted option 33 (which still should be supported, <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7792#issuecomment-355068519" target="_blank">depending on who you ask</a>). Option 121 also allows administrators to add static routes to a client’s routing table, but with classless ranges instead. There is no limit besides packet size to how many different routes can be installed at once.</p><p>An interesting quirk of DHCP option 121 is that the network interface device for the route it installs cannot be specified by the DHCP server. Below you can see a DHCPOFFER packet that was captured in Wireshark. It specifies the <em>CIDR range </em>and the <em>router</em> to use but has no interface device.</p>

  <p>Instead, the DHCP client will implicitly choose the network interface that the client is talking to the DHCP server on when installing its routing rules for this option. </p><h2>Decloaking Attacks</h2>

  <h3>Requirements for decloaking VPN traffic</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The targeted host must accept a DHCP lease from the attacker-controlled server</p></li><li><p>The targeted host’s DHCP client must implement DHCP option 121</p></li></ul><p>We want to stress that <strong>there are ways an attacker who is on the same network as a targeted user might be able to become their DHCP server</strong>:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A rogue DHCP server using a DHCP starvation attack against the true DHCP, then responding to new clients. We have achieved this in lab environments and are working on a follow-up blog post.</p></li><li><p>A rogue DHCP server racing to respond to DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts to abuse DHCP clients’ common behavior where they implement first-offer lease selection.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between the true DHCP server and client, then waiting for a client to renew their lease. </p></li></ul><h3>Performing the attack</h3><p>Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.</p><p>We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a <code>/0</code> CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple <code>/1</code> routes to recreate the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> all traffic rule set by most VPNs.</p><p>Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_95776">
  <p>We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.</p><h3>Proof of Concept</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Video proof of concept:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lab Setup Code:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://github.com/leviathansecurity/TunnelVision" target="_blank">https://github.com/leviathansecurity/TunnelVision</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>DHCP Server image:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLJGs3ZUypf6hLh5WL4AJmsKdUOZo5yZ" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLJGs3ZUypf6hLh5WL4AJmsKdUOZo5yZ</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><br>The lab scenarios are built to represent:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>An attacker compromises a DHCP server/access point</p></li><li><p>A rogue administrator owns the infrastructure themselves and maliciously configures it</p></li><li><p>An attacker sets up an evil twin wireless AP in a physical location such as a coffee shop or corporate office</p></li><li><p>One we release our tool, ArcaneTrickster, the lab can also be used to mimic an attacker who has an adjacent host on the network na dis otherwise not in a privileged network position</p></li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><h4><strong>Network Namespaces</strong></h4><p>Using network namespaces on Linux can completely fix this behavior. However, in our experience, it is less commonly implemented.</p><p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution" target="_blank">WireGuard’s documentation</a> shows how it’s possible to use a namespace for all applications with traffic that should be using a VPN before sending it to another namespace that contains a physical interface. However, this appears to be Linux-specific functionality and it’s not clear if there is a solution for Windows, MacOS, or other operating systems with the same amount of robustness.</p><h3>Mitigations</h3><h4><strong>Firewall Rules</strong></h4><p>We’ve observed VPN providers denying all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface via firewall rules. An exception was necessary for the DHCP and VPN server IPs because they are necessary to remain connected to the LAN and VPN server. Deep packet inspection could also allow only the DHCP and VPN protocols instead but would likely incur a performance penalty.</p><h4><strong>Problems with Firewall Rule Mitigations</strong></h4><p>Firewall mitigations create a selective denial of service for traffic using the DHCP route and introduce a side-channel. An attacker can use this side-channel to determine the destination of traffic. To determine the traffic’s destination, an attacker could perform traffic analysis on the volume of VPN encrypted traffic a user sends. The attacker would need a baseline volume of traffic where no malicious are installed. Then the attacker would need to modify the lease configuration to install routes that deny traffic and observe the difference in volume.</p><p>With enough samples, it would be possible to statistically prove whether the targeted user is sending traffic to a specific destination. For the average internet user, most internet traffic is already secured by TLS. Therefore, traffic intercepted by TunnelVision will mostly be unreadable except for the destination and protocols. This means that this side-channel has nearly the same impact and should be considered insufficient.</p><p>The side-channel is flexible in use:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The traffic can be checked against a predefined list.</p></li><li><p>The traffic can be selectively denied as a censorship mechanism.</p></li><li><p>The attacker can use IP space denial with binary search to determine all current connections in logarithmic time.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Ignore Option 121</strong></h4><p>Another possible mitigation is ignoring option 121 while the VPN is on. We noted that because Android does not implement support for DHCP option 121, it was uniquely unaffected. The downside is that option 121 exists for a reason, and ignoring these routes can break network connectivity (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34145080" target="_blank">something that is frequently brought up as a reason to implement i</a>t on Android). If this mitigation is implemented, it must be mandatory because attackers could simply deny network access until the VPN or user re-enables option 121.</p><h4><strong>Use a Hot Spot or VM</strong></h4><p>Hot spots are temporary Wi-Fi networks controlled by a cellular device. They create a password-locked LAN with automatic network address translation. Because this network is completely controlled by the cellular device and requires a password, an attacker should not have local network access. A virtual machine would also work similarly as long as the VM’s network adapter is not in bridged mode.</p><h4><strong>Do not use untrusted networks if you need absolute confidentiality of your traffic</strong></h4><h2>Industry Impact</h2><h3>Is TunnelVision a vulnerability?</h3><p>This is debatable. We’re calling it a technique because TunnelVision doesn’t rely on violating any security properties of the underlying technologies. From our perspective, TunnelVision is how DHCP, routing tables, and VPNs are intended to work.</p><p>However, it contradicts VPN providers’ assurances that are commonly referenced in marketing materials; in our opinion, TunnelVision becomes a vulnerability when a VPN provider makes assurances that their product secures a customer from an attacker on an untrusted network. There’s a big difference between protecting your data in transit and protecting against all LAN attacks. VPNs were not designed to mitigate LAN attacks on the physical network and to promise otherwise is dangerous.</p><p>In our technique, we have not broken the VPN’s cryptographically secured protocol, and the VPN is still fully functional. An attacker is instead forcing a target user to not use their VPN tunnel. Regardless of whether we classify this as a technique, VPN users are affected when they rely on assurances that a VPN can secure them from attackers on their local network.</p><h3>Affected Operating Systems</h3><p>In our testing, we observed that any operating system that implements a DHCP client according to its RFC specification and has support for DHCP option 121 routes is affected. This includes Windows, Linux, iOS, and MacOS. Notably, it does not affect Android as they do not have support for DHCP option 121.</p><h3>Affected VPN Providers and VPN Protocols</h3><p>We found that VPNs that solely rely on routing rules to secure the host’s traffic are vulnerable. Those who are hosting their own VPN servers (e.g., system administrators) and are not hardening their VPN client configurations will likely be vulnerable as well. We have observed a mitigation from some VPN providers that drops traffic to non-VPN interfaces via firewall rules. It’s possible there are other methods that we did not encounter during testing to mitigate or fix this.</p><p>As previously mentioned, we observed the same behavior on each operating system we tested, save one. Furthermore, the strength of the encryption algorithm a VPN uses makes no difference. TunnelVision’s effect is independent of the underlying VPN protocol (e.g., WireGuard, OpenVPN, or IPsec) because it reconfigures the operating system network stack the VPN relies on.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><h3>Call to Action</h3><p>We have a limitation as a research team of two– there are simply too many VPNs on the market to test each one individually. The first approach we took was to notify companies via bug bounties or security disclosure email, but that quickly became unscalable. We’ve also engaged the EFF and CISA to help disclose as broadly as possible prior to publicly releasing this research. We thank them tremendously for their help. Our hope is that by publishing our work, we can reach more affected parties, especially because we believe the technique has been feasible since as early as 2002.</p><p>Although the public disclosure of this technique affects each party differently, ultimately there is a shared responsibility.</p><p>Users should be made aware of this technique and for sensitive traffic they should be warned against using untrusted networks. If they must use an untrusted network, they should use a VPN provider that has an effective mitigation against this technique. To determine if a provider has an effective mitigation or fix, our lab setup is available for testing and VPN providers themselves will be able to speak to the specifics of their existing mitigations in their documentation. If a VPN decloak does occur, most user data will not be visible to local network attackers assuming they are accessing websites with HTTPS, which has <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-httpsdefault" target="_blank">become increasingly common</a>.</p><p>It is common for corporate VPNs to be used in areas such as coffee shops, hotels, or airports. Network administrators should inform employees that working from such places carries risks and should be avoided when possible. If such a policy is not practical, then administrators should advise using VPNs that enable the previously mentioned mitigations or fixes. Some alternatives would be to use a trusted hot spot and then connect to the VPN. Lastly, running the VPN inside of a VM that obtains a lease from a virtualized DHCP server would prevent the local networks DHCP server from installing routes altogether.</p><p>Companies that control their own networks or have site-to-site VPNs should review the switches they use and enable features such as DHCP snooping and ARP protections.&nbsp; These layer 2 protections help prevent rogue DHCP servers but do not eliminate a rogue administrator scenario. In addition, implementing HTTPS or other protocols with encryption for internal resources will prevent data leakage from VPN users connecting from untrusted networks.</p><p>VPN providers can add features to clients to configure firewall rules that drop outbound packets to network interfaces. However, such a setting will mean that a VPN user will be isolated from interacting with local network resources. If the VPN client is for Linux and is intended to be a full tunnel, using network namespaces for isolation. As such, VPN providers should publicly provide documentation about any mitigations or fixes they have for TunnelVision and warn their end users about TunnelVision’s existence. We also recommend reviewing their marketing material and cease marketing claims that VPNs protect customers on untrusted networks until it can be proven.</p><p>Operating system maintainers (outside of Linux) should determine whether adding or enhancing features related to network namespaces is feasible. </p><h3>Upcoming Research</h3><p>During the disclosure process, we encountered multiple cases in which the entities we disclosed to did not see this as a serious problem. They assumed that the prerequisite conditions included privileged positions or accounts, despite the only prerequisite being local network access. This assumption was partially fueled by our intentionally simplistic lab setup where we were the only DHCP server, and what we perceive as the entity’s lack of familiarity with low-level networking.</p><p>With this feedback, we decided to develop a robust adversarial infrastructure library to enable further LAN security research and demonstrate practical attacks. For example, we can demonstrate that it’s possible to consistently perform TunnelVision while simply being adjacent to the target host on the same LAN. We’re calling it “ArcaneTrickster” and plan on releasing it at a later date. However, we feature a demo in our videos, which are available in the proof of concept section.</p>

Many knowledge workers manage projects on a daily or weekly basis, yet most, including myself, don't have formal training in it and will profusely reject the title "Project Manager". The book gives a no-bullshit guide to manage things—deliverables, deadlines, schedules, and scope—and how to lead people—team members, customers, etc.<p>"The Emperor of All Maladies". A haunting, personal, and intimate biography of cancer. Having been on the peripherals of several cancer patients, I find the book an incredible overview of the disease, and how to deal with its physical, mental, and societal consequences.

There almost didn't need to be a 2nd Edition - most of the major topics were covered in 1st edition - the only major difference is the use of lots of protocol examples.   The core material itself is timeless.</p><p>Here is just one gem from Chapter 5 - "Hubs, Switches, Virtual Lans and Fast Ethernet"</p><p>"I originally resisted adopting the term <i>switch</i>. Unlike <i>thing</i>, <i>switch</i> sounds like a word you'd apply to a well-defined concept, so it makes people assume that there is a crisp definition that everyone else knows. I thought the world was already confusing enough with the terms <i>bridge</i> and <i>router</i>. Unfortunately, people coined the word <i>switch</i> assuming they were inventing a new concept, somehow different from a <i>bridge</i> or a <i>router</i>. And there were various independent product concepts named <i>switch</i>. As "switch" vendors expanded the capabilities of their products, the products wound up being functionally the same as bridges and routers, usually a hybrid or superset. One cynical (and ungrammatical) definition I use for <i>switch</i> is "a marketing term that means fast." Almost all products these days are some hybrid or superset of bridges and routers. So maybe it's right for the industry to settle on a new word, <i>switch</i>, as a more generic term for a box that moves data."

A hub broadcasts incoming packets to all its ports while a switch keeps a table and broadcasts only to the port that MAC is plugged into. That table is likely called a “routing table”, which probably drives some confusion. I always thought of a router as an internet connected switch. In addition, I always thought of a modem as something that can speak the language of the line (phone lines originally) instead of just the network protocol.<p>I’m not a network pro and these concepts could be totally wrong in my mind. Not sure why I’m spewing them out, other than to give myself something to solidify in the future.

To keep track of the MAC address to port mappings, a switch will have one or more "forwarding" or "MAC-address" tables.</p><p>Routers (and Layer 3 switches) are not necessarily Internet connected, but will mostly be seen in larger networks.  Being mostly Ethernet-based these days, they maintain two tables - an ARP table (mapping IP Addresses to MAC Addresses) and a routing table (mapping IP prefixes/routes to destination IP addresses).  When an IP packet comes into a port, the router will consult it's routing table and find the most specific route that matches the destination of the packet.  From the destination IP of the route, it will then determine the egress interface that it should send the packet towards, then use the ARP table to work out the destination Ethernet MAC address for the Ethernet frame it will construct to transport the IP packet in on it's way to the next-hop router.</p><p>* During the early 00s there were "Dual-Speed Hubs", which were basically two hubs (one 10Mbps, one 100Mbps) joined together internally via a two-port Ethernet switch.  Fortunately the price of 100Mbps Ethernet switches kept falling and they weren't around too long.</p><p>* Provided those ports are all members of the same broadcast domain/VLAN

Here is an excerpt that uses this system to analyse modern workplace anonymity:</p><p>"[...] tendency to uniformity demands that individuals shall be treated as mere numerical 'units', thus realizing equality by a leveling down, for that is the only direction in which equality can be reached 'in the limit' [...] Anyone who wonders what happens to the individual in such conditions will find that [...] he is so to speak reduced to his substantial aspect, and this amounts to saying that he becomes scarcely more than [...] 'a body without a soul'. From such an individual the qualitative or essential aspect has indeed almost disappeared ('almost', because the limit can never actually be reached); and [...] the individual really no longer has any 'name' that belongs to him, because he is emptied of the qualities which that name should express; he is thus really 'anonymous', but in the inferior sense of the word. This is the anonymity of the 'masses' of which the individual is part and in which he loses himself, those 'masses' that are no more than a collection of similar individuals, regarded purely and simply as so many arithmetical 'units'. 'Units' of that sort can be counted, and the collectivity they make up can thus be numerically evaluated, the result being by definition only a quantity; but in no way can each one of them be given a denomination indicating that he is distinguished from the others by some qualitative difference."

It's about Data General and the development of a new minicomputer.  I read it at the dawn of my IT career in the 1990s and found much of was still relevant then.  (the book was written in 1981)  Thirty years later, I'm mostly just nodding as I follow along; yep, yep, yep. "Engineering" is a distant second to corporate politics and office pecking order.<p>Reading Brian Shul's "Sled Driver" autobiography on the tablet.  Shul was an SR-71 pilot, and the book is about 10% Shul and 90% SR-71.  It reads fast and it's interesting, with unexpected bits of information.</p><p>Just finished David Goggins' "Can't Hurt Me."  It's supposed to be a "motivational" autobiography.  I can't say I felt motivated.  Most of his problems were self-inflicted, and he treated his family and children like dirt.

It seems like he couldn't even get along with other Navy Seals, because they weren't disciplined and motivated enough for him, and wouldn't accept ideas like training to the point of serious injury or disability. But it makes zero sense- how can you be ready for a mission when you're injured? Ultimately, it seems like he's addicted to self harming to escape emotional trauma/pain, not because he's disciplined.<p>Jocko Willink is a similar "Navy seal teaching you the secrets to becoming a badass" but his approach seems a lot more sane and useful, and has been more effective in his own life.

I think I had a different reason for reading it the second time, as opposed to the first time.</p><p>The first time around, I think I was more reading it because I like to think of myself as an educated, scientific-minded person, and it was one of "those books" that any self-respecting "educated, scientific-minded person" was sort of "supposed to" have read. That and I was mentally already in a place somewhere in the nether regions between "agnostic" and "atheist" and I knew of Dawkins as a strong advocate for atheist thinking, and I guess I was looking for something that might convince me one way or the other. Or maybe that's just post-hoc rationalization on my part, but that's what I felt like I found. I felt much better about just calling myself an atheist after reading the book.</p><p>Anyway... one thing I was struck by though, was his discussion of things like kin altruism and reciprocal altruism and some of the game theoretical stuff, including mentions of Robert Axelrod and his research. So the second time I read the book, I was really looking to focus more on those sections, and take notes and do some further research. And all of that was really driven by my interest in evolutionary computing / genetic algorithms / etc. and a thought that I might find something there that I could apply to those areas. I wound up buying Axelrod's book <i>The Evolution of Cooperation</i>, but I sadly have not quite gotten around to reading it yet.</p><p>&gt; And read the author's sequel books to it.</p><p>I've also read <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> twice, although that was sort of by accident. I forgot I'd already read it, and I was moderately deep into the second read before I realized I'd read it before. It was worth it though.</p><p>I still have <i>Climbing Mount Improbable</i>, <i>The God Delusion</i>, <i>The Ancestor's Tale</i>, and a couple of other Dawkins books queued up to read as well.

Once you've got into the habit of pulling out floss and flossing just one tooth, you can move onto flossing two teeth and so on.</p><p>If at any point you feel resistance to doing the bigger habit you're trying to build up, you can always revert back to doing the initial tiny habit of flossing just one tooth.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We love complex, deep discussions.</p><p>We've seen or been part of many discussions — strategic discussions at work, discussions on<!-- --> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">AI alignment</a>,<!-- --> <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-736-shorthand-syntax-for-keyword-arguments-at-invocation/43432">technical design documents</a>, public policy, etc. For us, the most frustrating issues with discussions are: impulsive responses and lack of structure.</p><p>The default way of discussions — in-person ones — are highly susceptible to impulsive responses and are extremely hard to provide a good structure for, making them the worst for complex topics.</p><p>The first issue of impulsive responses is a hard nut to crack. Practising and advocating for active listening is the ideal solution but it's not guaranteed to work every time and in every team. That's why we prefer written, async discussions over in-person ones for complex topics — they help prevent impulsive responses to an extent (and even more with features like slow mode) and promote thoughtful responses. But the second issue still remains — written, async discussions lack structure too. If you've used chat/forum platforms like Slack and Discourse for complex discussions, you know how hard it is to follow comments there.</p><p><span>Discourse</span>In Discourse, discussions are a stream of unorganised comments. This way of discussion — where people talk over one another and topics get mixed up — doesn't work for deep dives into complex and lengthy topics. For such topics, the discussion needs to be carefully written and organised.</p><p>There's no concept of “where” you are in Discourse discussions. There's only “when” you are, since the comments are ordered only by time. Discourse does provide some organisation to see the replies to a comment at one place. However if you need to see the replies to a particular reply inside a comment, you need to scroll down through other comments, find that particular reply (repeated as a comment!) and then check its replies:</p><p><img alt="CQ2 demo screenshot" fetchpriority="high" width="702" height="960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://cq2.co/_next/static/media/discourse-comment-replies.02481816.png"></p><p><span>Slack</span>Slack is not really built for written, async discussions, but since it's widely used, let's talk about it. Discussions there are a stream of unorganised comments too, but at least Slack has threads to discuss a particular comment in detail in a separate pane. However, if you want to discuss a comment inside a thread in detail (i.e., create a new thread from a thread), you can't — Slack allows only one level of threads. Moreover, Slack feels too chatty — it feels impossible to have a long-running async discussion there. Its UI encourages sending bursts of fast, short comments instead of well-formed thoughts, and the typing indicator keeps everyone else distracted while one person tries to form their idea.</p><p><span>Quote hell</span>Now behold the common annoyance in all chat/forum platforms — the quote hell. What's that? Let's say Ava puts a comment about something. Then Caleb puts a comment with his replies to some quotes from Ava's comment. Now Ava puts a comment with her replies to Caleb's replies in quotes. What's happening? Replies to a topic are spread across different comments and you're forced to mentally manage all those quotes and their replies! On top of that, there are unrelated comments between that break your flow. These problems might not seem big for a discussion between two people, but a complex and lengthy discussion with 5+ participants quickly turns into a huge mess. Here's what a quote hell looks like:</p><p>After being frustrated with Slack, Discourse, etc., we started searching for a tool specifically built for complex discussions. We found none, began exploring how such a tool would work and look like, and started building:</p><p><span>CQ2</span>It's a free and open source tool for complex discussions.

Forget quote hell — create threads around specific quotes and find all replies related to a topic at one place. Never lose context of where you are — see all parent threads of the current thread in the same view. Focus on what matters — see which threads have unread comments, which are concluded and quickly go to a particular thread using CQ2's tree. Conclude threads — add conclusions to resolved threads and to the whole discussion once it's resolved.</p></div><div><p><span>Commenting and creating threads</span>General comments about the discussion go in the main (first and leftmost) thread.

      <p>It all started on a beach in southwestern England in the early 2000s. Richard Thompson, then a senior lecturer at Plymouth University (where he now serves as professor of marine biology),&nbsp;was leading a team of graduate students researching microplastics in marine environments. Examining samples of sandy sediment, they expected to find degraded bits of marine plastic from decades-old flotsam&nbsp;or plastic beads that were becoming widely used in cleaners. To their surprise, most of the plastic fragments were fibrous, which meant they&nbsp;likely came from clothing, rope, or some types of packaging.</p>
<p>Then, in 2011, Mark Browne, one of Thompson’s former graduate students, published a study in which he examined sediment sampled from 15 beaches around the world. He&nbsp;found high concentrations of polyester and acrylic fibers in samples taken near wastewater treatment plants. He then ran a polyester fleece jacket through the wash and filtered 1,900 fibers from the wastewater—fibers that otherwise would&nbsp;have gone to the local wastewater treatment plant. Browne started reaching out to apparel makers to see if they’d help fund research to study this issue more deeply—eventually, he hoped, finding tweaks to fabric design or apparel construction that would stop the&nbsp;microfibers from entering wastewater. He received&nbsp;one offer of help—from women’s clothing brand Eileen Fisher—but Patagonia, Columbia, and other big brands declined, saying they didn’t know if the fibers were anything they needed to worry about.</p>
<div data-animation=""><blockquote><p>During laundering, a single fleece jacket sheds as many as 250,000 synthetic fibers—significantly more than the 1,900 fibers Browne first recorded. Based on an estimate of consumers across the world laundering 100,000 Patagonia jackets each year, the amount of fibers being released into public waterways is equivalent to the amount of plastic in&nbsp;up to&nbsp;11,900 grocery bags.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Fast-forward four more years, and the fibers finally got everyone’s attention. <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1998166/plastics">The science was piling on</a>, showing that wastewater treatment plants couldn’t filter out all synthetic fibers,&nbsp;and that toxins such as DDT and PCBs can bind to them as they make their way into watersheds. It also showed&nbsp;that small aquatic species ingest the fibers, and that fish and bivalves sold for human consumption also contain microfibers. Experiments have&nbsp;shown that&nbsp;microplastics can lead to&nbsp;poor health outcomes in some species, and research is underway to find out how the plastics affect humans.</p>
<p>Jill Dumain, director of environmental strategy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia</a>, was one of the people paying attention to all the news. In early 2015, she&nbsp;and the&nbsp;company’s leadership decided to commission a study to find out if and how Patagonia’s iconic and well-loved fleeces and some other synthetic products were contributing to the problem.&nbsp;The results recently came&nbsp;in, and they’re not good.</p>
<p><a href="http://brenmicroplastics.weebly.com/project-findings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study</a>, performed by graduate students at the <a href="http://www.esm.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bren School of Environmental Science and&nbsp;Management</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that during laundering, a single fleece jacket sheds as many as 250,000 synthetic fibers—significantly more than the 1,900 fibers Browne first recorded. Based on an estimate of consumers across the world laundering 100,000 Patagonia jackets each year, the amount of fibers being released into public waterways is equivalent to the amount of plastic in up to&nbsp;11,900 grocery bags.</p>
<p>The experiment involved five pieces of apparel: three Patagonia fleece jackets,&nbsp;each with slightly different construction, as well as a nylon shell jacket that contains polyester insulation, plus a fifth specimen—a “budget”&nbsp;fleece jacket made by an undisclosed brand. Replicates of each jacket&nbsp;were washed multiple times, both in front-loading and top-loading washing machines. The effluent from each cycle was collected and put through a two-step filtration system that captured fibers with both a 333- and 20-micrometer mesh screen.</p>
<p>The jackets were then put through a 24-hour “killer wash,”&nbsp;which Patagonia uses to simulate the aging of a garment. The researchers did this to test whether older garments might shed more fibers as they age. After repeating the washing tests on these artificially aged jackets, they saw that age&nbsp;indeed increases fiber release&nbsp;by 80&nbsp;percent.</p>
<p>In previous studies, researchers counted the total number of fibers, but that was not a viable path for this study, which instead calculated their mass. “We fully intended to do counts, but in the volumes of water that we collected and filtered, there were simply so many—hundreds of thousands—of fibers [from each test], we knew quickly that even with five of us [on the research team] we did not have time or energy to [do individual counts],”&nbsp;says Stephanie Karba, the lead researcher on the UCSB team.</p>
<p>Using an equation widely used in the textile industry to determine fiber count based on mass, researchers found that the highest estimate of fibers released from a single jacket was 250,000, and the average across all jackets was 81,317&nbsp;fibers.</p>
<p>Hoping to publish its detailed methodology in a science journal, the team hasn’t revealed all its findings. But in addition to data about fiber release, the Patagonia report shows that fiber loss is directly related to the type of washing machine and the age of the garment.&nbsp;Garments released five times as many microfibers when washed in top-loading washing machines&nbsp;compared to front-loaders. And aging&nbsp;affected fiber loss differently for different garments&nbsp;based on the type of washer. For example, compared to Patagonia jackets, the average mass of fiber shed from the budget jacket of undisclosed origin was much higher when it was washed at the new stage&nbsp;in a front-loader. But after all the jackets were aged, the Patagonia jackets shed a comparable amount of fibers to the budget jacket. In top-loaders, the budget jacket shed a comparable amount of fiber, on average, to the others when new.</p>
<p>Another surprise: The nylon shell jacket actually released a comparable amount of fiber to the fleece jackets in some tests, and even more in other tests, seeming to indicate that the polyester fill escaped through seams or the shell fabric.</p>
<p>Having reviewed the findings, Richard Thompson, the Plymouth University scientist whose work knocked over&nbsp;the first domino, says Patagonia’s report might be more useful for Patagonia than for the scientific community&nbsp;because it does not take a vastly different approach that Browne’s research. He says he’d have preferred if Patagonia’s tests had been done with the use of detergent (the UCSB researchers say detergent would have clogged the filters, which is also why Browne did not use detergent in his 2011 research) and on a wider selection of apparel items.</p>
<p>“The budget jacket seems to perform worse in some tests but better in others, but even if it performed consistently better or worse, you can still only reach the conclusion for that one budget jacket of unknown origin,”&nbsp;he says. Still, he thinks it was an important first move by industry. “Honestly, some companies might shy away from this; they might not want to open a can of worms. So it’s a environmentally responsible move&nbsp;and potentially quite risky, since there is not much data out there on everyone else’s apparel.”</p>
<p>Add to the list of concerns unique to the outdoor industry: chemical additives in performance apparel (think&nbsp;waterproof-breathable duds) that enter the water along with the fibers.</p>
<p>Of course, apparel companies are far from the only stakeholders being thrust into the spotlight. The role washing machines play in microfiber pollution is also a major concern, and scientists and apparel companies are calling on appliance manufacturers to investigate the efficacy of adding filters to washing machines to capture fibers before they enter wastewater. The problem will&nbsp;grow with the rise in the number of washing machines coming into use globally—Swedish statistician <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sqnptxlCcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hans Rosling</a> says 2 billion of the 7 billion people on earth used washing machines in 2010, but he predicts that 5 billion out of the 9 billion humans expected to populate the earth by 2050 will use the appliances.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b05416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published last month</a>&nbsp;showed that while wastewater treatment plants remove more than 98 percent of plastic fragments from wastewater, they still send an estimated 65 million pieces of microplastics into watersheds each day. Polyester, the main fiber used in fleece, makes up the largest share of the plastics that get through—even though it only accounts for 10.8 percent of the plastic in influent wastewater (water that enters the plant). Also, many fibers that do get captured often end up in environmental sludge, which is sometimes added to fertilizer.</p>
<p>To try to get ahead of the problem, Patagonia and other apparel companies have said they want to research new yarn and fabric constructions to determine whether microfiber shedding can be addressed through better design, something that’s already happening in Europe.</p>
<p>After a 2013 European Commission–funded research program called Mermaids found that surfactants in detergents lead to much higher fiber loss—on the order of 1 million fibers shed from a single fleece jacket—textile specialists in Spain and Italy were tasked with developing a special coating or impregnation that would be applied to the fabric during manufacture and, in theory, reduce the amount of fiber loss. More details on the program are expected in December, but researchers say the coatings being tested and developed are environmentally benign.</p>
<p>The Mermaids program, promoted through the Plastic Soup Foundation, an NGO based in the Netherlands, has also released some guidelines based on its initial research, including suggestions to avoid the use of detergents with high pH, powder detergents, and the use of oxidizing agents. It also suggests washing clothing in cold water&nbsp;and softening hard water, and it released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8OZ_6YwTUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheeky video</a>&nbsp;to drive its point home. Clothing company G-Star, which integrates synthetic fibers sourced from plastic ocean debris into the denim jeans it sells, has partnered with the Plastic Soup Foundation to promote the Mermaid program.</p>
<p>In August, at the Outdoor Retailer trade show in Salt Lake City, Patagonia will present the findings to its industry peers. It hopes to partner with the Outdoor Industry Association to turn the UCSB researchers’ testing protocol&nbsp;into an industry standard that would enable all clothing manufacturers to set a benchmark for fiber release from their apparel products. Dumain says it’s important that companies outside the outdoor niche start tracking microfiber issues&nbsp;as well. And she thinks an international third-party testing standards group, such as the ASTM, which has developed testing methods for factors such as sewn seams and flammability of apparel textiles, could also take the protocol and run with it. “It’s right up their alley,”&nbsp;Dumain says.</p>
<p>Unlike laws that restrict manufacturers from adding plastic microbeads to cleaning products, no obvious legislative approaches limit&nbsp;microfiber pollution, and apparel makers would likely prefer to self-impose approaches to reducing fiber loss rather than find themselves in the crosshairs of regulators&nbsp;should scientific evidence that microfibers pose environmental dangers continue to mount.</p>
<p>“We knew this would be step one in testing—to prove the methodology, to understand where we were contributing to the problem, where the industry could be contributing to the problem,”&nbsp;says Dumain. “From here, it’s going to set up a whole lot of testing that needs to happen throughout the apparel industry.”</p>

We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).</p><p>Blog post here: <a href="https://blog.peerdb.io/peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture">https://blog.peerdb.io/peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart/streams-quickstart">https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart/streams-quickstart</a>.</p><p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.</p><p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.</p><p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.</p><p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.</p><p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn't at Debezium's level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we're putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.</p><p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack/Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a></p><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.</p><p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting/masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].</p><p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].</p><p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.</p><p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

<p>The streaming media libraries of the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF are also growing together technically: The broadcasters want to develop a joint "streaming OS", they announced on Monday. The code is also to be made publicly available as part of "one of the largest open source initiatives in Germany".</p>

    
  

  
  <a-paternoster height="360" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)">
    

  
    
    
  

  </a-paternoster>



<p>Competitors should also be able to use the Streaming OS code in this way, ARD Chairman Kai Gniffke commented on the initiative. He can imagine a cross-provider German streaming network. "If other institutions – including media companies that compete with us – use the software, then you can also imagine it as the nucleus for a large German-language platform."</p>
<p>ARD and ZDF media libraries also want to use the shared technical foundation to manage user data across the board. Meanwhile, it is still unclear which parts of Streaming OS will be made publicly available. In addition to the streaming player itself, the broadcasters' joint streaming software will also bundle the login system, code for recommendations and the "core of the design system". ARD and ZDF are thus also placing their media libraries on a common technical basis, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/ARD-und-ZDF-verknuepfen-ihre-Mediatheken-9331478.html?from-en=1">having already grown together in terms of content in recent years</a>.</p>

  





<h3 id="nav__giving__0">"Giving something back to society"</h3>
<p>In addition to private providers, educational institutions can also benefit from the broadcasters' planned open source code, according to the broadcasters. "In this way, we are giving something back to society for which it has paid us," comments ZDF Director General Norbert Himmler on the project. Cooperation with European partners is also conceivable, according to a statement.</p>
<p>ARD and ZDF are setting up a joint office for the streaming OS, where the project will be managed. The technical development of the operation is to take place in a commercial subsidiary, which will be founded under the management of ARD. The broadcasters hope that Streaming OS will be ready in spring 2025.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="article-body-content"><p>There are lots of reasons to want to shut off your car’s data collection. The Mozilla Foundation has <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/after-researching-cars-and-privacy-heres-what-keeps-us-up-at-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> modern cars “surveillance machines on wheels” and ranked them <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse than any other product category</a> last year, with all 25 car brands they reviewed failing to offer adequate privacy protections.</p><p>With sensors, microphones, and cameras, cars collect way more data than needed to operate the vehicle. They also <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/what-data-does-my-car-collect-about-me-and-where-does-it-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share and sell</a> that information to third parties, something many Americans don’t realize they’re opting into when they buy these cars. Companies are quick to flaunt their privacy policies, but those amount to pages upon pages of legalese that leave even professionals stumped about what exactly car companies collect and where that information might go.</p><p>So what can they collect?</p><p>“Pretty much everything,” said Misha Rykov, a research associate at the Mozilla Foundation, who worked on the car-privacy report. “Sex-life data, biometric data, demographic, race, sexual orientation, gender — everything.”</p><p>“The impression that we got — is that they are trying to be a bit more like Big Tech.”</p><p>It doesn’t mean they necessarily do, but they’re leaving the car door open.</p><p>“The impression that we got — and this impression is supported by the official documents of the brands — is that they are trying to be a bit more like Big Tech,” Rykov said. “It looks like most of them are not entirely sure what's going on there.”</p><p>The data they may or may not collect can cause real trouble. It can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notify your insurance company</a> that you braked too hard or sped up too fast. Car companies can share your info with law enforcement without your knowledge. A domestic abuser could use it to track your whereabouts. It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see this heading south.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to turn off data collection on my car because it’s creepy and I thought the option would be simple. It turns out that shutting off data collection and figuring out what’s been collected is much more difficult than it would seem. I know because it took me — a reasonably informed and technologically savvy person —&nbsp;a month to finally do so.</p><p>I’m in good company.</p><p>“It’s comically difficult,” Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at Electronic Frontier Foundation, who’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/how-figure-out-what-your-car-knows-about-you-and-opt-out-sharing-when-you-can" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written about how to do just this</a>, told me. “I do this for a living and I am not 100% positive I have gotten everything correct, which is ridiculous.”</p><p>In March, my husband and I bought a new Honda. When I turned on the car to leave the dealership, I got a notification telling me that data sharing was on. Right next to “on” was an “off” button. Simple enough! But when I hit “off” I got a message telling me it was “unable to change settings while network is invalid.” Right.</p><p>My children were screaming at me from the back seat, so I assumed this was a problem I could easily fix another time.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Honda privacy 1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>The car ostensibly gives me the option to shut on or off data collection.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><div><p><img alt="Honda privacy 2" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>Instead of shutting off, I got an error message.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Time got away from me and I tried again a few days later at home. I thought maybe the initial trouble was that the cell service wasn’t good enough, so I tried to shut off the data collection when I had a better signal. Nope.</p><p>I tried looking it up online and didn’t find anything conclusive. What I did find was a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times piece by Kashmir Hill</a> that said car companies were sharing driving data with third parties, which in turn were selling it to insurance companies to jack up people’s rates.</p><p>I called the dealer. He talked to some people at Honda and called me back. If I wanted to shut off the data sharing, I’d have to download Honda’s HondaLink app, which came with its own <a href="https://mygarage.honda.com/resource/AutoLinkLegalTerms/HondaLinkLegalTerms/HondaLinkTermsAndConditions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 pages of unreadable terms and conditions</a>.</p><p>That was my only choice, he said. He also said I was the first person to ask him how to do so. I reluctantly downloaded the app, but couldn’t figure out how to shut it off from there. Finally, a day after downloading the app, I was able to shut off the data sharing in my car (confusingly, I had to do so in the car and not on the app, but only once I downloaded the app). It only took me a month.</p><p>Now, though, I will forever have a bright orange notification on my car screen telling me my data sharing is off. It’s clearly a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark pattern</a> meant to nudge me into turning data collection back on.</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Honda privacy 3" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>I no longer am sharing data with Honda, but I will have this notification forever. </p></figcaption></figure><figure><div><p><img alt="Honda privacy 4" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>The bright orange system status is begging for me to turn my data sharing back on.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Honda confirmed the notification won’t go away as long as I have data sharing off. Great!&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to add you can’t select what is collected and what isn’t; it’s all or nothing. If I want a genuinely useful-sounding safety feature — the ability to get an ambulance in the event of a collision, for example — I have to give my car information for everything else.</p><p>Following this fiasco of turning off the data, I wanted to find out what Honda had collected from our car during the time it was running.&nbsp;</p><p>EFF’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/how-figure-out-what-your-car-knows-about-you-and-opt-out-sharing-when-you-can" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handy guide</a> sent me to Honda’s online <a href="https://www.honda.com/privacy/your-privacy-choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy request page</a>, where I learned we didn’t live in one of the five states where we could exercise our consumer rights to view or delete the data our car tracked.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Honda privacy 5" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>Honda would only let me view what data it’s collected if I lived in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia. </p></figcaption></figure><p>I tried by phone instead, to see if Honda might excuse our crime of living in New York. There I waited an hour to have someone — maybe — understand what I was asking: to see what data my car had collected on me.</p><p>“We haven’t done this. We don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>I was put on several holds. At one point I was told, “We haven’t done this. We don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>Eventually they figured it out.</p><p>Two days later, we got an email: “Because you are not a current resident of a qualifying state, your request will not be processed.” I filed an appeal, this time saying I was a journalist. Two days later that was denied as well.</p><p>“American Honda strives to build and maintain a relationship of trust with our customers,” a Honda rep wrote me. “Toward that end, the company’s public websites prominently feature a link to our privacy practices, which include provisions allowing consumers to opt out of the collection of certain types of information.”</p><p>When I tried asking more direct questions about what was collected, the Honda representative kept pointing me back to the company’s unreadable privacy policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Concurrently I’d sent out requests to data broker <a href="https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LexisNexis</a> to look at my and my husband’s files. Fortunately, it didn’t seem to have turned up anything about our driving — just former addresses, phone numbers, property records — though it’s unclear if that’s because our car only had data collection on for a month.&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ Hill was less lucky (as a civilian, more lucky as a reporter). She found out that she and her husband’s Chevy Bolt had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/technology/general-motors-spying-driver-data-consent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending detailed information about their driving habits</a> — speeding, accelerating, stopping too fast — to data brokers and then on to insurance companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EFF’s Klosowski likens car’s unbridled data collection to smartphones around 2010 or internet of things devices (that were constantly being hacked into) soon after. A mix of <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/legislation/california-electronic-communications-privacy-act-calecpa-sb-178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a> and <a href="https://www.gibsondunn.com/new-federal-law-for-iot-cybersecurity-requires-the-development-of-standards-and-guidelines-throughout-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal</a> legislation have helped but privacy problems persist.&nbsp;</p><p>“It used to be worse, which is a fun thing to think about,” he said.</p><p>“We have found ourselves in similar situations before and we did, slowly but surely, push on these companies to make improvements,” Klosowski said. “Car makers have less of an excuse given the fact that the history of smartphones and IoT products are <i>right there</i> to learn from.”</p><p>Last year, US Sen. Ed Markey sent a number of questions to car companies trying to suss out more clearly what they collect and where it goes. Recently their responses came out, but they’re <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/car-company-ceos-answer-tough-questions-about-cars-and-privacy-kinda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not exactly transparent</a>. Markey has since sent a letter to the FCC asking them to investigate automakers sending car location data to police. It’s part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/regulators-investigate-carmakers-driver-tracking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing government attention</a> on the car-data industry. But for now the freedom of the open road doesn’t feel really free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><hgroup><p><time datetime="2024-05-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 May 2024</time></p></hgroup><hr><p>Before the introduction of Java 21 virtual threads we were heavy users of <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/claypoole">claypoole</a> a fantastic library for simple but effective parallelism using thread pools. However, things get complicated with virtual threads, they shouldn't be pooled, as they aren't a scarce resource. So how do we limit throughput when we have "unlimited" threads? In this post we will look at using java <code>Semaphore</code> class to implement basic token bucket rate limiting to control throughput.</p><p>One of the other key insights I've drawn from claypoole is that unordered parallelism helps minimising latency, as it allows you to process results as soon as they became available. So we'll also explore unordered parallelism with virtual threads.</p><p>To get an virtual thread <code>executor</code> we can call:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defonce <strong>executor</strong> <span>(</span>Executors/newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor<span>))</span>
</code></pre><p>We can combine this with an <code>ExecutorCompletionService</code> to get tasks as they complete rather than the order they are submitted in:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>def <strong>cs</strong> <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/new executor<span>))</span>
</code></pre><p>We can submit tasks to the <code>CompletionService</code> with <code>.submit</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>run! <span>(</span>fn [x] <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/.submit
                  cs #<span>(</span>inc x<span>)))</span>
    [1 2 3 4 5]<span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>We are using Clojure 1.12.0-alpha10 methods as values syntax e.g: <code>ExecutorCompletionService/.submit</code>. This means we don't have to mannualy type hint to avoid reflection.</p><p>To take completed tasks from the service we use <code>.take</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>-&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>repeatedly #<span>(</span>deref <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/.take cs<span>)))</span>
    <span>(</span>take 5<span>))</span>
</code></pre><p>It's important to note that <code>.take</code> is blocking so if we <code>take</code> more tasks than there are from the completion service this code will block indefinitely (or until more tasks are submitted to the service). Because of this our implementation of <code>upmap</code> will consume eagerly (i.e it requires all of it's inputs before it will execute) as we need to know the total number of items that we will want to take <code>(count coll)</code>.</p><p>We can combine all of this to write our own implementation of <code>upmap</code> (unordered pmap):</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defn <strong>upmap</strong>
  <span>(</span>[f coll]
   <span>(</span>let [cs <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/new executor<span>)</span>]
     <span>(</span>run! <span>(</span>fn [x] <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/.submit
                     cs #<span>(</span>f x<span>)))</span> coll<span>)</span>
     <span>(</span>-&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>repeatedly #<span>(</span>deref <span>(</span>ExecutorCompletionService/.take cs<span>)))</span>
       <span>(</span>take <span>(</span>count coll<span>))))))</span>
</code></pre><p><code>upmap</code> takes completed tasks lazily, which lets us process them as they are completed rather than waiting for all tasks to complete:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>upmap inc [1 2 3 4 5 6]<span>)</span><span>
=&gt;</span>

<span>(</span>2 3 4 5 6 7<span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>Now lets look at implementing rate limiting. There's no point spinning up a bunch of virtual threads to make requests against a third party API only to have some fail due to exceeding the third party API's rate limit.</p><p>We can use semaphores for this. Semaphores are similar to pools, but instead of pooling a scarce resource like threads, semaphores instead pool permits:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defonce <strong>sem</strong>
  <span>(</span>Semaphore/new 2 true<span>))</span>
</code></pre><p>We set fairness to <code>true</code> to prevent starvation. From the docs:</p><blockquote><p> The constructor for this class optionally accepts a fairness parameter... When fairness is set true, the semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the acquire methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in which their invocation of those methods was processed (first-in-first-out; FIFO). </p></blockquote><p>Worth keeping in mind this will have a throughput cost, so might not always be the right choice:</p><blockquote><p> Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair ordering often outweigh fairness considerations. </p></blockquote><p>We can combine Semaphores with virtual threads to implement token bucket rate limiting (X req/s with burst of X). This is trivial with virtual threads as we can spin up a new virtual thread (with <code>Thread/startVirtualThread</code>) to return the permit to the semaphore pool after the allotted time. In our case we have two permits and we want a rate limit of 2 req/s so we sleep for 1000ms before returning a permit:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defn <strong>rate-limited-sem-release</strong> [sem]
  <span>;; block until available
</span>  <span>(</span>Semaphore/.acquire sem<span>)</span>
  <span>;; Create another virtual thread that will release this semaphore
</span>  <span>;; to refill the bucked when the time is up.
</span>  <span>(</span>Thread/startVirtualThread
    #<span>(</span>do <span>(</span>Thread/sleep 1000<span>)</span> <span>;; wait 1 second

</code></pre><p>Something to keep in mind is the accuracy of <code>Thread/sleep</code>. From the java language specification:</p><blockquote><p> Thread.sleep causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified duration, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread does not lose ownership of any monitors, and resumption of execution will depend on scheduling and the availability of processors on which to execute the thread. </p></blockquote><p>But for our use case this is accurate enough.

This is happening because the semaphore is blocking the <code>run!</code> function and the way the code is currently written we can't start taking from the <code>CompletionService</code> until all the tasks have been submitted.</p><p>We can get around this by throwing more virtual threads at the problem. We use <code>Thread/startVirtualThread</code> to execute the <code>run!</code> function in another thread, so even if it blocks we can still start taking completed tasks:</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defn <strong>upmap</strong>

<h2><!--mstheme--><span color="#006666">The Main Screen,<br>The Challenge Is To Develop a Safer
World<!--mstheme--></span></h2>
</center><p>This is where the Nukefix program substantially
begins. The following is the screen shown on startup. By
clicking on any of page in list of pages shown here, you can
go to commentary in that subject area when running Nukefix.
By repeatedly clicking on the "More" button, you
can see all the topics covered.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge is to explore conditions that
create a safer system than the base case that is shown.
</strong>In the particular case being considered, the graph
line in the center of the screen shows the probability of a
nuclear use when each nation, on average, would have a
probability of initiating a nuclear use once in 295 years,
during the period under consideration. As explained in the
text of the program, this would apply, regardless of what
probability distributions existed or whether events were
random or nonrandom. </p>
<p>Typically when running Nukefix, you will model many other
conditions to see the outcomes that tend to result when
conditions change.<br> </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/st1.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p><br>Of course, all nations are not equally
peaceful. The different reliability levels for each of the
particular nations are shown at the bottom of the screen, and
they together produce the composite reluctance level (RL) of
295 mentioned in the previous paragraph. </p>
<p>In this case where we are looking at an average
probability of one chance in 295 years for each nation, we
also know that a nuclear use can be caused by an Accidental
Use or a Willful Use. So we can see in the top four windows
what reliability levels are required in these areas, and in
their subcomponents. We ultimately are able to see the levels
of competence (as reflected by a low proclivity to accident)
and levels of caution (as reflected by a low propensity to
willfully initiate a nuclear use) that are required to
sustain the peace at designated probabilities. </p>
<p>We can carry this dissection further because Willful Use
results from a simultaneous failure of Deterrence and
Civility. With respect to Deterrence we are also able to see
how reliable the formal decision-making process needs to be
(as reflected by Decision Error) and the influence of
Irrationality in the psychiatric/psychological/emotional
sense of the term (e.g., in the extreme form, crazy or
insane). Similarly Civility is broken down into its
constituent parts. </p>
<p>The user can change any of these values by clicking on
them when running Nukefix, for example, to test how much
Civility would be required if Deterrence were eliminated, or
to test to what degree Morality can favorably influence
outcome. One can also test the effectiveness of Deterrence by
setting it to very high values. </p>
<p>The results may surprise you. Ultimately, you can see the
levels of stewardship that are required of nations to sustain
nuclear peace at a range of probabilities. </p>
<p>In the case shown, there would be a 50% chance of a
nuclear use occurring somewhere in the world within 22.7
years (as is now indicated at the point of the mouse arrow in
the above graph). This performance, of course, can be
improved or made worse depending on what levels of
reliability you apply to the different nations. </p>
<p>While we may not know with certainty what humans will do,
we are capable of knowing with certainty what levels of
restraint each nation must deliver if nuclear peace is to be
sustained at designated probability levels for specific
lengths of time. </p>

 Table of Contents </a> page, which you can read <a href="http://www.nukefix.org/contents.html">

<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The Menu<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>On the main screen you will see the
"Menu" button. If you had clicked on this button
when running Nukefix. The following screen would have
appeared and an explanation of each command would be shown,
as it is in the "L" (Life) command below. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stmenu.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Probability of a Nuclear Use During Your Remaining
Lifetime<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>Based on the probability of a nuclear use in the
case under consideration and actuarial data for human life
expectancy, Nukefix can calculate the probability of a
nuclear use occurring somewhere in the world during your, or
your children's, remaining lifetime. </p>
<p>For example, after entering the "L" (Life)
command shown in the above snapshot of the menu, the
following screen would appear, when one requested the outcome
for a baby one year old. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/ageone.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>The red window shows that in the given case for
one year olds there would be a 73% chance of a nuclear use
during their remaining lifetimes. Probabilities of occurrence
in one's remaining lifetime decline with advancing age
because of reduced life expectancy. In the given case for
other age groups the following pairings would be found to
apply: 14 years old, 65%; 20, 61%; 35, 49%; 50, 35%; 75, 13%;
and 85, 7%. </p>
<p>Using Nukefix's "^L" command you can readily
see expected outcomes under different conditions and for
different age groups. (Note that the "Learning
Curve" on the pages button is shown with a gray
background. This indicates that it was accessed prior to the
screen snapshot having been taken.)</p>

up.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/intro.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>As you continued reading you would see Feynman
saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, previous NASA experience had shown
on occasion just such difficulties, . . . all giving warning
that the probability of flight failure was not so very small.
. . .</p>
<p>"It would appear that, for whatever purpose -- be it
for internal or external consumption -- the management of
NASA exaggerates the reliability of its product to the point
of fantasy. . . .</p>
<p>"Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA
officials deal in a world of reality, understanding
technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be
actively trying to eliminate them. . . .</p>
<p>"For successful technology, reality must take
precedence over public relations, FOR NATURE CANNOT BE FOOLED
[Emphasis added, <a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html"> F&amp;S</a>, p. v]." </p>
</blockquote><p>Feynman's teachings are applicable in the
nuclear weapons case. Nukefix goes on to make the point:</p>
<blockquote><center><p><strong>The Epidemic</strong> </p>
</center><p>It is perplexing that we live in a
technologically advanced civilization that is amply able to
assess and prevent a major public health risk, yet it chooses
to largely ignore it. Instead, it focuses on less substantial
dangers, many of which are trivial.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hypothetical microbe, which at a
steady rate causes 2,369,886 deaths per year. By comparison
to the number of deaths normally occurring in the United
States in a typical year: In 3.7 months this microbe would
cause as many deaths as heart disease; in 2.8 months, as many
deaths as cancer; in 2.1 months, as many deaths as are
attributed to cigarette smoking; in 6 days, as many deaths as
AIDS; and in 4.2 weeks, as many deaths as lung diseases
(including pneumonia and influenza). In 6.7 days it would
cause as many deaths as all car accidents; in 30.6 minutes,
as many deaths as all floods; in 20.9 minutes, as many deaths
as tornadoes and hurricanes; in 18.4 minutes, as many deaths
as lightning; and in 5.9 days, as many deaths as all guns in
the United States (including all homicides, suicides and
accidents). In 11.7 months it would cause as many deaths as
all current causes of death combined. This is the risk of
death that would be continuously faced.</p>
<p>Within 3.1 months the microbe would produce as many
deaths as the U.S. military suffered in all wars to date
during the 20th century -- World War I, World War II, Korea,
Vietnam, and the Gulf War combined.</p>
<p>However, it is not a microorganism that presents such an
extraordinary public health risk. The expected long-term
average of 2,369,886 direct deaths per year (not including
retaliations, fallout, etc.) is the worldwide risk caused by
the aggressor/initiator alone, when 9 nations present
propensities to initiate nuclear strikes of the sizes
indicated in this program. You also can easily model more
favorable conditions and different size strikes.</p>
<p>You will soon see how and why such an analysis can be
made.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal in Nukefix is to reduce or eliminate these
deaths. <strong>You can literally "re-write the
book." You are not locked into the above opening
paragraphs.</strong> If you find other levels of restraint or
number of warheads better explain current conditions, or if
you expect improved conditions in the future (e.g., each
superpower reducing its arsenal to 3,500 or fewer warheads),
you can enter them into Nukefix. Indeed, often just clicking
on the graph on the main screen or accessing the
"T" (Treaty) command is enough. <strong>The above
paragraphs will automatically rewrite themselves to reflect
the consequences of whatever changes you make.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you had set a limit on the number of
weapons to 3,500 in the superpowers [using the "T"
(Treaty) command], the text have read as in the following.
The difference between the figures shown in brackets (which
were added here for illustration) and the initial values
would illustrate the risk reduction that took place when
going from the initial number of nuclear weapons to a maximum
of 3,500 per superpower as proposed in START II. As can be
seen, the risk of death remained quite substantial, but it
was reduced:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, consider a hypothetical microbe,
which at a steady rate causes 1,828,997 [instead of
2,369,886] deaths per year. By comparison to the number of
deaths normally occurring in the United States in a typical
year: In 4.8 [instead of 3.7] months this microbe would cause
as many deaths as heart disease; in 3.6 [instead of 2.8]
months, as many deaths as cancer . . . [etc.] In 1.3 years
[instead of 11.7 months] it would cause as many deaths as all
current causes of death combined. This is the risk of death
that would be continuously faced.</p>
</blockquote><p>The Nukefix program will show you how and
why such an analysis can be made. This is just a small sample
of the text. Numerous other areas of the nuclear weapons
issue are covered with considerable specificity. </p>
<p>Nukefix is as much a book, as it is a computer program.
However, unlike a book you are not confined to the author's
views. You can develop the conditions and the text by the
changes you make. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Reducing Risk of Death<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>There are only two ways to reduce risk of death
caused by nuclear weapons: 1) to reduce the probability of
occurrence and/or 2) to reduce the severity of occurrence.
All nuclear weapons risk reduction hinges on the ability to
achieve desirable outcomes in these areas. The nuclear
weapons problem poses such high risks of death that it
requires that both be employed.</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Enunciating the Problem in a Kernel<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>Nuclear deterrence presents an imbalance that is
directly at odds with the principle of reducing severity. It
effectively is the intent of nuclear deterrence to exchange a
"large number of deaths" for a very "low
probability" of their occurrence. By this technique,
nuclear deterrence increases severity in the hopes of
reducing probability. This technique can only be successful
in reducing average annual risk of war deaths if the
reduction in probability is proportionally greater than the
increase in severity. It is doubtful that nuclear deterrence
meets this criterion [This can be seen on the deterrence page in the computer
program Nukefix].</p>

 </a>The Imperious Roles of Accident and Miscalculation<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p><strong>The distinguishing feature of the
nuclear weapons system is NOT nuclear deterrence, but the
combined influence of accident and miscalculation.
</strong>Under the conditions shown in the main screen at
startup, there would be a 89.2% probability [89.2% = 66.6% +
22.6%] that a nuclear first use would result from
miscalculation or accident, and probability for all causes of
a nuclear first use can be subdivided as follow: </p>
<!--mstheme--></span><!--msthemelist--><!--mstheme--><span face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>With an expected 2,369,886 deaths per year, if 89.2% of
the incidents were caused by miscalculation or accident,
then, on average, as many as 2,114,675 deaths per year could
readily be attributable to nuclear weapon accident or
miscalculation [2,114,675 = 89.2% x 2,369,886].</p>
<p>There are obviously all sorts of variants in the kind of
conditions that one can develop by changing the values shown
on the main screen. But the central point is that it is
difficult, with nine nuclear weapon nations, to construct
plausible scenarios of long-term nuclear peace where the
influence of miscalculation and accident is acceptably low,
when there is a predominant reliance on nuclear deterrence
[calculations shown on the deterrence page in Nukefix]. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Main Screen Capabilities<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>The main screen has numerous capabilities. The
following are shots of some of the messages that will appear.
And, if you want to supress automatic prompts you can easily
do so by pressing the "S" (Suspend) key. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mainmsg.gif" width="641" height="770">
 </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Base Case Comparison<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>One of the features available is the "Base
Case" comparison. Note that the Main Screen shown
earlier indicated the longevity of nuclear peace when each
nation was sufficiently peaceful that it would have a
propensity to initiate a nuclear use, on average, only once
in 295 years (the Composite Reluctance Level).</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stbc.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>We can also see the advantage if, on average,
each nation were to become sufficiently peaceful that it
would not tend to initiate a nuclear use but once in 500
years. By having employed the "Base Case"
comparison feature, we see that the bottom center blue window
on the screen shows that at the median there would tend to be
15.8 years more of nuclear peace than at the previous 295 RL.
</p>
<p>Thus, using the "Base Case Comparison" we can
get some idea of how great a change in the longevity of
nuclear peace we can reasonably expect if features of the
nuclear weapons system change. </p>
<p>As a practical matter it is useful to note that when
running the program, clicking on the graph is all that is
required to reposition the graph line to pass through the
point that you click on. Thus, it is quite easy to see what
reliability goals nations must meet if they are to sustain
nuclear peace at designated probability levels for designated
periods of time. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Proliferation<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>Although there is a lot of discussion about
proliferation and nonproliferation, too frequently the
consequences of proliferation are so vaguely stated that we
have very little idea how much influence the addition or
reduction of, say, four nations would have on the longevity
of nuclear peace. </p>
<p>The "P" (proliferation) command provides the
following screen.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/stpro.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>For simplicity's sake, if we assume that the
only feature that changes is the number of nations, and that
each nation is effectively equally peaceful with a proclivity
to initiate one nuclear use, on average, once every 295 years
(as it was in the first screen snapshot), then we can see,
using the "Base Case Comparison" in the above
that:</p>
<!--mstheme--></span><!--msthemelist--><!--mstheme--><span face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>This example is of interest because during the Cold War
there were approximately an average 5 nuclear weapon nations.
Now there are about 9. If there were further proliferation,
there could be as many as 13. With this, we have the
beginnings of "Past, Present, and Future" analysis.
The program also offers other ways to analyze proliferation,
but this screen gives us a good starting point. </p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Specific Nations<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>On the initial Main Screen the upper four small
windows showed the "average" values for all
nations. If we want to see what a specific nation would have
to deliver then we just click on the <strong>name</strong> of
the nation, in this case China, then the upper four windows
are bordered in blue. And, the upper windows display the
specific subcomponent values China would have to maintain to
support its 450 RL. You will see that these values are higher
than they were in the first Main Screen, where it was only
necessary to support a 295 RL, instead of the 450 RL required
by China. </p>
<p>Though China might not deliver the precise subcomponents
shown, we would know that that it would have to deliver some
combination that would ultimately produce a 450 RL and we can
experiment with different values to see the ranges of
performances that would need to be met. </p>
<p>By changing subcomponent values for China, we can also
see how much a specific value in a single nation (say,
deterrence, since that is such a popular topic) would
influence median years of nuclear peace world wide. This
feature is especially useful for analyzing policies that are
geared to a specific nations.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Public Health Risk, Deaths per 100,000<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>In terms of public health, the lethality of a
disease can be measured in annual deaths per 100,000 population. By making
comparisons between death rates for different public health
risks, we can get a sense of the relative severity of the
risks that a population as a whole would face. </p>
<p>For example, AIDS and Heart Diseases are measured in
deaths per 100,000 per year. We can also compare nuclear
weapon risks to other known health risks by using the deaths
per 100,000 per year method, as is done in the following
graph, which is activated by the "D" (Death)
command.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/dth.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center>
<p>The curve represents the average risk during the median
years to occurrence for attacks of specific sizes and for
worldwide levels of peacefulness (Composite Reluctance
Level). The mouse arrow at the graph line points to the 295
RL that we have discussed. If the shown number of deaths
worldwide would occur, because of nuclear attacks, then
nuclear weapons would present a worldwide risk at least as
great as AIDS, and in the recipient nation the national death
rate would be much higher. </p>
<p>The present graph line spells out the minimum
requirements placed on nations, if nuclear weapons are to
present a worldwide risk no greater than AIDS. </p>
<p>By clicking on the graph, when running the Nukefix
program, the graph line is automatically repositioned at the
point where you click. Thus, it can illustrate comparisons
with other diseases also. </p>
<p>It is well to note that since 1914, "small"
wars (those less than a million deaths) have been responsible
for only 12% of war deaths, civilian and military. It is the
Mega-Death wars that have caused fully 88% of war deaths
[<cite><a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html">Forecast and Solution</a>,</cite> p. 127]. For this
reason, reducing the effects of large wars, especially
nuclear wars, is apt to yield great public health benefit.
Prior to WWI only two Mega-Death wars had occurred -- a civil
war in China in the middle 1800s and Genghis Khan's
destruction in the 1200s. Mega-Death wars are a creature of
the 20th century. </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><span color="#003333">Buckle your seat belts. The News is
This.<br>Simultaneous Detonations: Firestorms<!--mstheme--></span></h2>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The "M" (Multiple Blasts) Command<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>Bernard Lown has observed: "Few societies
are more susceptible to the malevolent consequences of a
nuclear detonation than rich, urbanized, highly developed,
industrial countries." </p>
<p>This is true for reasons that few suspect. </p>
<p>For example, a 3+ psi (pounds per square inch static
overpressure) destruction indicates that total deaths would
be approximately equal to 56% of the average population in
the 3+ psi area. Wood-framed buildings would receive heavy
destruction, even at the outermost 3 psi limits. Destruction
would become more intense as one approached ground zero. </p>
<p>It is widely known that a single primitive 20 Kt nuclear
weapon (approximately the size used at Nagasaki) would
produce 8.04 square miles of 3+ psi destruction (when the
altitude of the blast is set to maximize 3.5+ psi
destruction.). </p>
<p>From this we can easily calculate that detonating eight
individual 20 Kt weapons would produce 64 square miles of 3+
psi destruction [64.3=8x8.04]. This is the same area of 3+
psi destruction that would occur upon detonating one 475 Kt
thermonuclear weapon. </p>
<p>On this basis, we are able to know that, at the absolute
minimum, eight individual low-tech 20 Kt nuclear weapons are
capable of producing a level a level of destruction equal to
a large thermonuclear weapon (475 Kt). </p>
<p>Now let's consider the potential consequences of
SIMULTANEOUSLY DETONATING a pattern of eight nuclear weapons.
I have not seen simultaneous nuclear air bursts discussed, or
even hinted at, in the open literature, but too many of their
effects are too obvious to ignore them. </p>
<p>As you would be able to experiment with when running
Nukefix [using the "See" button in the
"M" command as shown below], when eight low-tech 20
Kt nuclear weapons are detonated simultaneously in an
encirclement pattern (5 mile radius, 4.3 miles between zero
points in a circle) in a high population density urban area,
at least as much destruction would tend to be produced as
with a single one megaton thermonuclear weapon. The reason
for this is firestorms and the interaction of blast forces.
</p>
<p>A one megaton weapon would cause 105 square miles of 3+
psi destruction. With firestorms, the 20 Kt encirclement
pattern can readily envelope 105 square miles in total
destruction, leaving no escape for the inhabitants. At a
population density of 12,000 per square mile the 20 Kt
encirclement pattern might well produce 53% more deaths than
a single one megaton weapon, which is to say, approximately
1,082,884 deaths with 20 Kt encirclement versus approximately
708,426 deaths with a one-megaton blast. </p>
<p>A widespread shortcoming in the available literature is
that it fails to indicate the consequences of multiple
nuclear weapon detonations, most particularly SIMULTANEOUS
detonations in encirclement patterns. </p>
<p>By activating the "M" (Multiple Blasts) command
you can see these consequences. For example, the capabilities
of France are shown below.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mfran.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>When running Nukefix, the following screen [in
this case for France with a 160 Kt average weapon size] would
appear after clicking on the "See" shown above. The
"Color Heat" button on that screen is ONE OF THE
MOST USEFUL IN THE PROGRAM. It illustrates the thermal energy
that would be sufficient to ignite items at points which are
in line of sight of the contributing weapons in a
SIMULTANEOUS DETONATION. <a name="simultaneous">
 </a> </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/mseefran3.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>The Legend indicates the areas in which the
following can be ignited: Leaves [dry beech leaves, 4-6
Cal/cm sq], Shades [cotton muslin green window shades, 8
oz/sq yd, 7-13 Cal/cm sq], Rubber [black rubber construction
material, 10-20 Cal/cm sq], and Shirt [Khaki colored cotton
shirt, 3 oz/sq yd, 14-21 Cal/cm sq] [See: Glasstone and
Dolan, <cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons,</cite> pp.
287-289. The thermal flux, Cal/cm sq, in this paragraph
indicates the ignition range required by weapons from 35
kilotons to 1.4 megatons]. </p>
<p>The flash from the initial simultaneous blast would be
sufficient to ignite these respective items. Not all such
items will be ignited because at least some fires will be
blown out by the blast wave. However, others will not, and
these will tend to spread. At Hiroshima (12.5 Kt), the
approximate area characterized here by rubber was involved in
a firestorm. <a name="350to800">
 </a> </p>
<p>Note that, in the Nukefix program, whatever pattern you
select will be applied to the "encirclement number of
weapons (EncWep)," when you access the "War-Room
Plans" page. That section of the program scans and sorts
the population densities for the entire world, so that you
can see how many weapons are required to destroy specified
areas of different countries. </p>
<p>For example, it takes only 354 to 800 Russian warheads to
destroy every city and town in the United States that has a
population density in excess of 1,000 people per square mile
(urban and metropolitan USA, 36.3% of the U.S. population, 94
million people) ["War-Room Plans" in Nukefix].
Thus, it's not difficult to see that the highly-publicized,
much-applauded, and the yet-to-be-ratified START II treaty
levels of 3,000 to 3,500 intercontinental warheads mounted on
missiles or aircraft by the year 2007 (roughly a decade from
now) offer little protection. Only 10% of these numbers of
weapons hitting cities would produce unprecedentedly
appalling destruction. Moreover, the number of warheads now
existing are far higher. </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The effects of simultaneous detonations have grave
implications.<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
<p>Although the high-tech aspects of the physics of a single
weapon usually receive greatest attention, the physics
involved in a confluence of blast forces and thermal energy
from multiple weapons simultaneously detonating can be made
to present far greater destruction in an urban environment
than can single thermonuclear weapons of the sizes that
currently predominate. </p>
<p>If eight 20 Kt nuclear weapons were detonated
SIMULTANEOUSLY in an encirclement pattern over a city, it is
likely that they would produce at least as much destruction
as a one megaton nuclear blast. And, they definitely could
produce the equivalent of 475 Kt of destruction, even if they
were not simultaneously detonated. </p>
<p>Fully 87% of the thermonuclear weapons in the U.S.
strategic arsenal are smaller than 475 Kt, and a small
percentage are as large as one megaton. Approximately 58% of
Russia's strategic nuclear weapons are about 500-550 Kt in
size. Thus, we can see that small nations, or even highly
advanced terrorist groups, could have the potential to
produce vast thermonuclear levels of destruction (equivalent
to 475 Kt to one megaton) when attacking cities. </p>
<p>It further means that many thousands of
"tactical" nuclear weapons in superpower arsenals
can similarly be used to create levels of destruction
formerly attributed only to "strategic" nuclear
weapons. And, "strategic" warheads can be made to
be even more deadly via simultaneous detonations. </p>
<p>You can readily see the magnitude of destruction produced
by nuclear weapons of all sizes, including those used in
simultaneous detonations in encirclement patterns. To do so,
in the "M" command, click on the "See"
button. </p>
<p><strong>The myth perpetuated throughout the nuclear era
that thermonuclear levels of destruction in cities are
available only to advanced, rich nuclear powers is a fraud.

<center><p><br>THE "RADIUS" BUTTON </p>
</center><p>By clicking on the "Radius" button in
Nukefix, a graph like the following will appear showing psi

<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">War-Room Plans<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>One of the greatest problems for the non-expert,
who may be seriously interested in the nuclear weapons
problem, is to figure out what number of nuclear weapons will
targeters allocate to destroy cities. We can determine quite
a lot without having to enter their war-planning rooms.</p>
<p>The following screen snapshot is taken from the
"War-Room Plans" page in Nukefix. The particular
example shown illustrates the number of 550 kt warheads
Russia would need to destroy the indicated population
centers. </p>
<p>The initiating nation, in this instance Russia, can be
selected in the "M" (Multiple Blasts) command.
Substantially any nation that had the same encirclement
profile and size of warheads (550 kt) would produce an
identical outcome.</p>
<p><strong>"EncWep"</strong> refers to the number
of warheads required to subject the total area under
consideration to the same degree of destruction caused by the
encirclement pattern, in this case, when the zero point
distance is set at 15.6 miles as can be set up in the
"M" command under the "See" button.</p>
<p><strong>"MaxWep" </strong>refers to the maximum
number of warheads required to subject the total area under
consideration to 3 psi+ destruction. This is the same single
warhead targeting used in the "M" command.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/target.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>The particular page shown here indicates the
outcome for Britain and China, if 550 kt warheads were
detonated in the indicated regions. </p>
<p>For example, it would take approximately 35 to 78.3
warheads (550 kt) to destroy every population center in
Britain with a population density of 1,500, or more, per
square mile. We can also see that 22.1 million people (39.2%
of the British population) live in this area. </p>
<p>And, in China it would require approximately 1,292 to
2,887 warheads to destroy every region with a population
density of 1,500, or more, per square mile (510 million
people, 40% of the Chinese population reside in the
area).</p>
<p>In Nukefix, you can readily make similar estimates for
numerous other nations. Each page is sorted according to
population density for all nuclear weapon nations and many
non-nuclear nations. The attacking nation and its weapon
configuration can be setup in the "M" (Multiple
Blasts) command. So this, and similar pages in the
"War-Room Plans" section, will change according to
the data you enter. By this method you can make reasonable
first approximations for each nuclear weapon nation without
having to go through tedious calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Table Headings,</strong> An Explanation: </p>
<p>The <strong>"Regions"</strong> heading refers
to the number of reporting regions. </p>
<p><strong>"Dense"</strong> refers to minimum
population densities for the area under consideration. It is
expressed here in density per square mile but can be
expressed in kilometers if you mate that selection in the
"M" command. </p>
<p><strong>"AvgDen"</strong> refers to the average
density for the indicated region and for all more heavily

<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The Probability of Nuclear Winter/Autumn<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>There are numerous factors that must be
considered before we know what size attack is sufficient to
provoke a serious enough climate change that it could be
classified as a nuclear winter/autumn, some of which are
dealt with on the "Nuclear Winter/Autumn" page in
Nukefix. </p>
<p>Cutting to the chase: There are various gradations of
nuclear winter that probably can be associated with
initiating attacks of specific sizes. For example, an
aggressor attack producing 100+ million direct deaths might
well be sufficient to provoke a nuclear winter/autumn of a
designated level of severity. Or, alternatively, one might
find that an aggressor attack of 200+ million would be
needed.</p>
<p>In the following Nukefix graph you can enter whatever
attack size you are interested in. And, in the upcoming
"U" (Ultimate) command, you can define the
underlying probabilities for the entire range of attack sizes
for each nuclear weapon nation. </p>
<p>On Nukefix's "Nuclear Winter/Autumn" page, we
see aggressor attacks of 100+ million direct deaths (not
counting retaliation, etc.) would tend to occur within
approximately a median 115 years, given the conditions at
startup. While this may seem to be a long time, an attack of
this size can readily occur earlier, as can be seen in the
upcoming graph. For example, as the graph shows, there would
be, with startup data, roughly a one in five chance (20%) of
a nuclear attack producing 100+ million deaths within 37
years. And, at the upper end of the graph, we find a 95%
probability of an event of this scale within the next 500
years. When running Nukefix, you can also see the expected
outcome when the number of superpower nuclear warheads are
reduced.</p>

 </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The Ultimate, the "U" Command<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>There are numerous nuclear nations. And there
are numerous attacks of different sizes that each of these
nations can deliver. For each size attack there is also a
different probability of its ever actually being initiated.
In some nations the range of attack sizes may go from less
than a million deaths to conceivably more than a billion
deaths in the most extreme cases. </p>
<p>In order to account for outcomes, which go from the
probable to the highly improbable, this program introduces
the concept of Reluctance Level (RL) Curves for each nation.
This allows you to get answers you have not had access to
before. In the "U" (Ultimate) command, you can
readily set each nation's RLs throughout the range. </p>
<p>RL Curves offer the two ingredients necessary to
determine the expected risk of death posed by each nation: 1)
probability of occurrence (RL), and 2) severity of occurrence
(i.e., scale of death). </p>
<p>The RL Curves, further, offer the ability to make
reasonable estimates for a wide range of occurrences, because
probability (RL) in the upcoming graphs is defined in terms
of a nation initiating the stated size attack, OR ANY ATTACK
OF A LARGER SIZE. Thus, one does not have to consider each
size attack individually. A few broad groupings are all that
is required to make a good estimate of risk. </p>
<p>For example, in Nukefix when we access the "U"
(Ultimate) command we can get the following reluctance level
curve for France, which shows that France under the shown
conditions would produce, over the long term, a risk of
inflicting 97,041 deaths per year in attacks that it would
have a probability of initiating. It is also possible to
explore other outcomes by simply clicking on the graph to
change the shape of the curve. However, in the real world
nations would have to meet those reliabilities. And I point
out that France is already represented as being very
peaceful.</p>

 </p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The proof/method for determining expected deaths per
year<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>In Nukefix, clicking on the "DPY
Method" button would produce the upcoming graph, which
illustrates how one can determine death rate. </p>
<p>But it well to first consider the matter in prose.
Indeed, without performing the math, the method is
intuitively obvious. Consider that each point on the curve
represents the probability of a stated size attack and all
larger attacks. Given two adjacent points on the curve, if
the smaller of the two probabilities is subtracted from the
larger, all that remains is the probability associated with
the smaller size attack. When this is done for each point on
the curve, then all probabilities of occurrence have been
identified, and, as indicated, computation of expected death
per year is quite easy. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/u2fran.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>The math can be performed in the following
manner: The "expected deaths per year" caused by
the aggressor/initiator's attack (DPY) are determined by
multiplying each incremental probability (the difference in
probability at adjacent points on the curve) by the
corresponding level of death indicated on the x-axis, and
adding the sum of these values to the high-end RL probability
multiplied times its corresponding level of death. Simply
stated, the method accounts for all probability levels and
all sizes of attack for all nations -- which, incidentally,
come to 2,945 different cases. It can fully explain the total
probability attributed to an individual nation, and
axiomaticly conforms to mathematical expectation (i.e.,
multiplying probability times the severity of the event).
</p>
<p>By using these techniques, it is possible to know the
average risk of death when given specific RL curves. In these
cases, as seen in the "DPY Method" graph,
probabilities are the inverse of the RLs in question. </p>
<p>The DPY graph gives a practical demonstration of how the
method works, but since each adjacent point on the curve
cannot be graphically represented easily, a range with a
"weighted" average size attack is shown (even
though actual computation was performed for each point on the
curve). The expected deaths per year within the range
considered also applies to the RL curve. </p>
<center>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">The Composite Aggressor/Initiator Reluctance Level
Curve<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>In Nukefix the Reluctance Level Curves for the
individual nations are presented, then the Composite
Aggressor/Initiator Reluctance Level Curve is shown. </p>
<p>The RL curves for the individual nuclear weapon nations
combine to produce the Composite Aggressor/Initiator RL
Curve. This curve represents the average proclivities for a
single nuclear weapon nation to initiate attacks of the
stated size or larger.</p>
<p>If each of 9 equally capable nuclear weapon nations were
to possess these proclivities, they would present the same
total level of risk (2,369,886 DPY) as the present 9 nuclear
weapon nations. </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/comrl.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>By looking at the above curve one can clearly
see the levels of restraint required at each level during the
period under consideration, even if deterrence
"works." For example, at startup with 9 nations by
RIGHT clicking on the curve to get its values, one can see
that the curve passes through the following coordinates:
13,000 RL, 500+ million deaths; 5,000 RL, 329+ million
deaths; 2,175 RL, 200+ million deaths; 1,500 RL, 100+ million
deaths; 500 RL, 6.7+ million deaths; 320 RL 1+ million
deaths. </p>
<p>If an advocate of deterrence had seen such a curve, he or
she might well have been tempted to comment, "See
deterrence works. Look at the very high levels of restraint
that each nation, on average, is presenting. Don't you see
that this curve supports the respected political scientist
Kenneth Waltz's statements in 1988 and 1993 that, 'the
probability of major war among states having nuclear weapons
approaches zero [<cite>Forecast &amp; Solution,</cite> p.
13].'"</p>
<p>Yet, in sharp contrast to such optimism, the curve
reflects a public health menace that, over the long term,
would tend to produce 2,369,886 deaths per year. Indeed, if
so-called deterrence were to contain risk of death to low
levels, of say, roughly 23,699 deaths per year, its RL values
would, on average, need to be fully 100 times higher, as can
be seen in the same graph by setting Composite RL on the main
screen to 29,500 at startup [23,699=2,369,886/100;
29,500=295*100].</p>
<p>The Composite RL Curve provides a sound theoretical
approach that systematically accounts for probability and
severity of occurrence in wars. The curve provides an
alternative to idiosyncratic analyses that often focus on one
war (or type of war) at a time, but which do little to
explain the likelihood of, the consequences of, or the
methods for preventing future wars. </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><span color="#006666">The United States, Hit By Risk<!--mstheme--></span></h2>
</center><p>Previous sections of Nukefix have provided ways
to assess the average deaths per year (DPY) created by
nuclear weapon nations. The upcoming worksheet makes it
possible to evaluate how that risk would tend to be
distributed among individual nations. </p>
<p>Specifically, if you are a citizen of the United States
(or any other nuclear power), you can easily assess the
public health risk that nuclear weapons pose for you.</p>
<p>In the upper section of the worksheet, the highlighted
percentage figures indicate the percent of DPY received by
each nation. The values shown at startup are arbitrary. By
clicking on them, you can easily change them, according to
your own assessment. </p>
<p>The vertically positioned nations at the top of the
worksheet refer to the initiating nations that developed the
risk. Each column, for the particular initiating nation,
reflects how the percentages of risk are distributed among
nations. These percentages sum to 100%, and the user can
readily change them. </p>
<p>The rows show the nations receiving the risk. The red
horizontal lines are intended to make the rows easier to
read. The red lines do not imply groupings of nations. The
nations are alphabetically listed. </p>
<p>At the bottom section of the worksheet the "DPY
Delivered", "DPY Received", and "Deaths
per 100,000 received" are shown. The "DPYs
Delivered" are substantially the same as are indicated
in the "U" command graphs, except that in the
worksheet 10 nuclear weapon nations are always shown (not 9
nations as at startup, or a fewer nations as the user can
select on the main screen). </p>
<p>The "DPYs Received" result from the "DPYs
Delivered" for each nuclear nation being multiplied by
the percentage figures at the top of the worksheet and the
results summed. </p>
<p>Risk for "Deaths per 100,000" are calculated
based on the population of the recipient nation and its
"DPY Received." Since the category
"non-nuclear" nation can refer to several different
nations of various population sizes, no "Deaths per
100,000" are shown for this category. Nation-X
substantially refers to Iran.</p>
<p>In the worksheet in the "Deaths per 100,000"
column you will see a comparable public health risk, such as
"Heart Disease at 287" deaths per 100,000
population listed. Sometimes this text (for example,
"Total Worldwide War Deaths for WWI and WWII combined at
66.8") is cropped short, where space did not permit its
full listing. But these public health risks can be found
fully-listed via the "D" (Death) command in
Nukefix. </p>
<p>The "U" command graphs for the RL Curves showed
the expected deaths per year (DPY) that each nuclear weapon
nation would produce under the illustrated conditions. Those
DPYs would ultimately be received by other nations. This is
explicitly shown. At the bottom of the worksheet, Total
"DPY Delivered" equals total "DPY
Received." </p>
<center><p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/riskhit.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p><strong>"HIT BY RISK" WORKSHEET #1,
WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE UNITED STATES:</strong> We can also
tell a great deal about the relative risk of nuclear weapons
deaths to which the U.S. is now exposed in the post-Cold War
era. For example, the worksheet at startup shows the U.S.
having approximately a 246 death rate per 100,000 (a rate
between Cancer at 206 and Heart Disease at 287). </p>
<p>In 1945 the United States experienced its highest death
rate from war during any 50 year period in its history (WWI
and WWII). Its war deaths then averaged 6.8 deaths per
100,000 [<a href="http://www.nukefix.org/forecast.html">F&amp;S</a>, p. 129]. <strong>The risk to the U.S. of
nuclear weapons deaths from initiating attacks alone, at a
246 rate, is fully 36 TIMES GREATER THAN THE U.S. WAR-TIME
CONDITIONS DURING THE WWI/WWII PERIOD</strong>
[36.1=246/6.8]. Yet, this high risk is occurring in a
post-Cold War era that is ostensibly viewed by most of the
public as being substantially peaceful.</p>
<p>In the management of nations, the precise difficulty is
that a risk level, such as Cancer or Heart Disease, which we
are accustomed to in our own lives, becomes unacceptably
catastrophic when we allow the same level of risk to occur in
the nuclear weapons problem. While we cannot know with
precision when the event will occur, if the United States
were to experience a 682,937 "DPY Received," as
suggested in the worksheet at startup, then at 20, 40, or 60
year intervals, it would be perfectly logical for it to
experience nuclear attacks causing respectively 13.6, 27.3,
or 40.9 million deaths at these intervals [20, 40, and 60
multiplied by 682,937].</p>
<p>We can also view the net effect of the nuclear weapons
system for each particular nation in the case presented. For
example, in the screen snapshot we see the United States
delivering 555,372 deaths per year on average, yet receiving
638,937 deaths per year. The net disadvantage for the United
States in this case would be 83,565 deaths per year 83,565=
638,937 - 555,372. The risk received was greater than the
risk developed.</p>
<center><h2><!--mstheme--><span color="#006666">Two of the objectives of arms limitations<br>are
to reduce risk of death and to forestall<br>or prevent large
scale attacks.<br>How well can arms limitations alone meet
these objectives?<!--mstheme--></span></h2>
</center><p>At the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis 37 years
ago Russia had approximately 481 strategic nuclear warheads.
</p>
<p>START II proposes 3,000 to 3,500 deliverable strategic
warheads. START III proposes 2,000 to 2,500.</p>
<p><strong>"Hit By Risk" Worksheet #2</strong>
shows expected outcomes, other things being equal, at limits
from 10,700 to 50 warheads per nation. At each level of
warhead limits, estimated risk of death worldwide, and for an
individual nation (which you can select), are shown in terms
of deaths per year (DPY) and average deaths per 100,000
population. When considering low levels of nuclear warheads,
keep in mind that a single Trident submarine has 192 warheads
(24 missiles, 8 warheads per missile).</p>
<p>For attacks of 100+ and 200+ million deaths, estimated
median years to occurrence and years within which there would
be a one in five chance of occurrence (20%) are shown in
worksheet #2.</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">This is one of the most important sections of
the program.<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
<p><img src="http://www.nukefix.org/pixx/riskhit2.gif" width="644" height="484">
 </p>
</center><p>At startup conditions, with 10 nations, we see
that, so long as warhead limits are at 2,000 or higher, risk
of death caused by nuclear weapons tends to be in excess of
approximately 150 deaths per 100,000 for the United States.
And, worldwide it tends to be in excess of approximately 26.1
deaths per 100,000 population annually.</p>
<p>Moreover, worldwide, at the 2,000 level, there would tend
to be a one in five chance of a nuclear attack of 100+
million deaths occurring within 44.5 years. Not until
warheads get to very low levels, such as 50 per nation on the
worksheet is the risk of 100+ million death attacks
substantially eliminated. Attacks of 200+ million deaths
become very unlikely in the near term once warheads reach a
250 limit.</p>
<p>You can explore numerous other scenarios. Those that
typically are most beneficial, not only reduce the number of
warheads, but also reduce probability (RL) on the main
screen, or in the RL Curves in the "U" command. You
can also change percentages for DPY distribution on worksheet
#1 to reflect your personal assessment of real-world
conditions.</p>
<p>With startup conditions and 10 nations selected, the
citizens of the nuclear superpowers, Russia and the United
States, receive approximately 5.4 to 6.1 times the risk of
aggressor-caused death by comparison to the average person on
earth [5.4=217/40.4; 6.1=246/40.4]. At a worldwide death rate
of 40.4 per 100,000 annually, aggressor-caused nuclear weapon
deaths (not counting retaliation and secondary deaths) would
be substantially identical to the worldwide risk posed by all
sides in the WWII era at 40.3 deaths per 100,000.</p>
<p>Based on startup data, we see in worksheet #2 that, other
things being equal, dramatic reductions in risk of death do
not usually tend to occur until nations drop to very low
levels of warheads. There are two key reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, nuclear warheads, even at low levels, have
phenomenal death dealing properties. Second, the average
lethality of individual warheads increases as number of
warheads are reduced, because, on average, warheads are
targeted on higher density populations. The marginal deaths
at the periphery are substantially removed.</p>
<p>This increased lethality as warheads are reduced is
evident when one considers the second worksheet in the
"T" (Treaty) command, the "War-Room
Plans", or Tsipis' study of a "small" 239
warhead attack on the United States (Nukefix, page 3).</p>
<center><h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">Worksheet #2:<br>START II -- 3,500. What Does it
Mean?<br>A Risk Equal to Cancer?<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
</center><p>At a 10,700 warhead limit the U.S. would tend to
experience a 245 nuclear weapons death rate per 100,000 (a
rate between Cancer at 206 and Heart Disease at 287). </p>
<p>Based on startup conditions in worksheet #2, it appears
that it would be fraudulent to proclaim START II levels at
3,500 intercontinental warheads mounted on missiles or
aircraft by the year 2007, are sufficient to dramatically
reduce risk of nuclear weapon deaths. Under Nukefix's
baseline conditions with 10 nations selected, the "Hit
By Risk" pages shows that a 3,500 warhead limit (by
comparison to a 10,700 limit) only reduce the risk of nuclear
weapons death by about 23% for the United States. </p>
<p>This reduction would leave the U.S. with a long-term
average 522,699 aggressor-caused direct nuclear weapon deaths
and an average nuclear weapon death rate of 188 annually per
100,000 population. Thus, START II could readily present the
U.S. with a risk of nuclear weapons deaths that would be
fully 91% as great as the risk of death by Cancer [91%=188
nuclear rate/ 206 Cancer rate.]</p>
<p>However, the shock impact for nuclear attack is far more
adverse than Cancer deaths because in the nuclear case the
522,699 deaths per year are expressed infrequently at
intervals of, for example, 20, 40, or 60 years respectively
producing 10.5, 20.9, 31.4 million deaths at each event
[10.5, 20.9, 31.4 million = 20, 40, or 60 times 522,699].
Moreover, at a START II limit of 3,500 warheads, there would
also remain a one in five chance worldwide of an attack of
greater than 100 million deaths within 40.2 years.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><span color="#003300">In summary, a 3,500 START II warhead limit in the
post-Cold War era may well have a propensity to present a
risk of death for the United States nearly as great as one of
the top public health risks: Cancer. And, worldwide the
chance of enormous attacks of 100+ million deaths would
remain a serious threat. In the spirit of "The Emperor
Wears No Clothes," what on earth are the militaries,
governments, and arms control experts thinking?<!--mstheme--></span></h3>
<center><h2><!--mstheme--><span color="#006666">The Logic of Nukefix.<!--mstheme--></span></h2>
</center><p>A contribution, unique to Nukefix versions 2.02
and later, is that the program makes it possible in the
post-Cold War era for the user to assess and reduce the risk
that would be RECEIVED from aggressor-caused nuclear attacks
worldwide, by comparison to known public health risks (such
as Heart Disease, Cancer, etc.). In a nub, the logic used in
Nukefix can be followed quite precisely, as shown in the
following. </p>
<p><strong>Risk Produced:<br></strong>The risk produced is
established by evaluating destructive capabilities of
warheads, using Nukefix's "M" (Multiple Blasts)
command. The results from that section of the program can be
validated using a publicly available computer program
prepared for <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Library/Nukesims.html">
 Director Defense Nuclear Agency (We.zip) </a> available
through The High Energy Weapons Archive. Then in the
"War-Room Plans", extensive worldwide population
densities for nations where the warheads would potentially be
delivered is used to assess the maximum size attacks that
individual nations would be capable of producing. </p>
<p>For the superpowers, the annual probability of initiating
maximum size attacks is represented as being minuscule. But
having established an expected maximum size attack, the user
(using Nukefix's "U" command) can define the
probability for all size attacks, from the smallest to the
largest, that each nation could potentially carry out. The
Reluctance Curves that are established in this fashion show
the estimated restraint each nation would exercise before
initiating nuclear attacks of the different available sizes.
</p>
<p>The "U" (Ultimate) command uses each size
attack, and its associated probability, for each nation to
compute the long-term expected deaths per year produced by
that nation. The program then sums these figures to get
worldwide risk. Expressing long-term nuclear weapons risk in
terms of deaths per year serves to illustrate the expected
public health risk, as is done with Cancer, Heart Disease, et
cetera. It also provides a single currency by which the risk
presented by "small" and "large" nuclear
powers can be compared. The user can either accept the
baseline case presented in Nukefix at startup, or alter the
component values to preference via mouse clicks and simple
entries. At this point in the program the risk produce is
established. </p>
<p><strong>Risk Received:<br></strong>On the "Hit By
Risk" page, the user in worksheets #1 and #2 can see the
degree to which individual nations would tend to RECEIVE that
risk. The "Hit By Risk" worksheet #1 shows a grid
of percentages for the ten nations producing the risk and the
same ten (plus a category for non-nuclear nations) receiving
the risk. By identifying potential adversaries for each
nation and assigning a percent of its produced risk that
would be received in each potentially adversarial nation, the
user can find the risk RECEIVED for each nation. </p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>When performing initial hardware analysis and recon, I have become very fond of using Armbian-based single-board computers (SBCs) for things like UART, SPI, I2C, JTAG, and SWD. One of the main benefits of using one of these boards is that since the peripherals we are interested in&nbsp;are&nbsp;exposed&nbsp;as character devices in Linux, a wide variety of tools are available for interfacing with them, including most programming and scripting languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, one of the biggest hurdles that stop people from using an Armbian-based device is the initial setup and configuration (not to mention availability!). It takes more time to configure an Orange Pi or Raspberry Pi and enable the various interfaces than&nbsp;plug&nbsp;in an FTDI to your Linux machine. This blog post will help break down some of those barriers and streamline the setup process for those looking to learn hardware hacking with a Linux SBC.</p>

<p>With this blog post, we’ll introduce the PiFex, a basic companion board for the Raspberry Pi designed to teach users the basics of hardware hacking and embedded protocols. We will then demonstrate how to use the PiFex to access a JTAG tap on an undocumented SSD, allowing memory reads and GDB access to the SSD CPU.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The design and software for the PiFex will be open-sourced&nbsp;in the coming months as we continue our final rounds of testing</p>

<h2 id="background-information">Background Information</h2>

<p>&nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with JTAG at a low level, you might want to read my <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/jtag-hdd/">previous</a> blog post about reverse engineering JTAG taps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="pifex-an-overview">PiFex: An Overview</h2>

<p>The Pi Interface Explorer or PiFex, is a simple hat for a Raspberry Pi designed for tinkerers and hardware hackers alike.&nbsp;By breaking out the commonly used interfaces and routing them through bi-directional level shifters, we aimed to streamline some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;initial steps when reverse engineering a new device or&nbsp;trying to learn&nbsp;how a new sensor works.&nbsp;While this device&nbsp;was initially designed&nbsp;for use during our <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hhb.html">hardware hacking bootcamp</a> it has quickly become my go-to when performing initial hardware assessments of COTS devices.</p>

<p>The PCB is well documented, and the IO pins are all labeled as shown in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/pifex.JPG" alt="Pifex Overview"></p>

<p>We also have added an I2C OLED screen, which you can customize using the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/jtag_id_clipped.jpg" alt="JTAG ID Clipped "></p>
<h2 id="pifex-hardware">PiFex: Hardware</h2>

<p>The PiFex exposes the following interfaces to the end user:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UART via <code>IO14</code> and <code>IO15</code></li>
  <li>SPI via <code>IO8</code>, <code>IO9</code>, <code>IO10</code> and <code>IO11</code></li>
  <li>I2C via <code>IO2</code> and <code>IO3</code></li>
  <li>JTAG via <code>IO2</code>,<code>IO3</code>,<code>IO14</code> and <code>IO15</code></li>
  <li>SWD via <code>IO9</code> and <code>IO11</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also an additional eight GPIO pins. These interfaces were chosen because they are the ones that we utilize in our hardware hacking training and are also the most likely to be used by tinkerers and hardware hackers for other projects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="logic-analyzer-connector">Logic Analyzer Connector</h2>

<p>When reverse engineering a target device or inspecting why your custom code controlling a specific peripheral isn’t working, a logic analyzer is your best friend. To help simplify the wiring for both our training and standard usage, we also added a logic analyzer connector.&nbsp;This&nbsp;was done&nbsp;to remediate potential wiring issues and make debugging and troubleshooting as easy as possible. An interface board&nbsp;was designed&nbsp;to connect to entry-level logic analyzers that can&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/la_connector.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/la_1.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/la_2.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>This&nbsp;helps streamline&nbsp;connecting&nbsp;a logic analyzer to the PiFex and&nbsp;analyzing&nbsp;the transmitted or monitored signals.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="level-shifters">Level Shifter(s)</h2>

<p>The Raspberry PI uses 3.3V logic levels, meaning it can only communicate with devices that use that same logic level. If we want to connect to a device that uses lower voltages (1.8V and 1.2V are becoming increasingly common), we need to route those through a level shifter.&nbsp;To streamline this and help reduce issues with&nbsp;wiring&nbsp;during our training, we’ve added two&nbsp;onboard level&nbsp;shifters.</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/level_shifters.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We chose to use the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TXB0108">TXB0108 Bi-Directional level shifters</a>; these allow us to communicate with devices at a voltage below 3.3V. In the case where a different logic level is needed, the user can select whether to use an external voltage source for the input voltage using the <code>VCCA_IN</code> line on the exposed headers. The level shifter then references this voltage by toggling the selector switch at the top of the board to <code>VCCA_IN</code> as opposed to the default state, which is <code>3.3V</code>.</p>

<h2 id="pifex-software">PiFex: Software</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever had to set up a headless Raspberry Pi before, you know that it’s not always a simple task, and when performing remote training, we&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;assume that&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;will be able&nbsp;to manually configure their Pi to connect to their network.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is why we designed the PiFex image to use a USB-Ethernet gadget on startup to present an Ethernet device to the end user over USB. This results in an easy, predictable way to connect to the Pi. After plugging the Pi into their machine, all the user needs to do is set the IP address, and they are all set. A short video walking through the web interface can&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/multi.gif" alt="UART Startup Voltages"></p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, one of the initial hurdles when learning about embedded protocols is selecting what tool or interface you want to learn with. Embedded development boards like the Arduino series or STM32 series are great but require setting up a development environment and understanding the specifics of the target microcontroller. One of the benefits of using an embedded Linux board is that these interfaces are exposed via <code>/dev/</code> and can be accessed using many programming languages such as Python, Rust, C, and even bash.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</h2>

<p>Throughout our training, we utilize Jupyter Notebooks to help streamline the process and provide students with template notebooks for future assessments. For example, the JTAG notebook contains instructions and tooling to perform:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Scan Chain Detection via <code>go-jtagenum</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Example UrJTAG Python Bindings for low-level scan chain access</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Example OpenOCD configurations and Python bindings for scripting JTAG operations</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Screenshots of the included notebooks can&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/jtag-notebook-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/jtag.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/notebook-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>While in class, we will use all of these features on our target, and students will be able to copy this notebook and use the same tools and techniques for future targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, we’ve configured the PiFex image to allow access to standard tools such as SSH and FTP. Now that we’ve reviewed&nbsp;the PiFex’s&nbsp;features and intended use case, let’s reverse-engineer the JTAG TAP for an undocumented target!</p>

<h2 id="pifex-demo-1--jtag">PiFex Demo 1 : JTAG</h2>

<p>So, we’ve talked about our new hardware tooling. How about a demonstration of it in action? Let’s start with a low-cost SSD purchased on AliExpress.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/top_pcb_labelled.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After searching for datasheets, we were not able to locate much; however, next, we will investigate the mystery header at the end of the board. Let’s start by looking at this debug connector at the end of the drive. First, we will attempt to identify the ground connection. To do this, we will use our multimeter in continuity mode and test against a known ground. We will use the large copper fills to connect the SSD to an adapter board in this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/known_ground.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After performing this test, we determined that the following pin was ground.

<p>Now we need to determine what logic levels are in use; remember that the Pi uses a 3.3V logic level by default, so if there are other levels in use, we will need to locate a reference voltage for the level shifter. We will use the following pinout of the SSD for reference:</p>

<p>After measuring the voltages on the connector, we saw the following voltages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is extremely common for voltage sources to have capacitors connected to them called decoupling capacitors. These capacitors help stabilize the power supply in the event of voltage fluctuations. From here, there are two approaches that we can take to&nbsp;finding&nbsp;out which pins <strong>might</strong> be VCC on our SSD.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Note what pins&nbsp;are connected&nbsp;to large capacitors near the connector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor the voltage source on power up / power down</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the voltages we collected, we should monitor pins&nbsp;2,3,4,6,7,&nbsp;and \8 with the oscilloscope and see how they differ. Take a look at the images below and see if you can spot the different one:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/all_drops.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we examine the images highlighted in green below, we see a relatively sharp drop from high to low:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/digital_drops.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking closely at the images above, you may notice that image 1 has a slightly different shape when it rises and falls than the other lines.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is likely due to a capacitor being present somewhere on this line, which makes it a good candidate for VCC.&nbsp;This&nbsp;was pin two on the debug header, so we can now update our table as shown below.</p>

<p>We will connect to the SSD using the clips shown in the image below, these were also purchased on AliExpress.</p>

<p>With this assumption, we&nbsp;are left&nbsp;with six unknown pins. Next, we can perform a JTAG IDCODE scan using the <code>go-jtagenum</code> tools; this will attempt to brute force all of the possible JTAG pin combinations and will report back pin configurations that report a valid ID code or pass the bypass test. If you’re unfamiliar with these scans and want to learn more about them, check out my old writeup <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/jtag-hdd/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we move forward, let’s talk about the output&nbsp;that we’re seeing&nbsp;above. You’ll notice that <code>go-jtagenum</code> discovered what it believes to be multiple possible pin mappings, some of which contain more “devices” than others. While it is&nbsp;possible&nbsp;that there <strong>can</strong> be various devices on a JTAG scan chain, we know that this device is pretty straightforward and will not likely have 10+ devices.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is the one drawback of the <code>IDCODE</code> scan; it simply checks to see if data is changing** on the assumed <code>TDO</code> port, which can lead to many false positives. However, the entry displaying just one <code>IDCODE</code> value looks promising; we can further investigate this TAP using the <code>BYPASS</code> scan.</p>

<p>We can&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;verify these results with a bypass scan.&nbsp;The <code>BYPASS</code> scan attempts to leverage the <code>BYPASS</code> instruction of the JTAG TAP which directly links the <code>TDI</code> and <code>TDO</code> lines.&nbsp;The scan attempts to enter the <code>BYPASS</code> instruction, provides a unique bit pattern on <code>TDI</code>,&nbsp;and monitors for that same pattern on <code>TDO</code>.&nbsp;If the data sent on <code>TDI</code> matches what&nbsp;is read&nbsp;on <code>TDO</code>,&nbsp;then the scan has determined the correct pinout. The results of the BYPASS scan can&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

<div><pre><code>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We are not <strong>required</strong> to use the labeled JTAG pins on the PiFex for JTAG operations, they are configurable via OpenOCD.</p>

<p>So&nbsp;now&nbsp;that we know what the pins are, we need to use them to access the test access port (TAP) on the device. There is only one problem: we know our pins, but now we need to figure out how&nbsp;to actually use them. We can now write to the Instruction Register (IR) and Data Registers (DR), but without knowing <strong>what</strong> to write to them, knowing the JTAG pinout is largely useless. Before we move forward, we need to figure out two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What type of CPU is this?</li>
  <li>Can we use any open-source tools to interact with it?</li>
</ol>

<p>To determine what type of CPU we’re dealing with, we can start with the ID. We can extract this via a tool called UrJTAG.</p>

<h2 id="urjtag-for-reverse-engineers">UrJTAG for Reverse Engineers</h2>

<p><a href="http://urjtag.org/">UrJTAG</a> is an open-source tool designed for performing low-level JTAG operations. This tool allows one to programmatically read and write the instruction register and corresponding data registers when connected to a JTAG TAP. It&nbsp;was originally&nbsp;designed to enable developers to use other JTAG tooling besides those provided by the original component manufacturer. Because of this tool’s low-level instrumentation and introspection, it is also beneficial to us as reverse engineers when examining a new TAP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the data that we gathered from our previous scans, we can set up our cable in UrJTAG as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code>cable gpio tck=10 tdi=9 tms=14 tdo=15
</code></pre></div>

<p>This&nbsp;tells UrJTAG that we&nbsp;are connected&nbsp;to our target via GPIO pins on a Linux device; we then follow that with GPIO pin assignments for each JTAG signal. After defining our cable, we can run the <code>detect</code>,&nbsp;<code>idcode</code>,&nbsp;and <code>discover</code> commands, which will attempt to learn more about the TAP that it is connected to, resulting in the output above.</p>

<p>After running&nbsp;a UrJTAG&nbsp;scan, we now know the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many available DRs are present</li>
  <li>The width of all of the available&nbsp;DRs</li>
  <li>Confirmation of the CPU ID</li>
  <li>Confirmation of the JTAG pinout</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a lot of great information that we did not have at the beginning of this post, but what can we do with it? In order to read memory, set breakpoints, etc., we need to know more about how to interact with these registers. Without a datasheet, this is a difficult task. However, there are other open-source tools that we can leverage before attempting <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/attachments/1435_JTAG.pdf">black box reverse engineering of the JTAG TAP</a>.</p>

<h2 id="openocd-for-reverse-engineers">OpenOCD for Reverse Engineers</h2>

<p>Armed with this information, we can search the ID and determine that this chip uses the ARCompact architecture, and if we check the configuration files for OpenOCD, we can see this ID code in the following files:</p>

<div><pre><code>pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl/cpu/arc <span>$ </span><span>ls
</span>common.tcl em.tcl&nbsp;&nbsp;hs.tcl&nbsp;&nbsp;v2.tcl

<p>It looks like there is a few target file that uses these config files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>snps_hsdk</code></li>
  <li><code>snps_hsdk_4xd</code></li>
  <li><code>snps_em_sk_fpga</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do one more quick search before trying to write our&nbsp;own&nbsp;config file; if we search for the above config files, we find the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl/board <span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lathr</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>snps<span>*</span>
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 411 May 4 18:20 snps_hsdk_4xd.cfg
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 416 May 4 18:20 snps_hsdk.cfg
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 615 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v2.2.cfg
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 659 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v2.1.cfg
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 555 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v1.cfg
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 pi pi 612 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk.cfg
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of&nbsp;these config files are very straightforward and essentially import one of the three files&nbsp;located&nbsp;in the <code>target</code> folder.&nbsp;Taking some basic information from the target&nbsp;folder&nbsp;we will construct our own OpenOCD as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code>source&nbsp;[find cpu/arc/hs.tcl]
transport select jtag
# We don't know much about this CPU at the moment, until&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;we'll assume that
#&nbsp;it&nbsp;has one core that we will index at 0 and that the&nbsp;dbg
set _coreid 0
set _dbgbase 0
# CHIPNAME will be used to choose core family (600, 700 or EM). As far as
# OpenOCD is concerned EM and HS are identical.
set&nbsp;_CHIPNAME arc-em
set _TARGETNAME $_CHIPNAME.cpu
# Create the TAP using the information we extracted via UrJTAG and the IDCODE scan
jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME cpu -irlen 4 -ircapture 0x1 -expected-id 0x100434b1
# OpenOCD requires us to create a target for debugging the target; most of the&nbsp;
# provided arguments are variable names that we've already set up; however, we must&nbsp;
# specify the architecture; in this case we'll use ARCv2, the assumed architecture of&nbsp;
# this CPU
target create $_TARGETNAME arcv2 -chain-position $_TARGETNAME
# Next we configure our initial guesses for the coreid and base address for debug regions of memory
# We're not using these at the moment, but perhaps after further reversing, we'll learn more
# and can come back and update them
$_TARGETNAME configure -coreid 0
$_TARGETNAME configure -dbgbase 0
# Here, we are defining what to do when a reset event occurs
$_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-assert "arc_hs_reset $_TARGETNAME"
#&nbsp;The following two lines were pulled&nbsp;from the ARC-specific examples in OpenOCD&nbsp;
# These seem to be used across all ARCompact variants supported by OpenOCD
arc_hs_init_regs
$_TARGETNAME arc cache l2 auto 1
</code></pre></div>

<p>This file will let OpenOCD know what pins to use on the Raspberry Pi and the specifics&nbsp;about&nbsp;our target CPU. The following config file can be used to configure the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.</p>

<div><pre><code>source [interface/raspberrypi-native.cfg]

transport select jtag

adapter gpio tms -chip 0 14
adapter gpio tdi -chip 0 9

adapter speed 100
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we run OpenOCD using these config files as an argument, we see the following:</p>

<p>Success! It looks like we have connected to the JTAG TAP of this SSD using OpenOCD. Next, we will use this to read memory and single-step through the running firmware on the SSD itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="reading-memory-with-openocd">Reading Memory with OpenOCD</h3>

<p>Now that we have a working OpenOCD connection, we can read memory using the <code>mdw</code> and <code>dump_image</code> commands. We will dump a small region of memory as a test:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we’ll want to review this memory dump to make sure that it’s accurate.&nbsp;This&nbsp;creates an interesting problem: we don’t know what the memory contents will look like at address <code>0</code>, especially since we don’t have a datasheet or an example firmware image. In this case, we will start by running strings on the resulting binary; some of these results can&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

<div><pre><code>pi@voidstar:~/pifex/ssd-example $ strings mem-test.bin | less
02023042MS2295CAX--XYYYYYYYY

L^r|
%`)$5a94
SMISSDRetryTable
Device_FW_Authentication
xFW_MAC_Key
SM2259ROMCodeTagZZZZ
</code></pre></div>

<p>We’ve got human-readable strings, which is a great sign!&nbsp;We also have the&nbsp;part number for the CPU&nbsp;in these strings, which leads me to believe we’ve correctly extracted this memory region via OpenOCD.&nbsp;However, we need to learn more about this processor and what areas&nbsp;might&nbsp;interest us.&nbsp;We can figure this out using OpenOCD to attach to the target CPU via GDB.</p>

<h3 id="debugging-with-openocd">Debugging with OpenOCD</h3>

<p>Now that we have OpenOCD connected to our target, we can attempt to debug the target via GDB.&nbsp;However, this&nbsp;does not come without&nbsp;some strings attached; we will need to compile a version of GDB capable of targeting the ARCompact architecture.&nbsp;Luckily for us, the good folks over at Synopsis have released a port of binutils for the ARCompact architecture. We can clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/binutils-gdb">here</a> and build it on the Raspberry Pi (<strong>Note</strong>: see the appendix for instructions on how to build this software).</p>

<p>After building GDB and attempting to connect to the GDB server presented by OpenOCD, we see the following:</p>
<div><pre><code>(gdb) x/10i $pc

<p>Success! Using OpenOCD and GDB, we are able to single-step through the firmware and read register values. These register values tell us more about potential memory regions of interest that we can read out, specifically <code>0x50000000</code> and <code>0x10000000</code>. As a final test, we will load the area of memory we extracted initially into Ghidra and see if the instructions match what we see in GDB.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="loading-the-firmware-into-ghidra">Loading the Firmware into Ghidra</h3>

<p>While the current Ghidra release does not support ARCompact, a wonderful fork is being maintained <a href="https://github.com/niooss-ledger/ghidra">here</a>. We can build this and use it to analyze our firmware image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we look at offset <code>0</code> in the firmware image, we have what appears to be an interrupt vector table of some sort:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/ivt.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we look a little further at the image, we can see that there are some branch instructions for a region that&nbsp;we’ve not extracted yet.&nbsp;We also see that the two areas we previously identified (<code>0x50000000</code> and <code>0x10000000</code>) are&nbsp;being referenced&nbsp;as well. These are likely internal/external SRAM regions, while the area starting around <code>0x4007000</code> appears to be used as code.</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/interesting.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s&nbsp;try to&nbsp;extract that region, load it into our Ghidra database, and see if the results make sense.&nbsp;First, we’ll dump the region out using OpenOCD, as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code>dump_image 0x40070000.bin 0x40070000 0x100000
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can then import it into our Ghidra database, resulting in the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/jtag-pifex/imported_new_region.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong>&nbsp;It looks like we have code in this region, and it disassembles properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here, we now have the following primitives available to us on the SSD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memory R/W</li>
  <li>Control Flow Monitoring / Modifications</li>
  <li>Register Reads/Writes</li>
</ul>

<p>This puts one in a perfect position to do more software research, look for bugs or errors in their code, or even attempt to modify the firmware or reverse engineer the update process!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’ve read this far, thank you for taking the time to read it all. This probably should have been two separate posts!</p>

<p>With this blog post, we introduced the PiFex hardware and software tools. These tools utilize open-source software and commercial hardware to aid in embedded device assessments. We then demonstrated how to use these tools to discover and enumerate an undocumented JTAG TAP on an SSD. Using this TAP, we were able to read memory and control execution on the target, giving us full control over the device.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been working on Keygen for coming up on 8 years now (May 22nd, to <a href="https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api/commit/84e8ccc35ea4accaf45d8bf529ba554650465644">be exact</a>).
In that time, it's an understatement to say that I've learned a lot. One of the things I've
learned is that a lot of founders, myself included, ignore some pretty crucial business
metrics. One of those metrics that we'll be talking about today is <strong>time-to-convert</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first started Keygen, I did what everybody probably does and set up a 14-day free
trial. What I quickly found is that it's very hard for a potential customer to integrate
a software licensing API into their entire stack within a 14 days timeframe.</p>
<p>So I started offering free trial extensions. I'd push this on my pricing page, in onboarding
emails, in follow up emails, etc. I wanted to make potentional customers aware that
<em>they had more time.</em></p>
<p>What I found over the next couple years was that the majority of converting customers had
asked for a free trial extension. And out those that <em>did</em> and those that <em>didn't</em>, my
conversion rate was higher when they <em>did</em> ask for one.</p>
<p>Was there a reason <em>why</em> this was the case? Possibly!</p>
<p>When I extended a trial, I would require the potential customer to put a card on file
before I extended their trial. So we go from free trial without a card, to free trial
with a card. Much better.</p>
<p>You may be thinking — what does this have to do with time-to-convert?</p>
<p>We'll get there.</p>
<p>Anyways — after discovering that free trial extensions increase conversion rate, I started
personally sending emails to potentional customers that were nearing their trial's end to
offer a trial extension. This was a pretty big success.</p>
<p>So much of a success, actually, that I stopped being so strict about requiring a card be
put on file — mainly out of laziness — because it was such an annoying back-and-forth
step to do before extending a potential customer's trial.</p>
<p>Unintuitively to what I learned prior, this didn't hurt conversion rate (so that potential
reason for a higher conversion rate was moot).</p>
<p>I chugged along manually extending trials for a couple more years.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/how-i-replaced-baremetrics-and-chartmogul-with-rake/">I got fed up with limited metrics from Baremetrics and replaced it with a Rake task</a>.
I no longer use that Rake task (it didn't scale as my Stripe customer count grew), but through
that, I learned about my <strong>time-to-convert</strong>, which is a crucial business metric that remains
unknown to many, many founders (myself included at the time).</p>
<p>What is time-to-convert? It's the time it takes from a customer signing up to a customer
paying you. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>(For brevity, I'll refer to this metric as <strong>TTC</strong>.)</p>
<p>So why was this such a big deal?</p>
<p>Well, because my 14-day free trial didn't line up with the time it takes a customer to realize
value from Keygen — to get to that fork in the road where they can decide "is this worth
my money?"</p>
<p>I gave them 14 days to get to that fork.</p>
<p>But my p50 TTC is <em>41 days.</em> My p90, 130 days; p95, 198; p99, 290.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I realized that what I was <em>really doing</em> was asking people to sign up
<em>now</em> and complete a proof-of-concept integration <em>in 14 days.</em> This includes reading
documentation, onboarding, and planning and executing a proof-of-concept (PoC).</p>
<p>But my median TTC is 41 days!</p>
<p>That just doesn't work.</p>
<p>Understanding and integrating a new API can be a lot. On top of other projects, it can
end up being impossible to do in 14 days, from first discovery to being integrated
(or at least with a PoC in-hand).</p>
<p>What I was really asking potential customers to do was <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>Wait until they're ready to start understanding the API.</p>
<p>Wait until they're ready to go through onboarding.</p>
<p>Wait until the PoC is planned.</p>
<p>Wait until dev is freed up.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait. Wait.</p>
<p>What ends up happening is that people get busy and they end up seeing that 14 day
deadline, determine that they're not ready yet, so they bounce until they <em>are</em>
ready, but then <em>they never come back.</em></p>
<p>I decided that I needed to remove that friction. I wanted to capture these leads
as soon as they decide Keygen may be the solution for them. So ultimately, I can
start nurturing these leads.</p>
<p>So I did what every bootstrapper tells you to never do…</p>
<p>I added an unlimited trial, a.k.a. <em>a free tier.</em></p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<p>Overall sign ups increased, of course, as it always does with a free tier. But by
segmenting out users that stay on the free tier, I found paid sign ups also increased,
with conversion rate staying steady, but now with no manual work. I say that's a
win-win.</p>
<p>So, what's your TTC?</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

              How I Think About Debt
            
          </h2>
          
        </div>


  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  

  <section>
    <p>Japan has 140 businesses that are at least 500 years old. A few <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/business/japan-old-companies.html">claim</a> to have been operating continuously for more than 1,000 years.</p>

<p>It’s astounding to think what these businesses have endured – dozens of wars, emperors, catastrophic earthquakes, tsunamis, depressions, on and on, endlessly. And yet they keep selling, generation after generation.</p>

<p>These ultra-durable businesses are called “shinise,” and studies of them show they tend to share a common characteristic: they hold tons of cash, and no debt. That’s part of how they endure centuries of constant calamities.</p>

<p>I love the quote from author Kent Nerburn that, “Debt defines your future, and when your future is defined, hope begins to die.”</p>

<p>Not only does hope begin to die, but the number of outcomes you can endure does, too.</p>

<p>Let’s say this represents volatility over your life. Not just market volatility, but life world and life volatility: recessions, wars, divorces, illness, moves, floods, changes of heart, etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-04-30%20at%2012.17.40%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-30 at 12.17.40 PM.png"></p>

<p>With no debt, the number of volatile events you can withstand throughout life might fall within a range that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-04-30%20at%2012.08.17%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-30 at 12.08.17 PM.png"></p>

<p>A few extreme events might do you in, but you’re pretty durable.</p>

<p>With more debt, the range of what you can endure shrinks:</p>

<p><img src="https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-04-30%20at%2012.08.53%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-30 at 12.08.53 PM.png"></p>

<p>And with tons of debt, it tightens even more:</p>

<p><img src="https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-04-30%20at%2012.09.26%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-30 at 12.09.26 PM.png"></p>

<p>I think this is the most practical way to think about debt: <strong>As debt increases, you narrow the range of outcomes you can endure in life.</strong></p>

<p>That’s so simple. But it’s different from how debt is typically viewed, which is a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside is the cost of capital (the interest rate).</p>

<p>Two things are important when you view debt as a narrowing of endurable outcomes.</p>

<p>One is you start to ponder how common volatility is.</p>

<p>I hope to be around for another 50 years. What are the odds that during those 50 years I will experience one or more of the following: Wars, recessions, terrorist attacks, pandemics, bad political decisions, family emergencies, unforeseen health crises, career transitions, wayward children, and other mishaps?</p>

<p>One-hundred percent. <em>The odds are 100%</em>.</p>

<p>When you think of it like that, you take debt’s narrowing of survivable outcomes seriously.</p>

<p>The other is you think about the kinds of volatile events that could do you in.</p>

<p>Financial volatility is an obvious one – you find yourself unable to make your debt payments. But there’s also psychological volatility, where for whatever reason you can’t mentally endure your job any longer. There’s family volatility, which can be anything from divorce to caring for a relative. There’s child volatility, which could fill a book. Health volatility, political volatility, on and on. The world’s a wild place.</p>

<p>I’m not an anti-debt zealot. There’s a time and place, and used responsibly it’s a wonderful tool.</p>

<p>But once you view debt as narrowing what you can endure in a volatile world, you start to see it as a constraint on the asset that matters most: having options and flexibility.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">The appetite for alternative clouds has never been bigger.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/coreweave-which-provides-cloud-infrastructure-for-ai-training-secures-2-3b-loan/">CoreWeave</a>, the GPU infrastructure provider that began life as a cryptocurrency mining operation, this week raised $1.1 billion in new funding from investors including Coatue, Fidelity and Altimeter Capital. The round brings its valuation to $19 billion post-money, and its total raised to $5 billion in debt and equity — a remarkable figure for a company that’s less than ten years old.</p>
<p>It’s not just CoreWeave.</p>
<p>Lambda Labs, which also offers an array of cloud-hosted GPU instances, in early April secured a “special purpose financing vehicle” of up to $500 million, months after closing a $320 million Series C round. The nonprofit Voltage Park, backed by crypto billionaire Jed McCaleb, last October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/31/new-nonprofit-backed-by-crypto-billionaire-scores-ai-chips-worth-500m/">announced</a> that it’s investing $500 million in GPU-backed data centers. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/together-lands-102-5m-investment-to-grow-its-cloud-for-training-generative-ai/">Together AI</a>, a cloud GPU host that also conducts generative AI research, in March landed $106 million in a Salesforce-led round.</p>
<p>So why all the enthusiasm for — and cash pouring into — the alternative cloud space?</p>
<p>The answer, as you might expect, is generative AI.</p>
<p>As the generative AI boom times continue, so does the demand for the hardware to run and train generative AI models at scale. GPUs, architecturally, are the logical choice for training, fine-tuning and running models because they contain thousands of cores that can work in parallel to perform the linear algebra equations that make up generative models.</p>
<p>But installing GPUs is expensive. So most devs and organizations turn to the cloud instead.</p>
<p>Incumbents in the cloud computing space — Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure — offer no shortage of GPU and specialty hardware instances optimized for generative AI workloads. But for at least some models and projects, alternative clouds can end up being cheaper — and delivering better availability.</p>
<p>On CoreWeave, renting an Nvidia A100 40GB — one popular choice for model training and inferencing — costs $2.39 per hour, which works out to $1,200 per month. On Azure, the same GPU costs $3.40 per hour, or $2,482 per month; on Google Cloud, it’s $3.67 per hour, or $2,682 per month.</p>
<p>Given generative AI workloads are usually performed on clusters of GPUs, the cost deltas quickly grow.</p>
<p>“Companies like CoreWeave participate in a market we call specialty ‘GPU as a service’ cloud providers,” Sid Nag, VP of cloud services and technologies at Gartner, told TechCrunch. “Given the high demand for GPUs, they offers an alternate to the hyperscalers, where they’ve taken Nvidia GPUs and provided another route to market and access to those GPUs.”</p>
<p>Nag points out that even some big tech firms have begun to lean on alternative cloud providers as they run up against compute capacity challenges.</p>
<p>Last June, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/microsoft-inks-deal-with-coreweave-to-meet-openai-cloud-demand.html">reported</a> that Microsoft had signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with CoreWeave to ensure that OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and a close Microsoft partner, would have adequate compute power to train its generative AI models. Nvidia, the furnisher of the bulk of CoreWeave’s chips, sees this as a desirable trend, perhaps for leverage reasons; it’s said to have given some alternative cloud providers <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-nvidia-aids-cloud-rivals-of-aws-google-and-microsoft">preferential access</a> to its GPUs.</p>
<p>Lee Sustar, principal analyst at Forrester, sees cloud vendors like CoreWeave succeeding in part because they don’t have the infrastructure “baggage” that incumbent providers have to deal with.</p>
<p>“Given hyperscaler dominance of the overall public cloud market, which demands vast investments in infrastructure and range of services that make little or no revenue, challengers like CoreWeave have an opportunity to succeed with a focus on premium AI services without the burden of hypercaler-level investments overall,” he said.</p>
<p>But is this growth sustainable?</p>
<p>Sustar has his doubts. He believes that alternative cloud providers’ expansion will be conditioned by whether they can continue to bring GPUs online in high volume, and offer them at competitively low prices.</p>
<p>Competing on pricing might become challenging down the line as incumbents like Google, Microsoft and AWS ramp up investments in custom hardware to run and train models. Google offers its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tpus/">TPUs</a>; Microsoft recently unveiled two custom chips, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/15/microsoft-looks-to-free-itself-from-gpu-shackles-by-designing-custom-ai-chips/">Azure Maia and Azure Cobalt</a>; and AWS has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/28/amazon-unveils-new-chips-for-training-and-running-ai-models/">Trainium, Inferentia and Graviton</a>.</p>
<p>“Hypercalers will leverage their custom silicon to mitigate their dependencies on Nvidia, while Nvidia will look to CoreWeave and other GPU-centric AI clouds,” Sustar said.</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that, while many generative AI workloads run best on GPUs, not all workloads need them — particularly if they’re aren’t time-sensitive. CPUs can run the necessary calculations, but typically slower than GPUs and custom hardware.</p>
<p>More existentially, there’s a threat that the generative AI bubble will burst, which would leave providers with mounds of GPUs and not nearly enough customers demanding them. But the future looks rosy in the short term, say Sustar and Nag, both of whom are expecting a steady stream of upstart clouds.</p>
<p>“GPU-oriented cloud startups will give [incumbents] plenty of competition, especially among customers who are already multi-cloud and can handle the complexity of management, security, risk and compliance across multiple clouds,” Sustar said. “<span>Those sorts of cloud customers are comfortable trying out a new AI cloud if it has credible leadership, solid financial backing and GPUs with no wait times.”</span></p>

	<p><span><span>W</span></span>ASHINGTON – Two New York University professors collaborated directly with executives of the vaping company Juul without disclosing those relationships to academic journals or Congress, a STAT investigation reveals.</p>
<p>At the height of the youth vaping crisis, when many public health experts were calling for sweeping action that could upend the entire industry, David Abrams and Ray Niaura emerged as two authoritative voices willing to defend vaping — despite its growing popularity among youth — as an effective public health strategy to help adults cut back or quit smoking.</p>
<p>Abrams, a frequent commentator about vaping in the news media, including CBS This Morning, CNN, and The New Yorker, coordinated extensively with Juul on public messaging in 2017 and 2018, according to company emails. Abrams asked Juul officials for talking points, allowed company executives to review an academic article prior to publishing, and attended Juul scientific advisory board meetings, all without disclosing those connections to journal publishers or the public.</p>
