<p>WhatsApp will soon be granted access to explore the "full functionality" of the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware—sophisticated malware the Israeli Ministry of Defense has long guarded as a "highly sought" state secret, The Guardian<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/29/pegasus-surveillance-code-whatsapp-meta-lawsuit-nso-group"> reported</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2019, WhatsApp has pushed for access to the NSO's spyware code after alleging that Pegasus was used to spy on 1,400 WhatsApp users over a two-week period, gaining unauthorized access to their sensitive data, including encrypted messages. WhatsApp suing the NSO, Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">noted</a> at the time, was "an unprecedented legal action" that took "aim at the unregulated industry that sells sophisticated malware services to governments around the world."</p>
<p>Initially, the NSO sought to block all discovery in the lawsuit "due to various US and Israeli restrictions," but that blanket request was denied. Then, last week, the NSO lost another fight to keep WhatsApp away from its secret code.</p>
<p>As the court considered each side's motions to compel discovery, a US district judge, Phyllis Hamilton, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WhatsApp-v-NSO-Group-Order-2-23-2024.pdf">rejected</a> the NSO's argument that it should only be required to hand over information about Pegasus' installation layer.</p>
<p>Hamilton sided with WhatsApp, granting the Meta-owned app's request for "information concerning the full functionality of the relevant spyware," writing that "information showing the functionality of only the installation layer of the relevant spyware would not allow plaintiffs to understand how the relevant spyware performs the functions of accessing and extracting data."</p>
<p>WhatsApp has alleged that Pegasus can "intercept communications sent to and from a device, including communications over iMessage, Skype, Telegram, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and others” and that it could also be "customized for different purposes, including to intercept communications, capture screenshots, and exfiltrate browser history."</p>
<p>To prove this, WhatsApp needs access to "all relevant spyware"—specifically “any NSO spyware targeting or directed at WhatsApp servers, or using WhatsApp in any way to access Target Devices"—for "a period of one year before the alleged attack to one year after the alleged attack," Hamilton concluded.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The NSO has so far not commented on the order, but WhatsApp was pleased with this outcome.</p>
<p>“The recent court ruling is an important milestone in our long running goal of protecting WhatsApp users against unlawful attacks," WhatsApp's spokesperson told The Guardian. "Spyware companies and other malicious actors need to understand they can be caught and will not be able to ignore the law."</p>
<p>But Hamilton did not grant all of WhatsApp's requests for discovery, sparing the NSO from sharing specific information regarding its server architecture because WhatsApp "would be able to glean the same information from the full functionality of the alleged spyware."</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, the NSO also won't be compelled to identify its clients. While the NSO does not publicly name the governments that purchase its spyware, reports indicate that Poland, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, India, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates have used it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/activists-phones-targeted-by-one-of-the-worlds-most-advanced-espionage-apps/">to target dissidents</a>, The Guardian reported. In 2021, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/us-blacklists-maker-of-pegasus-spyware-that-helps-governments-spy-on-activists/">US blacklisted the NSO</a> for allegedly spreading "digital tools used for repression."</p>
<p>In the same order, Hamilton also denied the NSO's request to compel WhatsApp to share its post-complaint communications with the Citizen Lab, which served as a third-party witness in the case to support WhatsApp's argument that "Pegasus is misused by NSO’s customers against ‘civil society.’"</p>
<p>It appeared that the NSO sought WhatsApp's post-complaint communications with Citizen Lab as a way to potentially pressure WhatsApp into dropping Citizen Lab's statement from the record. Hamilton quoted a court filing from the NSO that curiously noted: "If plaintiffs would agree to withdraw from their case Citizen Lab’s contention that Pegasus was used against members of ‘civil society’ rather than to investigate terrorism and serious crime, there would be much less need for this discovery.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Hamilton denied the NSO's request because "the court fails to see the relevance of the requested discovery."</p>
<p>As discovery in the case proceeds, the court expects to receive expert disclosures from each side on August 30 before the trial, which is expected to start on March 3, 2025.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> FastUI is still an active work in progress, do not expect it to be complete.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Principle (short version)</h2><a id="user-content-the-principle-short-version" aria-label="Permalink: The Principle (short version)" href="#the-principle-short-version"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can see a simple demo of an application built with FastUI <a href="https://fastui-demo.onrender.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">FastUI is a new way to build web application user interfaces defined by declarative Python code.</p>
<p dir="auto">This means:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>If you're a Python developer</strong> — you can build responsive web applications using React without writing a single line of JavaScript, or touching <code>npm</code>.</li>
<li><strong>If you're a frontend developer</strong> — you can concentrate on building magical components that are truly reusable, no copy-pasting components for each view.</li>
<li><strong>For everyone</strong> — a true separation of concerns, the backend defines the entire application; while the frontend is free to implement just the user interface</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At its heart, FastUI is a set of matching <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" rel="nofollow">Pydantic</a> models and TypeScript interfaces that allow you to define a user interface. This interface is validated at build time by TypeScript and pyright/mypy and at runtime by Pydantic.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Practice — Usage</h2><a id="user-content-the-practice--usage" aria-label="Permalink: The Practice — Usage" href="#the-practice--usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">FastUI is made up of 4 things:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastui" rel="nofollow"><code>fastui</code> PyPI package</a> — Pydantic models for UI components, and some utilities. While it works well with <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow">FastAPI</a> it doesn't depend on FastAPI, and most of it could be used with any python web framework.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pydantic/fastui" rel="nofollow"><code>@pydantic/fastui</code> npm package</a> — a React TypeScript package that lets you reuse the machinery and types of FastUI while implementing your own components</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pydantic/fastui-bootstrap" rel="nofollow"><code>@pydantic/fastui-bootstrap</code> npm package</a> — implementation/customisation of all FastUI components using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@pydantic/fastui-prebuilt" rel="nofollow"><code>@pydantic/fastui-prebuilt</code> npm package</a> (available on <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@pydantic/fastui-prebuilt" rel="nofollow">jsdelivr.com CDN</a>) providing a pre-built version of the FastUI React app so you can use it without installing any npm packages or building anything yourself.

<p dir="auto">FastUI is an implementation of the RESTful principle; but not as it's usually understood, instead I mean the principle defined in the original <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" rel="nofollow">PhD dissertation</a> by Roy Fielding, and excellently summarised in <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/how-did-rest-come-to-mean-the-opposite-of-rest/" rel="nofollow">this essay on htmx.org</a> (HTMX people, I'm sorry to use your article to promote React which I know you despise 🙏).</p>
<p dir="auto">The RESTful principle as described in the HTMX article is that the frontend doesn't need to (and shouldn't) know anything about the application you're building. Instead, it should just provide all the components you need to construct the interface, the backend can then tell the frontend what to do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Think of your frontend as a puppet, and the backend as the hand within it — the puppet doesn't need to know what to say, that's kind of the point.</p>
<p dir="auto">Building an application this way has a number of significant advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You only need to write code in one place to build a new feature — add a new view, change the behavior of an existing view or alter the URL structure</li>
<li>Deploying the front and backend can be completely decoupled, provided the frontend knows how to render all the components the backend is going to ask it to use, you're good to go</li>
<li>You should be able to reuse a rich set of opensource components, they should end up being better tested and more reliable than anything you could build yourself, this is possible because the components need no context about how they're going to be used (note: since FastUI is brand new, this isn't true yet, hopefully we get there)</li>
<li>We can use Pydantic, TypeScript and JSON Schema to provide guarantees that the two sides are communicating with an agreed schema</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the abstract, FastUI is like the opposite of GraphQL but with the same goal — GraphQL lets frontend developers extend an application without any new backend development; FastUI lets backend developers extend an application without any new frontend development.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Beyond Python and React</h3><a id="user-content-beyond-python-and-react" aria-label="Permalink: Beyond Python and React" href="#beyond-python-and-react"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, this principle shouldn't be limited to Python and React applications — provided we use the same set of agreed schemas and encoding to communicate, we should be able to use any frontend and backend that implements the schema. Interchangeably.</p>
<p dir="auto">This could mean:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Implementing a web frontend using another JS framework like Vue — lots of work, limited value IMHO</li>
<li>Implementing a web frontend using an edge server, so the browser just sees HTML — lots of work but very valuable</li>
<li>Implementing frontends for other platforms like mobile or IOT — lots of work, no idea if it's actually a good idea?</li>
<li>Implementing the component models in another language like Rust or Go — since there's actually not that much code in the backend, so this would be a relatively small and mechanical task</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.zarl.dev/articles/enums">https://www.zarl.dev/articles/enums</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39564737">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="go-enums-suck">Go Enums Suck</h2>

<p>Go doesn’t technially have Enums and it is a missing feature in my book but there is a Go idiomatic way to achieve roughly the same thing.  Go does have however the <code>iota</code> keyword. This is basically a self incrementing integer - so you end up writing Enums something like this:</p>

<pre><code>type Operation int

const (
	Escalated Operation = iota
	Archived
	Deleted
	Completed
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine however it is nothing but an integer under the covers this means what we actually have is:</p>

<pre><code>const (
	Escalated Operation = 0
	Archived  Operation = 1
	Deleted   Operation = 2
	Completed Operation = 3
)
</code></pre>

<p>This also means any function that uses these or a struct that contains these can also just take an <code>int</code> value.  For this reason its best to make sure our default case is correctly handled. So for this we either decide which will be the default case or what I usually do is specify an <code>Unknown</code> case and use this as a validation check.  So now we have :</p>

<pre><code>type Operation int

const (
	Unknown Operation = iota
	Escalated 
	Archived
	Deleted
	Completed
)

func (o Operation) IsValid() bool {
	if o == Unknown {
		return false
	}
	return true
}
</code></pre>

<p>But what you notice here is we have no string representation of these Enums so we have to build that out next, for this I just use a <code>map[Operation]string</code> and instantiate this with the defined string constants.  We also now need to handle in inverse scenario of a <code>string</code> to an <code>Operation</code> for example if we are reading the value off the wire via JSON for example.  Adding the string maps:</p>

<pre><code>
const (
	unknownStr = "Unknown"
	escalatedStr = "Escalated"
	archivedStr = "Archived"
	deletedStr = "Deleted"
	completedStr = "Completed"
)

var (
&nbsp; &nbsp; opsToStrings = map[Operation]string{
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Escalated: escalatedStr,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archived: &nbsp;archivedStr,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deleted: &nbsp; deletedStr,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Completed: completedStr,
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; stringsToOps = map[string]Operation{
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; escalatedStr: Escalated,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; archivedStr: &nbsp;Archived,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deletedStr: &nbsp; Deleted,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; completedStr: Completed,
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have these maps set up we should really put them to use, for this I usually make 1  method and 1 function, the <code>String()</code> method on the Enum type and a package level function Parse which takes the <code>any</code> type and can return an Operation type.  This looks like:</p>

<pre><code>func (o Operation) String() string {
&nbsp; &nbsp; if s, ok := opsToStrings[o]; ok {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return s
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; return unknownStr
}

func ParseOperation(o any) Operation {
&nbsp; &nbsp; switch o := o.(type) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; case Operation:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return o
&nbsp; &nbsp; case int:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation(o)
&nbsp; &nbsp; case string:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return stringToOp(o)
&nbsp; &nbsp; case fmt.Stringer:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return stringToOp(o.String())
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; return Unknown
}

  func (o Operation) IsValid() bool {
&nbsp; &nbsp; _, ok := opsToStrings[o]
	return ok
}

  func stringToOp(o string) Operation {
&nbsp; &nbsp; if op, ok := stringsToOps[o]; ok {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return op
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; return Unknown
}
</code></pre>

<p>This lets us use the Enum in JSON for example, it can be represented as an <code>int</code> or a <code>string</code> it’s up to you, but I almost always go for the <code>string</code> representation in JSON.  And of course it’s the 2 most used interfaces in the world.  The JSON Marshall and Unmarshall interfaces.</p>

<pre><code>func (o Operation) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; return []byte(`"` + t.String() + `"`), nil
}

func (t *Operation) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {
&nbsp; &nbsp; *t = Parse(string(b))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>OK so now that we have all the individual Enums defined I like to group them up in a struct and give it the feel of an Enum more akin to a Java/Kotlin Enum when referencing it.  Start with making a container wrapper with a <code>Operation</code> for each case then define a public variable of the container type with all the correct mappings.  This ends up looking like:</p>

<pre><code>type operationContainer struct {
	UNKNOWN:   Operation
	ESCALATED: Operation
	ARCHIVED:  Operation
	DELETED:   Operation
	COMPLETED: Operation
&nbsp;}

var Operations = operationContainer {
	UNKNOWN: Unknown,
	ESCALATED: Escalated,
	ARCHIVED: Archived,
	DELETED: Deleted,
	COMPLETED: Completed,
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us to use these Enums like below if for example we are importing from the <code>cmd</code> pkg.</p>

<pre><code>cmdOp := cmd.Operations.COMPLETED
</code></pre>

<p>With this container we can also extend the functionality to return all Enums as a slice for iteration over all the values if required excluding the <code>Unknown</code> value.</p>

<pre><code>func (c operationsContainer) All() []Operation {
&nbsp; &nbsp; return []Operation{
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.ESCALATED,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.ARCHIVED,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.DELETED,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.COMPLETED,
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="job-done-or-is-it">Job Done. Or is it….</h2>

<p>After all this we now have a much nicer more fully featured Enum but the biggest problem remains;  Anywhere that accepts an <code>Operation</code>  Enum type will just as happily accept an <code>int</code>. This is a real pain as it almost completely negates the work we have done here.  There is also the fact that we have our container but the original definitions are also public and can be accessed from outside the package so we have two things that are functionally the same.</p>

<pre><code>opCompleted := cmd.Completed
enumCompleted := cmd.Operations.COMPLETED
</code></pre>

<p>To limit this the first thing I did was to make the operation Enum type private so <code>Operation</code> became <code>operation</code> and made all instances of the operation type private also.  I then defined a new public struct called <code>Operation</code> which contains this private <code>operation</code> Enum.</p>

<pre><code>type Operation struct {
&nbsp; &nbsp; operation
}

type operation int

const (
&nbsp; &nbsp; unknown operation = iota
&nbsp; &nbsp; escalated
&nbsp; &nbsp; archived
&nbsp; &nbsp; deleted
&nbsp; &nbsp; completed
)
</code></pre>

<p>This now makes it impossible to just pass an <code>int</code> to any function or struct that uses the <code>Operation</code> type as they cannot instantiate a new one with a valid private <code>operation</code> as it cannot be used outside the package.  This also means even if someone for example uses this as an empty struct <code>empty := cmd.Operation{}</code> it will be Invalid and will report as <code>Unknown</code>.  So now that this has been done we need to change our public container to accommodate our new <code>Operation</code> struct but as you can see the container does not need to change but the assignment does.</p>

<pre><code>type operationsContainer struct {
&nbsp; &nbsp; UNKNOWN &nbsp; Operation
&nbsp; &nbsp; ESCALATED Operation
&nbsp; &nbsp; ARCHIVED &nbsp;Operation
&nbsp; &nbsp; DELETED &nbsp; Operation
&nbsp; &nbsp; COMPLETED Operation
}

 
var Operations = operationsContainer{
&nbsp; &nbsp; UNKNOWN: &nbsp; Operation{unknown},
&nbsp; &nbsp; ESCALATED: Operation{escalated},
&nbsp; &nbsp; ARCHIVED: &nbsp;Operation{archived},
&nbsp; &nbsp; DELETED: &nbsp; Operation{deleted},
&nbsp; &nbsp; COMPLETED: Operation{completed},
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also now need to change our Parse function to handle the wrapped <code>operation</code></p>

<pre><code>func Parse(a any) Operation {
&nbsp; &nbsp; switch v := a.(type) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; case Operation:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return v
&nbsp; &nbsp; case string:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{stringToOperation(v)}
&nbsp; &nbsp; case fmt.Stringer:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{stringToOperation(v.String())}
&nbsp; &nbsp; case int:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{operation(v)}
&nbsp; &nbsp; case int64:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{operation(int(v))}
&nbsp; &nbsp; case int32:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{operation(int(v))}
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; return Operation{unknown}
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this new structure we still have the same nice syntax for accessing the Enum outside the package but the individual Enums are not public so this encourages the use of the singleton Enum container for getting the appropriate value and it also makes Intellisense in the IDE better as there is less public variables exposed meaning the drop down is cleaner.</p>

<p>Now I know - this is a metric ton of work just to get nice Enums, but to be honest I think it really makes a nicer developer experience when using them and is better than the <code>iota</code> approach from a type safety perspective.  However I too agree that this is way to much work and it’s repetitive work at that, which can easily require rework with the adding of Enums or the changing of Enums means making sure everything has been done correctly for all the string maps etc.</p>

<p>So ………..</p>

<h2 id="goenums">goenums</h2>

<p>This is a a little tool I wrote to accompany this post - its an Enum generator that generates Enums in the same style as I have laid out above.  It’s a simple <code>text/template</code> based tool that can turn some simple JSON configuration into a formatted go file.</p>

<p>It turns this:</p>

<pre><code>{
&nbsp; "enums": [
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "package": "cmd",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "type": "operation",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "values": [
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Escalated",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Archived",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Deleted",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Completed"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Into this:</p>

<pre><code>package cmd

import "fmt"

type Operation struct {
&nbsp; &nbsp; operation
}

type operation int

const (
&nbsp; &nbsp; unknown operation = iota
&nbsp; &nbsp; escalated

&nbsp; &nbsp; if v, ok := typeOperationMap[s]; ok {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return v
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; return unknown
}
  
func (t operation) IsValid() bool {
&nbsp; &nbsp; _, ok := strOperationMap[s]
    return ok
}
  
type operationsContainer struct {
&nbsp; &nbsp; UNKNOWN &nbsp; Operation

}
  
func (c operationsContainer) All() []Operation {

}
  
func (t *Operation) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {
&nbsp; &nbsp; *t = Parse(string(b))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the config is a JSON array this allows specifying many different Enums and have them all get generated in one shot.  More about goenums can be found on the github at <a href="https://www.github.com/zarldev/goenums" target="_blank">https://www.github.com/zarldev/goenums</a></p>

                    <p>After a few weeks of internet drama, Apple has responded to complaints about the death of Progressive Web Apps in the European Union and is restoring them to how they worked in iOS 17.3 and before.
</p><p>When the first iOS 17.4 beta launched, European Union users were <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/02/09/something-is-happening-to-progressive-web-apps-in-ios-174----but-they-arent-dead">hit by problems</a> with Progressive Web Apps that weren't working properly. Further iterations of the beta, including the release candidates on February 27, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/02/15/apple-blames-new-law-for-why-progressive-web-apps-dont-work-right-in-the-eu">made this worse</a>.
</p><p>And now, Apple has changed its mind on the matter. Apple says that it has reversed course because of numerous requests by consumers to keep the feature.
</p><p>Apple has altered its page on what the Digital Markets App <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#browser-alt-eu">changes entail</a> to reflect the Progressive Web App direction change.
</p><p>Apple's new page reads as follows:
</p><div><blockquote>Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS.<p>We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS.</p><p>Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.</p></blockquote>
</div><p>For support, the Progressive Web Apps will still need to be built on WebKit, with all that entails.
</p><p>The European Union Digital Markets Act that spawned all these changes has an implementation deadline of March 8. If Apple follows its normal course, iOS 17.4 with the contained <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store" title="App Store" data-kpt="1">App Store</a> concessions to suit the law will arrive on Tuesday, March 5.
</p><p><h2 data-anchor="apples-dma-plans-and-subsequent-complaints" id="apples-dma-plans-and-subsequent-complaints">Apple's DMA plans and subsequent complaints</h2>
</p><p>On January 25, Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/25/apple-will-charge-eu-developers-to-sideload-but-its-not-quite-as-bad-as-rumored">revealed its changes</a> that will come into effect from March 2024 to comply with DMA. For all users, Apple will start to notarize all <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios" title="iOS" data-kpt="1">iOS</a> apps, regardless of where they're sold. 
</p><p>Developers can offer their own app marketplace in the EU, but they must be approved by Apple and use a human review process. Those stores are also responsible for their own refunds but can use alternative third-party payment processors. 
</p><p>At the same time, Apple is changing its fee structure, reducing the standard commission of 30% down to 17%. For apps that stay within the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store" title="App Store" data-kpt="1">App Store</a>, there will also be a 3% fee for using Apple's payment processing services.
</p><p>Controversially, all apps not sold via the App Store will be subject to a Core Technology Fee of 0.50 Euro per first install of an app annually, waived for the first million installs. 
</p><p>Alongside the changes is a mandate that iOS supports multiple browser engines beyond custom front-ends on top of WebKit. In short, in the EU, Apple has to fully support Mozilla's Firefox instead of just using Apple's WebKit.
</p><p>At the same time, it crippled Progressive Web Apps. Presumably, it did so because it thought it would have to support them across all browsers that didn't use WebKit, but that is not the case.
</p><p>Apple's move also comes after a threat to look into the issue by European Commission authorities.
</p><p>"We are indeed looking at the compliance packages of all gatekeepers, including Apple," the European Commission said in a statement on February 26. "In that context, we're in particular looking into the issue of progressive web apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment."
</p><p>Apple's proposals have, naturally, attracted complaints. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/27/spotify-ceo-unhappy-with-apples-eu-app-store-extortion">called the fees</a> "extortion, plain and simple," while Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/25/epics-tim-sweeney-is-mad-about-apples-eu-app-store-concessions">referred to it</a> as "hot garbage" and a "devious new instance of malicious compliance." </p>

Mostly generalist programmers with at least 1 strong specialty over the past few years. We believe that great software need a decent mix of generalists and specialists to cover the whole spectrum of programming practices.</p><p>* We all work very closely to product and design and put a lot of emphasis on having the user at the center of all our technical reflections — pushing the boundaries of what could be (more) awesome for the end user.</p><p>* We make the extra effort of defining, dividing and sizing technical projects and use Linear to communicate those with the rest of the team as well as tracking progress within the team. We value rigor, pragmatism and performance in all our technical decisions.</p><p>* Having a team of seasoned programmers greatly helps in that regard. Since we are working on a single monorepo, we encourage one another to cross language boundaries when it feels right. We believe that exposure to different environments makes you a better programmer.

The same building blocks that power the marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and the automatic segmentation and delivery of data to other platforms. We're also building towards a future where users can leverage our collaboration tools without needing to push their data to us, instead our query engine will be embeddable where their data is already at rest.</p><p>We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), and Poland.</p><p>In brief, the technologies we use are:</p><p>- Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Calcite in the backend. We love functional programming and make use of libraries like Cats, Cats-Effect, and FS2, but we keep a pragmatic stance on purity given our exposure to the Spark ecosystem.</p><p>- Our services are deployed on AWS and provisioned using Terraform. We leverage the usual suspects: Fargate, EMR, RDS, Lambda, etc. and we're starting to lean into Kubernetes. Being a small team, we think twice before rolling out custom infrastructure that we'll need to monitor and maintain.</p><p>- On the frontend, we use Typescript, VueJS, PrimeVue, Nuxt, and Vite.</p><p>Job postings and more on information about our team and culture are available at: <a href="https://jobs.narrative.io/" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.narrative.io/</a></p><p>Apply by sending your resume to hiring-dev@narrative.io.

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Lead and Senior Health Data Engineer</p><p>* Lead  Software Engineer, Data Serving</p><p><i>Sr Backend Software Engineer, Rewards</i></p><p>Sr Flutter Mobile Software Engineer, Rewards</p><p><i>Lead Software Engineer, Infrastructure</i></p><p>Lead Software Engineer, Developer Productivity</p><p><i>Lead Software Engineer, IAM</i></p><p>Lead Product Manager, Rewards</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Kotlin, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

I got my PhD in Physics in Aug of 2021 and my work has primarily dealt with modeling protein interactions and understanding mutational effects. I'm adept with Python and Bash, working with both sparse and large datasets, as well as working with an HPC environment. On the side I've hosted server infrastructure for open source projects utilizing bare-metal servers, VPS, and AWS. I also host my own infrastructure as a hobby, from the hardware to the nameservers.</p><p>I'm a strong communicator, having collaborated across disciplines and presented work for both technical and non-technical audiences. I'm self-motivated and love to dig into new complex problems and learn new tools.</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hi! I'm Liam, a freshman at UBC, aiming to specialize in Computer Science/Physics. Looking for a software related internship in the summer. I've been programming for 7 years, and built dozens of projects, most of them can be found on my Github (<a href="https://github.com/liam-ilan">https://github.com/liam-ilan</a>).<p>Over the summer, I built Crumb (<a href="https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb">https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb</a>), a programming language from scratch, which was front paged here a couple months ago! I'm also a member of the firmware team at UBC Formula Electric, working on porting firmware for the Front Sensor Module to our next car.</p><p>Open to doing just around anything you need me to do. If you have an opening, or any advice, hit me up :D

Started in PHP, moved to Rails &amp; Elixir for the past decade. I love designing software, resolving long-term technical debt, and learning new languages (both computer and human languages, I've previously used English, Japanese, and Korean professionally). Always happy to learn if necessary. Hoping to continue to grow into more leadership positions, but I'm amenable to any role so long as it drives successful business outcomes. I've generally been moved between teams to help mentor junior engineers, and solve any sticky problems that others have struggled with. I'm also comfortable wearing many hats including Product management, Product management, Architecture, Engineering Management, Customer Success, QA, Sales, and more, though I'm predominantly looking at Staff+ IC roles.  Currently focused on W2 full-time opportunities but also open to 1099 roles.</p><p>Look forward to hearing from you soon!

  I'm a Sr. level Linux and Network Systems engineer, or devops, or systems development engineer, or whatever you're calling it at your company.  I like to work in in lower level systems automation specializing in on-prem Kubernetes infrastructures.  From hardware selection and ordering, to understanding rack ordering, power constraints and fully automated server provisioning to build and maintain your on-prem multi-tenant or multi-team Kubernetes stack.

  If you're looking to do a cloud repatriation project, it can be difficult to find people that understand both the physical side and the Kubernetes automation and management. I know, I've hired teams to do it.  So, if you're looking to stand up an on-prem cluster, or integrate with your existing cloud infrastructure to move expensive workloads into your own cluster, we should talk.

Hey there!<p>My name is Koray. I’ve been programming since I was ten years old, starting with computer magazines. It quickly turned into my career, and I've had the opportunity to work in various companies since I was 16.</p><p>Eight years ago, at the age of 23, I started my first company. Since then, I've been involved in different roles, primarily focusing on technical product leadership and cross-platform application development. Some of the products I have built and helped build have been embraced by millions of users, received awards, and consistently maintained high rankings on app stores.</p><p>Recently, my latest pursuit came to an end due to funding constraints. Now, I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can wear different hats. I'm open to any industry and I'm technology-agnostic.</p><p>I love learning new things and have a wide range of interests, including 3D printing, IoT, and home automation. On a fun note, I also collect vinyls, synthesizers and groove boxes.</p><p>If there is a match, let's chat!

I'm primarily self-taught, in ways that are fueled by -- in varying parts -- a DIY habit, a distaste or depending on cloud vendors, troubleshooting dives, and an urge to automate out tasks I (or other people) don't want to do. (That last one is where I'd say my <i>best</i> work tends to be.) I enjoy excuses to expand on this, and have a few other areas of curiosity beyond the ones I'd actually call an expertise, ranging from DevOps to cybersecurity to ML.</p><p>Longer-term, I really want to work on open-source and/or Web infrastructure (examples of orgs that catch my attention include Mozilla, GitLab, and Element), but in the immediate one I don't have <i>strong</i> opinions about mission fit right now, as my core focus after a particularly traumatizing previous workplace is to find someplace that operates differently.</p><p>So much so that I've been on a Web scraping rabbit hole for the last several months, building a bot to doomscroll job boards for me so that I have an escape hatch if it ever happens again. There's also a writeup of this (and a few other projects on the path from initial client-side tinkering to full-on browser automation) on my website if you're interested in a 10000 word dive into the topic.</p><p>(Some other recent experiments have included writing a demo track in Sonic Pi, and toying around w `osquery` to finally get some tangible exposure to SQL.)

Hi, I'm Matt. I have ~2.5 years of software engineering experience. Most of it has been on backend systems using Python (REST APIs, services, and automation), but I've done some UI work with TypeScript &amp; React as well.<p>I'm interested in roles at companies that move quickly to deliver valuable products to their customers. All of the companies that I've worked at fail at some part of that statement. I'd really enjoy working with competent people that are engaged in their work. Thanks for reading!

Hi! I'm Samuel. I have 5+ years as a product manager and 10 in product development (before pm: agile coach, UX designer, and developer). I work closely with engineering teams, supporting them in every way I can, and have contributed code in every role I have ever held. I am very curious and driven to learn, so diving in deep is always a thrill. On the flip side, I am regularly found tackling ambiguous problems and planning our product and company strategy with the executive team.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Physics in college -&gt; software engineering.<p>Extremely passionate about this career, got into software because I found my free time being sucked up by messing around with raspberry pis and watching CS related lectures on OS's, C++ related HFT talks, random talks on exotic data structures.</p><p>Many of those who know me regard me as brilliant, I'm a fast learner, looking for a challenge/fast paced environment where learning on the job is encouraged and rewarded.

Have you noticed something?<p>Everyone here is some kind of developer! And remember what developers are notoriosly bad at? That's right -- marketing and sales...which is exactly what I can help you with. Because no matter how good your product is if you don't know who your audience is and how to market it to them.</p><p>Remember what Gary Halbert said to his students if they were to compete with his hypothetical hot-dog stand, "I'll give you every advantage you ask for -- better hot-dogs, better prices, whatever...as long as I can get only one advantage. I want a starving crowd!"</p><p>Every week I stumble upon websites of software companies who are just as good as their more famous competitors (or even better), but their marketing sucks, and that's why they never reach the hockey-stick growth phase.</p><p>Want some help with that? Send me an email today.</p><p>Cheers, 
Filip Stanojevic -- Copywriter &amp; Marketer</p><p>P. S. Don't worry about sleazy sales tactics, I am an engineer by training myself -- I did a lot of coding and data analytics while earning my BSc in engineering.

Hi All! Full stack engineer with 4yoe most recently working as a Senior SWE at Nielsen using Java/Python/AWS to help create, streamline, and safe-guard a backend system to capture and process data from over half a million US panelist homes that result in the determination of billions dollars worth of advertisement currency. Prior to this position, I focused on creating and enhancing open-source developer tools using JavaScript/React/Node. Love building across the full stack but even more enthusiastic about creating a collaborative and communicative team environment.<p>Cheers!

At my previous role, I wrote a real-time smart recording app in C++17 that would record H.264/H.265 video from security cameras by detecting changes in the foreground using real-time background subtraction, and then would re-encode the video and upload it to the cloud over an HTTPS connection. In a contractor role before that, I built a topic classification service for that would scale to 100s of thousands of inputs per second on a single GCP e2.mini instance, since the client was very price sensitive.

I'm a mid-level generalist software engineer who has spent the last year or so doing full-stack web development with Google Maps APIs and the 3 years before that doing C systems programming on a compiler/database at a startup. I'm also a Google Cloud certified Associate Cloud Engineer. I'm always looking to broaden my skillset and learn new technologies.<p>Currently, go, rust and zig are at the top of the list of technologies I'd like to work with. I'm also interested in doing more with cloud technologies whether Google Cloud, Azure or AWS and would also be open to considering a DevOps, SRE or Cloud role.

I’m on the job market for software engineering roles. A bit about me: I’ve cofounded a startup as the technical lead, worked full-stack most of my career, and have been using Rust for backend web development in the last few years.</p><p>I’m currently looking for mid- to large-sized businesses with strong engineering cultures that prize communication and personal growth. I thrive with open communication and authenticity. I’m open to remote roles or roles local to Chicago. I’m also tentatively open to relocating to California-based opportunities, given the right conditions.</p><p>I’m handy with test-driven development, I’m an eager documentarian, and I’m always excited to share what I know, whether that’s in writing, giving talks, or leading screen-sharing sessions. In previous roles, I’ve taught teams to collaborate via OpenAPI, migrated legacy systems to microservices, optimized CI/CD pipelines, implemented OpenTelemetry metrics and traces, and successfully introduced test-driven development.</p><p>My current career aspiration is to continue progressing as an IC to staff engineering roles, although I suspect my interests will swing towards the management side of the pendulum eventually. I would love to be working with Rust on innovative tech, or working with any tech stack whatsoever on developer experience or web development (where I’ve used languages running the gamut from PHP to Rust).</p><p>I have kids and they monopolize most of my free time, but when I have time I play with tech and writing code. I write here: <a href="https://briankung.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://briankung.dev</a>, I have a microblog at <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@briankung" rel="nofollow">https://hachyderm.io/@briankung</a>, and I am a professional software engineering job reposter on LinkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-kung-ba7410180/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-kung-ba7410180/</a>.</p><p>Please reach out if you think I might be a good fit for your team!

In addition to working directly on large and complex code projects I also managed and grew engineering teams at various companies.<p>If you need help with specific technical projects, or are looking for management roles please feel free to reach out. I'm very familiar with both the unique challenges of scaling up startups as well as working to innovate in large enterprise companies.</p><p>Specifically if you need help productizing and scaling out various AI/Machine Learning/LLM systems this would be a good fit. I know there is quite a bit of demand in this area and a limited supply of qualified candidates.

   <p>The four-day workweek is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p>   <p>Companies that have tried it are reporting happier workers, lower turnover and greater efficiency. Now, there's evidence that those effects are long lasting.</p>   <p>The latest data come from a trial in the U.K. In 2022, 61 companies moved their employees to a four-day workweek with no reduction in pay.</p>   <p>They began it as a six-month experiment. But today, 54 of the companies still have the policy. Just over half have declared it permanent,<a href="https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/making-it-stick_-1.pdf"> according to researchers</a> with the think tank Autonomy, who organized the trial along with the groups 4-Day Week Campaign and 4 Day Week Global. </p>   
   <p>Follow-up surveys help to explain the four-day workweek's success.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1234306929" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Improvements in physical and mental health, work-life balance, and general life satisfaction, as well as reductions in burnout, have been maintained over the past year, says sociologist Juliet Schor of Boston College, who's part of the research team. Workers report higher job satisfaction now than before the trial began.</p>   <p>"The results are really stable. It's not a novelty effect," she says. "People are feeling really on top of their work with this new model."</p>   <p>Similarly positive results are emerging from other four-day workweek trials, including in the U.S., Schor says.</p>   <h3><strong>"Doesn't happen by magic"</strong></h3>   <p>At a recent webinar, participating companies shared their experiences and tips for success.</p>   <p>"It absolutely doesn't happen by magic," says Nicci Russell, CEO of the London-based water conservancy non-profit Waterwise. "You can't just drop a day and carry on as usual, because how stressful would that be?"</p>   <p>Russell says after some initial teething problems, they managed to find efficiencies that allow all 10 employees to take Fridays off. They keep all meetings to 30 minutes and make sure those meetings start on time. They block off focus time on their calendars — sometimes even declaring Monk Mode Mondays. They're more mindful of the emails they send and of the time they spend going through their inboxes.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1234307133" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I only do my emails now at certain times of the day. I'm not drawn into them all day, every day," she says.</p>   <p>At the end of the pilot, the staff at Waterwise were unanimous in their desire to continue the four-day week. A majority said they wouldn't consider a five-day-a-week job again unless presented with a significant pay raise.</p>   <p>"It's brilliant for retention, which is super important in a teeny organization like ours," says Russell.</p>   <h3><strong>No one-size-fits-all</strong></h3>   <p>One important finding, researchers say, is that there is no one-size-fits-all recipe when it comes to the four-day workweek.</p>   
   <p>At Merthyr Valleys Homes in South Wales, giving everyone Fridays off wouldn't have worked, says Ruth Llewellyn, who led the pilot at the housing cooperative.</p>   <p>With 240 employees working in roles from customer service to home repairs and maintenance, they decided to keep their operations running from Monday through Friday.</p>   <p>"For us, the thought of dropping repair service for our tenants one day a week meant that we wouldn't be providing the same service," Llewellyn says.</p>   <p>Instead, employees work a variety of schedules depending on individual and team needs. Some have a set day off every week, while others are on a rolling schedule. Some employees work two half-days, and some still work five days a week but shorter hours, allowing them to drop off and pick up their children from school.</p>   <p>The teams found time savings in different places. Some of the trades staff found they could reduce travel time to and from the building supplier with better planning around which materials they needed. Customer-facing teams found they could address smaller issues quickly over the phone.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1234307263" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Employees are more motivated, employee performance has held consistent, and absences for illnesses have fallen, Llewellyn says.</p>   <p>Yet the company is not committing to the four-day workweek forever — at least, not yet. Hoping for still more data, it extended the pilot and will re-evaluate the results later this spring.</p>   <p>"We're really hopeful at that point that we can make it permanent," says Llewellyn.</p>   <h3><strong>Why companies fail </strong></h3>   <p>Of the 61 U.K. companies that joined the 2022 pilot, only a few have discontinued the four-day workweek.</p>   <p>At one small consultancy, although the staff reported improved morale and the company reported a boost in efficiency, there were problems managing client and stakeholder expectations, according to feedback collected after the pilot.</p>   <p>Researchers suggest that better external communications and more flexibility in adapting the policy to challenging conditions might have made a difference.</p>   
   <p>"There is a suggestion that the organisation did not give the policy enough of a chance, and indications of a change of heart on the issue from management," the researchers wrote.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hullworks.com/wood/">https://hullworks.com/wood/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39562530">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
			
<h2>Old vs. New Growth Trees and the Wood Products they Make</h2>


<p>It’s true what they say, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to.” We know, because our company restores historic windows. Many of these windows are still working well after 100 years. Most brand-new windows will not be in service 100 years from now.</p>


<p>Why? Because wood windows made with “new wood” aren’t made like they used to be. Historic windows made with “old growth” wood, from trees 100 years ago, are the most durable windows there are. </p>


<h3>The difference between old growth wood and new growth wood</h3>


<p>The difference between old growth wood and new growth wood is like the difference between granite and paper. Old growth wood has better stability, durability and longevity. New growth wood and the windows they’re made of, begin to rot and warp after only twenty years. </p>


<p>“Virgin Wood” refers to first -cut wood, or wood harvested for the first time. As early America grew and expanded, we harvested wood from virgin forests as we moved west.&nbsp; Wood harvesting started in New York, then Pennsylvania and into Ohio, then on to the Great Lakes region of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Tree harvesting then turned to the south and finally, after the early 1900’s out west. The virgin wood forest harvesting era lasts from the 1870’s into the 1940’s. </p>


<div>
<figure><img src="https://hullworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wood-Picture1.png" alt="Wood growth 100 years apart." width="336" height="347"></figure>
</div>


<p>The value of virgin growth wood is that it has grown very slowly over a long period of time. Because of this slow growth, the growth rings are very tight. Tight growth means more stability. In this photo there are 2 pieces of wood 100 years apart. The wood from 1918 has 20-25 growth rings per inch. The wood from 2018 has only 7. &nbsp; </p>


<p>Stability isn’t the only advantage. This slow growth also yields more heartwood. Heart wood is the longest lasting part of the tree, whereas sap wood which will rot very quickly. Note too in the picture above, the wood from 1918 is all heart wood, the wood from 2018 is all sap wood. </p>


<figure><img src="https://hullworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wood-Picture2.png" alt="Key differences between old vs new wood"><figcaption> This sketch highlights the key differences between old vs new wood.  </figcaption></figure>


<p>Most wood used today, by contrast, is grown very fast. The wood for a great deal of new millwork today is grown on plantations. Sixty- years ago, timber companies began to grow Radiata Pine in countries like New Zealand and Chile. Grown for quick production, these trees produce very little heartwood and these trees have fewer growth rings per inch. </p>


<h3>The effects of new vs. old wood</h3>


<p>If you have used finger jointed wood, you see the effects of new vs. old wood. Starting in the 1970’s lumber manufacturers began using finger-jointed wood to compensate for poor wood quality; the warping, twisting, and knots in their new growth wood. They took a board of wood, cut out the defects and then rejoined the pieces with finger joints. Finger joining wood in doors windows, moldings, and framing lumber is necessary because the new growth wood quality isn’t as good. Old growth timber is generally free of knots while plantation grown wood is riddled with them. </p>


<p>The value of old growth lumber is the reason we should NOT throw out old windows. These old windows are structurally superior and can be restored instead of replaced. An old window will last another 100 years if properly cared for. It’s true, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to.”</p>

<p>Near the end of 2022, Trail of Bits was hired by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) to <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/12/21/the-2022-curl-security-audit/">perform a security assessment</a> of the <a href="https://curl.se/">cURL</a> file transfer command-line utility and its library, <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>. The scope of our engagement included a code review, a threat model, and the subject of this blog post: an engineering effort to analyze and improve cURL’s fuzzing code.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss several elements of this process, including how we identified important areas of the codebase lacking coverage, and then modified the fuzzing code to hit these missed areas. For example, by setting certain libcurl options during fuzzer initialization and introducing new seed files, we doubled the line coverage of the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) handling code and quintupled it for the <code>Alt-Svc</code> header. We also expanded the set of fuzzed protocols to include WebSocket and enabled the fuzzing of many new libcurl options. We’ll conclude this post by explaining some more sophisticated fuzzing techniques the cURL team could adopt to increase coverage even further, bring fuzzing to the cURL command line, and reduce inefficiencies intrinsic to the current test case format.</p>
<h3>How is cURL fuzzed?</h3>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/">OSS-Fuzz</a>, a free service provided by Google for open-source projects, serves as the continuous fuzzing infrastructure for cURL. It supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, and Java codebases, and uses the coverage-guided libFuzzer, AFL++, and Honggfuzz fuzzing engines. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/07/01/5-years-on-oss-fuzz/">OSS-Fuzz adopted cURL on July 1, 2017</a>, and the incorporated code lives in the <code><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer">curl-fuzzer</a></code> repository on GitHub, which was our focus for this part of the engagement.</p>
<p>The repository contains the code (setup scripts, test case generators, harnesses, etc.) and corpora (the sets of initial test cases) needed to fuzz cURL and libcurl. It’s designed to fuzz individual <em>targets</em>, which are protocols supported by libcurl, such as HTTP(S), WebSocket, and FTP. curl-fuzzer downloads the latest copy of cURL and its dependencies, compiles them, and builds binaries for these targets against them.</p>
<p>Each target takes a specially structured input file, processes it using the appropriate calls to libcurl, and exits. Associated with each target is a corpus directory that contains interesting seed files for the protocol to be fuzzed. These files are structured using a custom type-length-value (TLV) format that encodes not only the raw protocol data, but also specific fields and metadata for the protocol. For example, the fuzzer for the HTTP protocol includes options for the version of the protocol, custom headers, and whether libcurl should follow redirects.</p>
<h3>First impressions: HSTS and Alt-Svc</h3>
<p>We’d been tasked with analyzing and improving the fuzzer’s coverage of libcurl, the library providing curl’s internals. The obvious first question that came to mind was: what does the current coverage look like? To answer this, we wanted to peek at the latest coverage data given in the reports periodically generated by OSS-Fuzz. After some poking around at the URL for the publicly accessible oss-fuzz-coverage Google Cloud Storage bucket, we were able to find the coverage reports for cURL (for future reference, you can get there through the <a href="https://oss-fuzz-introspector.storage.googleapis.com/index.html">OSS-Fuzz introspector page</a>). <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-coverage/curl/reports/20220928/linux/src/curl/lib/report.html">Here’s a report</a> from September 28, 2022, at the start of our engagement.</p>
<p>Reading the report, we quickly noticed that several source files were receiving almost no coverage, including some files that implemented security features or were responsible for handling untrusted data. For instance, hsts.c, which provides functions for parsing and handling the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">Strict-Transport-Security</a></code> response header, had only 4.46% line coverage, 18.75% function coverage, and 2.56% region coverage after over five years on OSS-Fuzz:</p>

<p>An investigation of the fuzzing code revealed why these numbers were so low. The first problem was that the corpora directory was missing test cases that included the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> and <code>Alt-Svc</code> headers, which meant there was no way for the fuzzer to quickly jump into testing these regions of the codebase for bugs; it would have to use coverage feedback to construct these test cases by itself, which is usually a slow(er) process.</p>
<p>The second issue was that the fuzzer never set the <code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTS.html">CURLOPT_HSTS</a></code> option, which instructs libcurl to use an HSTS cache file. As a result, HSTS was never enabled during runs of the fuzzer, and most code paths in <code>hsts.c</code> were never hit.</p>
<p>The final impediment to achieving good coverage of HSTS was an issue with its specification, which tells user agents to ignore the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header when sent over unencrypted HTTP. However, this creates a problem in the context of fuzzing: from the perspective of our fuzzing target, which never stood up an actual TLS connection, every connection was unencrypted, and <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> was always ignored. For <code>Alt-Svc</code>, libcurl already included a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/72652c0613d37ce18e99cca17a42887f12ad43da/lib/http.c#L3735-L3740">workaround</a> to relax the HTTPS requirement for debug builds when a certain environment variable was set (although curl-fuzzer did not set this variable). So, resolving this issue was just a matter of adding a similar feature for HSTS to libcurl and ensuring that curl-fuzzer set all necessary environment variables.</p>
<p>Our changes to address these issues were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>We added seed files for <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> and <code>Alt-Svc</code> to curl-fuzzer (<a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/commit/ee7fad2a2869ea3030c1b8d471ff90f51411a5ee">ee7fad2</a>).</li>
<li>We enabled <code>CURLOPT_HSTS</code> in curl-fuzzer (<a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/commit/0dc42e4a8f3ec6a6e7074536cd821e18e10243d4#diff-f50315868d5149f08fd9d32ba6606b3c1f92c29f50801d8921bc586e23bcf3e3R205">0dc42e4</a>).</li>
<li>We added a check to allow debug builds of libcurl to bypass the HTTPS restriction for HSTS when the <code>CURL_HSTS_HTTP</code> environment variable is set, and we set the <code>CURL_HSTS_HTTP</code> and <code>CURL_ALTSVC_HTTP</code> environment variables in curl-fuzzer (<a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6efb6b1e772934da9f3bc0d5dba5420da14ce587">6efb6b1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/commit/937597c51ecdc7a4140737bfb1e8ed7f24eb4397">937597c</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The day after our changes were merged upstream, OSS-Fuzz <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-coverage/curl/reports/20221016/linux/src/curl/lib/report.html">reported</a> a significant bump in coverage for both files:</p>

<h3>Sowing the seeds of bugs</h3>
<p>Exploring curl-fuzzer further, we saw a number of other opportunities to boost coverage. One low-hanging fruit we spotted was the set of seed files found in the corpora directory. While libcurl supports numerous protocols (<a href="https://curl.se/docs/features.html">some</a> of which surprised us!) and features, not all of them were represented as seed files in the corpora. This is important: as we alluded to earlier, a comprehensive set of initial test cases, touching on as much major functionality as possible, acts as a shortcut to attaining coverage and significantly cuts down on the time spent fuzzing before bugs are found.</p>
<p>The functionality we created new seed files for, with the hope of promoting new coverage, included (<code><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/commit/ee7fad2a2869ea3030c1b8d471ff90f51411a5ee">ee7fad2</a></code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS.html">CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS</a></code>: Sets protocol-specific login options for IMAP, LDAP, POP3, and SMTP</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER.html">CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER</a></code>: Specifies an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Access Token to use with HTTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, and SMTP servers</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USERPWD.html">CURLOPT_USERPWD</a></code>: Specifies a username and password to use for authentication</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USERAGENT.html">CURLOPT_USERAGENT</a></code>: Specifies the value of the User-Agent header</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256.html">CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256</a></code>: Sets the expected SHA256 hash of the remote server for an SSH connection</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPPOST.html">CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</a></code>: Sets POST request data. curl-fuzzer had been using only the <code>CURLOPT_MIMEPOST</code> option to achieve this, while the similar but deprecated <code>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</code> option wasn’t exercised. We also added support for this older method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain other CURLOPTs, as with CURLOPT_HSTS in the previous section, made more sense to set globally in the fuzzer’s initialization function. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE.html">CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</a></code>: Points to a filename to read cookies from. It also enables fuzzing of the cookie engine, which parses cookies from responses and includes them in future requests.</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR.html">CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR</a></code>: Allows fuzzing the code responsible for saving in-memory cookies to a file</li>
<li><code><a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CRLFILE.html">CURLOPT_CRLFILE</a></code>: Specifies the certificate revocation list file to read for TLS connections</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where to go from here</h3>
<p>As we started to understand more about curl-fuzzer’s internals, we drew up several strategic recommendations to improve the fuzzer’s efficacy that the timeline of our engagement didn’t allow us to implement ourselves. We presented these recommendations to the cURL team in our <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/b01cf46259ff4cc601b06466af92fb5837aa6c3d/reviews/2022-12-curl-securityreview.pdf">final report</a>, and expand on a few of them below.</p>
<h4>Dictionaries</h4>
<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a> are a feature of libFuzzer that can be especially useful for the text-based protocols spoken by libcurl. The dictionary for a protocol is a file enumerating the strings that are interesting in the context of the protocol, such as keywords, delimiters, and escape characters. Providing a dictionary to libFuzzer may increase its search speed and lead to the faster discovery of new bugs.</p>
<p>curl-fuzzer already takes advantage of this feature <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/blob/4f046b3b1cf2f4f6c06b7256472a5a45a507d621/ossconfig/http.dict">for the HTTP target</a>, but currently supplies no dictionaries for the numerous other protocols supported by libcurl. We recommend that the cURL team create dictionaries for these protocols to boost the fuzzer’s speed. This may be a good use case for an LLM; ChatGPT can generate a starting point dictionary in response to the following prompt (replace <code></code> with the name of the target protocol):</p>
<p><span><code>A dictionary can be used to guide the fuzzer. A dictionary is passed as a file to the fuzzer. The simplest input accepted by libFuzzer is an ASCII text file where each line consists of a quoted string. Strings can contain escaped byte sequences like "\xF7\xF8". Optionally, a key-value pair can be used like hex_value="\xF7\xF8" for documentation purposes. Comments are supported by starting a line with #. Write me an example dictionary file for a &lt;PROTOCOL&gt; parser.</code></span></p>
<h4>argv fuzzing</h4>
<p>During our first engagement with curl, one of us joked, “Have we tried <code>curl AAAAAAAAAA…</code> yet?” There turned out to be a lot of wisdom behind this quip; it spurred us to fuzz curl’s command-line interface (CLI), which yielded multiple vulnerabilities (see our blog post, <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/02/14/curl-audit-fuzzing-libcurl-command-line-interface/">cURL audit: How a joke led to significant findings</a>).</p>
<p>This CLI fuzzing was performed using AFL++’s <code><a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/c0c985a2781f84313db80eea3662ec88fb264292/utils/argv_fuzzing/argv-fuzz-inl.h">argv-fuzz-inl.h</a></code> header file. The header defines macros that allow a target program to build the <code>argv</code> array containing command-line arguments from fuzzer-provided data on standard input. We recommend that the cURL team use this feature from AFL++ to continuously fuzz cURL’s CLI (implementation details can be found in the blog post linked above).</p>
<h4>Structure-aware fuzzing</h4>
<p>One of curl-fuzzer’s weaknesses is intrinsic to the way it currently structures its inputs, which is with a custom Type-length-value (TLV) format. A TLV scheme (or something similar) can be useful for fuzzing a project like libcurl, which supports a wealth of global and protocol-specific options and parameters that need to be encoded in test cases.</p>
<p>However, the brittleness of this binary format makes the fuzzer inefficient. This is because libFuzzer has no idea about the structure that inputs are supposed to adhere to. curl-fuzzer expects input data in a strict format: a 2-byte field for the record type (of which only 52 were valid at the time of our engagement), a 4-byte field for the length of the data, and finally the data itself. Because libFuzzer doesn’t take this format into account, most of the mutations it generates wind up being invalid at the TLV-unpacking stage and <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/blob/9e099a0ed0252c609eb3c99afe44b0d8c6993ad8/curl_fuzzer.cc#L62-L65">have to be thrown out</a>. Google’s fuzzing guidance <a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/58c45f6314520b2432252eaf767a7a7967916326/docs/split-inputs.md#type-length-value">warns</a> about using TLV inputs for this reason.</p>
<p>As a result, the coverage feedback used to guide mutations toward interesting code paths performs much worse than it would if we dealt only with raw data. In fact, libcurl may contain bugs that will never be found with the current naive TLV strategy.</p>
<p>So, how can the cURL team address this issue while keeping the flexibility of a TLV format? Enter <a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/458f6edca28e780dea246b4eab655eb63d0c4cdd/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md#structure-aware-fuzzing-with-libfuzzer">structure-aware fuzzing</a>.</p>
<p>The idea with structure-aware fuzzing is to assist libFuzzer by writing a <em>custom mutator</em>. At a high level, the custom mutator’s job comprises just three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to unpack the input data coming from libFuzzer as a TLV.</li>
<li>If the data can’t be parsed into a valid TLV, instead of throwing it away, return a syntactically correct dummy TLV. This can be anything, as long as it can be successfully unpacked.</li>
<li>If the data does constitute a valid TLV, mutate the fields parsed out in step 1 by calling the <code>LLVMFuzzerMutate</code> function. Then, serialize the mutated fields and return the resultant TLV.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this approach, no time is wasted discarding inputs because every input is valid; the mutator only ever creates correctly structured TLVs. Performing mutations at the level of the decoded data (rather than at the level of the encoding scheme) allows better coverage feedback, which leads to a faster and more effective fuzzer.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-fuzzer/issues/32">open issue</a> on curl-fuzzer proposes several changes, including an implementation of structure-aware fuzzing, but there hasn’t been any movement on it since 2019. We strongly recommend that the cURL team revisit the subject, as it has the potential to significantly improve the fuzzer’s ability to find bugs.</p>
<h3>Our 2023 follow-up</h3>
<p>At the end of 2023, we had the chance to revisit cURL and its fuzzing code in another <a href="https://ostif.org/curl-audit-complete/">audit supported by OSTIF</a>. Stay tuned for the highlights of our follow-up work in a future blog post.</p>

</div><div>
																								
<p>One Atlanta resident has taken it upon himself to clean the streets of nails, screws and other metal bits that have been left to accumulate in large amounts.</p>



<p>Known as the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/atlantamagnetman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta Magnet Man</a>,” Alex Benigno bikes around Atlanta with a hitched trailer that uses magnets to attract metal debris that poses a risk to people’s car tires.&nbsp;The idea is completely his own, and he does it for free. </p>



<p>“I can’t really find anybody that says what I’m doing is a terrible thing unless, you know, they own a tire shop,” he said.</p></div><div>



<p>Benigno, a native Atlantan, first identified the problem early in the COVID-19 pandemic when roads were empty. </p>



<p>During work commutes, his car and motorcycle tires were damaged by nails. After he realized how many more drivers would be affected when traffic conditions returned to normal, he worked to find a solution.</p>



<p>“I like to randomly do things to help when nobody’s looking,” Benigno said. “I’ll do just random stuff to help improve things that will benefit random people that I’ve never met before … it’s just so that I can do a little thing to fix something so somebody doesn’t suffer down the road.”</p>



<p>In June 2023, Benigno first equipped his bike trailer with magnets. After several months of trial and error, he found the perfect configuration for the trailer and has been riding consistently since last December.</p>



<p>Nearly every day, Benigno bikes about 10 miles and picks up around six pounds of debris — about the max the magnets can carry. Over the course of eight weeks, he collected over 410 pounds of metal, recently donating it to a local scrap artist.</p>



<p>Benigno started documenting his journeys on Instagram and has amassed over 22,000 followers since January. His most popular video, with nearly 2 million views on Instagram, shows footage of the magnets as he bikes along I-285 and S. Atlanta Road.</p>




<pba-video :video="{

    id: 'ADkw9oo_L_c',
    options: {
      autoplay: 0,
    }
  }">
  </pba-video>







<p>So far, he said the roads he’s biked with the most debris are South Cobb Drive in Smyrna and Grassdale Road in Cartersville.</p>



<p>Thanks to a successful <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/clean-up-glass-from-atlantas-bike-lanes?member=32248187&amp;sharetype=teams&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;utm_content=ai_variant_ios_no_ai&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=instagram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe campaign</a>, he was able to cover the cost of a bike lane sweeper prototype. And although he’s not motivated to make a fortune, he said it’d be cool just to earn a living wage cleaning streets full-time.</p>



		<pba-embed css="" script="" code="<blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;><p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>Fundraiser by Alex Benigno : Clean up glass from Atlanta’s bike lanes <a href=&quot;https://t.co/JH7MrDu8sE&quot;>https://t.co/JH7MrDu8sE</a></p>&amp;mdash; Chris Test (@ChrisTest82) <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChrisTest82/status/1756016107360542954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;>February 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script type=&quot;application/javascript&quot;  async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;></script>">
	</pba-embed>



<p>“If I never got any recognition for this, I’d still be doing it anyway because it’s so effective,” he said.</p>



<p>Although magnetic sweepers are used for things like airport runways and at Air Force bases, it would be impossible to use them on streets riddled with metal plates, grates and manhole covers. Benigno is able to dodge those obstacles on a bike — usually. And while Atlanta does quarterly street sweeping, metal debris still falls through the cracks.</p>



<p>Rebecca Serna, the executive director of PropelATL (formerly the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition), said Benigno is highlighting a real need in Atlanta’s public services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What Alex is doing is incredible, and we’re really inspired by it,” Serna said. “But also we want to see the city invest in the systems and the people in the equipment so that they can maintain our public infrastructure.”</p>



<p>The Atlanta Department of Transportation and the Department of Public Works both play a part in the safety of the streets. Atlanta’s transportation department&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.letspropelatl.org/2024-policy-infrastructure-recommendations#Budget" rel="noreferrer noopener">budget was cut</a>&nbsp;by 12% last year. She said that about $50 million is three times less than peer cities.</p>



<p>PropelATL is particularly focused on keeping bike lanes clean and safe. She says the city doesn’t have street sweepers that can reach separated bike lanes, so all sorts of debris don’t get cleaned and pose a risk to people in motion.</p>



<p>“People using scooters and bikes, Onewheels, skateboards, wheelchairs are all affected by debris in the street, and especially in the separated bike [lane],” she said.</p>



<p>For now, it’s up to individuals to keep the streets clean.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks … they’re kind of DIY-ing it until we can get the level of public service that we really need.”</p>

Somewhat out of place next to a modern mirrored-window building, situated on the lip of a roundabout, the 200 year-old Church of Holy Transfiguration caters to the faithful of a large mining town that dates back to the era of Peter the Great. Inside, Father Konstantin Baiazov performs the customary rites and rituals for his flock. Dark and bearded, with a short, military-style buzz cut, the church’s archpriest’s routine is standard – services twice a day. Father Konstantin inherited the job — and the calling — from his own father, a revered Orthodox priest who, as local legend goes, had challenged the authority of the formidable KGB during Soviet times. </p><p>Konstantin, the father of three, used to travel abroad. He liked visiting Europe, and was particularly fond of Rome. However, he has not left Russia since September 2020. Since the fifth of that month, Father Baiazov’s official passport, numbered 763391844, has not belonged to a man of God. Rather, it belongs to someone who wears a different kind of white collar, looks a lot like him, and is the most wanted man in Europe.</p><p>For more than four years, Jan Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of the disgraced German financial services company Wirecard, has been living in Russia under this assumed identity, a year-long investigation by <em>The Insider, Der Spiegel,</em> <em>ZDF, </em>and <em>Der</em> <em>Standard </em>has uncovered. Wirecard, the German equivalent to PayPal was once a DAX-30 listed company, one of the wealthiest traded entities on the German stock exchange, with a valuation of $28 billion. Then came June 2020, when, in the midst of an audit, Wirecard could not locate €1.9 billion in assets it claimed were being held somewhere in the world – Russia, the United Arab Emirates or the Philippines. In fact, the money didn’t exist. Wirecard’s worth was predicated on commissions supposedly earned from three companies, Al Alam, Senjo and PayEasy, based in Dubai, Singapore and Manila, respectively. Wirecard money flowed into all three but the only documented flows in reverse existed in the German conglomerate’s imagination. Or, as the now imprisoned former CEO Markus Braun claims, it had been funneled away to a complex web of offshore accounts controlled by his then number two, Jan Marsalek.</p><p>Marsalek, the man responsible for overseeing the forging of company records, money-laundering, and extensive espionage and harassment campaigns against the journalists and speculators who exposed the enormity of Wirecard’s graft, fled in a sinuous route from Germany to Austria to Belarus to Moscow on June 19, 2020, at a moment when COVID-19 lockdowns made movement across borders more difficult than usual for ordinary citizens. But Marsalek is not only an internationally accused swindler. He is also an agent of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service, and he has been for the last decade. More recently, since his defection to Russia, he has also done jobs for the FSB.</p><p><em>The Insider</em>’s investigation is based mainly on confidential documents, emails, and chat transcripts, as well mobile phone and travel data. Research into Marsalek’s past also included interviews conducted by our consortium partners with people close to the accused. Among these are his mother and his longtime recruiter-handler, whom <em>Der Spiegel</em> met up with in February at a five-star hotel in Dubai.  </p><p>The never-before-told story of how the Austrian-born “whiz kid” was recruited to Russia’s largest and most notorious spy agency, the GRU, bears all the hallmarks of a genre-bending ham thriller. Sacha Baron Cohen as Bernie Madoff the Bond villain. It is a saga replete with honey traps, MiG fighter jets, erotic models, sinister ex-spooks, even more sinister mercenaries, counterfeit passports, fake priests taking Syphilis tests, and cheap disguises. More ominously, the story also involves surveillance and kidnapping plots, including surveillance targeting a member of the team that investigated Marsalek’s case, Christo Grozev.</p><h3 id="article_block_0">“World Domination”</h3><p>Born in Vienna on March 15, 1980, and raised in the nearby suburb of Klosterneuburg, Jan Marsalek was, in the recollections of his mother, a “presumptuous show-off.” Marsalek’s father was a Czech factory worker who eventually became managing director of a company in the newly independent Czech Republic — “a small man with small ideas,” in the words of his eldest son. Marsalek’s parents divorced when he was a teenager, and he would remain estranged from his family from that point on. </p></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/9ERv1UWo-3gts4amcnM-8DJnecewMzIC1NML6E3VZwA/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NDkv/ZmlsZS1jMmYxNDA1/YzhjODc5MWUwOWY0/MmJmODdhMTU1ODY1/MC5wbmc.jpg" alt="Childhood photos of Jan Marsalek"></p></div></figure></div></div><p><h5>Childhood photos of Jan Marsalek</h5></p></div><div><p>Growing up, everyone recalls, the young Marsalek had two principal talents: he could talk, and he could charm. “A sales genius, a catcher of people,” says a former friend. Even at an early age, Marsalek seemed to be mugging for the cameras as an international man of mystery. One photo from his boyhood shows him in a gray trench coat and oversized floppy hat — the secret agent as envisaged by Titin. He was tall, around 5’11, slim and fond of martial arts, always with a close-cropped haircut. He was educated at Vienna’s Lycée Français, and by the time he left, Marsalek could speak several languages, including computer code. Clearly, his outsized ambitions matched his capacity for persuading others to facilitate his realization of them. </p><p>Wirecard was founded in 1999 in Munich at the height of the dotcom boom as a credit card payment processor for online vendors. Then as now, the internet’s truly big business came from revenues connected to gambling and pornography, paid for by Visa and Mastercard customers whose “discretely charged” debits Wirecard was all too happy to transact — for a commission. And if that eventually meant miscategorizing transactions for newly proscribed online gambling sites, so what?</p><p>The CEO of the company was Markus Braun, a former KPMG consultant from a middle-class family in Vienna. Braun modeled his appearance on Steve Jobs, always wearing a black turtleneck and wire-frame eyeglasses, even if the tech visionary look was undercut by the clashing black sports jacket Braun insisted on wearing as part of the outfit. With his alleged PhD in social and economic sciences, Doktor Braun wanted to be taken seriously by the Central European financial elite, but he lacked the charisma and ostentatiousness necessary to sell an emerging tech company. </p><p>Enter Marsalek. Braun recruited him from a two-man startup to Wirecard a year after its formation, on Marsalek’s 20th birthday. Even though he held no university degree, the “whiz kid” was immediately branded the company’s chief technology officer. </p><p>His first major act was a major screw-up, albeit a characteristically self-interested one. Marsalek unwisely “routed all of the company’s internet traffic through his own PC, rather than the dedicated hardware in the server room – a set-up ideal for snooping,” writes <em>Financial Times </em>reporter Dan McCrum, author of the 2022 book <em>Money Men</em>, which chronicles the rise and fall of Wirecard, and his own role in becoming the subject of a well-financed vilification campaign for his muckraking reporting.</p><p>A favorite word of Marsalek’s was “brilliant,” which he’d use to describe things that impressed or amused him, very often because they involved some form of corner-cutting — if not outright con artistry. Marsalek’s icon in business was a fellow Austrian, Dietrich Mateschitz, the creator and promoter of the energy drink Red Bull, which outsourced production and distribution to others while keeping the profits for itself. Marsalek seemed fond of generating money on the back of a highly touted idea without any tangible product undergirding it, a real-life Joe MacMillan, the fast-talking, overpromising Silicon Valley guru in the TV series <em>Halt and Catch Fire.</em> But whereas the fictional MacMillan was an incorrigible idealist who serially failed in his poorly executed revolutions in personal computing, the all too real Marsalek reveled in being a hollow man. A new software for more secure payment processing? He spent months talking it up, and getting the Wirecard sales team to do likewise, with nothing but scraps of nonsense code to show for it. Any other company might have gone under. Instead, Wirecard ballooned, relentlessly acquiring subsidiaries and subcontractors including prepaid card concerns and smaller payment processing outfits overseas.</p><p>In most cases, the paper trails led nowhere — or, more specifically, they led to shell companies whose nominal directors worked out of slapdash offices atop fast food joints in Bahrain, or that consisted of the unsuspecting local population of an impoverished former steel town in Consett, County Durham, England, where residents were compensated fifty quid for every company they registered. One Wirecard partner was in fact a Filipino family, doorstopped at their villa three hours’ drive north of Manila while in the middle of grooming their poodle with clippers. </p><p>The entire empire ran on a Ponzi scheme dedicated to moving money from one Wirecard account into another — a process euphemistically called “round tripping” — and raising ever more cash from deceived shareholders taken in by the smoke and mirrors. More impressive was how Wirecard dealt with critics, the hedge fund analysts and short sellers and financial journalists who were onto its fraud and who, thanks to Marsalek’s silky evasions and dirty tricks, were for years cast as the real criminals in the company’s saga. Wirecard hired goons and snoops who spied on and hacked its enemies, which included the <em>FT’s </em>McCrum, who himself became the target of a German financial regulatory investigation thanks to lies told by the company. Marsalek’s<em> </em>money-launderers exploited Germany’s sterling reputation for commercial probity and Berlin’s defensiveness about its prized Bavarian asset to boost Wirecard’s market capitalization. All the while, Marsalek enjoyed the high life, zipping around the world on a private jet, entertaining associates and casual acquaintances, dropping a grand a pop on bottles of Château Haut-Brion or €15,000 on dinner at the Mandarin Oriental.</p><p>Until the entire thing came crashing down in June 2020, thanks in no small part to forensic accountants at KPMG, Wirecard CEO Markus Braun’s former employer. They realized, in the words of Dan McCrum, that Wirecard’s “core European payment processing operations made no profit at all.”</p><p>“The problem with us Austrians,” Marsalek liked to quip around the office, “is we always want world domination.”</p><h3 id="article_block_1">Blood Lust</h3></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/oCM8Uzv89SKK6XfduVE19P_nlLXubXigCylCf9obD5Q/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NTAv/ZmlsZS0xMGVkY2Rk/OWU3NTNjNDgwN2Rk/MWEyMWYxNmQ1ZDJk/Yi5wbmc.jpg" alt="Natalia Zlobina, Marsalek’s girlfriend, who introduces him to GRU recruiter Stanislav Petlinsky."></p></div></figure></div></div><p><h5>Natalia Zlobina, Marsalek’s girlfriend, who introduces him to GRU recruiter Stanislav Petlinsky.</h5></p></div><div><p>Taking over the word usually involves conquering Moscow. Braun’s relationship with the great and the not-so-good of the Austrian establishment opened that door. </p><p>Florian Stermann was the chairman of the Russian-Austrian Friendship Society and a fixer for the right-wing populist Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ). Thanks to Stermann, Wirecard had entered into negotiations for the provision of wireless payment technology with three Russian mobile operators. One of these projects was a joint venture with the mobile giant Megafon to provide NFC payment services to the Moscow Metro, a sprawling subway system that serves more than seven million passengers daily. That one was delegated to Marsalek. But by 2013, the project with Megafon had come to a halt as negotiations with the city-owned subway operator stalled after Megafon began pursuing the development of an in-house solution for NFC payments. Other attempts to offer Wirecard’s payment technology to Russian counterparts also failed, either because Wirecard’s solutions were too expensive or due to delays on the German side.</p><p>The Megafon failure wasn’t Marsalek’s first in Russia. Beginning in July 2010, not long after he was elevated from chief geek to chief operating officer at Wirecard, Marsalek began traveling to the country, sometimes making as many as four trips a month. In the space of the next decade, he would visit Russia more than sixty times, with the highest concentration of visits occurring between 2013 and 2016 — exactly when Wirecard’s attempts to export their business eastward were coming to dust. </p><p>This was because Marsalek had found new dissipations in Russia, one of them in the form of a tall blonde putative deal-saver named Natalia Zlobina. Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, the then 29-year-old Zlobina was already an advertising executive. However, she was more recognizable from her previous career in erotic modeling and B-movie acting, where her best-known feature was <em>Red Lips 2 – Blood Lust</em>, a sexy-schlocky vampire flick in which the thirteen-year-old Zlobina plays a Russian secret agent who kills her victims using a nerve agent.</p><p>In a fitting turn of life-imitating-art, Zlobina became a Russian spy. </p><p>When she met Marsalek, Zlobina claimed to have an investor who could set up an entity for Wirecard to do business with in Russia. In August 2013, she even incorporated a company called ByteMax Ltd. as a payment facilitation start-up intended to be the German giant’s main Russian partner. She was one of two shareholders, the other being a business partner of Dimitri Pyankovski, who was Moscow’s head of electronic payment services. Everything seemed poised for success.</p><p>Email correspondence and travel records reviewed by <em>The Insider</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em> show that, over the ensuing years, Marsalek and Zlobina’s relationship became an intertwined mix of business and personal pursuits. Despite Zlobina’s connections in Moscow, the former didn’t go so well for Wirecard. ByteMax ran up a large bill to Marsalek’s company that it didn’t have the funds to repay. But Marsalek hardly minded. His emails to Zlobina show he’d taken to coaching her on how and to whom at Wirecard she should address her requests for extensions to the payment deadlines. The dues were never repaid. ByteMax was wound down.</p><p>At the same time, the personal relationship between Marsalek and his protege blossomed. The two traveled both together and separately in Russia and abroad, with Wirecard fronting the costs for some of the trips. Emails show Marsalek’s personal assistant booking travel for Zlobina to Barcelona in March 2015; she stayed at a ​​€695-a-night hotel. Marsalek would sometimes fly into Russia on his private jet just to pick up Zlobina and then fly on to the Greek island of Santorini for a weekend getaway. They were more than associates; they were lovers.</p><p>And they liked it rough. Marsalek was drawn to BDSM, and so was Natalia. They were also drawn to others for whom violence was less a leisure activity than a means of retaining political power. </p><p>Travel records show that Marsalek and Zlobina traveled in September 2013 to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Witnesses have told <em>Der Spiegel</em> the purpose of the unlikely tourist trip was to meet the family of Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin-installed strongman president of the region. Kadyrov’s clan had a few hundred million squirreled away in banks in Hong Kong, and they needed a way to move it to Europe without arousing any suspicions. According to Zlobina, by then <em>au fait </em>with Wirecard’s global network of matryoshka companies and their dummy deposits, Marsalek was the Kadyrov clan’s man for the job. According to witnesses, two additional meetings between Marsalek and the Kadyrov family were arranged — one in Vienna and another in Asia, the site of the dirty money. On the Chechen side in Vienna was the silver-haired Akhmed Pakaev, who claimed to be a major from the FSB, Russia’s Federal Security Service and one of the successors to the Soviet-era KGB. Leaked Russian bank credit records examined by <em>The Insider</em> show Pakaev had previously served as a Russian representative to Interpol.</p><p>In January 2014, Marsalek jetted Zlobina to Kyiv at the very moment when the Ukrainian capital was mired in a protest movement against its pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, who at Putin’s prompting and financial encouragement had reneged on a campaign promise to sign an association agreement with the European Union. By the time the power couple arrived, the Euromaidan movement was already under physical threat from officers of the Yanukovych-loyal Berkut riot police and plain clothes hired thugs called <em>titushki</em>. The anti-revolutionary activities were being orchestrated by the FSB’s Fifth Service, the Russian organization’s foreign intelligence arm. In Kyiv, Marsalek and Zlobina again met with Pakaev, who had arrived in Ukraine in November at the start of Euromaidan for purposes that can only be guessed at. </p><p>Leaked emails show that Pakaev introduced Marsalek to Konstantin Torop, the self-styled director of the International Police Corporation for Public Security, a non-government militia that has reportedly been <a href="https://podrobnosti.ua/736957-interpol-zainteresovalsja-ukrainskoj-politsejskoj-korporatsiej.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigated</a> by Interpol over accusations that it was impersonating a public police body. In one letter to Marsalek, who used an email<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/wirecard-jan-marsalek-bahnte-offenbar-kauf-von-spionagesoftware-an-a-9ee27215-c572-42e7-9436-7e4325975c3b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> account that itself spoofed a state official</a> from Grenada (jan.<a href="https://theins.ru/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3954584b4a58555c52794a4d584d5c565f5e4b5c57585d5817564b5e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span data-cfemail="54393526273538313f1427203520313b323326313a3530357a3b2633">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>), Torop informed him that, on Pakaev’s recommendation, Marsalek had been issued a membership ID from the “police” organization.</p><p>Marsalek and Zlobina continued to travel, and not only to earthly destinations. In May 2016, Zlobina booked her boyfriend on a flight into the stratosphere aboard a Russian MiG fighter jet. But while images of the lovebirds on their adrenaline-filled extreme romantic getaways were known to Russian social and business elites at the time, the affair remained a mystery to all but a few employees at Wirecard. Back in Munich, Marsalek was involved in a steady, long-term relationship with Viola, his German girlfriend and eventual fiancée. The COO even boasted to his Russian friends that he’d relocated Viola to Hamburg, making it easier for Zlobina to visit him in Munich without any worry she might bump into her rival.</p></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/RXIsnxt6v4vmmX7RsnnWHrj0QcB8_vn6-WDOBl7ZshA/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NTEv/ZmlsZS00NzA0NDg1/YmVhNGI5ZWI2OTM4/ODFiMDIwNjY3ZWQw/NS5wbmc.jpg" alt="At the top, Natalia Zlobina and Jan Marsalek pictured together.

The three megawatt farm, called<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180626184045/http:/atlasmine.io:80/#whitepapper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Atlas Mine</a>, was built with equipment purchased by Marsalek through offshore accounts using a UK intermediary. The project followed Marsalek’s tried-and-true method of revenue generation: a pyramid scheme in which for the low, low price of $100, investors were guaranteed enormous returns within the space of six months and continuing in perpetuity. The prospectus for Atlas Mine’s initial coin offering (ICO) also referred to a previous project by the same operator, this one based in China. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OONL7jzbKcM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> YouTube video</a> uploaded in May 2018 shows the installation process and “operational” phase of what appears to be a large crypto mining farm. It is not known how many, if any, investors the ICO project attracted. Its website has been defunct since at least 2021.</p><p>It is also unknown whether Zlobina’s work for the Russian security services preceded or followed her personal and professional involvement with Marsalek, but in any case, she certainly enjoyed the kinds of unusual state protections typically associated with Russian intelligence operatives. For instance, her passport dossier — something usually obtainable through the transparent Russian personal data trading market on the dark web — was replaced by another woman’s file when <em>The Insider </em>attempted to acquire it. Subsequent attempts to retrieve the file were returned with a “missing person” notification. Likewise, all of Zlobina’s travel records for the two years after Marsalek fled to Russia have been purged from the comprehensive Russian database, Magistral - arguably, lest someone was able to trace the fugitive Austrian via his then girlfriend. Previously such deletions have been seen in the cases of Russia spies and undercover operatives, such as Vadim Krasikov, the FSB hit man who fatally gunned down Zelinkham Khangoshvili, a Chechen war veteran turned Georgian intelligence asset, in Berlin’s Tiergarten park in August 2019. (Krasikov, convicted in 2021, is currently serving a life sentence in German prison.)</p><p>Was Zlobina sent to honeytrap Marsalek, or was she just one of the several spooks and ex-spooks the German executive became entangled with over the years, whether for business or pleasure? Was this one of the tall blondes he just happened to sleep with, or had Zlobina been tasked with offering her services, as it were, to the Wirecard operator in order to talent-spot him for recruitment?</p><h3 id="article_block_2">Stas, the General from GRU</h3></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/ORvsS1Vdf3TiJKRQN-c2-Ia2P1sZHzPqRDK1W--N98U/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NTIv/ZmlsZS0xNGM5MmQy/NmJkYzU5Y2JmMTJi/OWM4YjRjNzRjYzJh/YS5wbmc.jpg" alt="Jan Marsalek and Stanislav Petlinsky celebrating Petlinsky’s birthday at the Munich restaurant &quot;Tantris&quot;."></p></div></figure></div></div><p><h5>Jan Marsalek and Stanislav Petlinsky celebrating Petlinsky’s birthday at the Munich restaurant "Tantris".</h5></p></div><div><p>On July 6, 2014, Zlobina turned 30. It was also the day Marsalek met his GRU handler.</p><p>Zlobina was waiting for her beau aboard a dingy Greek-flagged cutter, “Poseidon III,” in the Mediterranean waters off the coast of Nice. Marsalek arrived with a second man, who was carrying his suitcase. Marsalek climbed down a ladder into the vessel and gave Zlobina a perfunctory peck on the cheek. He was clearly angry, which was the point of this vignette, captured on marina security camera footage retrieved by <em>Der Spiegel</em>. The Poseidon III was a ruse, Natasha’s joke, and whether by accident or design, two years later, the Greek god of the ocean would furnish the codename used to refer to Wirecard in a bogus corporate merger scheme with a French merchant technology company, Ingenico. That scheme was designed — and then publicly leaked — to gin up Wirecard’s share prices.</p><p>Zlobina’s birthday gift to Marsalek — or maybe to herself — was an introduction aboard the yacht to a man named Stanislav Petlinsky. Zlobina introduced Marsalek to Petlinsky as “Stas, the general from GRU.” At the time, Petlinsky was dating Zlobina’s best friend, and she promised Marsalek that “Stas” would be a terrific addition to his thickening rolodex of influential Russian contacts. </p><p>So he would. </p><p>In the 90s, Petlinsky had been a supervising officer in the GRU Spetsnaz, or special forces, and fought in Chechnya. He spent that floating evening with Marsalek regaling him with his exploits — particularly as a marksman, as Marsalek expressed an interest in guns. Petlinsky’s exact rank and role in Russian intelligence — hinted at by the man himself to an intimate circle of contacts, either in truth or as provocatively sprinkled bits of disinformation aimed at burnishing his legend — is murky, but Western spy agencies do not doubt that his employer is the Russian state.</p><p>Among those Petlinsky has regaled is a reporter from <em>Der Spiegel</em>. That conversation occurred mere weeks ago at the Jumeirah al-Naseem beach resort in Dubai — amid a plentiful selection of champagne, Beluga caviar, and young Russian women.</p><p>Petlinsky is found sitting on the terrace overlooking the Persian Gulf. Not far from him is another Russian, Alexander Lebedev, the ex-KGB officer turned oligarch and publishing magnate who controls Britain’s <em>Independent</em> and <em>Evening Standard</em> newspapers. The two clearly know each other and nod a silent greeting.</p><p>Trim at 60, dressed in a gray pinstripe, black tee, and mirrored aviator sunglasses, Petlinsky confirms meeting Marsalek aboard the yacht in Nice in July 2014. “You know, I fell in love with him from the first moment,” he said. “He has such a beautiful mind. I always think so small, in dimensions of what’s possible,” he continues, echoing Marsalek’s own animadversions about his own father. “Jan always thinks big, very, very big.” Being chancellor of Germany? Too small for Marsalek. “But uniting China, Russia, and Europe as a counterbalance to the USA, that would interest him.” </p><p>Fancy toys and women aren’t Marsalek’s motivation, Petlinsky insists before describing the Austrian’s “beautiful mind” as being “a bit autistic.” While Marsalek’s acquaintances almost universally define him with the word “charisma,” Petlinsky says Marsalek’s weak point is dealing with people. “He lacks empathy,” the Russian spy says without noting that the trait is a telltale sign of the sociopath.</p><p>What about Marsalek’s espionage and Petlinsky’s responsibility for it? The Austrian is just playacting, Petlinsky maintains, inhabiting a theatrical role with no real-world legitimacy to it. Marsalek is “obsessed” with spycraft and all its mystique, something others also attest to. As for Petlinsky himself, he swears he’s merely a “security advisor” with a big portfolio in Africa, the kind of man who sometimes meets with Putin and chases down FSB agents. He offers a robust critique of the amateurish nature of the Khangoshvili assassination in Berlin — no small thing given that Putin has recently praised the killer Krasikov as a “patriot” in a much-discussed sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson. Petlinsky admits to introducing Marsalek to a host of colorful characters in Russia. He doesn’t want to talk about which ones were Russian intelligence officers, and he changes the subject. </p><p>But to his close circle of friends, <em>Der Spiegel</em> has learned, Petlinsky boasted about handing Marsalek off to the GRU after that first meeting in the South of France in 2014. Friends of Marsalek say the Wirecard fraudster’s life can be divided in two halves: “before Stas” and “after Stas.”</p><p>They traveled together, often as a trio, with Zlobina in tow. At one point, Petlinsky even told friends that he relocated his own mother, who suffered from health problems, to a clinic in Munich just to be closer to Marsalek, who built himself his own back office for Wirecard and other pursuits in a villa at Prinzregentenstraße 61, right in the center of the Bavarian capital. Johanna Singer, an employee of Wirecard (name has been changed on her request), recalled meeting Petlinsky at the gourmet Munich restaurant Tantris, where the GRU officer celebrated one of his birthdays with Marsalek, complete with a cake shaped in uncanny resemblance to the Soviet red star. One of the toniest areas of Munich, the high-ceilinged, white-columned digs cost 680,000 euro per year in rent, all paid for, of course, by Wirecard via its manifold holdings. A germaphobe in the mold of Donald Trump (the Wirecard executive somehow unsurprisingly owns a life-sized cut-out of the 45th U.S. President), Marsalek even had a field hospital built in the villa during the pandemic. The back office was conveniently situated directly across from the Russian consulate in Bavaria.</p><p>One trip Marsalek, Zlobina, and Petlinsky took was to Tunisia via private jet from Moscow in March 2016. The next month, they returned to Nice, the scene of Marsalek and Petlinsky’s meet-cute recruitment; then it was on to Tel Aviv. Stas pulled plenty of strings, as Russian border records demonstrate: much of his foreign travel is designated as “official visit to a diplomatic mission,” a category typically reserved for Russian Foreign Ministry officials. </p><h3 id="article_block_3">Marsalek's Mercenaries</h3><p>Stas was also a connector. </p><p>A proud owner of a Harley Davidson himself, he introduced Marsalek to a heavy-set man fond of Hells Angels attire, whom Petlinsky referred to as “Vladimir, my mercenary.” Vladimir’s actual name is Anatoliy Karaziy. Like Petlinsky, Karaziy is a former GRU Spetsnaz officer, and the two are thought to have served together in Chechnya. At the very least, the mercenary part of the story proved true, as Karaziy belonged to a guns-for-hire outfit that gained in infamy after its debut on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine in 2014. It was called the Wagner Group, and it was founded by catering magnate and ex-con Yevgeny Prigozhin, a personal friend of Putin’s from their native St. Petersburg.</p></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/yMH8tcSZ52JuOy5DQ2u47bQ2_CYifqRPziUQgGG5BLg/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NTMv/ZmlsZS00YjRiZWM3/NTA5NmE2YzgwMzNj/MTdmMzNjOWVjNDA0/My5wbmc.jpg" alt="Karaziy (second from right) in Chechnya circa 1996, and more recently at a gun show in Moscow."></p></div></figure></div></div><p><h5>Karaziy (second from right) in Chechnya circa 1996, and more recently at a gun show in Moscow.</h5></p></div><div><p>By 2017, Karaziy was the head of Wagner’s intelligence service. Travel data examined by <em>The Insider</em> confirms that on May 5, 2017, Karaziy flew from Moscow to Munich to meet with Petlinsky and Marsalek. From there, the three men flew to Beirut and then took a car into war-torn Syria, visiting the ancient city of Palmyra, which Russian forces backed by Wagner had recently captured from the terrorist group ISIS. The three men remained in Palmyra for a week, with Marsalek dressed as a soldier in aviator headgear, a flak jacket, and combat helmet (witnesses told Der Spiegel that Marsalek initially showed up dressed in brand-new state-of-the-art camouflage garb and military gear - a “shiny object in the desert” that would have attracted enemy fire within seconds; he was quickly given standard Russian attire to change into). He’s alleged to have shot live rounds at Islamist militants.  </p><p>In Dubai Petlinsky suggested the rounds had come from a rocket launcher, and that Marsalek had even been given a tutorial in how to position himself properly in order to fire it. The visit to Syria, Petlinsky says, was “a dream of Jan’s that I made come true… Jan imagined a helicopter flight and loud music and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Of course, that didn’t happen. Too dangerous.”</p></div><div><p>Another high-flying Russian to whom Petlinsky introduced Marsalek was Andrey Chuprygin, also a former GRU officer — a colonel — who worked for Petlinsky’s Center for Eastern Civilization Studies. Chuprygin was an academic, too, with a teaching job in African studies at the Moscow School of Economics. He also served as an adviser on Libya to Russia’s Foreign Ministry, a title Petlinsky even arranged for Marsalek to acquire. </p><p>Marsalek’s interest in Libya wasn’t confined to ego-gratifying honorifics from the Russian government. Upon his return from Syria, Petlinsky persuaded him to invest in the North African country, which was still reeling from the brutal civil war that ended Col. Muammar Gaddafi’s three decades of iron fisted rule. Someone recommended Marsalek buy cement factories, without which postwar Libyan reconstruction would be impossible. And he did. But as usual, Marsalek was thinking bigger.</p><p>In June 2017, Marsalek arranged to meet an Austrian UN worker named Kilian Kleinschmidt at the popular Munich cafe Käfer-Schänke. Kleinschmidt had decades of experience helping refugees get out of hot spots and, persuaded by Marsalek’s apparent concern for Libya’s wretched of the earth, he agreed to accept 200,000 euros to conduct a study on rebuilding the country. The invoice, Marsalek told Kleinschmidt, was to be sent to the Russian-Libyan Cultural Institute in Moscow. That should have been an immediate red flag. It was also bait. </p><p>At a second meeting, at Marsalek’s Prinzregentenstraße back office, Kleinschmidt was horrified to discover the Wirecard exec’s real intention: to train up a private army of 15,000 to 20,000 Libyan mercenaries who would be put in charge of guarding the country’s southern border and restricting migration flows at gunpoint — the opposite of Kleinschmidt’s life work. Marsalek even giddily recounted how mercenaries could be outfitted with state-of-the-art body cams to record “awesome video material” of them shooting people, which could be streamed live to the internet. Stas had told him all about how Wagner was using this technology already, the only hiccup being that the footage couldn’t be used for marketing purposes since Wagner had a habit of executing all of its POWs. Still, Marsalek and his “lack of empathy” wanted a brand all his own. Kleinschmidt could not escape the meeting fast enough. </p><p>The experienced UN worker was no longer an option, but Petlinsky had an alternative solution. Marsalek should enlist the services of a Russian private security company whose owner, Oleg Krinytsin, was also a Petlinsky acquaintance. Krinytsin’s outfit was RSB Group, one of Russia’s oldest PMCs, with international experience in Somalia, South Africa, Egypt, and Sri Lanka. Among its <a href="https://rsb-group.org/services/marine-operations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated achievements</a> were counter-terrorism operations and anti-piracy protection for marine vessels, a task that involved the use of non-lethal acoustic sound cannons.</p><p>Marsalek again had wider eyes than did his case officer. He didn’t just want to hire RSB Group; he wanted to buy it outright. Not only would he use it to clean up the cement company, he would have his private army on the ground in a strategic country in Northern Africa. Petlinsky negotiated a purchase price for RSB Group with Krinytsin. The deal was for Krinytsin to remain nominally as the public-facing owner, but to hand over the levers of control to Marsalek and Petlinsky. </p><p>The purchase price was paid in cash, which Marsalek provided to Stas in tranches of several hundred thousand dollars shuttled on his private jet from Munich to Moscow. The formal ownership of the original Russian company called RSB Group remained unchanged; however, its business was de facto moved to two new companies: a newly formed Russian entity with the identical name, OOO RSB Group, and a Cayman Island-registered offshore firm called RSB Group Ltd.</p><p>The Russian company was wholly owned by Kirill Korobeynikov, Petlinsky’s son. The Cayman Island firm, which had a contract with the Libyan Cement Company, was owned 25% by Korobeynikov, and 25% by Victoria Bowman, the Russian wife of Marsalek’s long-standing business partner Joe Bowman. The remaining 50% were owned in proxy by a Swiss lawyer, Richard Cedric Harry Ritter.</p><p>The integration of Marsalek’s personal and professional lives with Petlinsky’s followed much the same trajectory that Marsalek’s development under Zlobina had. By 2017, both of Petlinsky’s sons were fully mobbed up in Wirecard’s off-books and illegal operations. Korobeynikov, <em>The Insider</em> has learned, supervised a group of hackers for Wirecard. Their target list included the short sellers out to prove the company’s stated value was pure fiction, along with McCrum and other journalists at the <em>FT</em> who were looking to report the same. The email address Korobeynikov used for several Russian e-gov services was <a href="https://theins.ru/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3f5e7c1d2dad7f3d4ded2dadf9dd0dcde" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span data-cfemail="a5e3f1d7c4ccc1e5c2c8c4ccc98bc6cac8">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. </p><p>Petlinsky’s other son, Allen Petlinsky, an attorney based in Israel, acted in a legal capacity in mergers and acquisitions on behalf of Wirecard, Marsaleks’s email correspondence further shows.</p><h3>Spies ‘R’ Us</h3><p>All of this took place as Wirecard’s stock market value skyrocketed — and as Marsalek’s willingness to rely on intelligence operatives to help furnish the propellent grew bolder and more reckless.</p><p>One of his hirelings was Rami El Obeidi, the former head of foreign intelligence for Libya's post-Gaddafi transitional government. A lover of Italian haute couture and expensive vintages, El Obeidi helped spy on Wirecard detractors and even concocted a doctored sting operation to suggest that the <em>FT</em> was conniving with short sellers to sink the company — an allegation German regulators took seriously enough that they opened criminal investigations in McCrum and his colleagues.</p><p>Two other accomplices to Marsalek’s cloak-and-dagger sideline were recently retired officials from Austria’s domestic security service, the BVT, officially known as the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism. (The agency was disbanded in 2021, owing to its inability to stop an Islamist terror attack in Vienna, which killed four and injured 23.) </p><p>Until 2017, Martin Weiss was the head of BVT’s Department II, which was in charge of intelligence gathering and investigations. Weiss had therefore had access to all relevant classified information collected by BVT or given to it by allied foreign services. Marsalek hired Weiss as a “consultant” in 2018, using his extensive network of agents and informants in the West to gather information on anyone Marsalek or Wirecard needed to know about, including journalists in Europe. Weiss brought on one of his former deputies at BVT, Egisto Ott, who was suspended from the service in 2017 on the suspicion that he was transmitting information to Moscow. Ott ran background checks for Marsalek.</p><p>Weiss was arrested and interrogated after Wirecard’s implosion and Marsalek’s disappearance from Europe, after which he was hospitalized for a long period of time. He <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/br-recherche/marsalek-flucht-weiss-wehrt-sich-101.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">currently resides in Dubai</a>. Austrian investigators found that he and Marsalek were part of an “intelligence cell whose capacities and capabilities were used by Russian intelligence services.”</p><p>Ott was detained but released from pre-trial detention in the spring of 2021. In a brief interview with <em>Der Spiegel, </em>which met up with him at his home in Carinthia, Austria, in the Eastern Alps, Ott denied he was any kind of Russian spy. However, text messages examined by <em>The Insider</em> show Ott asking a police officer in Italy for help in understanding why the mistress of Russian oligarch Arkady Rotenberg and her sister were having difficulty entering Russia. The answer came back: they’d both been flagged in the European border surveillance system SIS.</p><p>By this point, Wirecard’s client list included Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, giving Marsalek — and the Russian intelligence services — access to sensitive data about German law enforcement’s slate of confidential informants. Marsalek even received a confidential report prepared by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international watchdog based in The Hague, about the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England in 2018. Sergei Skripal, a GRU defector to British intelligence, was targeted for liquidation by members of the GRU’s assassination and sabotage team, Unit 29155 and the highly restricted document Marsalek had contained the chemical formula for the toxin used: Novichok, a Russian military-grade nerve agent. Marsalek <a href="https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2021-10/oesterreich-johannes-peterlik-ermittlung-diplomat-suspendierung-dokumente-leak" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received</a> the document from Johannes Peterlik, the former Secretary General in the Austrian Foreign Ministry, who then became Austria's ambassador to Indonesia. A video of the document was even recorded on Ott’s cell phone on October 5, 2018. Not that the GRU couldn’t have gotten its hands on this material through more above-board means. Russia is a party to the OPCW and thus would have been privy to the Novichok report, even if it implicated Russian spies in the failed murder attempt.</p><p>Not that Marsalek didn’t earn his keep in other ways. In 2019, he instructed his underlings at Wirecard to compile a database of customers from major international companies, purportedly for use by Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service, or BND, the country’s equivalent to the CIA. Only the BND never commissioned any such project, raising the immediate question as to who did.</p><p>As Petlinsky’s intelligence apparatus grew — thanks in large part to his Austrian asset — Wirecard’s bid to take over the world appeared unstoppable. In 2018, the company joined the DAX, meaning it had become one of the 30 most valuable companies in Germany. At one point, German Chancellor Angela Merkel even brought up Wirecard’s 109 million euro purchase of Allscore, a Beijing-based payments company, in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Given that Wirecard wasn’t just a financial services giant, but also a bank — the “daughter,” as CEO Markus Braun awkwardly put it, of the original business — its only serious competitors in Germany were Commerzbank, which it had displaced on the DAX, and Deutsche Bank. In June 2020, as allegations of widespread stock manipulation, book-cooking (if not wholesale book-inventing), and money-laundering continued to bedevil Wirecard’s shareholder confidence, the company nevertheless launched a quixotic plan to buy Deutsche Bank. The scheme was described by Braun as both a reputation-salvaging PR move and a potential means of keeping Wirecard’s top management out of prison, as the company’s funny money could be confusedly mixed in with Deutsche Bank’s legitimate revenue.</p><p>June was when Wirecard had to confess that it couldn’t account for the missing billions reported in its accounts. Braun resigned as CEO and was arrested in 2020 on charges of market manipulation and embezzlement, with gang fraud added to his rap sheet in 2022. Marsalek was placed on leave, but he had no intention of following his boss into a jail cell.</p><p>On June 18, 2020, Marsalek met Weiss at an Italian restaurant in Munich to plan his escape from Germany. The plan was to fly from the Bad Vöslau airfield 20 miles south of Vienna. Marsalek boarded a small private jet, paying the pilots €8,000. To throw his German pursuers off his trail, Marsalek even got sources in the Philippines to falsely suggest his plane had landed there. In reality, as <em>The Insider</em> and Bellingcat pieced together in 2020, Marsalek’s destination was Moscow, where he arrived via Minsk.</p><p>Based on leaked travel data and emails, it can now be revealed that Petlinsky, Marsalek’s GRU handler, was the lynchpin of the exfiltration.</p><h3 id="article_block_4">From Germany to Crimea</h3></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/C0mLtIzaeIArDiYUgXCbDZ9W5nbOSBVN0AhByyM2lIM/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NTgv/ZmlsZS1jZDczOGZi/MjQ1ODBkYzIxM2Zi/ZDhkNDBiYTdmYWQz/NS5wbmc.jpg" alt="At top, Jan Marsalek.

At bottom, the man whose identity he has assumed in Russia, Orthodox priest Konstanin Baiazov.</h5></p></div><div><p>Petlinsky had a plane at Bad Vöslau initially booked in the name of David Iakobashvili, a Georgian billionaire with formerly close ties to the Russian government. (Iakobashvili, who co-owns a Russian wholesale distributor called PI OO with Petlinsky, resides mainly in Monaco.) A copy of Iakobashvili’s passport was supplied to the private jet operator, though Iakobashvili told <em>The Insider</em> he wasn’t aware of his passport being used to ferry a fugitive out of Europe.  </p><p>On the day of the flight from Austria to Belarus, Petlinsky called an Israeli flight logistics company named RS-LS Ltd. What role RS-LS played in the extraction is unclear, but Petlinsky’s communication with the company continued, phone traffic metadata shows. RS-LS Ltd is now a subcontractor of the U.S. Department of Defense.</p><p>Marsalek crossed from Belarus into Russia by car the day after his arrival, and his border crossing was organized by Lev Dengov, a Belarusian-Russian dual national who happened to serve as Putin’s special envoy to Libya. </p><p>On September 5, 2020, Evgeniya Kurochkina, an employee of RSB Group, the Marsalek-owned Russian mercenary outfit, with a history of FSB links including stints at FSB-controlled security companies, accompanied the suspended Wirecard COO to the migration office in Moscow to receive his brand new passport. The name he was told he would use was that of Konstanin Baiazov, the Orthodox priest from Lipetsk. Kurochkina left her own phone number and email address as the contact information for “Baiazov.”</p><p>The following day, September 6, Kurochkina rode in a minibus toward Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia illegally occupied not long after Marsalek and Zlobina’s first joint trip to Kyiv, according to data connected with Kurochkina’s cell phone. Petlinsky and Marsalek flew to Crimea in parallel in a private jet. Marsalek would have had to use his new passport, issued in Baiazov’s name but bearing his own photograph, when boarding the flight.</p></div><div><div><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="9" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="8" x2="32" y2="16" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="8" x2="17" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="8" x2="32" y2="8" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="31" x2="17" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="24" y1="31" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="9" y1="23" x2="9" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line><line x1="32" y1="23" x2="32" y2="31" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></line></svg><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/HRJDDGLYgPfyQS8wltOOMljSXTTQLVMaxLcc-MQqwn0/rs:fill:433:562:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjI3NDgv/ZmlsZS0zNzVkNTA1/ODRiYzAwNGFmNjMw/YzE5ZTA4ZGI4Yzgz/Ni5qcGVn.jpg" alt="Jan Marsalek's Russian passport."></p></div></figure></div></div><p><h5>Jan Marsalek's Russian passport.</h5></p></div><div><p>By nightfall on September 8, Kurochkina’s phone logged in at Sevastopol, Crimea, the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. The following morning, she ordered taxis and toured hotels along the southern coast of the peninsula. Petlinsky, travel data proves, chartered a private jet from Simferopol, the provincial capital of Crimea, to Moscow on September 12 — only Petlinsky wasn’t on the plane. He couldn’t get on the chartered jet because he could not bring his gun on board. He had to reschedule for a flight the following morning, using a more understanding charter company.</p><p>Petlinsky told <em>Der Spiegel</em> that he was indeed in Crimea around that time but had nothing to do with Marsalek’s escape. </p><p>He also said he had not communicated directly with Marsalek since the early days of his move to Russia.</p><p>This claim is belied by new evidence The Insider has obtained -- namely, the results of a blood test. </p><p>In January 2021, a mysterious man by the name of Alexandr Schmidt summoned a nurse from the Russian lab franchise Gemotest to a posh penthouse in a luxury Moscow high-rise. Schmidt asked to have his blood drawn and tested. The apartment in fact belonged to Petlinsky, who now goes by his new legal name, “Boris Grin.” “Alexandr Schmidt” does not exist. It is an alias used by Marsalek to travel on a forged French passport, intelligence officials from two European countries told The Insider. The passport number given by “Schmidt” to the nurse -- a requirement under Russian law -- belongs to Ekaterina Kulikova, a long-time aide and friend of Petlinsky’s.</p><p>Just a month later, on February 28, 2021, another ghost had his blood tested at this same apartment. This time, two of the measurements taken were for HIV and Syphilis. The testee this time went by the name of “Vitaly Malkin” and he was approximately the same age as Marsalek. Malkin, like Baiazov, is a small town priest from the Russian town of Vladimir. Just before the syphilis screening, Malkin announced that his passport had been stolen and arranged to receive a new one. It was the old, lost passport that “Vitaly Markin” used for the blood test. Marsalek used the passport a second time, a year later, in February 2022. A nurse visited him at the same posh apartment in Moscow owned by Petlinsky.</p><p>The real Vitaly Malkin told The Insider that he did not know Petlinsky and certainly had never tested himself for syphilis. The fake Malkin provided enough blood measurements to allow The Insider to compare certain metrics to those of “Alexandr Schmidt.” The probability that the two men are the same is overwhelming.

Leaving aside the central casting aspects of some of their biographies — one is an amateur mixed-martial-arts fighter nicknamed “the Destroyer” — they certainly behaved like spies. MI5, Britain’s equivalent of the FBI, had been surveilling the Bulgarians’ activities for a while, gathering passport data, evidence of international travel, and 80,000 chat messages, which included tasks assigned to them by Marsalek via his preferred mode of communication, the Telegram messenger app. </p><p>His years working on the Atlas Mine pyramid scheme were evidently not wasted, as Marsalek was compensating his agent network in cryptocurrency, along with cash delivered via a courier. Also in the possession of these Bulgarians were forged documents used for their legend, or cover stories: press badges and apparel with Discovery Channel and National Geographic logos emblazoned on them. After years of spying on and intimidating journalists, Marsalek had decided to use pretend journalists as snoops in the UK. One of them, the presumed ringleader of the network, was Orlin Roussev, a 46 year-old surveillance expert who had known Marsalek since Wirecard was flush. A sixth Marsalek agent, Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 36, listed in London as an interior decorator, was arrested on February 28, just as this story was being finalized. He had spied on targets for the Russian government, under Marsalek’s direct instruction, in Montenegro and in Austria.</p><p>Around the time the spy ring was being rounded up in the UK, Christo Grozev, the Bulgarian-born head of investigations at <em>The Insider</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em> journalist, and one of the bylines on this story, was informed by the law enforcement while on a visit to New York City that he could not safely return home to Vienna, as his life was in danger. Marsalek, it turned out, had requested Grozev’s home address from Weiss, the former Austrian spy, in December 2020, the day after Bellingcat, The Insider and Der Spiegel had published their joint investigation into the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Weiss had sent an encrypted message to Egisto Ott: “Could we make a query about a Mr. Christo Grozev in Austria?” it read, ominously adding that Grozev was working “against our case.” Grozev, at both Bellingcat and <em>The Insider</em>,<em> </em>has been the lead sleuth in unmasking GRU and FSB assassination plots, from the poisoning of the Skirpals in Salisbury with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, to the poisoning of Alexey Navalny with a similar substance.</p><p>Ott told <em>Der Spiegel</em> that he complied with this request from Weiss. «I only went to the registration office and paid 3.40 euros for the information about where [Grozev] lives.” Ott further stated that he took photographs of Grozev’s apartment in Vienna. Asked why Weiss — and behind him, Jan Marsalek and Stanislav Petlinsky — wanted the home address of a prominent investigative journalist, Ott replied that he gave it no thought. “I have always fought the Russian intelligence service in my career,” Ott told <em>Der Spiegel</em> matter-of-factly.</p><p>Grozev now resides permanently in New York.<br></p><p><em>– With additional reporting by Kato Kopaleishvili and Kate Manchester</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Awhile back, I had the chance to <a href="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/blog/2022/10/27/how-i-dumped-an-arcade-game-for-mame/">dump a game for MAME</a>. I told myself that if the chance ever came up again, I’d contribute again. Luckily, it turns out I didn’t have to wait too long—but the story didn’t end like I expected it to.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/martmasttw/0013.big.png" alt="In-game screenshot of Martial Masters"></p>

<p>When I bought my PGM arcade motherboard, the #1 game I wanted to own was a one-on-one fighting game called <a href="https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Martial_Masters">Martial Masters</a>. It’s a deeply underrated, gorgeous game—and judging from the price it goes for these days, I’m not the only one after it. It took quite a bit of hunting until I found a copy within my price range but my usual PGM game dealer in China finally tracked down a copy to sell me a few months ago. I was excited to finally play it on the original hardware, but also to see if I had another chance to contribute a game to MAME.</p>

<p>When it arrived, even before I had the chance to check the version number, I was surprised to see it was a Taiwanese region game. All    of IGS’s games have simplified Chinese region variants for sale in China; it’s unusual to see a traditional Chinese version from Taiwan show up over there. It could just be a sign that the game was so popular they brought over extra cartridges from Taiwan when there weren’t enough for local arcades. Once I booted the game and made note of its version numbers, I checked MAME and saw that there was a matching game in its database: <code>martmasttw</code>, or a special Taiwanese version of revision 1.02. That also surprised me—IGS typically didn’t produce entirely separate builds for different regions. Instead, each of their games contains the data for every language and region in its ROMs, and the region code in its copy protection chip determines what region it boots up as.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/martmasttw/0000.big.png" alt="Screenshot of Martial Masters crashing"></p>

<p>The other thing I noticed about MAME’s <code>martmasttw</code> was a comment in the source code noting that it might be a bad dump—that is, an invalid read that produced corrupted data. This isn’t that uncommon when dumping these sorts of games. Whether it’s due to dying chips or hardware issues with the reading process, sometimes a read just goes wrong and it gets missed. Once I booted it up in MAME, I confirmed it looked like a bad dump. It instantly crashes with an illegal instruction error, a clear sign of corrupted program code. Now that I owned the game, I had a chance to dump the correct ROMs and fix MAME’s database.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/martmasttw/gamechip.jpeg" alt="Photo of a game chip being held"></p>

<p>As soon as I opened the cartridge, I noticed something interesting: these weren’t the chips I was expected. Like with The Gladiator, I only needed to remove and dump two socketed chips, but these were a completely different model. Other PGM games using the same hardware typically use 27C322 (4MB) and 27C160 (2MB) chips, which were common EPROMs in their time period. Here, though, I saw something much more exotic: an OKI 27C3202 soldered into a custom adapter. The game board itself is essentially the same one that’s in The Gladiator, so it was clear that the adapter was presenting them as 4MB 27C322 chips.</p>

<p>I haven’t been able to figure out why it was designed this way. It can’t have been cheap to design and manufacture these custom adapters, and other PGM games that were made both before and after this one all use the more common chips without any adapters. I’ve only seen a single other game built this way. Was there a 27C322 shortage at the time this specific game was being made? Were they experimenting with new designs and ended up abandoning this approach? It’s hard to tell.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/martmasttw/reader.jpeg" alt="Photo of a game chip being dumped in an EPROM reader"></p>

<p>I only have an EPROM reader adapter for chips in the 27C322 family, so I hoped it would would be able to handle reading them just fine. On my first attempt, it rejected it; as far as I can tell, it was trying to perform “smart” verification of the chip, which failed since the underlying chip underneath IGS’s adapter isn’t actually the chip it’s trying to query. I ultimately tricked it by inserting a real 27C322 first and reading that before swapping over to the chip I actually wanted to read. Once the reader’s recognized at least one chip, it seems happy to stick in 27C322 mode persistently.</p>

<p>My first read seemed fine, and the dumped data did have a different hash from what MAME recognized. Success! …or so I thought, until I tried actually booting the game, where it crashed again. I went back to the EPROM reader to make sure the chip was seated correctly before doing a new test read. From the physical design of the adapters, I knew that getting it seated might be a challenge.</p>

<p>The reader uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_insertion_force">ZIF socket</a> which usually makes it easy to insert and remove chips. This time, though, there was an interesting complication. Because of how it’s constructed, the socket has a “lip” at the end past the final set of pins. With a normal 27C322, that’s not a problem; the chip ends right at the final set of pins, so nothing hangs over the end of the chip. This adapter has a very different shape from a real 27C322 chip, however—there’s a dangling “head” that contains the actual chip, as seen in the photo above showing the underside of the adapter. On the real board it hangs harmlessly over the end of the socket, but on a ZIF socket it ends up actually making contact with the end of the socket and keeps the pins from being able to sit as deeply as it would normal sit. I haven’t spoken to the person who originally dumped this revision, but I suspect that this is the issue behind the bad dump.</p>

<p>I ended up holding the apdater with one hand to stabilize it and keep all of the pins as even as I could while I locked the ZIF socket’s lever a second time; this time, it seemed as though I’d been able to get it sitting as even as possible. I then performed several more reads and, before trying to boot it again, compared them against each other. This time, I saw that these new reads were different from the first attempt—<em>and</em> that they were byte-for-byte identical to each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/martmasttw/0003.big.png" alt="Screenshot of Martial Masters's title screen"></p>

<p>Once I had what seemed like good dump of both chips, I booted them up in MAME to see if it would work. Unlike MAME’s ROMs, it booted right away without issues and worked perfectly. After I played a few rounds without a single crash or unexpected behaviour, I was satisfied that my new dumps were fine. As I was getting ready to submit a pull request to MAME to update the hashes in its database, however, I happened to grep the source for them and noticed something funny—they were already there. In another version of Martial Masters.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I was surprised that MAME had labelled the Taiwanese 1.02 version of Martial Masters as a separate revision from the Chinese 1.02. Well, as it turns out, once the ROMs are dumped correctly it’s <em>not</em> a separate revision. The ROMs are actually byte-for-byte identical; it’s only the bad dump that had made MAME consider <code>martmasttw</code> a separate revision this whole time.</p>

<p>This is the point where I’d intended to open a pull request to MAME just updating a few hashes for the correct dump, but with everything I’d learned the <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11883">final pull request</a> deleted <code>martmasttw</code> entirely. I had set out to fix a revision of the game in MAME, and make one more verison of it playable. Instead, I’d proven <em>it didn’t exist in the first place</em>. This wasn’t where I expected to end up, but it does teach an important lesson: corrupted data can go unnoticed for years if it’s not double and triple checked.</p>

<p>And, more than that, it’s a reminder that <em>databases are an eternal work in progress</em>. MAME’s list of ROMs is also as close as there is to a global catalogue of arcade games and their revisions, but it’s still fallible. Databases grow and, sometimes, they shrink; proving a work <em>doesn’t</em> exist can be just as important as uncovering new works.</p>

    <p><em>This post accompanies a <a href="https://cgad.ski/math/mlss_poster.pdf">poster</a> to be presented at the <a href="http://mlss.cc/">MLSS 2024</a>.</em></p>
<p>Physics likes optimization! Subject to its boundary conditions, the time evolution of a physical system is a critical point for a quantity called an <strong>action.</strong> This point of view sets the stage for <strong>Noether's principle</strong>, a remarkable correspondence between continuous invariances of the action and conservation laws of the system.</p>
<p>In machine learning, we often deal with discrete "processes" whose control parameters are chosen to minimize some quantity. For example, we can see a deep residual network as a process where the role of "time" is played by depth. We may ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does Noether's theorem apply to these processes?</li>
<li>Can we find meaningful conserved quantities?</li>
</ol>
<p>Our answers: "yes," and "not sure!"</p>

(For a much more complete reference, including the more subtle "off-shell" version applicable to local gauge transformations, see Chapter 5 of Olver's <em>Application of Lie Groups to Differential Equations</em>.) However, as a guide for the imagination, we illustrate two examples.</p>

<p>For a less familiar example of a conservation law, consider a ray of light passing through a rotationally symmetric lens. Rotating a trajectory about the center of the lens does not affect the time needed to traverse it. What conserved quantity does this symmetry produce?</p>

<h2>Noether's Principle in ML: A Toy Example</h2>
<p>In machine learning, we routinely deal with processes whose control parameters are chosen to minimize some quantity.

as the states of a discrete-time "process."

As we saw above, physical trajectories are also characterized as critical points of certain functions. Can we think about our trajectory of intermediate values <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from a physical point of view?</p>
<p>Of course, several things are different. Most obviously, "time" is now discrete rather than continuous. Furthermore, our trajectory of intermediate values is constrained in a different way. In physics, we specified boundary conditions and allowed the intermediate states of the process to vary, but in machine learning we specify an initial condition and constrain the trajectory <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>…</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(x_0, \dots, x_N)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to be driven by some parameters <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>θ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\theta_i.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Fortunately, Noether's principle continues to apply!</p>
<p>To see how, let's consider a toy example that's easy to visualize. First, we'll define a family of "deformations" of the plane, as depicted below. (Click the screen or drag the sldier to change the parameters of the deformation.)</p>

<p>Next, we'll set up some simple optimization problems. In each case, we'll try to find a sequence of small deformations that work together to send some "clusters" to their corresponding "destinations." This is easy to do by initializing randomly and optimizing our parameters with gradient descent. In the following widget, a composition of 50 maps is able to swap the positions of three clusters.</p>

<p>Now, observe that our family <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Fc</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> of deformations is <strong>invariant</strong> under conjugation by translations and rotations. This means that, where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a translation or rotation, we have an equality
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">F</mi><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo>∘</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>∘</mo><msup><mi>Q</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>∣</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="script">F</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Fc = \{ Q \circ f \circ Q^{-1} \mid f \in \Fc \}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
of sets. In other words, our family <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Fc</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> "looks the same" from a translated or rotated coordinate system. Moreover, conjugating a map <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by a transformation <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> near the identity can be realized by making a small change to the parameters that define <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> As it turns out, this is the right notion of invariance to apply Noether's principle. What conserved quantity do we get?</p>
<p>For each data point, let <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msubsup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(g_i)_{i = 1}^N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> be the backpropagated gradients of the loss function with respect to the intermediate positions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msubsup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(x_i)_{i = 1}^N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that this data point takes through our "process." Applying a certain discrete Noether's principle, detailed at the end of this post, will turn invariance of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Fc</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> under translations into conservation of the <em>expected value</em> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E[g_i]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from one layer to the next. (You can display the individual vectors <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in the widget above.) Invariance under rotation gives a conserved quantity reminiscent of angular momentum, namely <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>∧</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E[g_i \wedge x_i].</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>In this particular example, it turns out that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E[g_i]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is also approximately conserved (and nearly zero) over each individual <em>cluster</em>. In the next widget, we add some
examples where the per-cluster gradient is not conserved. (Each cluster now has its average gradient drawn with a single arrow. For simplicity, we are not visualizing "angular gradient.")</p>

<p>In the physical world, interactions are often accompanied by transfers of conserved quantities. Think, for example, of particles in a gas exchanging momentum and energy. Conversely, if two systems are not interacting with one another, then conservation laws will hold for each system in isolation. In mechanics, this is known as Newton's first law.</p>
<p>In our first toy example, the subgoals of bringing each cluster to its respective destination could be achieved without compromise between clusters, meaning that each cluster acted like an independent subsystem. This lack of interaction explains the conservation of gradient within each cluster. (In other words, we can apply Newton's first law.) In our next examples, "transfers" of average gradient indicate "interactions" between clusters, meaning that the trajectory of our process is no longer a stationary point for each subgoal considered in isolation. On the other hand, we can sometimes identify <em>subset</em> of clusters over which gradient is approximately conserved.</p>
<p>In general, if the layers of a deep model have meaningful "Noether equivariances," then we can build conserved quantities and perhaps study a physically-inspired notion of "interaction." However, I don't know if this idea works in practice! Can you think of interesting equivariances that we might find on real-world machine learning models? (Keep in mind that they might only be valid near the actual parameters of the model.)</p>
<h2>Proof of a Discrete Noether's Principle</h2>

For example, when we have a Lie group <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> acting on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Theta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Y</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> such that

Overall, we conclude that
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">⟨</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence="true">⟩</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">⟨</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>y</mi></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence="true">⟩</mo></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left\langle  g_x, \frac{\partial x}{\partial \epsilon} \right\rangle = \left\langle  g_y, \frac{\partial y}{\partial \epsilon} \right\rangle.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
This is quite analogous to the conservation law
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mrow><mo fence="true">⟨</mo><mi>p</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>q</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence="true">⟩</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{d}{dt} \left\langle  p, \frac{\partial q}{\partial \epsilon}  \right\rangle = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
that Noether's principle implies for a Hamiltonian system invariant under a family of canonical transformations.</p>
<p>One simple kind of Noether equivariance is a relationship like
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>φ</mi><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>φ</mi><mi>θ</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\varphi_{g \cdot \theta}(x) = g \cdot\varphi_\theta(x),</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
meaning that our family of maps is expressive enough to be closed under the action of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its outputs. In this case, since the action on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is trivial, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\partial x / \partial \epsilon = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the "conservation law" associated with any one-parameter subgroup of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> simply reads

Indeed, this inner product is exactly the derivative of the loss with respect to the transformation of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by a given one-parameter subgroup of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> If variations to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\theta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can produce these transformations and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\theta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is chosen optimally, the inner product must be <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (Informally, this explains why the average gradients in our toy example are approximately <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>)</p>
<p>The same idea applies to a group acting only on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>θ</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\theta,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in which case we get
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">⟨</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence="true">⟩</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0.</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left\langle g_x, \frac{\partial x}{\partial \epsilon}  \right\rangle = 0.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
For example, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x \in \R^n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the input to a linear layer, we get a "Noether equivariance" in the form of an action of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">GL</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\GL(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the layer parameters.

The general principle we proved above can be understood as the "two-sided" extension of these kinds of observations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was March 2022 when I sold CSS-Tricks to DigitalOcean. So it’s been just about 2 years now. </p>
<p>This was me and my wife’s thinking: </p>
<ul>
<li>The negotiated sale price was fair.</li>
<li>They are a big company (public!) with tons of resources, and their clear stated strategy was to invest in content and community, because that’s where the top of the funnel is, and it’s good for business. They didn’t just talk this way, they were obviously <em>investing</em> in content and community. There is a chance CSS-Tricks becomes <em>better</em>.</li>
<li>They were already decently well known for good content in DevOps and Back End, but were missing solid Front-End content. Filling this gap makes sense.</li>
<li>They would rip all the ads off the site. There would be only one “ad”: use DigitalOcean. I’m no advertising hater, it’s always been good to me, but the thought of CSS-Tricks as a clean ad-free site was appealing.</li>
<li>They would keep on Geoff, the lead editor, if he wanted it. He did and they did.</li>
<li> I was <em>way way</em> too busy trying to run CSS-Tricks and co-run CodePen and it was hard on me. </li>
</ul>
<p>After the sale, things seemed kinda fine for a bit, and that was encouraging. It was cool seeing new voices publishing new work I had nothing to do with. Then started to limp, using up the momentum that it had. </p>
<p>A year later they <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/goodbye-css-tricks/">fired Geoff</a> along with everyone else working on content and community. That was the real torpedo.</p>
<p>It seems DigitalOcean got excited when the whole industry started doing huge layoffs, they followed suit and slurped up the profits. The necessary directional change was: screw content and community. A month after that, the last article was published on CSS-Tricks, an overview of Passkeys, which will now apparently be on the homepage forever, a <em>very</em> strange bit of content to emblazon the tombstone of the site. They also added a cookie button that looks like a 4th grader designed it?? And started publishing every blog post as a guide???</p>
<p> How do I feel about all that? Well I’m not <em>stoked</em>, but I’m an adult I knew the risks. I sold the site. They now control it. They can do whatever they want with it. They could replace the entire site with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag that says <strong>Chris Coyier smells like donkeys</strong> and that would be their right.</p>
<p>I’ve heard from plenty of people who are pissed. Some are pissed at me. Sellout, yadda yadda. But I’m actually fairly pleased that the site is still online, relatively untouched, and with everybody’s bylines, including my own, intact. That’s a better outcome than scotch.io, purchased from Chris Sev, which was neutered and ultimately turned off. That’s a much more inglorious ending that I hope never happens to CSS-Tricks.</p>
<p>Hopefully that doesn’t happen, although during my 3-month consulting period I know they were very interested in porting the content to their own internal SSG system. As someone who has built a lot of SSG-powered sites and a lot of WordPress-sites, all I can say is CSS-Tricks is WordPress-y<em>-as-hell,</em> and I cannot possibly imagine a conversion that maintains any level of quality as being worth the effort. </p>
<p>A lot more people are pissed at DigitalOcean. People saying they’ll never use them again, and generally upset they’d take such a useful asset and do nothing with it. A void in the industry that doesn’t sit right.</p>
<p>Does any of this negative sentiment actually affect DigitalOcean meaningfully? I have no clue. It can’t <em>help</em>, but I’m sure if it was <em>that</em> big of a deal they would prioritize fixing it somehow. It seems more likely it’s a <em>oh well you win some you lose some shrug it off situation</em>. It’s almost certainly not acting as that strong top-of-funnel player they originally were hoping for it. </p>
<hr>
<p>I bet you could probably guess all that, or piece it together from things publicly said. </p>
<p>What you probably don’t know is that I tried to get it back. </p>
<p>I got an email from a fella a while back who is now a VP of Content &amp; Community at DigitalOcean who came over from the Cloudways acquisition. I think “ownership” of CSS-Tricks kinda fell is his lap after some internal shifts. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t have any hangups about just talking directly to me. What he originally wanted was just to learn what it’s going to take to get spun back up and producing again. A “return on investment” is what he was after, understandably. I was as frank with him as I am with anyone: It’s gonna take a lot. They would need a new lead editor, and you might be able to see how people might be squeamish about that role with the last one publicly axed not long ago. <em>Maybe</em> that person knows WordPress development pretty well? If not, ideally, you have someone know that knows WordPress pretty well, because the site uses <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-is-a-poster-child-wordpress-site/">everything</a>. And maybe that person knows how to wrangle up really good front-end specific writers? If you find that magical person, that’s a developer, writer, community builder, and site-running editor, it’s going to be expensive. More likely you gotta build a team again, and it’s going to take them a while to get things going, so your investment gets deeper and deeper, while the return remains unclear.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. </p>
<p>Maybe a little braggadocious here, <em>butttt</em> I’m basically the perfect person for the job. Let’s just say the most perfect person on Earth for the job lolz.</p>
<p>But I’m not even sure I’d want to do it again, and I have no idea if they would even want me to. But I definitely don’t wanna do free consulting work on it. </p>
<p>So I took my big swing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s my best (and wildest) idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run CSS-Tricks again myself. CSS-Tricks is big and complicated. Anybody walking in the door alone is going to have a serious learning curve just in getting comfortable operating the basics. I already know every inch of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get people reading again. I get people writing again. I get people excited again. I erase any bad mojo against DigitalOcean, fix that brand damage. Get people saying they&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to use DigitalOcean instead of saying they never will again.&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1691928618912387283">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/stolinski/status/1691942771035168887">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/awkroot/status/1692046926211150153">3</a>)</p>
<p>Then we do the most valuable possible thing for DigitalOcean: get content on there that helps people know about and do things on DigitalOcean. There are some big wins there. Astro is big right now in front-end, why isn’t DigitalOcean on&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/">this list</a>? Let’s get that article written and linked up.</p>
<p>We can make a special section of the site that is just DigitalOcean content, making it easy to browse and find stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we do the second most valuable thing we can do: move the hosting to DigitalOcean and have it be a living, breathing endorsement of DO being a great place to host a WordPress website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we’re back in action.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>You transfer ownership of CSS-Tricks back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re trying to get to break even on it. This means you aren’t spending any&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;money and time. You’re now just extracting marketing, branding, and conversion value out of money already spent.</li>
<li>You don’t have to spend any more time on this, personally or institutionally. Any other internal costs are gone.</li>
<li>The community will love it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is in the details. We’d get to an agreement on what has to happen for it to work. For example, no other web host can be advertised on the site for X time, etc.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d call that a big swing, anyway. <em>I’ll just take it back please and thank you.</em> But I feel like I made the case OK that it’s not completely crazy.</p>
<p>Crickets for a while.</p>
<p>A few back and forth emails like <em>“still thinking about this…</em>” later, and the conclusion is that the fella basically doesn’t have the “conviction to push it within the halls at DO”. </p>
<p>Understandable, really. I wouldn’t want to be handed a huge golden nugget by my boss and then ask for a meeting and be like “I think we should give it back to the leprechaun.”</p>
<p>When I pitched that, I wasn’t even 100% sure I wanted it, mainly for stress reasons. But I’m sure I could have figured out a way to run a more minimal ship with reduced stress and the site would be in a much more pleasant place. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to know some basic information about Passkeys I know a site you can check out.</p>

There's a few things to notice:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The 'app shell' renders first</strong> - you see the header and the footer, but there's a loading placeholder where the list of items will be rendered.</p></li><li><p>After a second the <strong>loading placeholder is replaced</strong> with the list of items - but with each item itself having a loading placeholder.</p></li><li><p><strong>The content of the items then renders out of order</strong>, replacing the loading placeholders - you see item 5 first, then the other items as they are generated.</p></li><li><p>If you look at the page source you'll see that the <strong>html is in the order it was sent - not the order it was rendered in</strong></p></li><li><p>The page makes use of <strong>Shadow DOM</strong> without Custom Elements.</p></li></ol><p>Pretty nice, right? It may be a contrived example but it's an interesting technique that enables things that have not been possible before without JavaScript.</p><p>Have a look at the <strong><a href="https://github.com/lamplightdev/ooo">code for this demo</a></strong>, or read on for an explanation of how it works.</p><hr><h2>Background</h2><h3>Streaming HTML</h3><p>The <strong>concept of streaming HTML</strong> - sending HTML from a web server to a browser in chunks as it is generated - is <strong>nothing new</strong>. It seemed to take a back seat at the beginning of the age of modern front-end frameworks and Single Page Applications - where the entire page was generated in the browser - but as the pendulum swings back towards server-side rendering with full stack frameworks, <strong>streaming responses are becoming popular again</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>advantages of streaming HTML</strong> over waiting for the entire response to be generated before sending it to the browser are clear - you can <strong>render something immediately</strong> to indicate to the user that something is happening, and you can start downloading assets like CSS and JavaScript earlier, while you <strong>wait for the more time consuming parts of the response</strong> to be generated.</p><p>What's been lacking up to this point is a way to <strong>stream HTML out of order</strong> - that is to stream the HTML in chunks as it's generated without worrying about the order in which the chunks are sent to the browser - and still have the browser render the chunks of HTML in the correct order as in the demo above.</p><p>Modern full stack frameworks enable this functionality by using a variety of clever techniques, all of which require buy-in to the particular framework and a <strong>hefty chunk of JavaScript</strong>. That might be fine for your use case, but what if we could <strong>achieve the same thing without any JavaScript or framework?</strong> <em>Well now you can</em>.</p><h3>Shadow DOM</h3><p><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM">Shadow DOM</a></strong> is a way to render a piece of DOM in isolation from the rest of the page. Whilst often associated with Custom Elements, Shadow DOM <strong>can be used with any HTML tag</strong>, such as the humble <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag.</p><p>It also has the concept of <strong>slots</strong> - tags that act as portals that you can render HTML into from elsewhere within the parent tag by specifying a <code>slot</code> attribute on the tag you want to render. Here the shadow root is attached to the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, and the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is rendered into the slot in that shadow root:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  #shadowroot<br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Header<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>content<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Footer<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>slot</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>content<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    This div will be rendered inside the slot above. Magic!<br>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><hr><h2>Requirements</h2><p>So how do you use Shadow DOM to stream HTML out of order? There's a few things you need:</p><ol><li>A <strong>http server that supports streaming responses</strong>. You're in luck here, there is pretty much universal support for this across all languages. I've opted for <strong><a href="https://hono.dev/">Hono</a></strong> as it's a lightweight server, built on web standards, that runs on node as well as a wide variety of edge platforms. It's worth noting though that there's no dependency on a JavaScript backend - the same thing can be achieved on PHP, Java, Go, etc.</li></ol><ol><li><p>A <strong>templating language that supports streaming</strong>. In theory you don't need a templating language - you could handcraft the HTML and manually manage the streaming - but that's a lot of work. In the JavaScript world, there aren't a lot of standalone templating languages that support streaming, but a recent project called <strong><a href="https://github.com/thepassle/swtl">SWTL</a></strong> does. SWTL was created to be used in Service Workers, but since we're using web standards all the way down, it can be used on the server too. The other great thing about SWTL is that you can chuck pretty much anything at it - async functions, generators, arrays, responses - and it will handle it all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Declarative Shadow DOM</strong> - Until recently custom Shadow DOM was a browser only technology - you could only create Shadow DOM in the browser using JavaScript - but now, thanks to <strong><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/declarative-shadow-dom">Declarative Shadow DOM</a></strong> (DSD), you can create Shadow DOM on the server and the browser will render it without JavaScript by using a new <code>shadowrootmode</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag. The shadow root is then automatically attached to the containing element:</p></li></ol><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span> <span>shadowrootmode</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>open<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Header<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>content<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Footer<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>slot</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>content<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    This div will be rendered inside the slot above<br>    without JavaScript. More magic!<br>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><hr><h2>Piecing it together</h2><p>So how was that initial demo created?

		<div>
		<p>We are excited to announce that <em>Communications of the ACM</em> (<em>CACM</em>) is now a fully <strong>Open Access publication</strong>. This means that more than six decades of <em>CACM</em>’s renowned research articles, seminal papers, technical reports, commentaries, real-world practice, and news articles are now open to everyone, regardless of whether they are members of ACM or subscribe to the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>But why this change, and why now? For almost 65 years, the contents of <em>CACM</em> have been exclusively accessible to ACM members and individuals affiliated with institutions that subscribe to either <em>CACM</em> or the ACM Digital Library. In 2020, ACM announced its intention to transition to a fully Open Access publisher within a roughly five-year timeframe (January 2026) under a financially sustainable model. The transition is going well: By the end of 2023, approximately 40% of the ~26,000 articles ACM publishes annually were being published Open Access utilizing the <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/acmopen#model">ACM Open</a> model. As ACM has progressed toward this goal, it has increasingly opened large parts of the ACM Digital Library, including more than 100,000 articles published between 1951–2000. It is ACM’s plan to open its entire archive of over 600,000 articles when the transition to full Open Access is complete.</p>

<p>As part of this transition and to coincide with the launch of <em>CACM</em>‘s new website, all <em>CACM</em> articles, past, present, and future, will be published in front of the subscription paywall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By opening <em>CACM</em> to the world, ACM hopes to increase engagement with the broader computer science community and encourage non-members to discover its rich resources and the benefits of joining the largest professional computer science organization. This move will also benefit CACM authors by expanding their readership to a larger and more diverse audience. Of course, the community’s continued support of ACM through membership and the ACM Open model is essential to keeping ACM and <em>CACM</em> strong, so it is critical that current members continue their membership and authors encourage their institutions to join the ACM Open model to keep this effort sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We invite everyone to explore CACM’s vast collection of articles, columns, and news items on the new website. Thank you for your interest in ACM and <em>CACM</em>!</p>

<p>Any Linux user trying to send the highest-resolution images to a display at the fastest frame rate is out of luck for the foreseeable future, at least when it comes to an HDMI connection.</p>
<p>The licensing group that controls the HDMI standard, the <a href="https://hdmiforum.org/">HDMI Forum</a>, has reportedly told AMD that it does not allow an open source implementation of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/hdmi-2-1-spec-released-ushering-in-new-era-of-dynamic-hdr-video/">HDMI 2.1</a> (or HDMI 2.1+) specification, blocking tools such as AMD's FreeSync from working over HDMI connections at resolution/rate combinations like 4K at 120 Hz, or 5K at 240 Hz.</p>
<p>Linux blog Phoronix <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-Closed-Spec-Hurts-Open">noted in January 2021</a> that the HDMI Forum did not offer public access to the HDMI 2.1 specification. Alex Deucher, an AMD engineer who has long contributed to the company's open source offerings, has kept <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417">a related bug thread</a> alive for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_830547">at least two years</a>, only to deliver the negative outcome yesterday.</p>
<p>In February 2023, Deucher <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_1795980">reported</a> that he was "working with our [AMD] legal team to sort out what we can deliver while still complying with our obligations to HDMI Forum." Two months <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_1876855">later</a>, he said that AMD got "the basic functionality up and running, now we have to go through each of the features with legal and determine if/how we can expose them while still meeting our obligations." Summer and fall of 2023 went by, with legal review <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2100060">still underway</a>, and in <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2144689">October</a>, the decision was "in the hands of the HDMI Forum."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Deucher offered the current resolution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately. At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ars has reached out to the HDMI Forum, AMD, and Deucher for further comment and will update the post with new information. X.org was also reportedly involved in negotiations with the HDMI Forum.</p>
<p>Membership in the HDMI Forum is a minimum of $15,000. While AMD is <a href="https://hdmiforum.org/members/">a listed member</a>, that likely doesn't extend to offering up an implementation of a specification for public use. The member agreement forbidding such things does not appear to be publicly available, nor does an "<a href="http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/adopter_registration.aspx">addendum</a>" for members linked from the Forum's site. A <a href="https://hdmiforum.org/hdmi-forum-adopter-source-code-license/">source code license</a> found on the Forum's site does not appear to be particularly flexible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-2.1-OSS-Rejected">Phoronix</a> and some commenters have suggested potential interference from media firms concerned about digital video ripping. That would seem like a barn door closed years after the horse's departure, but it also exists as one explanation, lacking other detail.</p>
<p>This outcome leaves DisplayPort as the likely best option for Linux users needing the best possible output. It also suggests that AMD has to decide whether to implement newer HDMI support inside closed-source Linux drivers or simply point its most demanding customers to other options.</p>
