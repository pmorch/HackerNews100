<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Go 1.21</h2>

<p>
  The latest Go release, version 1.21, arrives six months after <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.20">Go 1.20</a>.
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">promise of compatibility</a>;
  in fact, Go 1.21 <a href="#godebug">improves upon that promise</a>.
  We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57631 -->
  Go 1.21 introduces a small change to the numbering of releases.
  In the past, we used Go 1.<i>N</i> to refer to both the overall Go language version and release family
  as well as the first release in that family.
  Starting in Go 1.21, the first release is now Go 1.<i>N</i>.0.
  Today we are releasing both the Go 1.21 language and its initial implementation, the Go 1.21.0 release.
  These notes refer to “Go 1.21”; tools like <code>go</code> <code>version</code> will report “<code>go1.21.0</code>”
  (until you upgrade to Go 1.21.1).
  See “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/toolchain#versions">Go versions</a>” in the “Go Toolchains” documentation for details
  about the new version numbering.
</p>

<h2 id="language">Changes to the language</h2>

<p>
  Go 1.21 adds three new built-ins to the language.

  </p><ul>
    <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59488 -->
      The new functions <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> compute the
      smallest (or largest, for <code>max</code>) value of a fixed number
      of given arguments.
      See the language spec for
      <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Min_and_max">details</a>.
    </li>
    <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/56351 -->
      The new function <code>clear</code> deletes all elements from a
      map or zeroes all elements of a slice.
      See the language spec for
      <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Clear">details</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>


<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57411 -->
  Package initialization order is now specified more precisely. The
  new algorithm is:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      Sort all packages by import path.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat until the list of packages is empty:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Find the first package in the list for which all imports are
          already initialized.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize that package and remove it from the list.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  This may change the behavior of some programs that rely on a
  specific initialization ordering that was not expressed by explicit
  imports. The behavior of such programs was not well defined by the
  spec in past releases. The new rule provides an unambiguous definition.


<p>
  Multiple improvements that increase the power and precision of type inference have been made.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59338 -->
    A (possibly partially instantiated generic) function may now be called with arguments that are
    themselves (possibly partially instantiated) generic functions.
    The compiler will attempt to infer the missing type arguments of the callee (as before) and,
    for each argument that is a generic function that is not fully instantiated,
    its missing type arguments (new).
    Typical use cases are calls to generic functions operating on containers
    (such as <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/slices#IndexFunc">slices.IndexFunc</a>) where a function argument
    may also be generic, and where the type argument of the called function and its arguments
    are inferred from the container type.
    More generally, a generic function may now be used without explicit instantiation when
    it is assigned to a variable or returned as a result value if the type arguments can
    be inferred from the assignment.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/60353, https://go.dev/issue/57192, https://go.dev/issue/52397, https://go.dev/issue/41176 -->
    Type inference now also considers methods when a value is assigned to an interface:
    type arguments for type parameters used in method signatures may be inferred from
    the corresponding parameter types of matching methods.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/51593 https://go.dev/issue/39661 -->
    Similarly, since a type argument must implement all the methods of its corresponding constraint,
    the methods of the type argument and constraint are matched which may lead to the inference of
    additional type arguments.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58671 -->
    If multiple untyped constant arguments of different kinds (such as an untyped int and
    an untyped floating-point constant) are passed to parameters with the same (not otherwise
    specified) type parameter type, instead of an error, now type inference determines the
    type using the same approach as an operator with untyped constant operands.
    This change brings the types inferred from untyped constant arguments in line with the
    types of constant expressions.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59750 -->
    Type inference is now precise when matching corresponding types in assignments:
    component types (such as the elements of slices, or the parameter types in function signatures)
    must be identical (given suitable type arguments) to match, otherwise inference fails.
    This change produces more accurate error messages:
    where in the past type inference may have succeeded incorrectly and lead to an invalid assignment,
    the compiler now reports an inference error if two types can't possibly match.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58650 -->
  More generally, the description of
  <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Type_inference">type inference</a>
  in the language spec has been clarified.
  Together, all these changes make type inference more powerful and inference failures less surprising.
</p>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/57969 -->
<p>
  Go 1.21 includes a preview of a language change we are considering for a future version of Go:
  making for loop variables per-iteration instead of per-loop, to avoid accidental sharing bugs.
  For details about how to try that language change, see <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/LoopvarExperiment">the LoopvarExperiment wiki page</a>.
</p>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/25448 -->
<p>
  Go 1.21 now defines that if a goroutine is panicking and recover was called directly by a deferred
  function, the return value of recover is guaranteed not to be nil. To ensure this, calling panic
  with a nil interface value (or an untyped nil) causes a run-time panic of type
  <a href="https://go.dev/runtime/#PanicNilError"><code>*runtime.PanicNilError</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  To support programs written for older versions of Go, nil panics can be re-enabled by setting
  <code>GODEBUG=panicnil=1</code>.
  This setting is enabled automatically when compiling a program whose main package
  is in a module with that declares <code>go</code> <code>1.20</code> or earlier.
</p>


<p>
  Go 1.21 adds improved support for backwards compatibility and forwards compatibility
  in the Go toolchain.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/56986 -->
  To improve backwards compatibility, Go 1.21 formalizes
  Go's use of the GODEBUG environment variable to control
  the default behavior for changes that are non-breaking according to the
  <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">compatibility policy</a>
  but nonetheless may cause existing programs to break.
  (For example, programs that depend on buggy behavior may break
  when a bug is fixed, but bug fixes are not considered breaking changes.)
  When Go must make this kind of behavior change,
  it now chooses between the old and new behavior based on the
  <code>go</code> line in the workspace's <code>go.work</code> file
  or else the main module's <code>go.mod</code> file.
  Upgrading to a new Go toolchain but leaving the <code>go</code> line
  set to its original (older) Go version preserves the behavior of the older
  toolchain.
  With this compatibility support, the latest Go toolchain should always
  be the best, most secure, implementation of an older version of Go.
  See “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/godebug">Go, Backwards Compatibility, and GODEBUG</a>” for details.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57001 -->
  To improve forwards compatibility, Go 1.21 now reads the <code>go</code> line
  in a <code>go.work</code> or <code>go.mod</code> file as a strict
  minimum requirement: <code>go</code> <code>1.21.0</code> means
  that the workspace or module cannot be used with Go 1.20 or with Go 1.21rc1.
  This allows projects that depend on fixes made in later versions of Go
  to ensure that they are not used with earlier versions.
  It also gives better error reporting for projects that make use of new Go features:
  when the problem is that a newer Go version is needed,
  that problem is reported clearly, instead of attempting to build the code
  and instead printing errors about unresolved imports or syntax errors.
</p>

<p>
  To make these new stricter version requirements easier to manage,
  the <code>go</code> command can now invoke not just the toolchain
  bundled in its own release but also other Go toolchain versions found in the PATH
  or downloaded on demand.
  If a <code>go.mod</code> or <code>go.work</code> <code>go</code> line
  declares a minimum requirement on a newer version of Go, the <code>go</code>
  command will find and run that version automatically.
  The new <code>toolchain</code> directive sets a suggested minimum toolchain to use,
  which may be newer than the strict <code>go</code> minimum.
  See “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/toolchain">Go Toolchains</a>” for details.
</p>

<h3 id="go-command">Go command</h3>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58099, CL 474236 -->
  The <code>-pgo</code> build flag now defaults to <code>-pgo=auto</code>,
  and the restriction of specifying a single main package on the command
  line is now removed. If a file named <code>default.pgo</code> is present
  in the main package's directory, the <code>go</code> command will use
  it to enable profile-guided optimization for building the corresponding
  program.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>-C</code> <code>dir</code> flag must now be the first
  flag on the command-line when used.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/37708, CL 463837 -->
  The new <code>go</code> <code>test</code> option
  <code>-fullpath</code> prints full path names in test log messages,
  rather than just base names.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/15513, CL 466397 -->
  The <code>go</code> <code>test</code> <code>-c</code> flag now
  supports writing test binaries for multiple packages, each to
  <code>pkg.test</code> where <code>pkg</code> is the package name.
  It is an error if more than one test package being compiled has a given package name.]
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/15513, CL 466397 -->
  The <code>go</code> <code>test</code> <code>-o</code> flag now
  accepts a directory argument, in which case test binaries are written to that
  directory instead of the current directory.
</p>

<h3 id="cgo">Cgo</h3>

<p><!-- CL 490819 -->
  In files that <code>import "C"</code>, the Go toolchain now
  correctly reports errors for attempts to declare Go methods on C types.
</p>

<h2 id="runtime-changes">Runtime</h2>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/7181 -->
  When printing very deep stacks, the runtime now prints the first 50
  (innermost) frames followed by the bottom 50 (outermost) frames,
  rather than just printing the first 100 frames. This makes it easier
  to see how deeply recursive stacks started, and is especially
  valuable for debugging stack overflows.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59960 -->
  On Linux platforms that support transparent huge pages, the Go runtime
  now manages which parts of the heap may be backed by huge pages more
  explicitly. This leads to better utilization of memory: small heaps
  should see less memory used (up to 50% in pathological cases) while
  large heaps should see fewer broken huge pages for dense parts of the
  heap, improving CPU usage and latency by up to 1%.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57069, https://go.dev/issue/56966 -->
  As a result of runtime-internal garbage collection tuning,
  applications may see up to a 40% reduction in application tail latency
  and a small decrease in memory use. Some applications may also observe
  a small loss in throughput.

  The memory use decrease should be proportional to the loss in
  throughput, such that the previous release's throughput/memory
  tradeoff may be recovered (with little change to latency) by
  increasing <code>GOGC</code> and/or <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> slightly.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/51676 -->
  Calls from C to Go on threads created in C require some setup to prepare for
  Go execution. On Unix platforms, this setup is now preserved across multiple
  calls from the same thread. This significantly reduces the overhead of
  subsequent C to Go calls from ~1-3 microseconds per call to ~100-200
  nanoseconds per call.
</p>

<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>

<p>
  Profile-guide optimization (PGO), added as a preview in Go 1.20, is now ready
  for general use. PGO enables additional optimizations on code identified as
  hot by profiles of production workloads. As mentioned in the
  <a href="#go-command">Go command section</a>, PGO is enabled by default for
  binaries that contain a <code>default.pgo</code> profile in the main
  package directory. Performance improvements vary depending on application
  behavior, with most programs from a representative set of Go programs seeing
  between 2 and 7% improvement from enabling PGO. See the
  <a href="https://go.dev/doc/pgo">PGO user guide</a> for detailed documentation.
</p>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/59959 -->
<p>
  PGO builds can now devirtualize some interface method calls, adding a
  concrete call to the most common callee. This enables further optimization,
  such as inlining the callee.
</p>

<!-- CL 497455 -->
<p>
  Go 1.21 improves build speed by up to 6%, largely thanks to building the
  compiler itself with PGO.
</p>

<h2 id="assembler">Assembler</h2>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/58378 -->
<p>
  On amd64, frameless nosplit assembly functions are no longer automatically marked as <code>NOFRAME</code>.
  Instead, the <code>NOFRAME</code> attribute must be explicitly specified if desired,
  which is already the behavior on other architectures supporting frame pointers.
  With this, the runtime now maintains the frame pointers for stack transitions.
</p>

<!-- CL 476295 -->
<p>
  The verifier that checks for incorrect uses of <code>R15</code> when dynamic linking on amd64 has been improved.
</p>

<h2 id="linker">Linker</h2>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57302, CL 461749, CL 457455 -->
  On windows/amd64, the linker (with help from the compiler) now emits
  SEH unwinding data by default, which improves the integration
  of Go applications with Windows debuggers and other tools.
</p>

<!-- CL 463395, CL 461315 -->
<p>
  In Go 1.21 the linker (with help from the compiler) is now capable of
  deleting dead (unreferenced) global map variables, if the number of
  entries in the variable initializer is sufficiently large, and if the
  initializer expressions are side-effect free.
</p>

<h2 id="library">Core library</h2>

<h3 id="slog">New log/slog package</h3>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59060, https://go.dev/issue/59141, https://go.dev/issue/59204, https://go.dev/issue/59280,
        https://go.dev/issue/59282, https://go.dev/issue/59339, https://go.dev/issue/59345, https://go.dev/issue/61200,
        CL 477295, CL 484096, CL 486376, CL 486415, CL 487855, CL 508195 -->
  The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/log/slog">log/slog</a> package provides structured logging with levels.
  Structured logging emits key-value pairs
  to enable fast, accurate processing of large amounts of log data.
  The package supports integration with popular log analysis tools and services.
</p>

<h3 id="slogtest">New testing/slogtest package</h3>

<p><!-- CL 487895 -->
  The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/testing/slogtest">testing/slogtest</a> package can help
  to validate <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/log/slog#Handler">slog.Handler</a> implementations.
</p>

<h3 id="slices">New slices package</h3>

  The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/slices">slices</a> package provides many common
  operations on slices, using generic functions that work with slices
  of any element type.
</p>

<h3 id="maps">New maps package</h3>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57436, CL 464343 -->
  The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/maps/">maps</a> package provides several

  and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/cmp/#Compare"><code>Compare</code></a> that are
  useful with <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec/#Comparison_operators">ordered
  types</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="minor_library_changes">Minor changes to the library</h3>

<p>
  As always, there are various minor changes and updates to the library,
  made with the Go 1 <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">promise of compatibility</a>
  in mind.
  There are also various performance improvements, not enumerated here.

      The TLS alert codes sent from the server for client authentication failures have

      Now, certain failures will result in more appropriate alert codes,
      as defined by RFC 5246 and RFC 8446:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          For TLS 1.3 connections, if the server is configured to require client authentication using

          and the client does not provide any certificate, the server will now return the "certificate required" alert.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the client provides a certificate that is not signed by the set of trusted certificate authorities
          configured on the server, the server will return the "unknown certificate authority" alert.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the client provides a certificate that is either expired or not yet valid,
          the server will return the "expired certificate" alert.
        </li>
        <li>
          In all other scenarios related to client authentication failures, the server still returns "bad certificate".

      Multipath TCP is not supported by the kernel or the remote host,

    <span>Abstract</span>
</h2>
<p>
    GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model, which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). Despite the genuinely impressive improvement, however, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical of GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP community and the way in which the reasoning performance of LLMs is currently evaluated; introduces a collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and performs a detailed qualitative analysis of GPT-4's performance on these problems. Based on the results of this analysis, the paper argues that, despite the occasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly incapable of reasoning.

<p><span>Google is adding code to Chrome that will send tamper-proof information about your operating system and other software, and share it with websites. Google says this will reduce ad fraud. In practice, it reduces your control over your own computer, and is likely to mean that some websites will block access for everyone who's not using an "approved" operating system and browser. It also raises the barrier to entry for new browsers, something Google employees acknowledged in an unofficial explainer for the new feature, </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md"><span>Web Environment Integrity (WEI)</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re scratching your head at this point, we don’t blame you. This is pretty abstract! We’ll unpack it a little below - and then we’ll explain why this is a </span><i><span>bad idea</span></i><span> that Google </span><i><span>should not pursue</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But first…</span></p>
<h2><span>Some background</span></h2>
<p><span>When your web browser connects to a web server, it automatically sends a description of your device and browser, something like, "This session is coming from a Google Pixel 4, using Chrome version 116.0.5845.61." The server on the other end of that connection can request even more detailed information, like a list of which fonts are installed on your device, how big its screen is, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be good. The web server that receives this information can tailor its offerings to you. That server can make sure it only sends you file formats your device understands, at a resolution that makes sense for your screen, laid out in a way that works well for you.</span></p>
<p><span>But there are also downsides to this. Many sites use "</span><a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/"><span>browser fingerprinting</span></a><span>" - a kind of tracking that relies on your browser's unique combination of characteristics - to nonconsensually identify users who reject cookies and other forms of surveillance. Some sites make inferences about you from your browser and device in order to determine whether they can charge you more, or serve you </span><a href="https://qz.com/1733345/the-fight-against-discriminatory-financial-ads-on-facebook"><span>bad or deceptive offers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, the information your browser sends to websites about itself and your device is strictly voluntary. Your browser </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> send accurate information about you, but it doesn't have to. There are lots of plug-ins, privacy tools and esoteric preferences that you can use to send information of your choosing to sites that you don't trust.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These tools don't just let you refuse to describe your computer to nosy servers across the internet. After all, a service that has so little regard for you that it would use your configuration data to inflict harms on you might very well refuse to serve you at all, as a means of coercing you into giving up the details of your device and software.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, privacy and anti-tracking tools send </span><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox/Privacy"><span>plausible, </span><i><span>wrong</span></i><span> information about your device</span></a><span>. That way, services can't discriminate against you for choosing your own integrity over their business models.</span></p>
<p><span>That's where </span><i><span>remote attestation</span></i><span> comes in.</span></p>
<h2><span>Secure computing and remote attestation</span></h2>
<p><span>Most modern computers, tablets and phones ship from the factory with some kind of "secure computing" capability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Secure computing is designed to be a system for monitoring your computer that you can't modify, or reconfigure. Originally, secure computing relied on a second processor - a "Technical Protection Module" or TPM - to monitor the parts of your computer you directly interact with. These days, many devices use a "secure enclave" - a hardened subsystem that is carefully designed to ensure that it can only be changed with the manufacturer’s permission..</span></p>
<p><span>These security systems have lots of uses. When you start your device, they can watch the boot-up process and check each phase of it to ensure that you're running the manufacturer's unaltered code, and not a version that's been poisoned by malicious software. That's great if you </span><i><span>want</span></i><span> to run the manufacturer's code, but the same process can be used to stop you from </span><i><span>intentionally</span></i><span> running different code, say, a free/open source operating system, or a version of the manufacturer's software that has been altered to disable undesirable features (like surveillance) and/or enable desirable ones (like the ability to install software from outside the manufacturer's app store).</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond controlling the code that runs on your device, these security systems can also provide information about your hardware and software to other people over the internet. Secure enclaves and TPMs ship with cryptographic "signing keys." They can gather information about your computer - its operating system version, extensions, software, and low-level code like bootloaders - and cryptographically sign all that information in an "</span><b>attestation</b><span>."</span></p>
<p><span>These attestations change the balance of power when it comes to networked communications. When a remote server wants to know what kind of device you're running and how it's configured, that server no longer has to take your word for it. It can require an attestation.</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming you haven't figured out how to bypass the security built into your device's secure enclave or TPM, that attestation is a highly reliable indicator of how your gadget is set up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What's more, altering your device's TPM or secure enclave is a legally fraught business. Laws like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/dc-circuit-evades-important-questions-disappointing-ruling-section-1201-dmca"><span>Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span></a><span> as well as patents and copyrights create serious civil and criminal jeopardy for technologists who investigate these technologies. That danger gets substantially worse when the technologist publishes findings about how to disable or bypass these secure features. And if a technologist dares to distribute tools to effect that bypass, they need to reckon with serious criminal and civil legal risks, including multi-year prison sentences.</span></p>
<h2><span>WEI? No way!</span></h2>
<p><span>This is where the Google proposal comes in. WEI is a technical proposal to let servers request remote attestations from devices, with those requests being relayed to the device's secure enclave or TPM, which will respond with a cryptographically signed, highly reliable description of your device. You can choose not to send this to the remote server, but you lose the ability to send an </span><i><span>altered</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>randomized</span></i><span> description of your device and its software if you think that's best for you.</span></p>
<p><span>In their proposal, </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md"><span>the Google engineers claim several benefits of such a scheme</span></a><span>. But, despite their valiant attempts to cast these benefits as accruing to device owners, these are really designed to benefit the owners of commercial services; the benefit to users comes from the assumption that commercial operators will use the additional profits from remote attestation to make their services better for their users.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, the authors say that remote attestations will allow site operators to distinguish between real internet users who are manually operating a browser, and bots who are autopiloting their way through the service. This is said to be a way of reducing ad-fraud, which will increase revenues to publishers, who may plow those additional profits into producing better content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They also claim that attestation can foil “machine-in-the-middle” attacks, where a user is presented with a fake website into which they enter their login information, including one-time passwords generated by a two-factor authentication (2FA) system, which the attacker automatically enters into the </span><i><span>real</span></i><span> service’s login screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They claim that gamers could use remote attestation to make sure the other gamers they’re playing against are running unmodified versions of the game, and not running cheats that give them an advantage over their competitors.</span></p>
<p><span>They claim that giving website operators the power to detect and block browser automation tools will let them block fraud, such as posting&nbsp; fake reviews or mass-creating bot accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s arguably some truth to all of these claims. That’s not unusual: in matters of security, there’s often ways in which indiscriminate invasions of privacy and compromises of individual autonomy would blunt some real problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting handcuffs on every shopper who enters a store would doubtless reduce shoplifting, and stores with less shoplifting might lower their prices, benefitting all of their customers. But ultimately, shoplifting is the </span><i><span>store’s</span></i><span> problem, not the shoppers’, and it’s not fair for the store to make everyone else bear the cost of resolving its difficulties.</span></p>
<h2><span>WEI helps websites block disfavored browsers</span></h2>
<p><span>One </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/7998217b3d7334a71c26c52aeeadc1c6b1ba1dc4/explainer.md#how-will-we-prevent-this-signal-from-being-used-to-exclude-vendors"><span>section of Google’s document</span></a><span> acknowledges that websites will use WEI to lock out browsers and operating systems that they dislike, or that fail to implement WEI to the website’s satisfaction. Google tentatively suggests (“we are evaluating”) a workaround: even once Chrome implements the new technology, it would refuse to send WEI information from a “small percentage” of computers that would otherwise send it. In theory, any website that refuses visits from non-WEI browsers would wind up also blocking this “small percentage” of Chrome users, who would complain so vociferously that the website would have to roll back their decision and allow everyone in, WEI or not.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is, there are lots of websites that would </span><i><span>really, really</span></i><span> like the power to dictate what browser and operating system people can use. Think “</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"><span>this website works best in Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP</span></a><span>.” Many websites will consider that “small percentage” of users an acceptable price to pay, or simply instruct users to reset their browser data until a roll of the dice enables WEI for that site.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Also, Google has a conflict of interest in choosing the “small percentage.” Setting it very small would benefit Google’s ad fraud department by authenticating more ad clicks, allowing Google to sell those ads at a higher price. Setting it high makes it harder for websites to implement exclusionary behavior, but doesn’t directly benefit Google at all. It only makes it easier to build competing browsers. So even if Google chooses to implement this workaround, their incentives are to configure it as too small to protect the open web.</span></p>
<h2><span>You are the boss of your computer</span></h2>
<p><span>Your computer belongs to </span><i><span>you</span></i><span>. You are the boss of it. It should do what you tell it to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We live in a </span><i><span>wildly</span></i><span> imperfect world. Laws that prevent you from reverse-engineering and reconfiguring your computer are bad enough, but when you combine that with a monopolized internet of</span> <span>“</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040"><span>five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four</span></a><span>,” things can get really bad.</span></p>
<p><span>A handful of companies have established chokepoints between buyers and sellers, performers and audiences, workers and employers, as well as families and communities. When those companies refuse to deal with you, your digital life grinds to a halt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The web is the last major open platform left on the internet - the last platform where anyone can make a browser or a website and participate, without having to ask permission or meet someone else’s specifications.</span></p>
<p><span>You are the boss of your computer. If a website sets up a virtual checkpoint that says, “only approved technology beyond this point,” you should have the right to tell it, “I’m no piece of string, I’m a frayed knot.” That is, you should be able to tell a site what it wants to hear, even if the site would refuse to serve you if it knew the truth about you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To their credit, the proposers of WEI state that they would like for WEI to be used solely for benign purposes. They explicitly decry the use of WEI to block browsers, or to exclude users for wanting to keep their private info private.</span></p>
<p><span>But computer scientists don't get to decide how a technology gets used. Adding attestation to the web carries the completely foreseeable risk that companies </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> use it to attack users' right to configure their devices to suit their needs, even when that conflicts with tech companies' commercial priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>WEI shouldn't be made. If it's made, it shouldn't be used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>So what?</span></h2>
<p><span>So what should we do about WEI and other remote attestation technologies?</span></p>
<p><span>Let's start with what we </span><i><span>shouldn't</span></i><span> do. We shouldn't ban remote attestation. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech"><span>Code is speech</span></a><span> and everyone should be free to study, understand, and produce remote attestation tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These tools might have a place within distributed systems - for example, voting machine vendors might use remote attestation to verify the configuration of their devices in the field. Or at-risk human rights workers might send remote attestations to trusted technologists to help determine whether their devices have been compromised by state-sponsored malware.</span></p>
<p><span>But these tools should not be added to the web. Remote attestations have no place on open platforms. You are the boss of your computer, and you should have the final say over what it tells other people about your computer and its software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Companies' problems are not as important as their users' autonomy</span></p>
<p><span>We sympathize with businesses whose revenues might be impacted by ad-fraud, game companies that struggle with cheaters, and services that struggle with bots. But addressing these problems can’t come before&nbsp; the right of technology users to choose how their computers work, or what those computers tell others about them, because the right to control one’s own devices is a building block of all civil rights in the digital world..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An open web delivers more benefit than harm. Letting giant, monopolistic corporations overrule our choices about which technology we want to use, and how we want to use it, is a recipe for solving those </span><i><span>companies'</span></i><span> problems, but not their users'.</span></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Candle?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Candle stems from the need to reduce binary size in order to <em>enable serverless</em>
possible by making the whole engine smaller than PyTorch very large library volume.
This enables creating runtimes on a cluster much faster.</p>
<p dir="auto">And simply <em>removing Python</em> from production workloads.
Python can really add overhead in more complex workflows and the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/" rel="nofollow">GIL</a> is a notorious source of headaches.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rust is cool, and a lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors">safetensors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers">tokenizers</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other ML frameworks</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx">dfdx</a> is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
in types preventing a lot of headaches by getting compiler to complain about shape mismatch right off the bat
However we found that some features still require nightly and writing code can be a bit dauting for non rust experts.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/burn-rs/burn">burn</a> is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best

do bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of <code>tch-rs</code> is also involved in the development
of <code>candle</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl

<p>Aug 5th, 2023<br>
by <strong>makeworld</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini protocol</a> was a big part of my COVID-19 lockdown experience.
Discovering this underground, small protocol, having long discussions on the mailing list, and most
importantly for me, developing <a href="https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Amakew0rld+gemini&amp;type=repositories">software</a>.
My terminal Gemini browser, <a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora">Amfora</a>, was my first public
FOSS project, something actually intended for a wider audience to use.
It succeeded beyond my expectations (but within my hopes), and I’m proud to say it now
has thousands of downloads.</p>

<p>In the early days of Gemini, I had a lot of fun reading posts as they emerged from various <abbr title="Gemini [b]logs">gemlogs</abbr>,
responses to those posts, and writing my own posts. It felt new and fresh and fun, an exciting secret place full of potential.
Eventually, as the quarantine stage of the pandemic winded down and my life shifted, things fell into
a more natural pace for me, casually checking in with gemlog updates and reading people’s posts every
so often. Over time, the novelty of the protocol wore off, which is perfectly normal. When I wasn’t
actually developing code, what I was left with was simply the experience of Gemini (and my browser) as it
actually was, without added feelings around meta topics like protocol specifications.</p>

<p>As much as I want to like and use Gemini, in practice I simply don’t. Over the months (and now years!),
it just doesn’t keep me coming back for more. I first <a href="https://sunbeam.city/@makeworld/106191749002615329">mentioned</a>
this feeling all the way back in May 2021, but I’ve wrestled with writing this blog post because I couldn’t pin down the
reasons. Why don’t I use it? Am I too warped by modern convenience to be able to enjoy a slow Internet?</p>

<h2 id="the-reason">The reason</h2>

<p>After a lot of thinking, I’ve realized there is one main reason I don’t keep coming back to Gemini:
<strong>it offers no advantage over how I already use the Web</strong>.</p>

<p>In practice, the Web already has all the Gemini content I’m interested in from various people, and then of course
everything else.
Having everything in one place (whether my web browser or feed reader) makes for a much nicer experience.</p>

<p>Gemini is a reaction to bloated modern websites, but in fact I don’t actually visit that many gross websites like that.
When I do, my
<a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">ad blocker</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean">paywall bypasser</a>
usually make them decent again. Otherwise, I spend the majority of my non-work Internet time on
lightweight sites like my feed reader and Hacker News, and some time on sites that Gemini can’t emulate:
YouTube, Reddit, Discord.
The reality is that Gemini just wouldn’t actually improve
this experience for me.</p>

<p>Gemini also has downsides.
I enjoy
being able to express a bit of personality on my website through CSS, which is just not possible with Gemini.
And I’m come to realize I really do appreciate the unique design of 
different people’s websites as well.
If someone’s design is unbearable, using my feed reader or Firefox’s reader view gives me the choice
not to experience it, but with Gemini I don’t have the choice at all.</p>

<p>Finally, a more personal issue is that reading long form text in monospace really sucks, and
of course that’s all Amfora can do, operating in the terminal. This makes developing and
testing my browser easy, but makes actually using it for reading gemlog posts not ideal —
for me anyway. Long reading on my computer is already annoying for me, and this doesn’t help.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-my-gemini-software">The future of my Gemini software</h2>

<p>So, what does this mean for my software repos that deal with Gemini? Mostly I will be making
official what has been obvious for some time: active development is not happening.
Here is the rundown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora">Amfora</a>: maintenance mode. When possible, I’ll make/merge bug fixes, and maybe slowly
merge feature PRs by others.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/md2gemini">md2gemini</a>: archived. It’s always been a pile of hacks,
and now I’m not that invested in fixing it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/go-gemini">go-gemini</a>: maintenance mode. Bug and spec fixes only.
The code should be pretty simple to continue maintaining in case anyone is using it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/gemget">gemget</a>: maintenance mode. Being able to simply download
Gemini content will still occasionally be useful to me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/gemlikes">gemlikes</a>: archived. It’s always been a toy, and now
will no longer see any further development.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/go-gemini-socks5">go-gemini-socks5</a>: maintenance mode. I somehow
don’t expect <a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/go-gemini-socks5/blob/main/gemsocks5.go">this single file</a>
will need many changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-my-capsule">The future of my capsule</h2>

<p><a href="gemini://makeworld.space">gemini://makeworld.space</a> will remain online for the foreseeable future, but I will no longer be
syndicating my blog posts or site updates there. I will leave existing gemlog posts at least, but
other pages that would require updating may be removed.</p>

<h2 id="bye-gemini">Bye, Gemini</h2>

<p>Goodbye Gemini! I hope you continue to exist for those who want it, and to remind people that Web
alternatives are possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
      
      <article id="post-content">
        <p>Well, it finally happened to me.
I was blocked out of a website I need for work because of Cloudflare.
And I have no idea if or when I’ll be let back in.</p>

<h2 id="cloudflares-secure-connection-loop">Cloudflare’s secure connection loop</h2>

<p>The story begins with Cloudflare.
<a href="https://cloudflare.net/">Cloudflare</a> is a company that provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery networking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">distributed denial-of-service prevention</a>, and other networking infrastructure services to large parts of the internet.
The decisions that this company makes have broad impacts for individuals, companies, and anything that relies on the internet, as their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230731093909/https://cloudflare.net/home/default.aspx">homepage describes</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jrhawley.ca/assets/data/blocked-by-cloudflare/cloudflare-homepage.png" alt="Cloudflare's homepage demonstrating how broad their reach on the internet is -60%"></p>

<p>Many websites that use Cloudflare’s services deploy a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/browser-integrity-check/">“browser integrity check”</a> before you can access their site.
In theory, this is to keep bad actors, unscrupulous bots, and other undesirables off of your website to keep your traffic costs down and ensure your website is interacting with a genuine human using your site for a purpose you intended.
But often there are issues with these security pages that cause problems for users who are just minding their own business and genuinely trying to access the site with good intentions.</p>

<p>One such issue is the “secure connection loop”.
You type the URL for the site you want to visit in the address bar, Cloudflare intercepts that request, and puts up a security page that says “Checking if the site connection is secure”.
That page looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jrhawley.ca/assets/data/blocked-by-cloudflare/secure-connection-loop.png" alt="Cloudflare's secure connection loop -60%"></p>

<p>The issue is that sometimes you can never get past this page.
The loading symbol just keeps spinning, but the check never completes.
Or maybe the page refreshes and asks you to verify you are a human for a second time.
Then it refreshes again, and again, and again.
So even though you are a human who is jumping through the hoops Cloudflare demands you jump through, they throw away that hoop and ask you to jump through another one, or else they won’t let you through.</p>

<p>This is a common enough problem that when you search for “Cloudflare checking if the site connection is secure”, you see one result for Cloudflare’s official documentation and every other result asking about how to get around these pages because users are stuck at them.</p>

<p><img src="https://jrhawley.ca/assets/data/blocked-by-cloudflare/cloudflare-browser-integrity-check-loop.png" alt="Cloudflare's browser integrity check causes lots of problems for lots of users -60%"></p>

<p>This is what happened to me when I tried to access a page on <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> for some scientific software I was checking out for work on my work computer.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230603165446/https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/16/gitlab-changes-to-cloudflare/">GitLab starting using Cloudflare in 2020</a>, so naturally I was met their their “browser integrity check page”.
But no matter what I did, I was stuck in that “secure connection loop”.
I have no idea why.
I checked the developer console for errors and tried to fix them.
I temporarily disabled extensions.
I opened a private browsing window.
I restarted my computer.
Nothing worked.</p>

<h2 id="getting-around-the-secure-connection-loop">Getting around the secure connection loop</h2>

<p>Because I needed to check out this software, I read a bunch of those search results to see if I could get around Cloudflare’s check.
Eventually, I found some suggestions that if you’re using Firefox you can disable the <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> option in the <code>about:config</code> page.
But that was already listed as <code>false</code> for me when I got stuck, so I switched the value to <code>true</code> just to see if that would do anything.</p>

<p>And that worked!
I navigated straight through the browser integrity check and was able to check out the software I wanted to look at.
Problem solved.</p>



<p>Just kidding, my problem was only temporarily relieved.
And this, in fact, made my situation much worse.</p>

<p>The next day, I tried accessing a web page internal to my company that I need for my work and I was met with this page:</p>

<p><img src="https://jrhawley.ca/assets/data/blocked-by-cloudflare/access-denied.png" alt="Cloudflare denying me access to an internal work website -80%"></p>

<p>To recap: I couldn’t get past a security check page because of issues in Cloudflare’s software.
Because of that, I enabled a single privacy-preserving feature in my browser to bypass the faulty page.
As a result, I was then blocked on an <em>unrelated</em> website that I need for work.</p>

<p>The silliness of it all is that I was on my work device the whole time, which was behind my workplace VPN.
And you can’t access this VPN without specific security certificates being installed on the device.
Worse yet, I know that Cloudflare knows I have those certificates.
Why?
Because it asked for them!</p>

<p><img src="https://jrhawley.ca/assets/data/blocked-by-cloudflare/certificate-check.png" alt="Cloudflare's browser integrity check asking for certificates -60%"></p>

<p>Cloudflare has extremely reliable data to attest that I am in fact the person I say I am:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user-specific security certificates,</li>
  <li>corporate VPN IP addresses, and</li>
  <li>MAC address of my machine that I have previously used to access this site</li>
</ul>

<p>But it actively ignores this information in favour of a <em>hint that maybe, there is a possibility that I might, in some possible universe, be doing something I wouldn’t normally do</em>.</p>

<p>I didn’t install some sketchy extension.
I’m not connecting over a headless browser.
I didn’t change the user agent string.
I didn’t try to access the website over Tor or some unconventional protocol.
I only changed one privacy-preserving setting in my browser.
Even reverting the setting to its previous value didn’t change anything.
But now resources that I absolutely need for work are in jeopardy and there’s no easy recourse for me to resolve these issues.
And need I remind you that the only reason I enabled this option in the first place was to get around Cloudflare’s faulty security in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="what-i-think-happened">What I think happened</h2>

<p>What I suspect happened is that the secure connection loop caused my browser to request access to a single page many times in a short time span.
Cloudflare detected the high frequency of requests and denials (but not their faulty loop that caused this pattern of requests, of course), and tagged my browser as suspicious.
When I then blocked fingerprinting to get around the page, it worked initially, but Cloudflare eventually identified the series of events as nefarious and marked me with their scarlet letter.
So now I have no idea when that page will work for me again.
Maybe I’ll have to dig through the corporate directory to find the sysadmin responsible for this page to see if they can enable my access again.
Who knows how much time that will waste.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-google-chrome">What about Google Chrome?</h2>

<p>I tried all of the above in Firefox.
So I naturally tried to access the same page in Google Chrome to see if I’d still be blocked.
Thankfully, I wasn’t.</p>

<p>But of course I wasn’t because Chrome doesn’t have the same privacy- and security-enhancing designs that Firefox does.
Chrome will happily collect as much private information about me and my browsing history and share them with select parties, as needed.
It also doesn’t resist fingerprinting or let me modify settings to the same degree that Firefox does because Chrome relies on those fingerprinting technologies to ensure that I am targeted by ads it deems necessary for me to see.</p>

<p>Being blocked on Firefox and not blocked on Chrome also tells me that Cloudflare is blocking me based on the fingerprint (or lackthereof) of my browser.
Everything about my connection is identical between the two requests, aside from the browser being used.
It’s the same security certificates, same corporate VPN, same machine, even the same timeframe when I try to access the site.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>For the foreseeable future, I have to use Chrome to access this internal work site.
I may also have to do this for other sites, because I don’t know how many internal and external websites are “secured” by Cloudflare that may block me, now.
I could try reinstalling Firefox and to see if that changes anything.
But at this point I’m just guessing what I could do to solve my problems.
And if I’ve learned anything from the events above it’s that guessing with stuff like this can make my situation much worse with little to no recourse.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-the-web-in-general">Implications for the web, in general</h2>

<p>These types of experiences are precisely the things that worry me about the future of the web.
I have strong proof that I am who I say I am, but because I took <em>one step out of lockstep with what was expected of me by others that I can’t communicate with</em>, I’m blocked from accessing resources that I need.
My case is obviously only one small example.
But it is an example that makes my livelihood more difficult and fragmented.</p>

<p>Similar remote attestation and “security” measures could just as easily target things like online banking, which would interfere with just about every aspect of a person’s life.
And this isn’t just hypothetical examples, mind you.
Anyone who uses a de-Googled Android  phone has to go to great lengths to ensure hardware attestation is working correctly, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230804211102/https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide">GrapheneOS documents here</a>, or else they can’t using banking apps.
There is scant middle ground between accessing your money on your device and letting Google monitor your every interaction with that device.</p>

<p>Proposals for the future of the web that leave more power with unaccountable corporations and less with the individual will inevitably lead to more situations like this where individuals are left scrambling to figure out the Kafka-esque and invisible rules that they must follow to meet the ever-changing whims of these corporate entities.
I feel confident in making bold statements like this because companies, governments, and regulatory bodies across the world have repeatedly and overwhelmingly made decisions that favour corporate and governmental control over individual freedoms, rights, and privacy over the past 20 years.
Only in the last few years have legal frameworks with actual teeth started going after companies that routinely violate privacy laws, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230806213720/https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en">like the 1.2 B EUR fine levied against Facebook due to its GDPR violations</a>.
But these legal decisions don’t happen without huge fights and blowbacks from tech companies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230806074908/https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity">Web Integrity API proposal</a> that has <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36817305">so</a> <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/">many</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875940">people</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805180900/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-web-integrity-api-sounds-like-drm-for-the-web/">and</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805183646/https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852">companies</a> in uproar about the future of the web is precisely this kind of proposal.
If and when financial companies opt in to remote attestation policies for their websites, it will place greater restrictions on the types of hardware, operating systems, and software individuals can use.
I understand that there are legitimately good reasons to block certain combinations of hardware and software, say old devices with known vulnerabilities that cannot get patched.
But decisions like this from corporate entities always seem to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning">motivated reasoning</a> that increases the control of corporations at the cost of the freedoms or rights of individuals.</p>

<p>Take the first example of the Web Integrity API proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want or need to do it without paying directly.
These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots.
This creates a need for human users to prove to websites that they’re human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within two sentences, the authors are able to present the needs of advertisers as if they were synonymous with the needs of individuals.
And in the third sentence they put the onus on the individual to do something about it.
Is it relevant that the authors all work for Google, which makes most of its money from advertising?</p>

<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230525235848/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/passkeys-microsoft-apple-and-googles-password-killer-are-finally-here/">introduction of passkeys</a> is a useful proposal that could go multiple ways.
More secure access to websites that also provides a simpler user experience is undoubtedly a win-win.
But like I mentioned above in my experience with Cloudflare, I already had very strong data to prove that I was who I said I was and they blocked me anyway.
How am I to know whether these synced SSH keys that are unique to a single domain won’t get overlooked by Cloudflare or similar service providers?
And if these passkeys are going to form the backbone of how I interact with almost any website, how much control over them will I have?
A small list of important questions I have about using passkeys are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will I be able to create and sync these passkeys myself?</li>
  <li>Can only certain types of software use passkeys? If so, who decides what software meets this standard?</li>
  <li>Will I only be able to generate passkeys on a device with specific hardware/software requirements like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315091828/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-tpm-705f241d-025d-4470-80c5-4feeb24fa1ee">TPM</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230720061011/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck">DeviceCheck</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230802195352/https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Integrity API</a>?</li>
  <li>Can I, at any time, export my passkeys from one service provider and switch to another provider?</li>
  <li>If a passkey is invovled in a suspicious event, will that suspicious mark propogate to any other device that uses that same passkey?</li>
  <li>Do devices that contain suspicious passkeys also get marked as suspicious? If so, would that impact the ability of that device to access other independent websites?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not a sysadmin or networking engineer, so answers to these questions are simply beyond my expertise.
There are other, more important questions I focus on in my day job and I simply do not have the time to become a computer security expert as well.
As much as I’d love to use a simpler and standardized authentication method that is more secure than passwords, the central question of how much control I have over my data and how that is respected by others is critical when considering the benefits of ceding control over to corporate entities.
And that is a separate question from how much it will even matter if, at the end of the day, some other company with <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/cloudflare">dubious practices and origins</a> will just do their own thing anyway?</p>

<p>Passwords, for all their faults, have one fundamentally stellar property by nature: <strong>individuals make them for themselves</strong>.
Individuals can make them on whatever device they own.
Individuals can make them how they want.
Individuals can manage them how they like.
Certain people or tools or companies can make it easier to manage and use your passwords, but ultimately passwords are made by, and belong to, the individual.</p>

<p>VPNs, certificates, fingerprinting, and other technologies are ways of addressing the shortcomings of passwords and computer security.
But if I have to give up all pretense of privacy to do basic things, and might still get blocked anyway, how much is any of this stuff helping?</p>

Since 2020, when it was first floated, chipmakers have announced more than $200bn-worth of investments in America. If all goes to plan, by 2025 American chip factories (fabs, in the lingo) will be churning out 18% of the world’s leading-edge chips (see chart 1). <small>TSMC</small>, a Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth, is splurging $40bn on two fabs in Arizona. Samsung of South Korea is investing $17bn in Texas. Intel, America’s chipmaking champion, will spend $40bn on four fabs in Arizona and Ohio. As the <small>CHIPS </small>Act celebrates its first birthday, and as the administration prepares to start doling out the money, both Democrats and Republicans, who agree on little else these days, regard it as a bipartisan triumph.</p><p>Any triumphalism may, however, be premature. Leading-edge fabs being built in America are slower to erect, costlier to run and smaller than those in Asia. Complicating matters further, the chipmakers’ American investment binge comes at a time when demand for their wares appears to be cooling, at least in the short term. That could have consequences for the industry’s long-term profitability.</p><p>The Centre for Security and Emerging Technology, a think-tank, estimates that in China and Taiwan, companies put up a new plant in about 650 days. In America, manufacturers must navigate a thicket of federal, state and local-government regulations, stretching average construction time to 900 days. Construction, which makes up around half the capital spending on a new fab, can cost 40% more in America than it does in Asia. Some of that extra cost can be defrayed by the <small>CHIPS </small>Act’s handouts. But that still leaves annual operating expenses, which are 30% higher in America than in Asia, in part owing to higher wages for American workers. If those workers can be found at all: in July <small>TSMC </small>delayed the launch of its first <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/05/america-is-building-chip-factories-now-to-find-the-workers">fab in Arizona</a> by one year to 2025 because it could not find enough workers with semiconductor industry experience.</p><p>The planned American projects’ smallish size further undermines the economics. The more chips a fab makes, the lower the unit cost. In Arizona, <small>TSMC </small>plans to make 50,000 wafers a month—equivalent to two “mega-fabs”, as the company calls them. Back home in Taiwan, <small>TSMC </small>operates four “giga-fabs”, each producing at least 100,000 wafers a month (in addition to numerous mega-fabs). Morris Chang, <small>TSMC</small>’s founder, has warned that chips made in America will be more expensive. </p></div><div><figure><span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1042/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1042/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/343/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/514/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/686/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1028/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1371/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1714/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2194/90/media-assets/image/20230812_EPC047.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt=""></span></figure><p>C.C. Wei, the current chief executive of <small>TSMC</small>, has hinted that the company will absorb these higher costs. He can afford to do this because <small>TSMC </small>will continue to make the lion’s share of its chips more cheaply in Taiwan, not in America. The same is true of Samsung, which will spend nearly 90% of its capital budget at home. Even Intel is investing more in foreign fabs than in American ones (see chart 2). As a result, if all the planned investments materialise, America will produce enough cutting-edge chips to meet barely a third of domestic demand for these. Apple will keep sourcing high-end processors for its iPhones from Taiwan. So, in all likelihood, will America’s nascent <small>AI</small>-industrial complex.</p><p>The law may have unintended consequences, too. Chip firms which accept state aid are barred from expanding manufacturing capacity in China. Besides crimping the desire of firms like <small>TSmc </small>and Samsung, which have plenty of Chinese customers, to invest more in American fabs, such rules are prompting Chinese chipmakers to invest in producing less fancy semiconductors. The hope is that lots of older-generation chips can do at least some of what fewer fancier ones are capable of.</p><p>According to <small>SEMI</small>, an industry research group, in 2019 China made about a fifth of “trailing-edge” chips, which go into everything from washing machines to cars and aircraft. By 2025 it will produce more than a third. In July <small>NXP </small>Semiconductor, a Dutch maker of trailing-edge chips, warned that excessive supply from Chinese firms is putting downward pressure on prices. In the long run, this could hurt higher-cost Western producers—or even drive some of them out of business. In July Gina Raimondo, America’s commerce secretary, acknowledged that China’s focus on the trailing edge “is a problem that we need to be thinking about”.</p><p>Hardest to predict is the <small>CHIPS </small>Act’s effect on the semiconductor industry’s notorious boom-and-bust cycle. Usually chipmakers would be boosting capacity at a time of rising demand. Right now the opposite is true. Pandemic-era chip shortages have been replaced by a glut, now that consumers’ insatiable appetite for all things digital appears, after all, to be sated. <small>TSMC</small>’s sales declined by 10% in the second quarter, year on year, and the company now expects a similar drop for the whole of 2023. Intel’s revenue was down by 15% in the three months to June, compared with a year earlier. Samsung blamed a chips glut for its falling revenues and profits. Intel’s share price is half what it was at its recent peak in early 2021. </p></div><p>Chip executives point out that prospects for their industry remain rosy. They are probably right that demand is bound to revive at some point. Yet “inventory adjustments” (reducing oversupply, in plain English) are taking longer than expected. And when inventories finally adjust, the business that emerges may be less lucrative. Since early 2021 Intel, Samsung and <small>TSMC </small>have lost a third of their combined market value, or nearly half a trillion dollars. A few more anniversaries may be needed before the <small>CHIPS </small>Act’s impact on American economic security can be properly evaluated. Investors are already making up their minds. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Computing as we know it today was built in no small part by individuals who have written open source software—often for little to no personal financial gain—as well as by developers who use those tools. Few tools like that are as legendary and impactful as the <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim</a> open source code editor, the first version of which was written and released by Dutch engineer Bram Moolenaar in 1991.</p>
<p>According to a note published by his family to Google Groups this week, Moolenaar passed away on August 3 at the age of 62. The post did not share his cause of death, stating only that he had been suffering from a medical condition for a few weeks. They <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/tWahca9zkt4?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=inline-mention&amp;utm_campaign=platform&amp;pli=1">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with a heavy heart that we have to inform you that Bram Moolenaar passed away on 3 August 2023.<br>
Bram was suffering from a medical condition that progressed quickly over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Bram dedicated a large part of his life to VIM and he was very proud of the VIM community that you are all part of.</p></blockquote>
<p>The note goes on to say that they are arranging a Dutch-language funeral service in the Netherlands for Moolenaar, but that a date has not yet been set.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Moolenaar's text editor is legendary among software developers; it has repeatedly been named in surveys as one of the most widely used text editors or IDEs, and it is the default editor for some Linux distros. It was built initially as a clone for vi, a beloved Unix text editor. Moolenaar built Vim partly on another vi clone called Stevie, which is no longer supported.
</p><p>With the license of Vim, Moolenaar was an early pioneer of the charityware model; he invited users who appreciated the work to donate to support children in Uganda in lieu of sending a direct donation to himself. According to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/dev-world-mourns-loss-of-vim-creator-bram-moolenaar">The Next Web</a>, donations to the charity amounted to about 30,000 euros annually—"enough to help about 50 children finish their education, from primary school to university."</p>
<p>Moolenaar continued to update Vim until just a few weeks ago. He has worked on many other notable projects in his career. His most recent gig was working for Google to improve the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/retail/solutions/merchant-center/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Merchant Center</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon hired at least two union-busting consulting firms specifically to prevent its drivers from joining the International Brotherhood of Teamsters over the course of 2022, according to six reports filed to the Department of Labor and obtained by Motherboard. This is notable because Amazon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaa4m/amazon-drivers-are-actually-just-drivers-delivering-for-amazon-amazon-says"><span>claims that the drivers who deliver its packages are not its employees</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Motherboard reviewed five reports filed to the Department of Labor, which showed that Amazon spent more than $14.2 million total on anti-union consulting in 2022. Of that, $160,595 went to <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=860914&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>Optimal Employee Relations</span></a> and <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=861774&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>Action Resources</span></a>, who, on their own reports, specifically referred to “drivers” as the target group of their persuasion. Amazon and the contractors it hired <a href="https://www.laborlab.us/lm20scorecard#:~:text=Under%20current%20Federal%20law%2C%20anti,or%20arrangement%20with%20an%20employer." target="_blank"><span>are required to file these reports</span></a> with the government each year.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon’s <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=865472&amp;rptForm=LM10Form" target="_blank"><span>filing</span></a> references nine contractors hired throughout 2022. Both Optimal Employee Relations and Action Resources say that one of the people “through whom activities were performed” was Fernando Rivera, who filed a <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=869923&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>report of their own</span></a>. Rivera’s report again identifies “drivers” as the target group. It also cites “teamsters” as the union in question.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A third contractor referenced in Amazon’s filing, <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=854741&amp;rptForm=LM" target="_blank"><span>Government Resources Consultants of America</span></a>, said that it had been hired to persuade “various employees across the U.S. as may be requested from time to time,” and did not specify a union. However, the filing refers to another consulting group, known as D&amp;G Consulting, whose <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=867525&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>report filed in May</span></a> names “Amazon DSP Drivers” as the target group, and “Teamsters” as the union.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>These filings are particularly notable because they show, specifically, that Amazon is trying to squash unions among the delivery drivers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaa4m/amazon-drivers-are-actually-just-drivers-delivering-for-amazon-amazon-says"><span>that it repeatedly stresses</span></a> are employees of third-party companies, not Amazon itself. The Teamsters <a href="https://teamster.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5323ULPChargeAgainstAmazon.pdf" target="_blank"><span>have argued</span></a> that Amazon is in fact a joint employer of the drivers, and is using its contractor status as a way to evade responsibility.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Amazon has a level of responsibility that they’re trying to escape here,” said Randy Korgan, the director of the Teamsters’ Amazon Division, whose goal is to organize the company. “If the subcontractor is its own entity, and the subcontractor employs these drivers, then what is their interest in making sure that there are anti-union consultants meeting with drivers for a company that they don’t have any control over?”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“It clearly identifies the amount of control that Amazon is exerting over these subcontractors, number one,” he continued. “Number two, it shows that they have a vested interest because [the drivers] are employees of some sort. When you look at these filings, how can you say they’re not your drivers?”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“They just proved they’re an employer,” said Seth Goldstein, a lawyer at Julien, Mirer, Singla and Goldstein, who has represented Amazon warehouse workers unionizing with the Amazon Labor Union. “Why would they be involved in this, if they’re fearing that the [National Labor Relations] Board would rule that they’re a joint employer?”&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The reports do not reference specific Amazon locations. However, this past April, a group of drivers at an Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) in Palmdale, California became the first in the company’s vast network of contractors to unionize when they <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5ygaw/a-group-of-amazon-drivers-just-joined-one-of-the-biggest-unions-in-the-us"><span>joined the Teamsters</span></a>, who comprise one of the biggest unions in the industry. The <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/04/amazon-drivers-ratify-teamster-contract/" target="_blank"><span>contract ratification</span></a> marked the first time the Teamsters had successfully organized an Amazon-related facility, and the DSP owner voluntarily recognized the union almost immediately.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The problem was, however, that Amazon did not. Because Amazon contracts third-party companies to deliver packages out of its warehouses, it said that the drivers legally only counted as employees of the DSP, called Battle-Tested Strategies (BTS), and were subcontractors to Amazon. For that reason, Amazon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bdwy/amazon-delivery-drivers-unionized-now-they-have-to-prove-they-work-for-amazon"><span>declined to bargain with the Teamsters</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>None of the filings reviewed by Motherboard specifically mention Palmdale, Battle-Tested Strategies, or the delivery station, DAX8.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards told Motherboard that the filings were “unrelated to Battle-Tested Strategies in Palmdale,” and that BTS had been terminated “because of the company’s track record of failing to perform.” She referenced six breaches of contract, five of which were in January. These included grounding policy violations—which refers to how and when a vehicle is taken off the road due to some safety hazard—and a vehicle safety inspection violation. Motherboard has previously reported on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bdwy/amazon-delivery-drivers-unionized-now-they-have-to-prove-they-work-for-amazon#:~:text=Jonathon%20Ervin%2C%20the,on%20a%20repair.%E2%80%9D"><span>Amazon's van maintenance system</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When the unionization was first announced on April 24, Amazon said that it had terminated BTS’s contract, not because the workers were unionizing, but because of “poor performance.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Hards <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5ygaw/a-group-of-amazon-drivers-just-joined-one-of-the-biggest-unions-in-the-us"><span>told Motherboard in a statement</span></a> at the time, “This group does not work for Amazon. This particular third party company had a track record of failing to perform and had been notified of its termination for poor performance well before today’s announcement. This situation is more about an outside company trying to distract from their history of failing to meet their obligations.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The filings specifically referencing drivers say that consulting activity occurred between May and September of 2022. The timeline of the Palmdale unionization process is not clear, but Heath Lopez, one of the unionized drivers, previously told Motherboard that workers had started a petition in 2021 for better working conditions, which had served as a precursor to official organizing.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Almost immediately upon the workers exercising their right to protected concerted activities, Amazon had anti-union consultants on the ground,” Korgan said. “This is Amazon's M.O. A little bit of concerted activity goes on, Amazon sends anti-union consultants that are trying to talk to drivers and discourage workers.”&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Jesse Moreno, another unionized driver, said that after the union went public, he started seeing new faces around the warehouse.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Once we unionized, there was this influx of people we’d never seen,” Moreno said. “Probably around 10 people.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>He continued that one day after the unionization was announced, an unfamiliar man called a meeting with the drivers, and said that the Teamsters were spreading a false narrative, and that Amazon’s contract with BTS had been terminated and would expire in 60 days. During those 60 days, Amazon started grounding more vehicles, he said.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We were being grounded two, three-plus vehicles a day, which was affecting our routes,” Moreno said. “If we don't have vehicles to drive, then we don't have vehicles to deliver these packages, so we don't have our routes and they'll essentially have to send us home. So people were getting cut because of this.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The maintenance that they had on these vehicles is just terrible. Our dashboards would look like a Christmas tree, which they didn't care about before,” Moreno continued. “But once we unionized, if any light was on there—they were grounding our vehicles for just about anything. The fire extinguisher not being on the door, the seatbelt not retracting properly.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When asked whether Amazon can interfere with the drivers’ efforts if it says it does not employ them, Goldstein said, “They can interfere—if they’re an employer. They’re screwed. You can’t do that. That’s hilarious.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>This is not the first time Amazon has called anti-union consultants to influence an organizing effort at one of its facilities. Last October, when warehouse workers at the company’s ALB1 Albany warehouse tried to join the Amazon Labor Union, Motherboard reported on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3p5pb/amazons-dollar3200-per-day-union-busters-say-this-is-the-best-spot-for-steak-and-caviar-in-albany"><span>anti-union consultants</span></a> sent in to hold captive audience meetings and distribute fliers. When the votes were counted, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k8dv4/alb1-workers-will-not-join-the-amazon-labor-union"><span>ALB1 lost its union election</span></a> almost by a factor of 2-to-1. Those consultants were paid at least $3,200 per day.</p></span></p><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years, the web has gotten very hostile to the lowly web scraper. It's a result of the natural progression of web technologies away from statically rendered pages to dynamic apps built with frameworks like React and CSS-in-JS. Developers no longer need to label their data with class-names or ids - it's only a courtesy to screen readers now.</p>
<p>There's also been a concerted effort by large companies to protect their public data. Facebook, for example, employs a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/how-we-combat-scraping/" node="[object Object]">team of over 100 people</a> to make sure it is as difficult as possible for any data to escape the black hole. Granted, some of these large companies do offer APIs for their data but rarely is this unrestricted. You're usually at the whim of their app review process or granted access only to a partial view of the data. Data that would be otherwise public if you were to do a Google search and click through to their website manually.</p>

<p>This can be frustrating if you're like me - somebody who wanted to build a small, local, non-profit app that uses data hosted on a closed platform. The data is public but completely inaccessible to machines because of aggressive anti-web-scraping measures. That gave me two options - input the data manually or play the web-scraping game. Of course, I chose the latter.</p>
<h3><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> is born.</h3>
<p>After a couple of attempts at extracting the data using the usual CSS selector method of web-scraping - that is, fetching the raw HTML or booting up a browser via something like <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" node="[object Object]">Puppeteer</a> and trying to pick the data embedded in the HTML structure - I was close to admitting defeat. It wasn't until I had an epiphany: the data is <em>inside</em> the web page.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L_o_O7v1ews?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>I plucked out a unique string from the data visible on the web page and took a heap snapshot of the browser's Javascript runtime via Chrome's Dev Tools. A heap snapshot is a raw dump of everything in the web app's memory (or heap). Using the Dev Tools' search function and my unique string, I managed to find a nice, well-structured object containing my string and, adjacently, all the data that my app needed. It was from this point that I focused my energy on automating this process to find and extract the data from the heap snapshot. <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> is born.</p>
<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Chrome Dev Tools' Memory Profiler" srcset="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1VPKptaSPuNl8kbCWS4t4g%2F36963d9d0b96d268b8a7b9c3b88bb052%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.44.10.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1VPKptaSPuNl8kbCWS4t4g%2F36963d9d0b96d268b8a7b9c3b88bb052%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.44.10.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1VPKptaSPuNl8kbCWS4t4g%2F36963d9d0b96d268b8a7b9c3b88bb052%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.44.10.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><p>Chrome Dev Tools' Memory Profiler</p></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adriancooney/puppeteer-heap-snapshot" node="[object Object]"><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code></a> is a Node.js module that, given a <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" node="[object Object]">Puppeteer</a> browser page, can capture and parse a heap snapshot and deserialize objects that contain a set of properties. It comes with a nifty CLI tool too so we can quickly prototype scrapers from our terminal.</p>
<p>For example, let's fetch the metadata from the above video:</p>

<p>In that command, <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> booted up an instance of Chrome, navigated to the video on Youtube and took a heap snapshot of the page (58Mb in total, they can get large!). It then parsed that heap snapshot, found the object with the properties <code>channelId</code>, <code>viewCount</code>, <code>keywords</code>, and deserialized it back to us. These properties were chosen manually by working backward from the visible data on the web page to the data structure containing said data (I'll dive into that process in another blog post). We use the <code>--no-headless</code> argument to boot a windowed Chrome instance (i.e. not headless) because Google can detect and thwart headless Chrome - but that's a story for another time.</p>
<p>We can see the response is JSON! A clean, well-formed data structure extracted magically from the webpage. On top of that, the definition of the scraper is just 3 strings: <code>channelId</code>, <code>viewCount</code> and <code>keywords</code>! We no longer have to maintain a complex web scraper tightly coupled to the semantics of an ever-changing webpage. Instead, we can target objects that do not change often like API response objects or well-defined entities.</p>
<h3>Future proof web-scraping?</h3>
<p>You can imagine the grin on my face when I managed to circumvent the aforementioned closed-platform aggressive anti-web-scraping measures using this method. I experimented with other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and they're all susceptible to the technique after tweaking a few parameters. I've been using <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> in production for quite some time now and it's working surprisingly well.</p>
<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Me not fixing a broken web scraper and having more fun" srcset="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><p>Me not fixing a broken web scraper and having more fun</p></div>
<p>This method still comes with the same caveats that web-scraping always had - the public data could be here today, gone tomorrow and there is nothing you can do about it. The benefit of this technique though is the maintenance cost of the web scraper is greatly reduced and I'd even wager they will break <em>far less</em> than the current standard pattern.</p>
<p>It's costly for systems like web apps to change their underlying data structures because they're usually tightly coupled to the server meaning property names of objects are unlikely to change over time. On top of that, attempting to break the technique by obfuscating the data structure would be a large and costly undertaking because it would require obfuscating the entire stack - a mighty feat. Is this possibly a future-proof web-scraping technique? Maybe .. Web Assembly might be the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<h3>Get started heap snapshot scraping.</h3>
<p>Hop on over to <a href="https://github.com/adriancooney/puppeteer-heap-snapshot" node="[object Object]"><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code>'s Github Page</a> to get started using it (now that it's <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/" node="[object Object]">officially legal</a>!). It's still in an experimental/beta phase so proceed with caution when deploying. It's also incredibly slow - I didn't put any effort into optimizing the algorithms that query the (huge) heap snapshot data structures because I had more pressing features to build so please don't kill me for the CPU spikes (your orchestrator might kill your containers though, a lesson learned).</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Mexico became the top U.S. trading partner at the beginning of 2023, with total bilateral trade between the two countries totaling $263 billion during the first four months of this year.</p>
<p>Mexico's emergence followed fractious U.S. relations with China, which had moved past Canada to claim the top trading spot in 2014. The dynamic changed in 2018 when the U.S. imposed tariffs on China’s goods and with subsequent pandemic-era supply-chain disruptions that altered international trade and investment flows worldwide.</p>
<p>Mexico’s gains mirror its rise in manufacturing, a key component of goods moving between it and the U.S. During the first four months of 2023, total trade of manufactured goods between Mexico and the U.S. reached $234.2 billion.</p>
<p>Overall, Mexican imports to the U.S. totaled $157 billion; U.S. exports to Mexico reached $107 billion.</p>
<p>Mexico–U.S. trade during the first four months of 2023 represented 15.4 percent of all the goods exported and imported by the U.S.; the Canada–U.S. share followed at 15.2 percent and then the China–U.S. share at 12.0 percent (<em>Chart 1</em>).</p>

<h2>China gains follow World Trade Organization membership</h2>
<p>China’s share of U.S trade had steadily increased since it joined the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/whatis_e.htm" target="_blanki">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) in 2001. WTO member nations enjoy preferential tariffs when trading with one another and are protected from nontariff barriers such as quotas and currency restrictions—an incentive for foreign direct investment. They also participate in the development of new international trade rules.</p>
<p>Once in the WTO, China’s access to the world’s premier consumer markets, combined with its own economic prowess and ability to marshal resources for growth, quickly transformed the country into a leading manufacturing hub.</p>
<p>Within a decade of its admission, critics increasingly accused China of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-swallowed-the-wto-1509551308" target="_blank">flooding the world with cheap exports </a>while limiting foreign access to its market. China’s trade growth coincided with <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131578" target="_blank">sharp declines in U.S. manufacturing employment</a>. Sectors and regions especially exposed to <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121" target="_blank">China’s trade</a> tended to experience higher unemployment, lower labor force participation and reduced wage growth.</p>
<h2>U.S. imposes tariffs of China’s exports</h2>
<p>U.S.–China trade began trending lower in 2018 after the Trump administration imposed new tariffs on imports from China, whose government responded with a similar action on imports from the U.S. China subsequently lost its position as top trading partner later that year.</p>
<p>Approximately $335 billion in trade (66.4 percent of China’s exports to the U.S.) remains <a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart" target="_blank">subject to the tariffs</a>. The average U.S. tariff on Chinese imports is 19.3 percent, while China’s &nbsp;average tariff on U.S. imports is 21.2 percent, according to the WTO. This exceeded tariffs among WTO members (enjoying most-favored-nation status) of 9 percent.</p>
<p>There was a short-lived rebound in China’s trade share during the pandemic that subsequently gave way following supply-chain disruptions, many involving shipping and manufacturing originating in China. </p><p>
Mexico and Canada, which are highly interconnected to the U.S. economy, vied for the top spot. The three economies were formally tied together with the 1994 <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/pubs/usmca">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) and again in 2020 with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement that replaced NAFTA.</p>
<h2>Mexico positioned as a manufacturing base</h2>
<p>Mexico’s expanding manufacturing base has offered an alternative to producing in China. Sourcing or producing goods in a nearby country is sometimes referred to as “<a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2023/swe2303">nearshoring</a>.” While data on recent nearshoring is thin and evidence of it is largely anecdotal, increased protectionism and related industrial policy are consistent with less global trade, more regional trade, and nearshoring and reshoring (returning production to the home country).</p>
<p>More activity in Mexico would support increased bilateral manufacturing with the U.S. It would also bolster Mexico’s standing as the U.S.’ leading manufacturing trading partner, a ranking it achieved in 2022 (<em>Chart 2</em>).</p>
<p><img alt="Chart 2: Mexico surpasses China as main U.S. manufacturing trading partner" src="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2023/~/media/Images/research/economics/2023/0711/dfe0711c2.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2023/~/media/Images/research/economics/2023/0711/dfe0711c2.png">Downloadable chart</a> | <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2023/~/media/documents/research/economics/2023/0711data.xlsx">Chart data</a></p>
<p>Bilateral manufacturing trade between Mexico and the U.S. represented 16.5 percent of all U.S. manufacturing trade; the Canada–U.S. share followed at 13.5 percent and then the China–U.S. share at 12.5 percent.</p>
<h2>Automotive industry plays key role</h2>
<p>The automotive industry is an especially active example of the cross-border manufacturing relationship. A U.S. plant typically produces an intermediate good that is then exported to Mexico where it becomes part of the assembly process before a final good is then imported back into the U.S.</p>
<p>The supply trade linkages are supported by the presence in Mexico of foreign-owned, labor-intensive assembly plants for export—the so-called “<a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2022/swe2203/swe2203b">maquiladoras</a>” Over the past 20 years, transportation has accounted for about 24.5 percent of total bilateral manufacturing trade, followed by computer and electronic equipment, 22.4 percent; electrical equipment, appliances and components, 8.5 percent; and machinery (excluding electrical), 7.7 percent.</p>
<p>While Mexico benefits from increased trade with the U.S., the impact on U.S. producers and consumers has been mixed. To the extent that frictions with China account for Mexico’s ascension in the trade rankings, the higher profile comes at a cost to U.S. firms and consumers through higher input and purchase prices.</p>
<p>While the principal focus of trade policy was once free trade, greater efficiency and lower prices, that may no longer be the case. Today’s global economic relationships encompass a myriad of concerns, among them national security, climate policy and supply-chain resiliency.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Monitoring your logs is mostly a tarpit</h2>

	<p><small>August  6, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the reactions to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdRestartHidesProblems">my entry on how systemd's auto-restarting
of units can hide problems</a>
was a suggestion that we should monitor our logs to detect things
like this. As it happens, one of my potentially unpopular views is
that monitoring your logs is generally a tarpit that isn't worth
it. Much of the time you'll spend a great deal of effort to get
very little of worth.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with general log monitoring is that logs
are functionally unstructured. Anything can appear in them and in
a sufficiently complex environment, anything eventually will. This
unstructured randomness means that sorting general signal from
general noise is a large and often never-ending job, and if you
don't do it well, you wind up with a lot of noise (which makes it
almost impossible in practice to spot the signal).</p>

<p>One thing you can theoretically sensibly monitor your logs for is
specific, narrow signals of things of interest; for example, you
might monitor Linux kernel logs for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/MCEUseRasdaemon">machine check error messages</a>. The first problem with monitoring this
way is that there's no guarantee that the message you're monitoring
for won't change. Maybe someday the Linux kernel developers will
decide to put more information in their MCE messages and change the
format. One reason this happens is that almost no one considers log
messages to be an API, and so they feel free to change log messages
at whim.</p>

<p>(But in the mean time, maybe you'll derive enough value or reassurance
from looking for the current MCE messages in your kernel logs. It's a
tradeoff, which I'll get to.)</p>

<p>The second problem with monitoring for specific narrow signals of
interest in your logs is that you have to know what they look like.
It's easy to say that we'll monitor for the Prometheus host agent
crashing and systemd restarting it, but it's much harder to be sure
that we have properly identified the complete collection of log
messages that signal this happening. Remember, log messages are
unstructured, which means it's hard to get a complete inventory of
what to look for short of things like reading the (current) program
source code to see what it logs.</p>

<p>Finally, all of this potential effort only matters if identifiable
problems appear in your logs on a sufficiently regular basis and
it's useful to know about them. In other words, problems that happen,
that you care about, and probably that you can do something about.
If a problem was probably a one time occurrence or occurs infrequently,
the payoff from automated log monitoring for it can be potentially
quite low (you can see this as an aspect of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/AlertsNeverComprehensive">how alerts and
monitoring can never be comprehensive</a>).</p>

<p>But monitoring your logs looks productive and certainly sounds good
and proper. You can write some positive matches to find known
problems, you can write some negative matches to discard noise, you
can 'look for anomalies' and then refine your filtering, and so on.
That's what makes it a tarpit; it's quite easy to thoroughly mire
yourself in progressively more complex log monitoring.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a
solid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main
contents are $\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent
with recent reports [<a data-arxiv-id="2307.12037" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">arXiv:2307.12037</a>; <a data-arxiv-id="2308.01192" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01192">arXiv:2308.01192</a>]. In some small flaky
fragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a
$\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small
pieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,
we show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft
ferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape
anisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to
explain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our
measurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero
resistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not
exhibit superconductivity.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  The report of synthesis of modified Lead apatite (LK-99) with evidence of
superconductivity at more than boiling water temperature has steered the whole
scientific community. There have been several failures to reproduce
superconductivity in LK-99 including partial successes. Here, we have continued
our efforts to synthesize phase pure LK-99 with improved precursors. The
process has been followed as suggested by Sukbae Lee et. al., [1,2]. The phase
purity of each precursor is evidenced by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
well fitted by Rietveld refinement. The PXRD confirms the synthesis of phase
pure polycrystalline LK-99 with apatite structure. The freshly synthesized
sample does not show any signature of superconductivity levitation on a magnet
(diamagnetism). The magnetization measurements on SQUID also show that LK-99 is
diamagnetic at 280 K, there is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room
temperature. Moreover, we have also performed first principle calculations to
investigate the electronic band structure of the LK-99 near Fermi level. Our
study verifies that the Cu doped lead apatite (LK-99) has bands crossing at
Fermi level, indicating generation of strong correlation in the system.

<p>Malignant melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, deploys an elegant molecular mechanism to evade natural immune responses and the therapies intended to boost them, according to new work led by scientists at the <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/cancer.columbia.edu">Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> (HICCC). The findings, published in the current issue of Cancer Cell, explain how these tumors resist an important class of treatments, and suggests new strategies for attacking this and possibly other types of cancer as well.</p>
<p>Normally, the immune system eliminates abnormal cells, but cancers can elude it in various ways. For the past few years, <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/profile/benjamin-izar-md">Benjamin Izar, MD, PhD</a>, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University <a href="https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/">Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> and a member of the HICCC, has been studying how malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, hides itself from immune cells. Initially, Izar’s team identified a signature pattern of gene expression changes associated with melanoma’s apparent cloaking device. “This signature was composed of a couple of hundred genes, so it was difficult to prioritize which of these may be the major functional driver,” says Izar.</p>
<p>More recent experiments singled out a cell surface protein called CD58; in laboratory experiments, tumor cells that suppressed their CD58 expression got much better at escaping immune surveillance. CD58 stimulates T cells, white blood cells especially important for anti-tumor responses. “The activity of T cells is regulated in a variety of ways, so they eliminate cancer or infected cells, but don’t go overboard causing damage to normal tissues,” says Izar. The findings hinted at how melanomas might be hiding from T cells, but didn’t provide the whole story. “This was the basis for asking ‘what are the mechanisms by which CD58 loss may drive cancer immune evasion?’” says Izar, who is the senior author on the new paper.</p>
<p>Izar’s team, including a network of collaborators at institutions across the US and Europe, developed several new techniques to find the answer. To validate their earlier laboratory results, the scientists analyzed samples from melanoma patients before and during treatment with immune-targeting therapies, confirming that real tumors decrease CD58 expression while evading immunity. Meanwhile, “Patricia Ho, an outstanding MD/PhD student in my lab, performed a cool [molecular and cellular] analysis to identify, in an unbiased fashion, the key regulator of CD58: [the protein] CMTM6,” says Izar. The investigators also developed a special mouse model carrying specific human genes and cell types to see exactly how CD58, CMTM6, and other proteins operate in tumors facing the immune system in real time.</p>
<p>The results show that CMTM6 acts as a stabilizer, inhibiting the degradation of both CD58, which stimulates T cell activity, and another cell surface protein called PD-L1, which inhibits it. In fact, these two opposing signaling proteins compete with each other for CMTM6, so by reducing the amount of the pro-T cell CD58, tumor cells free up more of the CMTM6 to stabilize the anti-T cell PD-L1. “This is a double whammy to T cell activity: loss of activation and increased inhibition,” says Izar.</p>
<p>The work helps explain how malignant melanomas readily acquire resistance to immune-targeting therapies and points to ways drug developers might reverse the signaling pattern to restore the tumor’s vulnerability, exchanging its cloaking device for a high-visibility jumpsuit.</p>
<p>“We found, to our knowledge, the first example of a regulatory protein … that balances this yin and yang of immuno-stimulatory and inhibitory signals on cancer cells,” says Izar, adding that “it’s extremely likely that this mechanism is important in other cancers as well.”</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Hours after this post was published, my Goodreads profile was cleaned of the offending titles. However, the garbage books remain available for sale at Amazon with my name attached.</p>



<p>I did file a report with Amazon, complaining that these books were using my name and reputation without my consent. Amazon’s response: “Please provide us with any trademark registration numbers that relate to your claim.” When I replied that I did not have a trademark for my name, they closed the case and said the books would not be removed from sale.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s not much that makes me angry these days about writing and publishing. I’ve seen it all. I know what to expect from Amazon and Goodreads. Meaning: I don’t expect much, and I assume I will be continually disappointed. Nor do I have the power to change how they operate. My energy-saving strategy: move on and focus on what you can control.</p>



<p>That’s going to become much harder to do if Amazon and Goodreads don’t start defending against the absolute garbage now being spread across their sites.</p>



<p>I know my work gets pirated and frankly I don’t care. (I’m not saying other authors shouldn’t care, but that’s not a battle worth my time today.)</p>



<p><strong>But here’s what does rankle me: </strong>garbage books getting uploaded to Amazon where my name is credited as the author. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDCNNX39?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s but one example.</a>) Whoever’s doing this is obviously preying on writers who trust my name and think I’ve actually written these books. I have not. Most likely they’ve been generated by AI.</p>



<p>It might be possible to ignore this nonsense on some level since these books aren’t receiving customer reviews (so far), and mostly they sink to the bottom of search results (although not always). At the very least, if you look at my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jane-Friedman/author/B004KHXQ0U?ref=ap_rdr&amp;store_ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author profile on Amazon</a>, these junk books don’t appear. A reader who applies some critical thinking might think twice before accepting these books as mine.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not great. And it falls on me, the author—the one with a reputation at stake—to get these misleading books removed from Amazon. I’m not even sure it’s possible. I don’t own the copyright to these junk books. I don’t exactly “own” my name either—lots of other people who are also legit authors share my name, after all. So on what grounds can I successfully demand this stop, at least in Amazon’s eyes? I’m not sure.</p>



<p><strong>To add insult to injury, these sham books are getting added to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/625709.Jane_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my official Goodreads profile</a>. </strong>A reasonable person might think I control what books are shown on my Goodreads profile, or that I approve them, or at the very least I could have them easily removed. Not so.</p>



<p>If you need to have your Goodreads profile corrected—as far as the books credited to you—you have to reach out to volunteer “librarians” on Goodreads, which requires joining a group, then posting in a comment thread that you want illegitimate books removed from your profile.</p>



<p>When I complained about this on Twitter/X, an author responded that she had to report 29 illegitimate books in just the last week alone. 29!</p>



<p>With the flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading or fraudulent manner, how can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for the rest of their lives policing this? And if authors <em>don’t</em> police it, they will certainly hear about it, from readers concerned about these garbage books, and from readers who credulously bought this crap and have complaints. Or authors might not hear any thing at all, and lose a potential reader forever.</p>



<p>We desperately need guardrails on this landslide of misattribution and misinformation. Amazon and Goodreads, I beg you to create a way to verify authorship, or for authors to easily block fraudulent books credited to them. Do it now, do it quickly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, even if and when you get these insane books removed from your official profiles, they will still be floating around out there, with your name, on two major sites that gets millions of visitors, just waiting to be “discovered.” And there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.</p>

On Monday, a group of more than 50 on-set employees filed a petition for an election to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers are asking for the election to be held as early as August 21.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3m3000h3b6xd2ypja31@published" data-word-count="76">This marks the first time visual-effects professionals have banded together to demand the same rights, wage protections, and professional watchdog oversight enjoyed by workers in almost every other segment of the entertainment industry. The supermajority of Marvel’s 52-member on-set production crew signed authorization cards to indicate they wish to be represented by the powerful labor union representing some 170,000 artisans, technicians, stagehands, and craftspeople across TV, film, and live theater in the United States and Canada.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3of000i3b6x0ofvhhkt@published" data-word-count="64">“For almost half a century, workers in the visual-effects industry have been denied the same protections and benefits their coworkers and crewmates have relied upon since the beginning of the Hollywood film industry,” VFX organizer for IATSE Mark Patch said in a statement. “This is a historic first step for VFX workers coming together with a collective voice demanding respect for what we do.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3q5000j3b6xgo8q7cb1@published" data-word-count="120">In an era when around 90 percent of all films in release feature varying degrees of VFX fine-tuning (and it’s not uncommon for a show like <em>Stranger Things</em> to showcase up to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-vfx-sound-artists-creating-vecna-1235199328/">4,400 visual-effects shots</a> across a single season), workers within the field have remained stubbornly, confoundingly unrepresented by any professional union or guild. While fellow <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-below-the-line-definition/">below-the-line</a> workers in such divisions as costumes and wardrobe; hair and makeup; lighting, props and paint; and script supervision have been historically championed by IATSE, underappreciated VFX professionals have been unable to claim benefits such as paid overtime and health care, and have been at the mercy of pronounced labor shortages and managers’ unrealistic deadlines — despite the workers’ increasing indispensability within popular culture.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3s5000k3b6xlja3408c@published" data-word-count="52">“Turnaround times don’t apply to us, protected hours don’t apply to us, and pay equity doesn’t apply to us,” said VFX coordinator Bella Huffman. “Visual effects must become a sustainable and safe department for everyone who’s suffered far too long and for all newcomers who need to know they won’t be exploited.”</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3u0000l3b6xw4ostcgd@published" data-word-count="124">The petition for voluntary union recognition from Marvel and its parent company, Disney, arrives amid what the Los Angeles <em>Times</em> has taken to calling the “hot labor summer”: a cultural inflection point when both the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild are on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sag-strike-movies-tv-shows-paused.html">halting productions</a> across Hollywood and throwing the upcoming movie-release corridor into chaos. Just as crucially, however, VFX’s newly strident demands for a seat at the collective-bargaining table also play out against a backdrop of increasing fan displeasure with (and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-movie-review-marvel.html">critical opprobrium</a> toward) the quality of computer-generated imagery in Marvel Studios movies and series, coming perhaps not coincidentally just months after the firing of Marvel’s president of postproduction and VFX, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/04/victoria-alonso-firing-disney-marvel.html">Victoria Alonso</a>.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3w0000m3b6x2ygyuj0m@published" data-word-count="42">Even with the group’s NLRB petition, a VFX workers strike is not out of the question; it is perhaps the most battle-tested and surefire route to union recognition. (Representatives at Disney and Marvel did not respond to requests for comment from Vulture.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3y6000n3b6xff72l4i2@published" data-word-count="116">Leading off the collective-bargaining push with Marvel’s on-set VFX specialists — data wranglers, production managers, witness camera operators, and assistants employed on such MCU series as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/loki/"><em>Loki</em></a> and <em>Daredevil: Born Again, </em>as opposed to the people supplying visual effects in postproduction — arrives as no accident. Thanks to the studio’s fire hose of movie and TV series output (it will oversee the release of five movies and four shows in 2023 alone), Marvel is regarded in VFX circles as the industry’s biggest “bully,” with the capacity to flood effects houses with more work than they know what to do with or ruin careers and standings of those who do not live up to Marvel’s sky-high expectations.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp406000o3b6xbsw691ku@published" data-word-count="188">Hence, as the thinking goes, securing union recognition for a relatively small yet high-profile group of Marvel’s so-called “production-side” professionals would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push. Production-side unity would lead to solidarity at postproduction houses, which would then, in turn, unionize one by one, leading to an inevitable tipping point. The template for this sort of thing was set in the animation world last February when production workers for Adult Swim’s <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> and Hulu’s <em>Solar Opposites </em><a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/production-workers-on-rick-and-morty-and-solar-opposites-file-to-unionize-213740.html">filed a petition</a> with the NLRB for a union election, sparking a new wave of unionization for workers throughout the animation industry by becoming the first to be represented by the IATSE-affiliated Animation Guild. Soon after, workers at the Los Angeles branch of the award-winning production house <a href="https://titmouse.net/">Titmouse</a> joined the guild to begin collective bargaining for their first union contract. And those efforts ultimately compelled a coalition of production workers on the shows <em>American Dad</em>, <em>Family Guy,</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em> <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/07/the-simpsons-family-guy-american-dad-workers-repped-by-animation-guild-1235058303/">to also unionize</a> under the Animation Guild, teeing up new collective-bargaining negotiations for increased benefits with 20th Television Animation last summer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp41r000p3b6x2o37ogua@published" data-word-count="78">“We are witnessing an unprecedented wave of solidarity that’s breaking down old barriers in the industry and proving we’re all in this fight together,” said IATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb. “That doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Entertainment workers everywhere are sticking up for each other’s rights; that’s what our movement is all about. I congratulate these workers on taking this important step and using their collective voice. I urge Marvel Studios to voluntarily recognize their union immediately.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/">https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37040681">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>I just added a big new section to learntla: <a href="https://learntla.com/topics/optimization.html" target="_blank">Optimizing TLA+ Model Checking</a>. I take a spec and then show 15 different optimizations, many of them getting a 10x runtime improvement. Patreon notes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/notes-on-tla-87093195" target="_blank">here</a>. Besides that I've done very little writing the last couple weeks. I'm just in a slump: I sit down to write and the words all come out wrong. It happens sometimes and there's nothing to do about it but wait it out. </p>
<p>So instead of working I've been learning <a href="https://raku.org/" target="_blank">Raku</a>.<sup id="fnref:perl6"><a href="#fn:perl6">1</a></sup> It originally got on my radar after I ranted about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-am-disappointed-by-dynamic-typing/" target="_blank">dynamic languages</a> and a couple of users told me I'd like Raku. I finally checked it out last week to see if it'd make a good "calculator language". I use a hodgepodge of Python, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank">J</a>, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/frink/" target="_blank">Frink</a>, and Excel to do math and they all have their own big drawbacks, so it'd be nice if Raku could round them out.</p>
<p>After several days of experiments, I'm at a loss of <em>how</em> to describe Raku. The best I can come up with is that the language was designed by a bunch of really intelligent gremlins. Gremlins who spent a lot of time gathering feedback from other gremlins. </p>
<h3>Weird Operators</h3>
<p>Raku has no qualms about using Unicode operators. You check set membership with ∈. There's also ∉, ∋, and ∌. It's also fine with alphanumeric infix operators. String repetition op is <code>x</code>. Function composition is <code>o</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"a"</span> <span>x</span> <span>3</span>
<span>aaa</span>
&gt; <span>my</span> <span>&amp;f</span> = <span>&amp;sqrt</span> <span>o</span> <span>&amp;abs</span>
{<span>noise</span>}
&gt; <span>f</span> -<span>3</span>
<span>1.7320508075688772</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>X</code> gives you the cross product of a list, <code>Xf</code> applies <code>f</code> to each element of the cross product, <code>Zf</code> does the same with zip.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>X</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
((<span>a</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>3</span>))
&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>Xx</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
(<span>a</span> <span>aa</span> <span>aaa</span> <span>b</span> <span>bb</span> <span>bbb</span> <span>c</span> <span>cc</span> <span>ccc</span>)
&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>Zx</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
(<span>a</span> <span>bb</span> <span>ccc</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p>If <code>f</code> is an infix operator, then <code>[f]</code> reduces a list and <code>[\f]</code> accumulates it: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
<span>15</span>
&gt; [\+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>3</span> <span>6</span> <span>10</span> <span>15</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>~~</code> is the "anything goes" matcher.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>"abc"</span> <span># do the strings match?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>Str</span> <span># is abc a string?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ {.<span>chars</span> == <span>3</span>} <span># is abc length 3?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>so</span> <span>"abc"</span> ~~<span> /^b/</span> <span>#does abc start with b?</span>
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, there's <code>...</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Defining operators</h3>
<p>So you know how some languages let you define infix operators? Raku lets you also define new circumfix and <em>postcircumfix</em> operators.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># circumfix</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>circumfix:</span><span>&lt;[∀ zz&gt;</span>(<span>$inner</span>){<span>sum</span>(<span>$inner</span>)}
&gt; [∀ <span>1</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>5</span>..<span>.10</span> <span>zz</span>
<span>25</span>

<span># vector inner product!</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>postcircumfix:</span><span>&lt;| ⟩&gt;</span>(<span>@left</span>, <span>@inside</span>){[+] (<span>@left</span> <span>Z</span>* <span>@inside</span>)}
&gt; <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>|<span>&lt;4 5 6&gt;</span>⟩
<span>32</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In addition to left- and right-associative infix operators, you can define operators to be chain associative (like how <code>x &lt; y &lt; z</code> is <code>x &lt; y &amp;&amp; y &lt; z</code>) and "list" associative (<code>a op b op c</code> is <code>op(a, b, c)</code>).</p>
<h3>Multiple dispatch</h3>
<p>So Raku has "multiple dispatch", meaning that you overload a function with multiple different type signatures and it will choose the appropriate one. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># @ is for iterable types</span>

<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>$x</span>,<span>@arr</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr</span>, <span>$x</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr1</span>, <span>@arr2</span>) {<span>@arr1</span> <span>Z</span>+ <span>@arr2</span>}

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>);
(<span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span>)

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;3 4 5&gt;</span>)
(<span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This isn't weird, lots of languages have multiple dispatch. What <em>is</em> weird is that you can also dispatch based on a <em>runtime predicate of the value</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span> <span>where</span> {<span>$x</span> &gt; <span>0</span>}) {<span>$x</span>}
<span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span>) {-<span>$x</span>}

&gt; <span>map</span> <span>&amp;my_abs</span>, <span>&lt;-4 4&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also the signature of a function is a first-class value, as are the parameters in the signature.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you define a <code>MAIN</code> function, any parameters you give it will be automatically turned into CLI flags.</li>
<li>Objects have way more preloaded methods than I've seen in any language, and I used to do Rails. The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List" target="_blank">List object</a> has methods for getting all permutations, all k-combinations, and all sliding windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" target="_blank">Junctions</a> are this weird type-value-thing for doing multiple comparisons at once. <code>1|2</code> expands to <code>any(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 &lt; 1|2</code>. <code>1&amp;2</code> expands to <code>all(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 !&lt; 1&amp;2</code>.<ul>
<li>Oh yeah and you can negate any infix operator by prefixing it with <code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raku is the only language I've ever seen that has <code>$kebab-case</code> names <em>and</em> infix subtraction, I'm guessing because sigils disambiguate <code>x-y</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes" target="_blank">regex syntax</a> isn't backwards compatible with Perl 5. For <em>thirty years</em> languages followed the PCRE "standard" and Perl 6 just…  threw it all away.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's just a tiny slice of all the weird Raku features, since I've only been looking at calculator applications so far. I haven't even learned about the object system, packages, or <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial" target="_blank">grammars</a>! And even so, I <em>still</em> left out a ton of stuff. Like in a function body, <code>samewith</code> will call the same function with new arguments.</p>
<p>I think if I had to maintain a Raku legacy codebase my brain would explode. I have no idea how people would manage to write this language In The Large. At the same time, it seems incredible for programming In The Small. One-off scripts, computations, personal tooling, all the kinds of things I wanted to do with it in the first place.</p>
<p>I've also seen some really frustrating things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The documentation is really poor and the heavy reliance on symbols makes it hard to search for things. I've learned a lot of poorly-documented languages but Raku is much bigger and more complex than any of them and it can be real demotivating.</li>
<li>The REPL crashes on Windows if I type in any Unicode. The compiler is also pretty slow, with even small files taking half a second or more. Iterating on things is painful.</li>
<li>I hate the sigil thing. I spent half an hour debugging a problem because I wrote <code>$x</code> instead of <code>@x</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall? Maybe I'm just a gremlin at heart, but I think I like this language and want it to succeed. I assume I'll have a more balanced picture thoughts after I use it in anger. I just hope that over time the compile times and documentation improve.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article> <div id="readme"><h2>Doculite</h2>
<p>DocuLite lets you use SQLite like Firebase Firestore. It's written in Typescript and an adapter on top of sqlite3 and sqlite. It support listeners on documents, collections, and basic queries. Feedback &amp; Bugs to <a href="mailto:thedoculite@gmail.com">thedoculite@gmail.com</a>.
This is early work, so please treat it appropriately.</p>
<h2>Current features</h2>
<h2>1. Initialize a DB</h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import { Database } from "doculite"
const db = new Database();
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Create Collections and Set Documents</h2>
<p>Collections are created on first insertion of a document. They are represented by a SQLite Table.</p>
<pre><code>// create ref to the doc. Doc ID optional.

const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
const refWithoutId = db.collection("users").doc();

// Any valid Javascript object that can be parsed to valid JSON can be inserted as a document.

await usersRef.set({ username: "John Doe", createdAt: "123", updatedAt: "123" });
await refWithoutId.set({ username: "Jane Doe" });

</code></pre>
<h2>3. Get a particular document</h2>
<pre><code>// define ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
// get
const user = await usersRef.get();
// print
console.log(user); // prints { username: "John Doe" };

</code></pre>
<h2>4. Update Documents in Collections</h2>
<pre><code>// ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// Properties existing on both old and new object will be updated.
// Properties only existing on the new object will be added.

// If merge is false, properties only present on the old object will be deleted.
// Merge is true by default

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: true });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345", createdAt: "123" }

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: false });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }

</code></pre>
<h2>5. Delete Documents in Collection</h2>
<pre><code>const db = new Database();

const ref = db.collection("users").doc("deletable");

await ref.set({ username: "deletableUsername", updatedAt: 123123 });

await ref.delete();

const doc = await ref.get();

console.log(doc) // prints null

</code></pre>
<h2>6. Listen to real-time updates of documents.</h2>
<pre><code>
// ref to doc
const ref = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// snapshot listener returns unsubscribe function
const unsub = ref.onSnapshot((doc) =&gt; {
console.log("Omg the user doc is updating!", doc?.username);
});

await ref.set({ username: "SHEESH Doe", updatedAt: 2 });
// prints: `Omg the user doc is updating! SHEESH Doe`

// unsub
unsub();

</code></pre>
<h2>7. Query Documents in a collection by equality comparison</h2>
<pre><code>
const usersRef = db.collection("users");

await usersRef.doc().set({ username: "Doculite", updatedAt: 234 });

const query = usersRef.where("username", "Doculite");

const docs = await query.get();

const user = docs[0]

console.log(user.username) // prints `Doculite`

</code></pre>
<h2>Potential roadmap:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Better query-based system</li>
<li>Stability and speed updates</li>
<li>Delete collections</li>
<li>Subcollections</li>
<li>Listeners on queries / multiple documents</li>
<li>Queries with other comparison operators (&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, contains, etc.)</li>
<li>Queries for multiple variables (without indexes, probably)</li>
<li>Queries with Full Text Search (without indexes, probably)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>

    </div>
<p>Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries power smartphones, electric vehicles and storage for solar and wind energy, among other technologies.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>They descend from another technology, the lithium-metal battery, that hasn't been developed or adopted as broadly. There's a reason for that: While lithium-metal batteries have the potential to hold about double the energy that lithium-ion batteries can, they also present a far greater risk of catching fire or even exploding.
</p><p>Now, a study by members of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA reveals a fundamental discovery that could lead to safer lithium-metal batteries that outperform today's lithium-ion batteries. The research was published today in the journal <i>Nature</i>.
</p><p>Metallic lithium reacts so easily with chemicals that, under normal conditions, corrosion forms almost immediately while the metal is being laid down on a surface such as an electrode. But the UCLA investigators developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a surprising shape—the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
</p><p>"There are thousands of papers on lithium metal, and most descriptions of the structure is qualitative, such as 'chunky' or 'column-like,'" said Yuzhang Li, the study's corresponding author, an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a member of CNSI.
</p><p>"It was surprising for us to discover that when we prevented surface corrosion, instead of these ill-defined shapes, we saw a singular polyhedron that matches theoretical predictions based on the metal's crystal structure. Ultimately, this study allows us to revise how we understand lithium-metal batteries."
</p><p>At tiny scales, a lithium-ion battery stores positively charged lithium atoms in a cage-like structure of carbon that coats an electrode. By contrast, a lithium-metal battery instead coats the electrode with metallic lithium. That packs 10 times more lithium into the same space compared to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium-ion+batteries/" rel="tag">lithium-ion batteries</a>, which accounts for the increase in both performance and danger.
</p><p>The process for laying down the lithium coating is based on a 200-plus-year-old technique that employs electricity and solutions of salts called electrolytes. Often, the lithium forms microscopic branching filaments with protruding spikes. In a battery, if two of those spikes crisscross, it can cause a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/short+circuit/" rel="tag">short circuit</a> that could lead to an explosion.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>The revelation of the true shape of lithium—that is, in the absence of corrosion—suggests that the explosion risk for lithium-metal batteries can be abated, because the atoms accumulate in an orderly form instead of one that can crisscross. The discovery could also have substantial implications for high-performance energy technology.
</p><p>"Scientists and engineers have produced over two decades' worth of research into synthesizing metals including gold, platinum and silver into shapes such as nanocubes, nanospheres and nanorods," Li said. "Now that we know the shape of lithium, the question is, Can we tune it so that it forms cubes, which can be packed in densely to increase both the safety and performance of batteries?"

<p>Until now, the prevailing view had been that the choice of electrolytes in solution determines the shape that lithium forms on a surface—whether the structure resembles chunks or columns. The UCLA researchers had a different idea.
</p><p>"We wanted to see if we could deposit lithium so quickly that we outpace the reaction that causes the corrosion film," said UCLA doctoral student Xintong Yuan, the study's first author. "That way, we could potentially see how the lithium wants to grow in the absence of that film."
</p><p>The researchers developed a new technique for depositing lithium faster than corrosion forms. They ran current through a much smaller electrode in order to push electricity out faster—much like the way that partially blocking the nozzle of a garden hose causes water to shoot out more forcefully.
</p><p>A balance was required, however, because speeding up the process too much would lead to the same spiky structures that cause short circuits; the team addressed that issue by adjusting the shape of their tiny electrode.
</p><p>They laid down lithium on surfaces using four different electrolytes, comparing results between a standard technique and their new method. With corrosion, the lithium formed four distinct microscopic shapes. However, with their corrosion-free process, they found that the lithium formed miniscule dodecahedrons—no bigger than 2 millionths of a meter, or about the average length of a single bacterium—in all four cases.
</p><p>The researchers were able to see the shape of lithium thanks to an imaging technique called <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cryo-electron+microscopy/" rel="tag">cryo-electron microscopy</a>, or cryo-EM, which beams electrons through frozen samples in order to show details down to the atomic level while inhibiting damage to the samples.
</p><p>Cryo-EM has become ubiquitous in biosciences for determining the structures of proteins and viruses. Use for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/materials+science/" rel="tag">materials science</a> is growing, and the UCLA researchers had two key advantages.
</p><p>First, when Li was a graduate student, he demonstrated that cryo-EM can be used to analyze lithium, which falls to pieces when exposed to an electron beam at room temperature. Second, the team performed experiments at CNSI's Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines, which is home to several cryo-EM instruments that have been customized to accommodate the types of samples used in materials research.
</p><p>"Cross-pollination between the biology and chemistry communities is producing new ideas," said Matthew Mecklenburg, a co-author of the study and managing director of the imaging center. "We're applying our extensive experience analyzing small molecules, proteins and viruses using cryo-EM methods in new ways to look at battery materials that are sensitive to the electron beam."
</p><p>Li said the new technique for depositing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium/" rel="tag">lithium</a> still requires further work to optimize it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>Well, well, well... It looks like <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a> isn't the only company out there that is willing to bet all its chips on reusing other people's content for AI training. </p>



<p>Zoom Video Communications, Inc. <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently updated its Terms of Service</a> to encompass what some critics are calling a significant invasion of user privacy.</p>



<p>In a detailed perusal of the newly updated terms, two sections - <strong>10.2</strong> and <strong>10.4</strong> - stand out for their broad-ranging implications on how Zoom is permitted to utilize user data. These sections establish Zoom's rights to compile and utilize "Service Generated Data," which is any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects in connection with users' use of their services or software.</p>



<p>Zoom's updated policy states that all rights to Service Generated Data are retained solely by Zoom. This extends to Zoom's rights to modify, distribute, process, share, maintain, and store such data "for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law."</p>



<p>What raises alarm is the explicit mention of the company's right to use this data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, including training and tuning of algorithms and models. This effectively allows Zoom to train its AI on customer content without providing an opt-out option, a decision that is likely to spark significant debate about user privacy and consent.</p>



<p>Additionally, under section 10.4 of the updated terms, Zoom has secured a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license" to redistribute, publish, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content.</p>



<p>Zoom justifies these actions as necessary for providing services to customers, supporting the services, and improving its services, software, or other products. However, the implications of such terms are far-reaching, particularly as they appear to permit Zoom to use customer data for any purpose relating to the uses or acts described in section 10.3.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates and legal experts are expected to scrutinize these updated terms closely. Many argue that they push the boundaries of what is acceptable in terms of consent, data privacy, and individual rights. While Zoom's intentions may be focused on improving their platform and delivering better service, the breadth and depth of these changes may leave many users uncomfortable and seeking assurances about how their data is being used.</p>



<p>Zoom has yet to comment (added below) on the updates and potential concerns raised by these changes. As this unfolds, the debate around privacy in the digital age and the responsibility of companies in respecting user privacy continues to intensify.</p>

<h3>An update</h3>



<p>Biella Coleman picked this story up and <a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman/status/1688332659108257792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted it out</a>, which got this trending and invoked a response from Zoom. </p>



<p>Aparna Bawa, COO at Zoom, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left a comment on Hacker News</a>,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features (recently launched on a free trial basis) and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.</p>



<p>Also, Zoom participants receive an in-meeting notice or a Chat Compose pop-up when these features are enabled through our UI, and they will definitely know their data may be used for product improvement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I myself also got an email from a spokesperson, who said that, <em>"Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features, and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes."</em>.</p>



<p>While these are all lovely responses, and at least they're being involved in the discussion, they don't actually answer the <strong>10.4</strong> clause in the Terms of Service, which states,</p>



<blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>Git is a widely used distributed version control system that allows software development teams to have multiple local copies of the project's source code that are independent of each other. Version control has come to be associated with Git—it is unquestionably the best version control program for new developers to start learning due to its popularity and wealth of resources related to its use. Read on for an overview of the basics.</p>

<h2>Git configuration: Linux</h2>

<p>Most Linux installations have Git, but to check, execute the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>

<p>You should get output that is similar to the following:</p>

<pre>git version 2.40.1</pre>

<h2>Git configuration: Windows</h2>

<p>Git searches the <code>$HOME</code> directory for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file on Windows systems.</p>

<p>We need to tell Git to keep track of our login and email when we use it, as shown in the code snippet below. This makes it possible for other code contributors to identify the change's author and our contact information in case of problems.</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "username"

$ git config --global user.email "useremail"</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command if you need assistance:</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>This command will open a browser containing configuration commands. Essentially, the <code>help</code> command gives a manual from the help page for the given command.</p>

<p>You can also use the same command in the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --help</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command to view configurations:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config -l</code></pre>

<h2>Working with repositories</h2>

<p>A directory that Git will track is called a <strong>repository</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>or repo. The Git repository contains the whole of our project. Git will trace any change we make. We'll use the command below to create a test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir test</code></pre>

<p>We can then use the following command to enter the test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd test</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>git init</code> command inside the directory lets Git know that it is a Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git init&nbsp;

Empty Git repository created and initialised in /home/uname/test/.git</code></pre>

<p>Now a Git repository exists in this directory. Showing the <code>.git</code> file that Git generated inside the directory will be helpful; use the command as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>.git</pre>

<p>The directory is now a Git repository. In fact, deleting the <code>.git</code> directory will uninitialize the repository (this can be very helpful when you're just starting out). Run the following command to make your directory a non-Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm.git -rf</code></pre>

<p>Use this only if you truly want to start over because it will remove Git from the directory completely.</p>

<p>Let's create two files in the test directory with the names <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code>. This will show how Git tracks files:</p>

<pre><code>$ touch file1.txt
$ touch file2.txt</code></pre>

<h2>Staging files: git add&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The principles of the staging environment and the commit are essential to Git. You can add, change, or remove files as you work. However, anytime you reach an important stage or complete a portion of the work, you should move the files to a staging environment. Files that have been <strong>staged</strong> are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. (We'll discuss commits in more detail in a later section.)</p>

<p>We can see what Git is tracking using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status

On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; File2.txt</code></pre>

<p><code>git status</code> displays a list of newly added or modified files and directories in the Git repository. In our example,&nbsp;<code>file1.txt</code> and <code>file2.txt</code> have been modified.</p>

<p>We must stage the files in order to instruct Git to keep track of changes. Let's use the <code>add</code> command to stage <code>file1.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file1.txt

$ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; &nbsp;(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
Untracked files:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>file1.txt</code> is listed under <strong>Changes to be committed</strong> by Git. This indicates that Git is keeping note of any modifications made to this file in order to commit those modifications to the repository. Let's add <code>file2.txt</code> now:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file2.txt


$ git status
...
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>You can instruct Git to monitor a file or directory using the <code>add</code> command or to stop tracking a file or directory with the <code>unstaging</code> command.</p>

<p>The git <code>rm</code> command is used to remove individual files or a set of files using the filename, as shown below. The <code>git rm --cached</code> command maintains a file in the working directory while removing it from the Git index.&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>$ git rm --cached file1.txt
rm file1.txt

$ git status
…
Untracked files: (
&nbsp; use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>file1.txt</code> file is no longer being tracked.</p>

<h2>Keeping track of untracked files</h2>

<p>We frequently need a quick way to tell Git to add everything that is untracked to the staging area. We can do this by using <code>*</code> or <code>.</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add --all</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add .</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add *</code></pre>

<p>Stage all changes (new, changed, and deleted) files by using <code>--all</code> rather than specific filenames.</p>

<h2>Commits</h2>

<p>Git uses <strong>commits</strong> to make changes to files and directories permanent. In a sense, every commit represents a new version of our repository. Even while a commit can be seen to be a more permanent change, Git makes it simple to undo those changes, which is the strength of version control with Git.</p>

<p>For Git users, this alters the fundamental development model. Git developers have the option to build up commits in their local repo before making a change and committing it to the main repository. It accomplishes this by tracking the history of commits. Git's main purpose is to allow users to make commits. Everything we wanted to stage has already been done, so we can now make those modifications.&nbsp;<code>git commit</code> is used to do this.</p>

<p>When using the <code>git commit</code> command, we recommend always including two arguments: <code>-a</code> and <code>-m</code>.</p>

<h3>Stage all modified files: git commit -a</h3>

<p>Add all untracked files to the staging area with the <code>-a</code> or <code>--all</code>&nbsp;option. Note that only previously added files and folders are added using this method. Use the <code>add</code> command first if a file or directory has to be added that hasn't already been.</p>

<h3>Commit messages: git commit -m</h3>

<p>A commit message should always be included when making a commit. The <code>-m</code> or <code>--message</code> option is used for this. This message should be brief and descriptive, with just enough information included in the commit statement to summarize your actions since the last commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -am "my first git commit"</code></pre>

<h3>View change history: git log</h3>

<p>To view the history of changes that have been committed to a Git repository, use the <code>git log</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log</code></pre>

<p>In order to make our output easier to read and only to show the first seven characters of the commit ID, we'll also use the option <code>--oneline</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -oneline</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>cf0p490 (HEAD -&gt; main) my first git commit</pre>

<p>In this example, the commit ID's first seven characters are <code>cf0p490</code>. There will be a lot of commits; thus each one needs to have its own identification. We can move the <code>HEAD</code> pointer around as necessary.</p>

<h2>Publishing changes: git push</h2>

<p>Finally, the <code>git push</code> command is used to upload content from a local repository to a remote repository. <strong>Pushing</strong> refers to the process of transferring commits from your local repository to a remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin branchname</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div b-gj8cwnhyng=""><p>Where C# is the most dominant language in the .NET world, other languages are built on top of the Framework that deserves their respective place. F# is strong when it comes down to functional programming! In this blog post, we will leverage the power of F# and C# to showcase where both excel!</p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?</h2>
<p>Before I go into the details of the code, I want to explain why this works. Why can we use F# code in C# and vice versa? The answer is simple: the .NET Framework is a runtime that can execute code written in different languages. The runtime is responsible for compiling the code to an intermediate language (IL) that the runtime can execute. If your code is dependent on other libraries, you are not relying on the source code but the IL code of that library. I already had a whole blog post about that: <a href="https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/aa23a1c9-8ab2-4b05-9bd2-52624af7b684">"<em>What is the difference between C#, .NET, IL and JIT?</em>"</a>. Have a read here if you are interested in more details.</p>
<p><img src="https://linkdotnetblog.azureedge.net/blog/20220612_CSharpDotNetJit/Dotnet.webp" alt=".NET"></p>
<h2 id="f">F#</h2>
<p>Here is a very brief introduction: F# is a functional-first programming language in the .NET ecosystem. It is designed to provide the expressive power of functional programming alongside the robustness of object-oriented paradigms. It enjoys all of the benefits of the .NET Framework itself: open-source, platform-independent, and strongly typed.</p>
<pre><code>let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)

printfn "Factorial of 5 is %d" (factorial 5)
</code></pre>
<p>F# also has some distinct features C# does not offer, the most prominent: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions">Discriminated unions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-use-case">The use case</h2>
<p>I want to showcase where F# excels - and oftentimes, that can be the domain layer of your application. Especially then when you have a lot of calculations (basically where functional programming excels in the first place). Let's create a small domain project that is written in F# and see how it could look like in C#. I will create a "small online" shop that can take orders and calculate a discount (a percentage or a fixed amount). Before we go into F#, have a look at the C# code:</p>
<pre><code>
public class Product 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine 
{
    public Product Product { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}

public enum DiscountType { Percentage, FixedAmount }

public class Discount 
{
    public DiscountType Type { get; set; }
    public decimal Value { get; set; }
}

public record Order(List&lt;OrderLine&gt; OrderLines, Discount Discount)
{
    public decimal CalculateTotalPrice() 
    {
        decimal subtotal = OrderLines.Sum(ol =&gt; ol.Product.Price * ol.Quantity);
        decimal totalDiscount = 0M;

        if (Discount != null) {
            totalDiscount = Discount.Type == DiscountType.Percentage 
                                ? subtotal * Discount.Value / 100M 
                                : Discount.Value;
        }

        return subtotal - totalDiscount;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the sake of simplicity, I left out a lot of validation and error handling. I hope you get the idea anyway. Now let's see how this would look like in F#:</p>
<pre><code>type Product = { Name: string; Price: decimal }
type OrderLine = { Product: Product; Quantity: int }

type Discount = 
    | Percentage of float
    | FixedAmount of decimal

type Order(orderLines: OrderLine list, discount: Discount option) =
    member this.CalculateTotalPrice() =
        let subtotal = List.sumBy (fun ol -&gt; ol.Product.Price * (decimal ol.Quantity)) orderLines
        let totalDiscount =
            discount
            |&gt; Option.map (fun d -&gt; 
                match d with
                | Percentage p -&gt; subtotal * (decimal p / 100M)
                | FixedAmount f -&gt; f)
            |&gt; Option.defaultValue 0M
        subtotal - totalDiscount
</code></pre>
<p>Wow - that is really slim. Let's go through the code step by step. First, we have the <code>Product</code> and <code>OrderLine</code> types. They are just simple records that hold the data. Then we have the <code>Discount</code> type. This is a discriminated union that can either be a <code>Percentage</code> or a <code>FixedAmount</code>. The <code>Order</code> type class takes a list of <code>OrderLine</code> and an optional <code>Discount</code>. The <code>CalculateTotalPrice</code> method is the same as in the C# example. The only difference is that we use the <code>Option</code> type to handle the <code>null</code> case. The <code>Option</code> type is a discriminated union that can either be <code>Some</code> or <code>None</code>. We can use pattern matching to handle both cases. In this case we use the <code>Option.map</code> function to map the <code>Discount</code> to a <code>decimal</code> value. If the <code>Discount</code> is <code>None</code> we use the <code>Option.defaultValue</code> function to return <code>0M</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can easily integrate that to a controller:</p>
<pre><code>[ApiController]
[Route("api/orders")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private static readonly List&lt;Order&gt; Orders = new();

    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; CreateOrder([FromBody] List&lt;OrderLine&gt; orderLines, [FromBody] Discount discount)
    {
        var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
        var order = new Order(fsharpOrderLines, discount);
        Orders.Add(order);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOrderById), new { id = Orders.Count - 1 }, order);
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}")]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; GetOrderById(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id];
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}/total")]
    public ActionResult&lt;decimal&gt; GetOrderTotalPrice(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id].CalculateTotalPrice();
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt;&gt; GetAllOrders()
    {
        return Orders;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There might be a very special line here that needs some clarification:</p>
<pre><code>var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ListModule.OfSeq</code> function is a helper function that converts a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code>. The <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> type is a sequence of elements. It is a lazy collection that is only evaluated when needed. This is a very powerful concept that is used a lot in F#. You can read more about it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/sequences">here</a>. In this case we need to convert the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> because the <code>Order</code> type expects a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> as input.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this blog post gave you a good overview of how you can use F# and C# together. It can be a very powerful tool, and F# has some unique strengths that can make your life easier!</p>

                    <p>It has been one and a half years since <a target="_blank" href="https://aeroxplorer.com/articles/ukrainian-civil-airspace-closed.php">the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>. Since the onset of the war, many sanctions have been placed on Russia, including on the country's aviation industry. Many parts in (western made) Russian passenger aircraft that would normally be easily replaced are rapidly wearing out with no replacement parts in sight due to the import of spare aircraft parts from Boeing and Airbus being banned since March 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the aforementioned sanctions, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot is experiencing problems replacing worn-out brakes on "foreign" (non-Russian-made) aircraft.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-PMqbC8cGnKGcbaCJVqhy.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: A T | AeroXplorer</figcaption></figure><p><br>Due to Aeroflot's inability to replace worn-out brakes on its fleet, the airline has requested that its pilots turn off the brakes on affected aircraft. Currently, nine Aeroflot planes are flying with turned brakes: five Boeing 777-300ERs, one Airbus A330-300, one Airbus A320, and two Airbus A321s.&nbsp;</p><p>An aircraft can land without brakes, as during landing most of the work of stopping a commercial aircraft is done through the use of thrust reversers. However, landing without the aid of brakes will significantly increase the amount of runway an aircraft uses on landing. Brakes are also necessary for aborting takeoffs, through the use of Auto Brakes, which automatically activate should pilots decide to abort a takeoff for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the airline requesting pilots turn off brakes on affected aircraft, mechanics and technicians in Aeroflot's flight operations department are actively warning pilots of the increased risk of runway overruns. When pilots land an affected Aeroflot aircraft (without brakes), "...The aircraft will tend to turn to the side...especially when landing on a wet runway with a side [side] wind..."&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Moscow Times, Russian Airlines are allowed to refuse the repair of aircraft brakes for up to 10 days, after which they must either be replaced or turned off, with a notification of the Federal Agency for Air Transport (FATA) required.&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-OkB9TGwo6uOx0i6j4tjr.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Lukasz S.</figcaption></figure><br>&nbsp;<h2>Russian aviation is becoming progressively more dangerous.&nbsp;</h2><p>As of August 2022, there does not appear to be any end in sight to the seemingly endless Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent sanctions. Due to the scarce supply of aircraft parts, many Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, are cannibalizing their own aircraft for parts. Demand within the Russian passenger aviation industry is growing, and most of Russia's civilian aircraft fleet is comprised of foreign aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>While Russia is attempting to increase its domestic aircraft production with aerospace companies by the likes of Irkut (Yakovlev), and Tupolev, this will happen gradually. So for now, the Russian aviation industry will remain in a dangerous position in which the risk of crashes will remain at a drastically high level, primarily due to sanctions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aeroflot - One Of The Oldest Airlines In The World.&nbsp;</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/XhqQl3aaA8ovFX8mfO2Z.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Cody Newton</figcaption></figure><p>Founded in 1923, 100-year-old Aeroflot has a fleet of 172 aircraft, most all composed of Airbus and Boeing. Currently, just two aircraft in the airline's fleet are Russian-made - two Sukhoi SuperJet SSJ-100-95s. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the airline has made an additional 389 aircraft orders with Russian plane-makers Sukhoi, Tupolev, and Irkut (Yakovlev) to make up for canceled aircraft orders with Airbus and Boeing.</p><p>Prior to 2022, the airline had over 200 routes, connecting cities within Russia and abroad. The airline also had numerous other routes in the form of codeshares through its SKYTEAM alliance membership, which was also suspended following the resumption of the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>
