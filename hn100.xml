<h2 id="laborberlinstate-of-the-art_16mm_projector">LaborBerlin: State-of-the-Art 16mm Projector</h2>


<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<div>

<p>
While artists all over the world continue to work with celluloid film, they are often confronted with precarious screening conditions due to increasingly old and hard to repair equipment. In particular, film projectors and their aging mechanical parts have become less dependable, contributing in many cases to the destruction of the film material instead of ensuring its optimal presentation. The last 16mm commercially available film projector was built in the 90’s but most artists, archivists and projectionists have to deal with much older equipment, sometimes going back to the 60’s and 50’s. At the same time, the traditional industrial manufacturers have disappeared or shifted to other fields, service personnel have retired and spare parts are rare and unreasonably priced. Designed mainly for standard film projections, vintage projectors also fail to cater to contemporary demands: While not offering enough flexibility for artists who work in expanded cinema, they also don’t usually meet the needs of archival projection. Along with the digital revolution, which has, in the last decade, already greatly reduced the opportunities for experiencing analogue film projection, the aging technology of vintage projection equipment has become an important factor in the disappearance of analogue film projection and the uniqueness of its experience.
</p>



</div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div>

<p>
Our idea is to develop a state-of-the-art and modular 16mm film projector using only open-source technologies and non-proprietary/commonly available spare parts. We believe that especially the central mechanical elements of the old projectors – claw mechanism, shutter wheel and film transport - are in most cases so well engineered that a new development here would be a waste of time and energy. Instead, we want to build the projector on the basis of an existing - and easily available - projector mechanism. The same applies to the optics: lenses that are compatible with projectors made by Eiki, Bauer, Bell &amp; Howell and Hokushin are available worldwide in good condition. This projector should cater to the needs of contemporary film artists, archivists and projectionists alike.

<h2 id="state_of_the_project_march_2023">State of the Project – March 2023</h2>
<div>

<p>
Our project takes place over a period of two and a half years, and should be completed by September 2025 with the presentation of a prototype at the Back To The Future Festival in Rotterdam.
</p>

<p>
As a first step, in a team of two, we disassembled four film projector models, which we found offered a suitable mechanical system that could serve as the basis for further development. We have defined three fields of development, for which we will have to collaborate with different experts. These fields are light source, film transport mechanism and electronics.
</p>

<p>
But before we can take the next step, we also realised that we are at a junction where we first have to decide which path to take:
</p>

<p>
<strong>A. </strong>Develop a flexible upgrading system which suits various existing projector models. This would ensure that artists would be able to upgrade their own projector model, no matter where they live and what projector they own. Our concern is that it may be difficult to develop parts that can adapt with various existing mechanical parts.
</p>

<p>
<strong>B. </strong>Develop an upgrading system for only one widely available projector model. This would enable us to develop much more specific parts and create an integrated concept for that one type. The downside is that many projector models are not equally available in all parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<strong>C. </strong>Develop a DIY-Kit, replicating mechanics from various existing models, using techniques like 3D-printing , CNC- and laser cutting. This would enable artists all over the world to build up their own, modular and state-of-the-art projector from scratch. Eventually we could provide and ship readymade parts that would be too difficult to produce individually.
</p>

<p>
Once this crucial decision has been made, we want to bring an expert in electromechanics on board to accompany the project through to the prototype. At the same time, we want to build an online community with whom we can share our ideas and who can also test and improve individual parts. We are already in contact with several people who are independently working on similar developments and who are waiting to finally share their knowledge and experiences with each other. In the end, we will hire an industrial designer to work with us in order to build a prototype.

<h2 id="state_of_the_project_february_2024">State of the Project – February 2024</h2>
<div>

<p>
In August 2023 we decided that before building a prototype, we first needed to find an LED light source that is capable of replacing the common 24V 250W halogen bulb. Chzech film artist Jan Kulka recommended high density LEDs from Chinese manufacturer <a href="https://www.getiangroup.com/specialty-white-cob-leds.html" title="https://www.getiangroup.com/specialty-white-cob-leds.html" rel="ugc nofollow">Getian</a>, which he has used for his <a href="https://www.pramitacka.cz/archeoscope.pdf" title="https://www.pramitacka.cz/archeoscope.pdf" rel="ugc nofollow">Archeoscope</a> expanded cinema machine. Over a period of 6 months we tested several LEDs with different Wattage, starting from 200W, then moving up to 400W, 600W and finally 800W. We based our decisions not only on the brightness but also on the size of the LED chips in relation to the 16mm projector gate.
</p>

<p>
In order to achieve comparable and realistic testing parameters, we took out a 16mm gate with lens holder from an old Bell &amp; Howell projector. We placed the LEDs as close as possible to the gate and step-by-step turned up the voltage in 0.5V increments. We then measured the temperature on the chip, and the brightness of the projection, using a lux meter.
</p>

<p>
After a few attempts we noticed that we were always reaching a critical temperature of 60°C (recommended by the manufacturer) even before the LEDs reached the rated power capacity and the highest brightness. We realised that we would have to find a more efficient cooling system then the computer processor heat sink with fan that we had started with. The next step to achieve more brightness was to try out water cooling. For our tests we chose a <a href="https://www.caseking.de/alphacool-eisbaer-aurora-360-cpu-complete-water-cooling-digital-rgb-360mm/WASE-452.html" title="https://www.caseking.de/alphacool-eisbaer-aurora-360-cpu-complete-water-cooling-digital-rgb-360mm/WASE-452.html" rel="ugc nofollow">water cooling system (AIO)</a> that is usually used for gaming computers. This actually allowed us to operate the LEDs with much higher voltage and up to their maximum capacities without over heating. Finally with an 800W LED we were able to reach close to twice the brightness of a 24V 250W halogen bulb.

<div>

<p>
After coming to the conclusion that the 800W LED was the most appropriate for our project, we decided that the next step should be to test the LED with a projector that had a working transport mechanism which would allow us to run a test film through the projector and check the quality of the projection. This would mean that we would have to find a projector that we would need to modify in order to fit the LED and cooler. This brought us back to the question of which path to take with the project in general. It became clear that in the time frame that we have for the project, it was most important to be able to test a system where we had variable control over the light and the transport mechanism and that we should focus first on these two parameters. That meant focusing on replacing the lamp and motor in an already existing projector instead of trying to design an entirely new projector from scratch or instead of trying to engineer a hybrid model with the best features of various projectors. So we decided to modify the Eiki RT model because of its availability, robust construction and the amount of space that it offered in the housing for modifications. The simplicity of its transport mechanism was also the factor as well as the idea that the modifications we would make could be easily reproduced by others.
</p>

<p>
At this stage we decided to bring in somebody with more expertise with projector construction and modification. Based on his experience building his own custom projection devices we asked <strong>Jan Kulka</strong> from Prague to join our team and continue the development of the prototype with us. In April 2024 we met in Berlin and decided on the next steps to follow. Even though our wish list contains a vast number of possible functions, we decided to focus initially on replacing the motor and installing a flickering LED Lamp that would replace the mechanical shutter.

<h2 id="st_prototype_with_800w_led_water_cooling_variable_fps_shutter_blades_angle">1st Prototype with 800W LED, water cooling, variable FPS, shutter blades &amp; angle</h2>
<div>

<p>
<br>
<strong>Jan Kulka </strong>took over the technical engineering of our first prototype. The aim was to modify an Eiki RT-2 projector and implement the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The prototype should be capable of projecting 16mm film at variable frame rates from 0 - 30FPS</p>
</li>
<li><p> Our 800W high density LED should be installed, cooled by an AiO water cooling system to avoid blowing the LED or burning the film</p>
</li>
<li><p> The original shutter wheel should be replaced by an entire digital approach through flickering the LED</p>
</li>
<li><p> The prototype should be ready to be presented at ALUD festival in Barcelona by end of October 2024</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point of time, we knew that our SPECTRAL project partners from Mire (Nantes) had already appointed experts for their “wandering devices project” to work out a modification of the same projector model, similar to what we had in mind. Their design, created by Zach Poff, Stefan Voglsinger, Guillermo Tellechea &amp; Loic Verdillon can be seen here: <a href="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/mire-wandering/wandering-16mmprojection/start" title="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/mire-wandering/wandering-16mmprojection/start" rel="ugc nofollow">Wandering 16mm projector retrofit</a>. Since all four devices projects within the SPECTRAL project are meant to be open source and to be replicated and improved by others, we decided to take over larger parts of their concept as a basis for our prototype. So we discussed with Jan that it would make sense to take over the code, the choice of the encoder, the motor model and the ‘virtual shutter’ system from their wandering devices project. This would give us more time and capacities to focus on the implementation of the 800W high density LED and the AiO water cooling system.
</p>

<p>
Jan decided to use only basic tools like a power drill, angle grinder and basic hand tools. Only in one case an ultrasonic saw had to be used. In order to make sure that anybody could do the same modification without the need for special machinery, no 3D printing or laser cutting were being used. Due to heat resistance reasons, most custom made parts were made of aluminum. Jan and the technicians he employed did a marvellous job as the following technical details and photos reveal:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Eiki RT-2 projector - original parts that have been removed</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> mechanical shutter &amp; sill image clutch &amp; dowser</p>
</li>
<li><p> power supply</p>
</li>
<li><p> motor</p>
</li>
<li><p> fan</p>
</li>
<li><p> all electronics</p>
</li>
<li><p> sound board</p>
</li>
<li><p> lower part of the body</p>
</li>
<li><p> to accommodate the hoses of the water cooler, some holes had to be drilled &amp; grinded into the inner part of the body</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>2. New light source</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
<li><p> Mosfet – semiconductor for switching the 800W LED</p>
</li>
<li><p> three big resistors for safety &amp; better control of the LED</p>
</li>
<li><p> extra fan for cooling the resistors &amp; Mosfet</p>
</li>
<li><p> Condensor lens (probably taken from a Kodak Pageant 16mm projector)</p>
</li>
<li>
</li>
<li><p> yet to come: fan for gate, fan for space in between LED and condensor</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>3. Two new power supplies</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>4. New motor</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Quicrun Fusion SE brushless system for Crawler 2-IN-1 with FOC (field oriented control) driver embedded within the motor itself, for accurate positioning &amp; control, big torque at slow &amp; fast speeds, compact size &amp; light weight</p>
</li>
<li><p> Motor pulley 16 teeth (GT2 type)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Main shaft pulley 100 teeth (GT2 type)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Timing belt (GT2 type)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Magnetic encoder / neodym magnet mounted on main shaft – detects angle of main shaft for precise motor control &amp; frame counting</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>5. New control electronics</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Main circuit board accommodates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p> ESP - main controler</p>
</li>
<li><p> step down module to 5V</p>
</li>
<li><p> inputs &amp; outputs to control panel potentiometers &amp; buttons</p>
</li>
<li><p> Relay to switch optical sound LED</p>
</li>
<li><p> PWM signal output for the main LED power supply – to control the output voltage/current for the main LED chip (dimming)</p>
</li>
<li><p> PWM signal to the motor driver – to control the motor</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p> New soundboard (simple pre-amp for line out) for optical sound, using Eiki original light sensor &amp; small LED light source (replacing original exciter lamp)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Arduino Nano for resetting the ESP &amp; Motor driver when Machine gets switched on</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p> The main LED Chip is  switched on &amp; off by Mosfet HY 4306 (mounted on new aluminium heatsink with a small fan), controlled by ESP-Wroom-32 - this serves as the electronic shutter </p>
</li>
<li><p> 800W LED is powered &amp; dimmed by Meanwell 1000W UHP-1000-48 power supply. The output voltage is controlled by an external VC (voltage control). This VC is generated by our custom made board, which is receiving the PWM signal from the ESP and translates it into 0-10V VC, which from there is being sent to the power supply's own output regulation system (no extra dimmer needed, dimming can be programmed digitally)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h2 id="feedback_loop_ii_25nd_oct_2024_at_alud_festival_barcelona">Feedback Loop II – 25nd Oct 2024 at ALUD Festival, Barcelona</h2>
<div>

<p>
<br>
As part of<strong> <a href="https://crater-lab.org/alud-4/" title="https://crater-lab.org/alud-4/" rel="ugc nofollow">¡Alud! #4</a></strong>, a festival organised by our project partner Crater Lab, which is entirely dedicated to expanded cinema, we presented our first prototype at a so-called feedback loop, a public gathering where makers &amp; experts are having a detailed look at the various technical achievements during the Devices project. All four groups showed their latest version of their <a href="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/start" title="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/start" rel="ugc nofollow">various prototypes</a> in an exhibition kind of set-up. A few participants who could not attend in person, like Zach Poff and Matt McWilliams in the US, were joining the discussion via streaming. The open and hands-on character of the event allowed a direct exchange of feedbacks about technical features and solutions between all participants, on-site as well as online. Due to our logistic restrictions across countries, this was the first opportunity for our research team to see our prototype in a direct, side-by-side comparison with a similar, unmodified projector model with the original 250W halogen bulb, both projecting the same film. It was amazing to see the brightness and versatility of our projector, nevertheless we also observed a few flaws. This is what we found:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brightness: </strong>The projection of our prototype was much brighter compared to the 250W halogen projector</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Colours: </strong>Even though our 800W LED only has a CRI of 70, the colours looked saturated and vivid. The often debated importance of the CRI value doesn't seem to be as relevant in projection as it definitely is for scanning and colour grading in post production</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Features: </strong>All variable transport functionalities worked like a charm</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optics: </strong>Since we are currently using an obscure condenser lens, we should work out a better optical system that can easily be replicated by anyone who wants to modify their own projector </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanics: </strong>The projector seems to be very sensitive to tape splices, even though we took extra care to make sure they are accurate. Also Jan pointed out that he had come across one vintage film roll that didn't even get moved by the claw mechanism. Quick adjustments of the claw position did not solve the problem, we will have to do a complete CLA before we can go ahead. For the final release of our projector, we should also consider including sufficient information how to solve such problems</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Projection: </strong>Especially in the comparison with the original 250W halogen projector, we found the projected image flickering too much. In direct comparison, the much dimmer image of the halogen projector looks much smoother. This happens especially when the 800W LED is set to higher brightness. But the virtual number of shutter blades and the virtual shutter angle also play a big role in here</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We discussed the possible reasons for the flicker:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Electronics: </strong>Zach Poff suggested that there could be a problem with the output from mosfet. We will have to measure with an oscilloscope whether there are any flaws in the electronics</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sync: </strong>It could be a sync problem between the pull of the claw and the flicker of the LED, especially after the prototype had been shipped in a van over a distance of 1700 kms from Prague to Barcelona. The neodym magnet that is attached to the main shaft, only holds by its own magnetic force. So a microscopic shift of its position on the shaft could have caused a slight jitter in the projection</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Human perception:</strong> It is possible that with the brightness of our LED, we may have reached a certain threshold, at which the image flicker appears more apparent to the human eye. Matt McWilliams pointed out that back in the days when drive-in theatres in the US increased the brightness of their projections, they also upgraded from two to three shutter blades to compensate for the occurring flicker</p>
</li>
<li><p> It could be possible that all three reasons may be adding up upon each other and that way cause more flicker</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div>

<p>
After the Feedback Loop in Barcelona we decided to first look into the flicker problems before going ahead with implementing more features in Phase IV. It turned out the the flicker was caused by several issues which were adding up upon each other. One major problem was the misalignment of the projector's pull-down claw mechanism. Due to poor reproduction quality, the service manual for Eiki RT series did not really help, but finally we found an online version of the <a href="http://www.k3camera.com/pdfs/eiki/2009-eiki-nt-nst-service-manual.pdf" title="http://www.k3camera.com/pdfs/eiki/2009-eiki-nt-nst-service-manual.pdf" rel="ugc nofollow">service manual for Eiki NT series</a> which gives very detailed instructions for cam tank adjustments (Page 27–31).
</p>

<p>
Another source for the flicker were minor fluctuations in the pulse output of the Mosfet HY 4306 semiconductor that switches the 800W LED. These fluctuations could be resolved by changing the code that is running the ESP-Wroom-32.

</p>

<p>
In order to get a real life impression of the projector's projection quality and capacities we decided that we need to see the projection in direct comparison with reference 16mm film projectors. We met at a screening room in Berlin and set up four projectors side-by-side. We fixed further minor mechanical issues and projected two (almost) equal film prints of a well preserved corporate film about land mapping and road construction.
</p>

<p>
Later we used a lux meter to measure the projection brightness at a distance of approx. 10 meter from the screen All projectors were running at their native 24 fps frame rate and equipped with an Isco Vario Kiptaron 1.3 / 35-65mm lens:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State-of-the-Art 16mm Prototype</strong> – LED 800 W – 2 virtual blades                           530 Lux   (white with minimal pink tint?)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki EX-2000 N2</strong> – Xenon lamp 350 W – 2 shutter blades                                          480 Lux   (green tint)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki SSL-2 (Super Slim Slot Load)</strong> – halogen lamp 250 W – 2 shutter blades         410 Lux   (yellow tint)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki RT-2</strong> – halogen lamp 200 W – 2 shutter blades                                                   305 Lux   (orange tint)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even though it helped using two (almost) equal film prints of the same film for comparison, it turned out that both prints were very different in colour tint and sharpness. Swapping prints and lenses systematically finally helped us understand that our prototype delivers a slightly brighter, sharper and much whiter image compared to the Eiki EX-2000 N2 Xenon Projector.

                  <p>I think the Chinese law is effective in this regard: in order to maintain any non-competition agreement, the company must continue to pay you a monthly compensation amount equal to 30% of your total monthly income when you were at the company. Whenever the payment stops, the non-competition agreement is automatically void.</p>

                  <p>WA is busy losing its way on taxation vs value provided for taxes paid and reporting burden. so imo these IP issues are almost second order effects at this point. i personally expect a continued exodus over some of the latest tax hikes for example taxing cap gains beyond a certain amount at an additional 7%. as if niit was not bad enough.  if residents could at least see some value from these added taxes maybe it could be something. also the estste tax there kicks in quickly and has hidden gotchas even for people who no longer live there.</p>

                  <p>I'm not sure what conclusions you think we should draw from that. California's advantage over Washington is primarily one of size - Washington's GDP per capita is actually about 3% higher than California's. The most generous interpretation I can think of is that you're crediting the non-compete difference for California's far larger population, which is tenuous at best.</p>

Now it needs to be <i>very</i> specific if they want to enforce it (not just "development work in the same industry" which most contracts had back when I graduated), only applicable for maximum a year, and they have to pay your salary for the time they stop you working somewhere else.</p>

                  <p>How is a union any different in that respect than a corporation? I mean on a theoretical level. A true free-market firm would just be an association of individuals making individually negotiated transactions, with no employee-employer relationship, and no coordination on the side of purchasing labor. Of course that's very inefficient outside of pure theory. A corporation acts as a coordinating body that collectively negotiates the purchasing of labor contracts, and a union collectively negotiates on the selling side.</p>

This would be how I understood a broad definition.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>On the heels of the disastrous House reconciliation bill’s passage, Senate Republicans have unveiled their own poisonous version of the bill that will fund President Trump’s agenda—a bill that calls for the outright sale of public lands as a key element.</p>
<p>The provision in question mandates the disposal of between 2 million and 3 million acres of lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service across 11 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Alarmingly, the provision contains very limited exemptions—Wilderness Study Areas, Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, roadless areas and critical habitat are all considered eligible for sale. <strong>Based on those limited restrictions, more than 250 million acres of public lands will be eligible to be sold to "any interested party."</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate just how much is at stake, we’ve created a map of all public lands that are now at risk of disposal.</p>

<p>About a year ago, we<a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-a-logging-platform-with-clickhouse-and-saving-millions-over-datadog"> shared the story of LogHouse </a>- our internal logging platform built to monitor ClickHouse Cloud. At the time, it managed what felt like a massive 19 PiB of data. More than just solving our observability challenges, LogHouse also saved us millions by replacing an increasingly unsustainable Datadog bill. The response to that post was overwhelming. It was clear our experience resonated with others facing similar struggles with traditional observability vendors and underscored just how critical effective data management is at scale.</p>
<p>A year later, LogHouse has grown beyond anything we anticipated and is now storing over 100 petabytes of uncompressed data across nearly 500 trillion rows. That kind of scale forced a series of architectural changes, new tools, and hard-earned lessons that we felt were worth sharing - not least that OpenTelemetry (OTel) isn’t always the panacea of Observability (though we still love it), and that sometimes custom pipelines are essential.</p>
<p><strong>In our case, this shift enabled us to handle a 20x increase in event volume using less than 10% of the CPU for our most critical data source - a transformation with massive implications for cost and efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>Other parts of our stack have also changed, not least due to the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-acquires-hyperdx-the-future-of-open-source-observability">ClickHouse acquisition of HyperDX</a>. Not only did this give us a first-party ClickHouse-native UI, but it also led to the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickstack-a-high-performance-oss-observability-stack-on-clickhouse">creation of ClickStack </a>- an opinionated, end-to-end observability stack built around ClickHouse. With HyperDX, we’ve started transitioning away from our Grafana-based custom UI, moving toward a more integrated experience for exploration, correlation, and root cause analysis.</p>
<p>As more teams adopt ClickHouse for observability and realize just how much they can store and query affordably, we hope these insights prove as useful as our first post. If you’re curious about this journey, when and where OTel is appropriate, and how we scaled a log pipeline to 100PB…read on.</p>

<p>Over the past year, our approach to observability has undergone a significant transformation. We've continued to leverage OpenTelemetry to gather general-purpose logs, but as our systems have scaled, we began to reach its limits. While OTel remains a valuable part of our toolkit, it couldn't fully deliver the performance and precision we needed for our most demanding workloads. This prompted us to develop purpose-built tools tailored to our critical systems and rethink where generic solutions truly fit. Along the way, we've broadened the range of data we collect and revamped how we present insights to engineers.</p>

<p>When we last wrote about LogHouse, we were proud to handle 19 PiB of uncompressed data across 37 trillion rows. Today, those numbers feel like a distant memory. LogHouse now stores over 100 petabytes of uncompressed data, representing nearly 500 trillion rows.
Here's a quick look at the breakdown:</p>




















<table><thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Uncompressed Size</th><th>Stored rows</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SysEx</td><td>93.6 PB</td><td>431 Trillion</td></tr><tr><td>OTel</td><td>14.5 PB</td><td>16.7 Trillion</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>These numbers also tell a story. In our original post, 100% of our telemetry flowed through OpenTelemetry, with every log line collected via the same general-purpose pipeline. But as the scale and complexity of our data grew, so did the need for specialization.
While our total volume has grown more than 5x, the breakdown reveals a deliberate shift in strategy: today, the vast majority of our data comes from “SysEx”, a new purpose-built exporter we developed to handle high-throughput, high-fidelity system logs from ClickHouse itself. This shift marks a turning point in how we think about observability pipelines - and brings us to our first key topic.</p>
<p>We hope the following helps comprehend the scale at which LogHouse operates.</p>


<p>Initially, we used OpenTelemetry (OTel) for all log collection. It was a great starting point and an established industry standard which allowed us to quickly establish a baseline where every pod in our Kubernetes environment shipped logs to ClickHouse. However, as we scaled, we identified two key reasons to build a specialized tool for shipping our core ClickHouse server telemetry.</p>
<p>First, while OTel capably captured the ClickHouse text log via stdout, this represents only a narrow slice of the telemetry ClickHouse exposes. Any ClickHouse expert knows that the real gold lies in its <strong>system tables</strong> - a rich, structured collection of logs, metrics, and operational insights that go far beyond what’s printed to standard output. These tables capture everything from query execution details to disk I/O and background task states, and unlike ephemeral logs, they can be retained indefinitely within a cluster. For both real-time debugging and historical analysis, this data is invaluable. We wanted all of it in LogHouse.</p>
<p>Second, the inefficiency of the OTel pipeline for this specific task became obvious as we scaled.</p>

<p>The data journey involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer's ClickHouse instance writes logs as JSON to stdout.</li>
<li>The kubelet persists these logs in <code>/var/log/…</code></li>
<li>An OTel collector collects these logs from the disk, parsing and marshalling the JSON into an in-memory representation.</li>
<li>The collector transforms these into the OTel log format - again an in-memory representation.</li>
<li>Finally, they are inserted back into another ClickHouse instance (LogHouse) over the native format (requiring another transformation within the ClickHouse Go client).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The architecture described here is simplified. In reality, our OTel pipeline is more involved. Logs were first collected at the edge in JSON, converted into the OTel format, and sent over OTLP to a set of gateway instances. These gateways (also OTel collectors) performed additional processing before finally converting the data into ClickHouse’s native format for ingestion. Each step introduced overhead, latency, and further complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At our scale, this pipeline introduced two critical problems: inefficiency and data loss. First, we were burning substantial compute on repeated data transformations. Native ClickHouse types were being flattened into JSON, mapped into the OTel log format, and then re-ingested - only to be reinterpreted by ClickHouse on the other end. This not only wasted CPU cycles but also degraded the fidelity of the data.
Even more importantly, we were hitting hard resource limits on the collectors themselves. Deployed as agents on each Kubernetes node, they were subject to strict CPU and memory constraints via standard Kubernetes limits. As traffic spiked, many collectors ran so hot they began dropping log lines outright - unable to keep up with the volume emitted by ClickHouse. We were losing data at the edge before it ever had a chance to reach LogHouse.
We found ourselves at a crossroads: either dramatically scale up the resource footprint of our OTel agents (and gateways) or rethink the entire ingestion model. We chose the latter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: To put the cost in perspective - handling 20 million rows per second through the OpenTelemetry pipeline without dropping events would require an estimated 8,000 CPU cores across agents and collectors. That’s an enormous footprint dedicated solely to log collection, making it clear that the general-purpose approach was unsustainable at our scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our solution was to develop the <strong>System Tables Exporter</strong>, or <strong>SysEx</strong>. This is a specialized tool designed to transfer data from one ClickHouse instance to another as efficiently as possible. We wanted to go directly from the system tables in a customer's pod to the tables in LogHouse, preserving native ClickHouse types and eliminating all intermediate conversions. This has the fantastic side benefit that any query our engineers use to troubleshoot a live instance can be trivially adapted to query historical data across our entire fleet in LogHouse, as the table schemas are identical, with the addition of some enrichment columns (such as the Pod Name, ClickHouse version, etc).</p>
<p>Firstly we should emphasize that SysEx performs a <strong>literal byte-for-byte copy</strong> of data from the source to the destination. This preserves full fidelity, eliminates unnecessary CPU overhead, and avoids the pitfalls of repeated marshalling.</p>

<p>The architecture is simple and powerful. We run a pool of SysEx scrapers connecting to our customer's ClickHouse instances. A hash ring assigns each customer pod to a specific scraper replica to distribute the load. These scrapers then run SELECT queries against the source pod's system tables and stream the data directly into LogHouse, without any deserialization. The scrapers simply coordinate and forward bytes between the source and destination.
Scraping system tables requires careful handling to ensure no data is missed due to buffer flushes. Fortunately, nearly all system table data is inherently time-series in nature. SysEx leverages this by querying within a sliding time window, deliberately trailing real time by a small buffer - typically five minutes. This delay allows for any internal buffers to flush, ensuring that when a scraper queries a node, all relevant rows for that time window are present and complete. This strategy has proven reliable and meets our internal SLAs for timely and complete event delivery to LogHouse.</p>
<p>SysEx is written in Go, like most of our infrastructure components for ClickHouse Cloud. Naturally, this raises a question for anyone familiar with the Go ClickHouse client: how do we avoid the built-in marshalling and unmarshalling of data when reading from and writing to ClickHouse? By default, the client converts data into Go-native types, which would defeat the purpose of a byte-for-byte copy. To solve this, we <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/pull/1233">contributed improvements</a> to the Go client that allow us to <strong>bypass internal marshalling entirely</strong>, enabling SysEx to stream data in its native format directly from the source cluster to LogHouse - without decoding, re-encoding, or allocating intermediary data structures.</p>
<p>This approach is broadly equivalent to a simple bash command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -s -u <span>'default:&lt;password&gt;'</span> <span>"https://sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com:8443/?query=SELECT+*+FROM+system.query_log+FORMAT+Native"</span> | curl -s -X POST --data-binary @- <span>'http://localhost:8123/?query=INSERT+INTO+query_log+FORMAT+Native'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>An actual go implementation for the curious can be found <a href="https://pastila.nl/?00740eb5/722157a76fc25f54212d7097b805253b#OSfprbH3wM1dGgtyMAnmuw==">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, SysEx doesn’t require the heavy buffering that OTel does, thanks to its pull-based model. Because scrapers query data at a steady, controlled rate, we don’t risk dropping logs when LogHouse is temporarily unavailable or when the source experiences a spike in telemetry. Instead, SysEx naturally handles backfill by scraping historical windows, ensuring reliable delivery without overloading the system or requiring complex retry buffers.</p>


<p>One of the key challenges with the SysEx approach is that it assumes the source and target schemas match. But in reality, as any ClickHouse user knows, system table schemas change frequently. Engineers continuously add new metrics and columns to support emerging features and accelerate issue diagnosis, which means the schema is a moving target.</p>
<p>To handle this, we generate schemas dynamically. When SysEx encounters a system table, it inspects and hashes its schema to determine if a matching table already exists in LogHouse. If it does, the data is inserted there. If not, a new schema version is created for this system table e.g. <code>text_log_6</code>.</p>
<p>At query time, we use ClickHouse’s <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-01#better-merge-tables">Merge table engine</a> to unify all schema iterations into a single logical view. This allows us to query across multiple versions of a system table seamlessly. The engine automatically resolves schema differences by selecting only the columns that are compatible across tables, or by restricting the query to tables that contain the requested columns. This gives us forward compatibility as schemas evolve, without sacrificing query simplicity or requiring manual schema management.</p>

<p>As we continued to scale and refine our observability capabilities, one of our primary focuses was capturing in-memory system tables, such as <code>system.processes</code>. Unlike the time-series data we’ve been capturing, these tables provide a snapshot of the server’s state at a specific point in time. To handle this, we implemented a periodic snapshot process, capturing these in-memory tables and storing them in LogHouse.</p>
<p>This approach not only allows us to capture the state of the cluster at any given moment, but also provides time-travel through critical details like table schemas and cluster settings. With this additional data, we are able to enhance our diagnostic capabilities by performing cluster-wide or ClickHouse Cloud-wide analyses. This we can join against service settings or query characteristics like used_functions to pinpoint anomalies, making it easier to identify the root causes of issues as they arise. By correlating queries with particular schemas, we further improved our ability to proactively identify and resolve performance or reliability problems for our customers.</p>

<p>One of the many powerful capabilities we've unlocked with SysEx is the ability to take the same <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/common-issues-you-can-solve-using-advanced-monitoring-dashboards">Advanced Dashboard queries</a>  that customers use to monitor their individual ClickHouse instances and run them across our entire fleet of customer instances simultaneously.</p>
<p>For release analysis, we can now execute proven diagnostic queries before and after deployments to immediately identify behavioral changes across our entire fleet. This has been rolled into our comprehensive release analysis process. Queries that analyze query performance patterns, resource utilization trends, and error rates complete in real time, allowing us to quickly spot regressions or validate improvements at fleet scale.</p>
<p>Secondly, our support dashboards can now embed the same deep diagnostic queries that customers rely on, but with enriched context from our centralized telemetry. When investigating customer issues, support engineers can run familiar Advanced Dashboard queries while simultaneously correlating with network logs, Kubernetes events, data and control plane events - all within the same interface.</p>

<p>The efficiency gains from this SysEx are staggering. Consider these stats from LogHouse:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OTel Collectors:</strong> Use over 800 CPU cores to ship 2 million logs per second.</li>
<li><strong>LogHouse Scrapers (SysEx):</strong> Use just 70 CPU cores to ship 37 million logs per second.</li>
</ul>
<p>This specialized approach has allowed us to handle a 20x increase in event volume with less than 10 percent of the CPU footprint for our most important data source. Most importantly, it means we no longer drop events at the edge. To achieve this same level of reliability with our previous OTel-based pipeline, <strong>we would have needed over 8,000 CPU cores</strong>. SysEx delivers it with a fraction of the resources, maintaining full fidelity and consistent delivery.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, you might be wondering: when is OpenTelemetry still the right choice, and is it still useful?
We firmly believe that it is. While our architecture has evolved to meet challenges at extreme scale, such as parsing and processing over 20 million log lines per second, OpenTelemetry remains a critical part of our stack. It offers a standardized, vendor-neutral format and provides an excellent onboarding experience for new users - and is hence the default choice for ClickStack. Unlike SysEx, which is tightly integrated with ClickHouse internals, OpenTelemetry decouples producers from consumers, which is a major architectural advantage, especially for users who want flexibility across observability platforms.</p>
<p>It is also well suited for scenarios where SysEx cannot operate. SysEx is pull-based and relies on querying live system tables, which means the service must be healthy and responsive. If a service is crash-looping or down, SysEx is unable to scrape data because the necessary system tables are unavailable. OpenTelemetry, by contrast, operates in a passive fashion. It captures logs emitted to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, even when the service is in a failed state. This allows us to collect logs during incidents and perform root cause analysis even if the service never became fully healthy.
For this reason, we continue to run OpenTelemetry across all ClickHouse services. The key difference is in what we collect. Previously, we ingested everything, including trace-level logs. Now, we collect only info-level and above. This significantly reduces the data volume and allows our OTel collectors and gateways to operate with far fewer resources. The result is a smaller, more focused pipeline that still accounts for the 2 million log lines per second referenced earlier.</p>

<p>Collecting all this data is just the beginning. Making it usable and accessible is what really matters. In the first iteration of LogHouse, we built a highly customized observability experience on top of Grafana. It served us well, but as our internal data sources grew and diversified, particularly with the introduction of SysEx and wide-column telemetry, it became clear we needed something more deeply integrated with ClickHouse.</p>
<p>This challenge was not unique to us. Many teams building observability solutions on ClickHouse have encountered the same issue. Getting data into ClickHouse was straightforward, but building a UI that fully unlocked its value required significant engineering effort. For smaller teams or companies without dedicated frontend resources, ClickHouse-powered observability was often out of reach.</p>
<p>HyperDX changed that. It provided a first-party, ClickHouse-native UI that supports log and trace exploration, correlation, and analysis at scale. Its workflows are designed with ClickHouse in mind, optimizing queries and minimizing latency. When we evaluated HyperDX prior to the acquisition, it was already clear that it addressed many of the pain points we and others had experienced. The ability to query using Lucene syntax dramatically simplifies data exploration and is often sufficient. Importantly, it still allows us to query in SQL - something which we still find essential for more complex event analysis - see “SQL for more complex analysis”.</p>
<p>A key reason HyperDX was such a compelling fit was the schema-agnostic <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickstack-a-high-performance-oss-observability-stack-on-clickhouse">approach introduced in v2.0</a>. It doesn't require log tables to conform to a single, rigid structure. This flexibility is critical for a system like LogHouse, which ingests data from numerous sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seamlessly handles the standardized, yet evolving, data format from our <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> pipeline.</li>
<li>More importantly, it works out-of-the-box with the highly specialized, wide-column tables produced by <strong>SysEx</strong> and our other custom exporters. It does this with no prior knowledge of the SysEx schemas, or complex <em>grok pattern</em> specializations. It simply inspects the schema behind-the-scenes and adapts to work with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means our engineering teams can add new data sources with unique, optimal schemas to LogHouse without ever needing to worry about breaking or reconfiguring the user interface. By combining HyperDX's powerful UI and session replay capabilities with LogHouse's massive data repository, we have created a unified and adaptable observability experience for our engineers.</p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that Grafana still has its place in our observability stack. Our internal Grafana-based application has some distinct advantages, particularly in how it handles routing and query scoping. Users are required to specify the namespace (effectively a customer service) they intend to query. Behind the scenes, the application knows exactly where data for each service resides and can route queries directly to the appropriate ClickHouse instance within LogHouse. This minimizes unnecessary query execution across unrelated services and helps keep resource usage efficient.</p>
<p>This is especially important in our environment, where we operate LogHouse databases across many regions. As our previous blog post described, efficiently querying across these distributed systems is critical for performance and reliability. We’re currently exploring how we might push this routing logic to ClickHouse itself, allowing HyperDX to benefit from the same optimization..so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In addition to its routing capabilities, Grafana remains the home for many of our long-standing dashboards and alerts, particularly those built on Prometheus metrics. These remain valuable, and migrating them is not currently a priority. For example, kube_state_metrics has almost become a de facto standard for cluster health monitoring. These high-level metrics are well suited for alerting, even if they are not ideal for deep investigation. For now, they continue to serve their purpose effectively.</p>
<p>For now, the two tools serve complementary purposes and coexist effectively within our observability stack.</p>

<p><em>Store everything, aggregate nothing</em></p>
<p>The development of SysEx has brought more than just technical gains. It has driven a cultural shift in how we think about observability. By unlocking access to system tables that were previously unavailable, where only standard output logs had been captured, we have embraced a model centered on wide events and high cardinality data.</p>
<p>Some refer to this as Observability 2.0. <strong>We simply call it LogHouse combined with ClickStack.</strong></p>
<p>This approach replaces the traditional three-pillar model with something more powerful: a centralized warehouse that can store high-cardinality telemetry from many sources. Each row contains rich context - query identifiers, pod names, version metadata, network details - without needing to pre-aggregate or discard dimensions to fit within the limits of a metric store.</p>
<p>As engineers, we have adapted to this new model, leaving behind outdated concerns about cardinality explosions. Instead of summarizing at ingest time, we store everything as is and push aggregation to query time. This approach allows for in-depth inspection and flexible exploration without sacrificing fidelity.</p>
<p>One pattern we have found particularly impactful is logging wide events that include timeseries attributes in place of traditional metrics. For example, here is a log line from SysEx that tracks data pushed from a source ClickHouse instance to the LogHouse cluster:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"level"</span><span>:</span> <span>"info"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"ts"</span><span>:</span> <span>1728437333.011701</span><span>,</span>

  <span>"podIP"</span><span>:</span> <span>"10.247.29.9"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"spokenName"</span><span>:</span> <span>"plum-qa-31"</span><span>,</span>

  <span>"windowSize"</span><span>:</span> <span>120</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"insertDuration"</span><span>:</span> <span>0.00525254</span><span>,</span>

  <span>"stopLT"</span><span>:</span> <span>1728437033</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you may be asking: <strong>how is this different from a traditional metrics store like Prometheus?</strong></p>
<p>The key difference is that we store <strong>every single data point</strong>. We do not pre-aggregate fields like <code>insertDuration</code>; instead, we capture and retain each value and store it together.</p>
<p>In contrast, a system like Prometheus typically stores either a gauge per series or, more commonly, pre-aggregates values into histograms to support efficient querying. This design introduces significant limitations. For example, storing time series for all label combinations in Prometheus would lead to a cardinality explosion. In our environment, with tens of thousands of unique pod names, each label combination would require its own timeseries just to preserve query-time flexibility. Pre-aggregating with histograms helps control resource usage but comes at the cost of fidelity. It makes certain questions impossible to answer, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Which exact insert is represented by this spike in insertDuration - down to the specific instance, table, and time window?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our approach, we avoid these trade-offs entirely. We log each event as a wide row that captures all relevant dimensions and metrics in full. This shifts aggregation and summarization to query time while preserving the ability to drill down into individual events when necessary.</p>
<p>This model isn’t entirely new. Systems like Elasticsearch have long encouraged the ingestion of wide events and flexible document structures. The difference is that ClickHouse makes this approach operationally viable at scale. Its columnar design allows us to store high-cardinality, high-volume event data efficiently - without the runaway storage costs or query latency that traditionally limited these kinds of approaches to storing events.</p>

<p>The power of this approach is in how we can use that single event to draw many different conclusions by visualising its various characteristics, and we can always jump back to the raw logs from any given point on a chart.</p>
<p>First, we can focus on a particular service and see its inserts line by line in series. This is the raw view upon the data.</p>

<p>We can visualize the insert lag for all tables for this individual instance trivially…</p>

<p>We may go a layer up and visualise the insert lag for all servers in a region, which have lag &gt; desired.</p>

<p>And, because Observability is <em>Just another Data Problem</em>, we get to borrow all of the tooling in the data science space for our observability data, so we can visualise our logs in any tool of our choice for which C<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/data-visualization">lickHouse either integrates directly</a> or <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/language-clients">via a client library</a>.

Whether it’s Hex, Bokeh, Evidence, or any other platform that supports SQL-driven analysis, they are free to work with the approach that suits them best.</p>
<p>Here, we saw five views of the same event - demonstrating the flexibility we have to choose how we render at query time, using different charting tools, always with the ability to drill down into the raw line-by-line events.</p>

<p>HyperDX offers a robust event search interface utilizing Lucene syntax, ideal for quick lookups and filtering. However, to answer more complex observability questions, a more expressive query language is needed. With ClickHouse as the engine behind LogHouse, we can always drop into full SQL</p>
<p>SQL allows us to express joins, time-based operations, and transformations that would be difficult or impossible to perform in typical log query tools. One example is identifying pod termination times by correlating Kubernetes event streams. The query below uses ASOF JOIN to align Killing and Created events for the same container, calculating the time between termination and restart:</p>

<p>Sure, we could write a component to track this as a metric, but the power of ClickHouse is that we don’t need to do so. It’s sufficient to store a warehouse of wide events and derive the metric we need at query time from them. So, when a colleague asks, ‘what’s the p95 replacement time for Pods after termination is requested’, we can just find a relevant set of events instead of responding, 'let me ship a new metric ', and getting back to them with an answer after the next release goes out.</p>

<p>Sold on the immense value of having deep, structured telemetry in a high-performance analytics engine, we've been busy adding more data sinks to LogHouse, mainly at the request of our engineering and support team, who love using LogHouse and want all critical data to live in the warehouse. This year, we've embraced a cultural shift towards high-cardinality, wide-event-based observability as shown above.</p>
<p>Some of our new data sources, which adhere to this wide event philosophy, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>kubenetmon:</strong> Our open-source tool for monitoring Kubernetes networking, giving us deep insights into cluster traffic. <code>kubenetmon</code> uses Linux's conntrack system to capture L3/L4 connection data with byte/packet counts. This provides three key capabilities: forensics (time-series connection records with per-minute bandwidth), attribution (mapping connections to specific workloads and pods), and metering (cost tracking for expensive data transfer like cross-region egress). The system processes millions of connection observations per minute, helping us identify costly cross-regional downloads, track cross-AZ traffic patterns, and correlate network usage with actual costs. You can find the project at<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubenetmon"> https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubenetmon</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes Event Exporter:</strong> We forked the popular exporter and added a native ClickHouse sink, allowing us to analyze Kubernetes API events at scale. You can find our fork <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubernetes-event-exporter">here</a>. This is hugely useful for understanding why things changed in K8s over time. We’re not stopping there, however! We’re already working on a plan to ingest not just the events, but the entire k8s object model into LogHouse, with snapshots at every change. This would allow us to model the full state of all clusters at any moment in time over the past six months, and step through all of the changes. Instead of just knowing "Pod X was terminated at 15<!-- -->," we’ll see the full cluster state before and after, understand dependencies, resource constraints, and the cascading effects of changes.</li>
<li><strong>Control Plane Data:</strong> We collect all operational data from our Control Plane department, who had not yet onboarded into LogHouse.</li>
<li><strong>Real User Monitoring (RUM):</strong> In a project that is still a work in progress, we collect frontend performance metrics from our users' browsers, which are pushed via a public gateway into our OTel pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Istio Access Log:</strong> We ingest HTTP-level traffic data from our Istio service mesh, capturing request/response patterns, latencies, and routing decisions. Combined with ClickHouse's system.query_log and kubenetmon's network flows, this creates a powerful tri-dimensional correlation capability. When network usage spikes occur, our support team can trace the complete story: which specific SQL queries were executing, what HTTP requests triggered them, and the exact packet flow patterns. This cross-layer visibility transforms debugging from guesswork into precise root cause analysis - if we see unusual egress traffic, we can immediately identify whether it's from expensive cross-region queries, backup operations, or unexpected replication, making troubleshooting incredibly efficient for the support team.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been an incredible year of growth for LogHouse. By moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and embracing specialized, highly efficient tooling, we’ve scaled our observability platform to remarkable new heights while significantly enhancing our cost performance. Integrating HyperDX is a key part of that evolution, providing a flexible and powerful user experience on top of our petabyte-scale data warehouse. We're excited to see what the next year brings as we continue to build on this strong foundation.</p>

<p>While SysEx is designed to be efficient and resource-conscious, customers occasionally notice our scrape queries in their logs and metrics. These queries are <strong>tightly constrained with strict memory limits</strong>, but when they error (as they sometimes do) it can create concern. Although the actual resource impact is minimal, we recognize that even lightweight queries can create noise or confusion in sensitive environments.</p>
<p>To address this, we’re exploring what we call <strong>zero-impact scraping</strong> - the next evolution of SysEx. The goal is to eliminate all in-cluster query execution by entirely decoupling scraping from the live system. One promising direction involves leveraging <strong><a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/storing-data#s3-plain-rewritable-storage">plain rewritable disks on S3</a></strong>, where ClickHouse already writes its service logs. In this model, a pool of SysEx workers would mount these disk-based log tables directly, bypassing the need to query the running ClickHouse instance. This design would deliver all the benefits of our current system - native format, high fidelity, minimal transformation - while removing even the perception of operational impact.</p>
<p>OpenTelemetry remains a critical component of our platform, particularly for early-stage data capture before service tables are available. This is especially useful during crash loops, where structured logs may be unavailable. However, if our zero-impact scraping approach proves successful, it could reduce our reliance on OTel even further by providing a high-fidelity, low-disruption path for log ingestion throughout the lifecycle of a cluster.</p>
<p>This effort is still in progress, and we’ll share more once we’ve validated the approach in production.</p>

<p>The JSON type has been available in ClickHouse for some time and <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-03">recently reached GA in version 25.3</a>. It offers a flexible and efficient way to store semi-structured data, dynamically creating columns with appropriate types as new fields appear. It even supports <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/a-new-powerful-json-data-type-for-clickhouse">fields with multiple types</a> and gracefully handles schema explosion.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, we’re still evaluating how well JSON fits common observability access patterns at scale. For example, querying a string across an entire JSON blob can effectively involve scanning thousands of columns. There are workarounds - such as also storing a raw string version of the JSON alongside the structured data - but we’re still developing best practices in this area.</p>
<p>Culturally, we have also come to recognize the practical limits of the Map type, which has served us well. Most of our log and resource attributes are small and stable enough that the Map continues to be the right fit. We have found that single-level JSON logs are often all you need, and for exceptions, tools like HyperDX automatically translate map access into <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/json-functions#jsonextract">JSONExtract</a> functions. While we plan to adopt JSON more broadly, this is still a work in progress. Expect us to share more in a future update.</p>

<p>Over the past year, LogHouse has evolved from an ambitious logging system into a foundational observability platform powering everything from performance analysis to real-time debugging across ClickHouse Cloud. What began as a cost-saving measure has become a catalyst for both cultural and technical transformation, shifting us toward high-fidelity, wide-event telemetry at massive scale. By combining specialized tools like SysEx with general-purpose frameworks like OpenTelemetry, and layering on flexible interfaces like HyperDX, we have built a system that not only keeps up with our growth but also unlocks entirely new workflows. The journey is far from over, but the lessons from scaling to 100PB and 500 trillion rows continue to shape how we think about observability as a core data problem we are solving at warehouse scale.</p></div><p><a href="https://clickhouse.cloud/signUp?loc=blog-cta-footer&amp;utm_source=clickhouse&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=blog">Get started</a> with ClickHouse Cloud today and receive $300 in credits.

                <h3>How can I try out Cosmoe?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is still a work in progress, and exists as a source-only technology preview for now.  To run it, clone or download the <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/">Cosmoe source code repo from Gitlab</a> and compile the code on your Linux distribution of choice.  There are several sample applications included which demonstrate what it is capable of.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What are the plans for Cosmoe going forward?</h3>
                <div><p>Cosmoe needs 2 main improvements to be a reliable, full-featured UI library:</p><p>
					<strong>Stability</strong><br>While I've made incredible strides with getting the BeOS class libraries to talk to Wayland, much work still remains to weed out crashes and incorrect behavior.  Wayland is powerful, but not friendly.</p><p>
					<strong>Compatibility</strong><br>Cosmoe implements about 95% of the BeOS API currently.  Notable feature that are not yet implemented include "offscreen" BBitmaps for accelerated drawing, and BFilePanel which implements Open and Save dialog boxes.  Some file-related classes like BVolume are only partially implemented.  Also, for security reasons, Wayland forbids certain Window-related actions such as window positioning and centering, so that functionality can never exist.</p><p>
					For more details on this items and other in-progress aspects of Cosmoe, please see the <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/-/blob/master/TODO?ref_type=heads">TODO file in the Cosmoe repo</a>.
				</p></div>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What license does Cosmoe use?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is distributed under the MIT license.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What source code comprises Cosmoe?  Where did it come from, and what inspired it?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is a fork of the Haiku operating system, which itself is an open-source re-implementation of BeOS.  The current iteration of Cosmoe is implemented as a UI library, but <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-haiku/">the previous iteration (now known as "Cosmoe Classic")</a> was a full port of Haiku to the Linux kernel.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>How is the current iteration of Cosmoe different from Cosmoe Classic?</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/">current iteration of Cosmoe</a> is a shared library which implements the BeOS class library on top of Wayland.  There are no supporting programs, e.g. app_server or registrar, needed to use it.  All the necessary functionality is rolled into the library.  Apps linked with the library run natively on Linux via Wayland.
  <br>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-haiku/">previous iteration of Cosmoe (now known as "Cosmoe Classic")</a> is a full port of the Haiku OS to the Linux kernel.  It runs inside an SDL window on Linux.  It would be possible to develop graphics drivers to allow it to run as its own standalone Linux-based OS, but those have not been developed.
<br>Moving forward, my focus is on the shared library version since I believe it has the most practical benefit.</p>

<h2>Installing and testing beta apps</h2><p>Each build is available to test for up to 90 days, starting from the day the developer uploads their build. You can see how many days you have left for testing under the app name in TestFlight. TestFlight will notify you each time a new build is available and will include instructions on what you need to test. Alternatively, with TestFlight 3 or later, you can turn on automatic updates to have the latest beta builds install automatically.</p><p>When the testing period is over, you'll no longer be able to open the beta build. To install the <span>App Store</span> version of the app, download or purchase the app from the <span>App Store</span>. In-app purchases are free only during beta testing, and any in-app purchases made during testing will not carry over to <span>App Store</span> versions.</p><p>Note: To automatically download additional in-app content and assets in the background once a beta app is installed in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 18.4, or visionOS 2.4, turn on Additional In-App Content in your App Store settings for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/manage-purchases-subscriptions-settings-iph3dfd91de/ios">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/manage-purchases-subscriptions-settings-ipadee10c6e7/ipados">iPad</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/app-store/change-app-store-preferences-mchlp2257/3.0/mac/13.0">Mac</a>, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3><p>To get started, install TestFlight on the device you’ll use for testing. Then, accept your email invitation or follow the public link invitation to install the beta app. The public link invitation will include a description of the beta app and may also include screenshots, the app category, and criteria you must meet to join the beta. You can install the beta app on up to 30 devices.</p><p>If you do not meet the tester criteria, the beta invitation will inform you that the developer requires you to test with a specific device and OS when you tap or click Learn More on the beta invitation. If you have a device that meets the critiera, you can install TestFlight on the device and then accept the beta invitation.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can accept an invitation on a non-preferred device as long as you have a device associated with TestFlight that meets the criteria set by the developer.</p><p>If you do not wish to accept an invitation, you can easily <a href="#giving-feedback">give feedback</a> to help the developer by letting them know why.</p><p><span>Note:</span> When testing your app's subscriptions in TestFlight, the renewal rate is accelerated. Each subscription is renewed daily, up to 6 times within a one-week period, regardless of the subscription's duration.</p><p><span>Note:</span> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210737"><span>Managed Apple Accounts</span></a> can't be used to test builds.</p>

"The EFS has just discovered the 48<sup>th</sup> blood group system in the world!" the agency said in a statement on the social network LinkedIn. "This discovery was officially recognised in early June in Milan by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT)."</p>              <p>The announcement was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of surgery, the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said on Friday. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems. The discovery was first reported by radio <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/l-info-de-france-inter/l-info-de-france-inter-1294478" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Nouvelle fenêtre">France Inter</a>.</p>                   <p>Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at the EFS involved in the discovery, told AFP that a "very unusual" antibody was first found in the patient in 2011. However, resources at the time did not allow for further research, he added. Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to "high-throughput DNA sequencing", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said.</p>              <p>The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman "is undoubtedly the only known case in the world," said the expert. "She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself," he said. Peyrard said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.</p>              <p>The name "Gwada negative", which refers to the patient's origins and "sounds good in all languages," has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. He and colleagues are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group. "Discovering new blood groups means offering patients with rare blood types a better level of care," the EFS said.</p>              <p>The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.</p>              <section>  <p>  <span>Le Monde</span>  </p>   </section>    <section>     <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/syndication/" title="Reuse this content" target="_blank">Reuse this content</a>   </section>   </article>   </section>                        </section>          <section id="js-capping" data-full="0" data-mini="0">  <section id="js-capping-content"> <p>Vous pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> sur un seul appareil à la fois</p>   <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.</p>    <a href="https://moncompte.lemonde.fr/" id="js-capping-yellow-button" data-cta="multi">Découvrir les offres multicomptes</a>  </section> <section id="js-capping-bottom">     <ul id="js-capping-faq"> <li> <p>Parce qu’une autre personne (ou vous) est en train de lire <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte sur un autre appareil.</p> <p>Vous ne pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> que sur <strong>un seul appareil</strong> à la fois (ordinateur, téléphone ou tablette).</p> </li> <li> <p>Comment ne plus voir ce message ?</p> <p>En cliquant sur «&nbsp;&nbsp;» et en vous assurant que vous êtes la seule personne à consulter <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte.</p> </li> <li> <p>Que se passera-t-il si vous continuez à lire ici ?</p> <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.

<p>You may not need any incentive to do this, but I’m going to argue that moving from WhatsApp to Signal is an important action, right now. There are other alternatives to WhatsApp, of course, but several have received criticism over various issues so I’m going to focus on Signal here. Please comment below if you’d like to propose ethical alternatives to WhatsApp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In March I argued that we should <a href="https://greenstarsproject.org/2025/03/30/bluesky-an-ethical-replacement-for-x-twitter/"><strong>choose Bluesky over X/Twitter</strong></a>, based on the obvious reason of boycotting companies connected to Musk. Bluesky is structured as a benefit corporation (like Patagonia) and based on an open network, two features that create strong incentives for the company to not upset its users.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This creates an alignment between Bluesky and its users – Bluesky is disincentivized to make a bad user experience. This also acts as a kind of poison pill against a billionaire takeover, or at least a deterrent against this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moving from X/Twitter to Bluesky does require some sacrifice for people who worked hard to build up a following on the former. But we’ve reached a point where support of Musk is unconscionable, whatever the sacrifice involved. The move from WhatsApp to Signal, however, is quite straightforward and completely painless. But in this case, some may be wondering, <em>why should I bother moving at all?</em></p>

<h2>Ethical issues with WhatsApp</h2>



<p>My biggest issues with using WhatsApp are related to its parent corporation, Meta (formerly Facebook) and its founder/CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But first, I want to mention a few issues specific to WhatsApp.</p>



<p>In early 2021, WhatsApp updated its terms of service, requiring users to opt into <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/whatsapps-new-terms-of-service-are-a-facebook-or-die-ultimatum/">sharing their data</a> with Facebook – including network details and location (even if you haven’t turned on location sharing). This 180° reversal on an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">earlier promise</a> made by Zuckerberg that “WhatsApp is going to operate completely autonomously” was one of several events over the last 5 years that accelerated an exodus from WhatsApp to Signal. The large amount of metadata that WhatsApp collects is also shared with law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>WhatsApp shares metadata, unencrypted records that can reveal a lot about a user’s activity, with law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice. Some rivals, such as Signal, intentionally gather much less metadata to avoid incursions on its users’ privacy, and thus share far less with law enforcement. – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">ProPublica</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have to admit that I don’t give a huge amount of time fretting over these things during normal times. But we no longer live in normal times – people are now guilty by suspicion (or by association, based on their WhatsApp contacts) and convicted without due process.</p>



<p>Over the years, Zuckerberg and Meta have done more flip flopping than a White Lotus guest (walking around in flip-flops, you see). Facebook has since been <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1369">fined</a> €110 million by EU antitrust regulators and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions">$5 billion</a> by the US Federal Trade Commission for deceiving regulators and users. Following this greater level of scrutiny, Zuckerberg has shown himself to be a person of little scruples, capitulating to whoever will do him favors.</p>



<h2>Meta and Zuckerberg</h2>



<p>Meta – a company so bad that it had to change its name to try to clean its reputation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> involved the collection of user data without consent to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographics">psychographic profiles</a> that were used in Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign and suppressing Black voters in Trinidad and Tobago. WhatsApp, in particular, played a role in the Brazil’s 2018 election.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of false information shared on WhatsApp in Brazil during the presidential election favoured the far-right winner, Jair Bolsonaro. The analysis sheds light on the spread of misinformation on the Facebook-owned app, with fears it could be poisoning political debate in one of the largest democracies in the world. – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/whatsapp-fake-news-brazil-election-favoured-jair-bolsonaro-analysis-suggests">The Guardian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Companies supporting Jair Bolsonaro are buying a service called “mass blasts,” using the candidate’s list of WhatsApp users or buying lists from agencies specializing in digital strategy. – <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/10/businessmen-fund-whatsapp-campaign-against-pt.shtml">Folha de S.Paulo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2018, Zuckerberg testified before US Congress, admitting: “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Aww! You’re totally forgiven, Zuck! You’ve learned your lesson, right?</p>



<p>But wait! Last year, as you probably know, Zuckerberg did the cowardly act of endorsing Trump by implication. I happened to catch this interview with the Zuck live on Bloomberg and was totally gagged (Hey Gen Z readers!). Take a look and marvel at Zuck sticking to his guns and maintaining his neutrality:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Zuckerberg Calls Trump 'Badass' Without Endorsing Him #politics" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bE7SyQWf4_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Post-election, Zuck flew down to Florida for dinner with Trump (I’m imagining scenes from the hunting episode of <em>Succession</em>) and then got rid of DEI and moderation and all that weak stuff. It didn’t take long for Zuck to switch from humility (<em>It was my mistake, and I’m sorry</em>) to going on the Joe Rogan show to say this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Masculine energy is good, and obviously, society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was really trying to get away from it,” Zuckerberg continued. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive.” – <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-masculine-feminine-energy">Mashable</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Ethical review of Signal</h2>



<p>Signal provides a very similar user experience to WhatsApp, so switching over is pretty seamless. This is not too surprising, considering that the current CEO of Signal LLC., Brian Action, was one of the cofounders of WhatsApp. WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and Acton <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/whatsapp-co-founder-acton-named-signals-interim-ceo-2022-01-10/">left the company</a> three years later due to differences around the use of customer data and targeted advertising.</p>



<p>A year later, Acton contributed $50 million to launch a non-profit, the Signal Foundation and a subsidiary, Signal Messenger, LLC.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On 21 February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is “to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous”. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#History">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/secure-messaging-scorecard">ranked messaging apps</a> for privacy and transparency, Signal was one of the few that received a perfect score. The nonprofit also has an <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal">updated guide</a> to using Signal, navigating its settings, etc.</p>



<p>The protection of data and personal privacy is important. The nonprofit Signal Foundation is led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a>, a former director of the AI Now Institute at NYU, which examined the social impacts of AI and concentration of power in tech. She is a strong proponent of protecting privacy as a human right and an opponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. Signal’s predecessor, Open Whisper Systems <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/tor-signal-funding-donald-trump-steve-bannon-encryption/">received funding from</a> journalism nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>



<p>Signal has been recommended to Democratic Party staffers and officially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#History">approved</a> by the US Senate in 2017. Just not for texting top secret plans, obviously!</p>

<h3>Action plan for migrating from WhatsApp</h3>



<p>It’s easy to see how we all get drawn into using specific apps like WhatsApp – the user base reaches a critical size and it becomes the app to find everyone on. At the same time, the company becomes more lucrative (and in many cases is taken over by a bigger fish) and then ethical issues creep in. We learn to suppress our concerns because the app is just too convenient and, to quote The Cranberries, <em>Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We? </em>(R.I.P., Dolores).</p>



<p>The exit plan from WhatsApp is quite simple. Start by installing Signal and setting it up – it takes only a couple of minutes. Then, resume any WhatsApp conversations on Signal if that person is already a Signal user. If they are not, then switch to regular text messaging and gently suggest to that person to switch over to Signal. [Shout out to CeCe for reminding me to install Signal!] Group chats are a good way to get people to switch over as nobody will want to be the person who can’t be bothered making the switch.</p>



<p>The interference with elections is not OK.</p>



<p>I’ll leave the last word to future president, AOC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta as in ‘we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!'” – <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/facebook-to-meta-a-new-name-but-the-same-old-problems/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a></p>

            <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 03:06:42 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/">https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44334167">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
<p>In recent months, we have received numerous reports from users across West Asia and North Africa (WANA) expressing alarm over a little-known but deeply intrusive bloatware application—AppCloud—pre-installed on Samsung’s A and M series smartphones. Without users’ knowledge or consent, this bloatware collects sensitive personal data, cannot be removed without compromising device security, and offers no clear information about its privacy practices.</p>



<p>AppCloud, developed by the controversial Israeli-founded company ironSource (now owned by the American company <a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2022/Unity-Announces-Merger-Agreement-with-ironSource/default.aspx">Unity</a>), is embedded into devices sold in countries where such affiliations carry legal implications. Despite the serious privacy and security risks, Samsung has offered no transparency on how AppCloud functions, what data it collects, or why users cannot opt out.</p>



<p>This open letter, addressed to Samsung, calls for immediate transparency, accountability, and dialogue. Users deserve to know what is installed on their devices and how their data is being used, especially amid Israel’s espionage campaigns in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>_________</p>



<p>To Whom it May Concern,&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are writing to urgently request that Samsung be transparent regarding the pre-installation of AppCloud on its A and M series smartphones, particularly in West Asia and North Africa (WANA). We ask that Samsung provide information about AppCloud’s privacy practices, opt-out and removal options, and that Samsung reconsider future pre-installations in light of privacy rights. We also request a meeting with Samsung teams to discuss these concerns further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the expansion of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/ironsource-expands-samsung-partnership-launching-on-samsung-mobile-devices-in-mena">partnership</a> with ironSource in 2022, AppCloud has been embedded by default on <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">new A and M devices distributed in this region</a>.</p>



<p>According to our <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">analysis</a>, this intrusive software is <strong>unremovable</strong>, deeply integrated into the devices’ operating system, making it nearly impossible for regular users to uninstall it without root access, which voids warranties and poses security risks. Even disabling the bloatware is not effective as it can reappear after system updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The privacy policy is <strong>opaque, </strong>there is no accessible and transparent privacy policy for this bloatware and users are in the dark about what data is collected and how it is used. There is also no straightforward opt-out mechanism. The bloatware collects sensitive user data, including biometric information, IP addresses, device fingerprints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The installation of AppCloud is done <strong>without any consent </strong>from the user, which violates GDPR provisions in the EU and relevant data protection laws in the WANA region states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AppCloud is developed by ironSource, <strong>an Israel-founded company (now acquired by American company Unity),</strong> raising additional legal and ethical concerns in countries where Israeli companies are barred from operating, such as <a href="https://www.lexismiddleeast.com/law/Lebanon/Law_1_1955">Lebanon</a>. ironSource is notorious for its questionable practices regarding user consent and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samsung’s terms of service mention third party applications but do not specifically address AppCloud or ironSource, despite the significant data access and control granted to this bloatware app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The forced installation of AppCloud <strong>undermines the privacy and security rights of users in the MENA region and beyond.</strong> The lack of transparency and control over personal data is particularly alarming given<a href="https://telecomlead.com/smart-phone/smartphone-strategies-in-middle-east-for-market-share-119061"> Samsung’s <strong>significant market share in the region</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, we respectfully request that Samsung:</p>



<ul>
<li>Disclose the full privacy policy and data handling practices of AppCloud, making this information easily accessible to all users.</li>



<li>Offer a straightforward and effective method for users to opt out of AppCloud and remove it from their devices without compromising device functionality or warranty.</li>



<li>Provide a clear explanation for the decision to pre-install AppCloud on all A and M series devices in the WANA region.</li>



<li>Reconsider the continued pre-installation of AppCloud on future devices, in line with the right to privacy as established by Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</li>



<li>We also request a <strong>meeting with the relevant Samsung teams</strong> to discuss these issues in detail and to better understand the company’s approach to user privacy and data protection in the WANA region.</li>
</ul>



<p>We look forward to your prompt response and to working together to ensure the privacy and security of all Samsung users.</p>

<h2>RJ45 Angle Adapters</h2>
<p>I mostly use laptops to do various tasks and cables sticking out on the sides perpendicularly does not help. Not many laptops today have the RJ45 LAN socket – but if they do – they are mostly on the side of the laptop.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6246" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/rj45-angle-adapter/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg" data-orig-size="740,460" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rj45-angle-adapter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=740" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=625&amp;h=389 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=150&amp;h=93 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=186 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rj45-angle-adapter.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>Thanks to such angle RJ45 adapters it is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> page – with the <b>RJ45 ANGLE ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>RJ45 Angle Cable Adapters</h2>
<p>The mentioned earlier <i>RJ45 Angle Adapters</i> are quite bulky – but as an alternative its possible to get a short 40cm cable with smaller plug.</p>
<p>Not sure if its noticeable on the picture below – but I also cut the top ‘cover’ with knife of the plug – so its easier to detach.</p>

<p>With these simple ‘join’ adapters it is no longer a problem. You would not use them in a serious Data Center with 10+ GE speeds – but for home 1.0-2.5 GE speeds its more then enough.</p>

<p>I usually boot from some USB drive with FreeBSD and while new SSD is attached with these adapters – I then execute <tt><b>dd(8)</b></tt> command to clone the old HDD disk to new SSD drive … and then just swap them out.</p>

<p>While I usually omit Bluetooth I can not say the same about WiFi … and as FreeBSD lacks a little in that department – using a very tiny chip such as <a href="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/10/30/realtek-usb-wifi-review/">Realtek RTL8188CUS</a> often does the job done.</p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Micro USB Adapter</h2>
<p>In the past – in the USB Micro times – I remember using an adapter to be able to charge – then new and uncommon – USB-C devices.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years and now the situation is the other way around (as expected). The USB-C is the standard and USB Micro devices are less and less common … but there are still here. To not have to keep separate dedicated USB Micro cables I use a small USB-C to USB Micro adapters.</p>

<p>Such adapter takes USB-C as input power and is able to charge USB Micro devices.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>USB-C USB MICRO ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Laptops/Routers/5.5mmx2.5mm Adapters</h2>
<p>When it comes to delivering power to my (and not only) laptops – the new standard seems to be the USB-C connector with ‘requirement’ of 45W or more (it depends).</p>
<p>Not that long ago I discovered that even laptops as old as 13 years – <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s/W520</strong> – can be powered the same – but with simple and very cheap adapter cables – such as these below. From the left there is <strong>5.5mm/2.5mm</strong> typical router socket – then more modern <strong>ThinkPad X270/T470s</strong> (and many more) – then oldschool models from 2011 year – <strong>ThinkPads</strong> such as <strong>X220/T420s/W520</strong> models.</p>

<p>You need to only meet two requirements – the USB charger that will make enough power for example 20V at 3.25A for 65W that would power <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s</strong> or 20V at 6.75A for 135W that would power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong>. While the official power supply for ThinkPad W520 is 170W – its perfectly fine to use the 135W power adapter from <strong>ThinkPad W510</strong> to power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong> laptop.</p>
<p>This makes organizing cables (and chargers) a lot easier – for example – I would not be able to fit 3 ‘dedicated’ ThinkPad chargers in that white cable organizer behind laptops – but I will fir there two powerful 65W and 85W USB-C chargers perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>Creative BT-W2 USB-A Bluetooth Adapter</h2>
<p>When I have to cope with Bluetooth technology – its ‘tolerable’ on Android devices such as phones/tablets and mostly nowhere else. After bad audio (just not working) Bluetooth possibilities on FreeBSD I decided to try the hardware solution instead. The audio related Bluetooth on FreeBSD have failed me too many times – to the point called <i>enough is enough</i> – that also means I do not want to waste any more time trying to figure the way using FreeBSD Bluetooth stack devices anymore – at least for audio related devices.</p>
<p>Not so long ago I got the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones. I am/was a big fan of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones (Jack or Mini Jack based). They have so much BASS and ‘power’ that I could not ask for more … and their cost is very low – like <b>$24</b> or less. The only ‘downside’ of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> headphones is that they are audio only – they do not have any microphone at all – they are dedicated for music only – and that is OK – they do GREAT in that role.</p>
<p>I have tried some Bluetooth based headphones in the past – and they were SHIT to say the least. Not enough ‘power’ – not enough BASS etc. After reading multiple reviews I decided to give <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones a chance … and I was not disappointed. Its the first time after <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones that ANY Bluetooth based headphone delivered. I was (and I still am) really satisfied with them.</p>
<p>This is where the USB powered <i>Creative BT-W2</i> comes handy. Its also relatively cheap as the cost of used unit is less then <b>$20</b> – at least that is the price I payed for mine in Poland. The <i>Creative BT-W2</i> allows to connect Bluetooth audio devices everywhere – even on OpenBSD – on the system that cut off Bluetooth stack entirely – and it works well on FreeBSD too. The ‘downside’ of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones is that they do have microphone – but only in Bluetooth node – they have Mini Jack connector – but for audio only …</p>

<p>This is also only downside of the <i>Creative BT-W2</i> solution – it transmits only audio – but w/o microphone. Its more then OK for listening music – but if You have to do live conferencing/meetings on FreeBSD as I do – its a dead end.</p>
<p>I have tried to find a solution to this problem – to the point that I wanted to abandon <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones entirely and find some Mini Jack (or Jack) based BASS oriented headphones that will also have a working microphone.</p>
<p>On my journey I have found a solution that I did not expected at all – and that was the solution that solved all my problems – and allowed me to enjoy the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – but more about that in the next ‘subsection’.</p>

<h2>External Microphone for SONY Headphones</h2>
<p>You already know the downsides of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones that were giving me headaches. Now its time to address them.</p>
<p>After many hours of searching the Internet I have found a very ‘usable’ Mini Jack cable. A cable that came with microphone and a one that perfectly integrated with <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones … and FreeBSD as well.</p>
<p>Its available to buy for <b>$22</b> on <a>amazon.de</a> (and possible other locations) and its called <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b>. Thanks to the knowledge that <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones have Mini Jack port with microphone part – the <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> cable even comes with volume controls and even come with physical kill switch for microphone.</p>

<p>After You attach this <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> to the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones it looks (and works) like a natural solution.</p>

<p>The only ‘downside’ is generally the downside of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – that You CAN NOT disable their silencing while you speak – so using them in ‘passive’ mode with <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> is preferred to meet all needs.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>After reading comments to this article I learned that this ‘silencing’ is called <em>Speak to Chat</em> and it can be disabled in the SONY Android app or by holding <span>two fingers</span> on the <span>right earcup</span> until the headphones say <em>“Speak to Chat disabled.”</em> Thank You for that.</p>

<h2>Headphones Handle</h2>
<p>I got used to the fact that I just put my headphones on the desk … but I wanted something more useful – after some searching it was obvious to me that I needed just some headphones handle that I could attach somewhere.</p>
<p>After another several hours of browsing I have found a ‘part’ that would fit perfectly – a <b>$4-5</b> part from <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> that I could find with the <b>HEADPHONES HOLDER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<p>Its really handy for many transfers … and its more fast then slow as well.</p>

<h2>Tiny USB-A Hub</h2>
<p>When You need to connect several USB-A devices the USB ports count often come short fast – this is where this tiny USB-A hub comes handy.</p>

<p>With its dirt cheap <b>$1-2</b> price (at <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>USB HUB</b> keywords) its a ‘steal’ … and it is a 3 port hub – there is another USB-A port at the end of it – the one that is not visible.</p>

<p>I do not even remember how many times I have used it to copy/backup contents of my phone(s) and/or tablet(s).</p>
<p>Nowadays I believe I use the <b>Dual USB-C / USB-A Pendrive</b> more … but not always.</p>
<p>For <b>$8-9</b> on its not a bad solution to have.</p>
<p>Batteries … I mean SD card – not included 🙂</p>

<h2>Angle Power Adapters</h2>
<p>I have often found that the angle with which the power cord sticks out of a PC is definitely not ideal – this is where angle power adapters come handy.</p>

<p>After You have spent some time to lay down the C13/C14 power cables just to power your PC its really annoying to do the same for another set of C1/C2 or C5/C6 cables/sockets … but not anymore.</p>
<p>Now with single cable adapter You are able to power more then one computer – depending on the needs with additional connectors.</p>

<h2>HDMI 3in1 Switch with Remote Control</h2>

<p>For the record – I have used the <b>UGreen 3in1 HDMI Switch with 4K @ 30Hz Capability and Remote</b> and I was able to get one for <b>$16</b>.</p>

<h2>Cable Organizers</h2>
<p>To not have a mess in the cables its useful to have them organized in some way.</p>
<p>I use multiple solutions for that.</p>
<p>Lets start with simple organizers.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6280" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg" data-orig-size="740,530" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=625&amp;h=448 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=150&amp;h=107 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300&amp;h=215 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>… and a larger/taller one for more capacity/possibilities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6281" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables-larger/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg" data-orig-size="740,430" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables-larger" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=625&amp;h=363 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300&amp;h=174 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>They are available for <b>$3-9</b> on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>CABLE ORGANIZER</b> keywords on the search box.</p>
<p>I also use some IKEA containers …</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6282" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizers-containers/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg" data-orig-size="740,520" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizers-containers" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=625&amp;h=439 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>… and smaller boxes in which I keep the tiny things.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6283" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizers-boxes/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg" data-orig-size="740,510" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizers-boxes" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=625&amp;h=431 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=207 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I do not even remember after what product these boxes are … and that does not even matter I think.</p>

<h2>Mouse Jigger</h2>
<p>While there are many software settings or solutions to prevent screen from locking up – there is one bulletproof solution what just always works – a hardware USB mouse jigger.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6284" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/mouse-jigler/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg" data-orig-size="740,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mouse-jigler" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=625&amp;h=422 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=203 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I use a very simple one with 3 modes – but its more then enough for me needs.</p>
<p>Feel free to check other offers with <b>USB MOUSE JIGGER </b>at <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> search box.</p>

<h2>FM Transmitter</h2>
<p>Last but not least – the car FM transmitter.</p>
<p>My daily ‘real’ driver (I mean on the real road outside) is the <b>2006 Dodge Magnum</b> car. I really love it for the simplicity and calm that it provides during the ride – but on the audio side it only has an old FM/AM radio and a CD slot … and not MP3 support in that one.</p>
<p>This is where the FM transmitter such as mine <b>Blow</b> comes really handy.</p>

<p>It supports two modes. One is being a Bluetooth slave of your phone – it just plays on the car speakers anything you are currently playing on your phone – it also has microphone builtin – so You can also use it as a ‘loud’ phone talking device.</p>

<p>I use it in a more simple mode – I just attach a tiny <b>Lexar S47 32GB</b> pendrive to it – and play a random song of it.</p>
<p>Besides these features it also has additional USB-A port available to attach a cable to it and charge some device.</p>
<p>I was able to get one a new one for about <b>$19</b>.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The mentioned devices above are probably not the only ones that make my life easier – but definitely the most crucial ones.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your ‘helper’ hardware in the comments.</p>
